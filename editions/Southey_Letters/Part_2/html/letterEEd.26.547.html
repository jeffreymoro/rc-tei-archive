                  </div> we only know that it ended as all such expeditions have ended, &amp; will end till the
                  end of the chapter. we know nothing certain of what has been done at Vigo – except
                  that their only possible motive in going there must have been to make a Gazette, &amp;
                  varnish over the failure of the principal object. where they are now we do not know,
                  tho they are so near! Of our probable campaign I said enough in my last. things remain
                  in status quo, but these marauding schemes of the English will probably precipitate
                  Spain into a war with this country, if only to secure her own coasts by drawing our
                  attention here. A more serious danger alarms us. You must have heard of the plague
                  at Cadiz. what the disorder is we know not – it is said to be the Black Vomit which
                  some centuries since made great ravages in Europe – I recollect no disease of that
                  name in history. however it is ravaging all Andalusia. they say it is <span class="ital">epidemic</span>, not <span class="ital">contagious</span>. if so we shall escape – if not, we are in hourly &amp; imminent danger. No precautions
                  are taken. a man just arrived from Cadiz who has recovered from the disease, is daily
                  on the Exchange at Lisbon, &amp; his baggage underwent no fumigation: indeed no precautions
                  could be effectual. there is no natural frontier; – where the birds &amp; the foxes pass
                  – the smugglers also find their way. an immense contraband trade is carried on thro
                  byepasses; – had the disease been infectious I think it must ere this have arrived.
                  The Siroc blew for nine weeks at Cadiz – a place always unwholesome in summer. if
                  this was the cause – the rains will remove it; but other accounts ascribe its origin
                  to a ship from Charlestown, &amp; the importation of the Yellow Fever. so little do we
                  know of what is next door to us! If it reaches Lisbon we shall remove into the country
                  – somewhere North among the mountains.</p>

               cotton &amp;c, near the coasts or within reach of exportation, than to go mine-hunting
               among the Savages. in the one case the profit is all their own. Brasil produces spices,
               inferior indeed to what the Dutch monopolized, but still good enough, I should have

                  how to employ it. they have neither arts nor sciences to encourage. country-gentlemen
                  are things unknown. the nobleman perhaps visits the mansion – (house I should say)
                  or his estate <span class="ital">perhaps</span>, when the fruits are ripe. he squanders his income<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> in frippery &amp; dangling about the court – of course has no money for improvements,
                  &amp; distresses his tenants, who cannot improve &amp; dare not – if they could. Therefore
                  the church lands are the only well-managed estates. One of these wealthy men wanted
                  some pictures. there happened to be a foreign artist at Lisbon of some merit. he sent
                  for him, mentioned the size of the pictures he wanted, &amp; asked at what price he would
                  execute them. the Painter said 20 Moidores each. 20 Moidores! replied the Patron of
                  the Arts – I can get a Portugueze to do them for a six &amp; thirty! The wealthiest of

                  I shall shew you in England this volume &amp; its almost unbelievable absurdity. a century
                  &amp; half ago Portugal was not behind the rest of Europe – her country towns had their
                  presses, &amp; if what was done was not good, very little better was performed elsewhere.
                  There is now a man who [MS torn] a sort of contraband circulating library: but his
                  subscribers are chiefly English; – I doubt whether he has a Portugueze book, &amp; do
                  not doubt that he will soon be imprisoned. The cock &amp; – a – bull stories of superstition
                  would little interest you. yet there is one which you should know. Portugal is infested
                  with witches who delight in killing infants – they kill them <span class="ital">always</span> in the night, &amp; it is known by the children being <span class="ital">black in the face</span>. this is believed – but this cannot be superstition on the part of the mothers &amp;
                  the nurses who overlay the infants. you cannot imagine <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> how these people sleep. the driver whom we always use sleeps upon his mule as he drives
                  us – we wake him – the passers-by wake him – still he has more than once endangered
                  us, &amp; was once driving <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> into the river.

                  hour, &amp; woke with a cold that killed him. I have heard often of servants whom it is
                  impossible to awaken by any noise: they must be pulled &amp; shaken. does your servant
                  wait at the door when you make a morning visit? in five minutes he is stretched on
                  the stones &amp; snoring. a dog does not slumber more readily. it is an act of volition
                  with them. the moment they cease from animal action, they have no alternative.</p>

            <p class="indent1">There is a sort of general Hospital Board of which on my return I shall hunt out all
               particulars. but you can not easily conceive how ignorant the English here are of
               the country they live in, &amp; how difficult it is to learn any thing. I believe its
               funds are chiefly derived from legacies – however that may be, they communicate with

               Popery is a charitable religion, &amp; begging must be a good trade, where alms-giving
