            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I was on Monday last summoned to Bath in consequence of an alarming increase in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</a> illness. She had taken fresh cold, &amp; tho I found her somewhat amended by bleeding
                  still her state of health appears both to myself &amp; the Physician who attends her,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> to require a speedy removal to a better climate. I wrote immediately to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, trusting that he is safely arrived but almost I fear that this may be too late.
                  the hopes I yet entertain of her recovery are only founded upon the sudden amendment
                  which change of scene &amp; of surrounding circumstances has heretofore effected in her.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> also is very unwell. she has now good advice, &amp; air as good as this country can furnish.
               these are unpleasant subjects, &amp; I have said enough.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> tells me he has seen you, &amp; that you agree with him in thinking a house fit for the
                  purpose may be found ready built. I doubt whether you can find one with land enough
                  annexed, &amp; well situated for our purpose. it is however worth trying. Mr Martin has
                  opened a wide field for enquiry by proposing to appropriate the useless funds of charity
                  to new institutions.

                  set on foot into the application of the funds left for charitable purposes, much iniquity
                  would be brought to light, &amp; a fund would be discovered of very great value to relieve
                  the lower classes. Of late I have been making some enquiries into one charity at Bath,
                  where an estate left to support 13 poor persons has increased to the value of 100,000
                  pounds; the paupers receive little more than they ever did, &amp; the remainder of the
                  5000£ per annum, goes to nobody knows who. The minister who has their Chapel is said
                  to share 2000 annually, &amp; a rascally Lawyer picks 500 a year out of the spoils.

                           to James Losh, 28 March [1798], Letter 299. In 1792, the master of the Blue Alms Charity
                           was Rev. Dr Chapman (dates unknown), a Canon of Bristol Cathedral,The New Bath Directory,
                           for the Year, 1792 (Bath, 1792), p. 9. He possibly also acted as its minister. The

                  </div> In enquiring into this iniquity, other peculations as enormous have been pointed out
                  to me. The state of the poor requires some effectual relief, &amp; the nation would find
                  funds that would go far towards relieving them, by merely correcting such abuses as
                  these.</p>

                  when plunging into sensuality felt its own degradation &amp; the emptiness of sensual
                  enjoyment. There seemd a perpetual struggle between his soul &amp; body. I do not look
                  upon Rousseau with blind admiration, he was a miserable man &amp; I think of him with
                  feelings of regret &amp; compassion that make him the more interesting. Read his Levite
