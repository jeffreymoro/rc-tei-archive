                  which will defray the expences of the journey, the voyage, &amp; the personal expences
                  necessary to clothe us for <span style="text-decoration: line-through">a</span> twelvemonths absence. this done, my annual income remains, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">f</span> £160.
