            <p class="indent1">I parted from you at Liskeard with a heavy heart. The thought of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">on</span> seeing you upon the way was a pleasure to look on to when we took our departure from
               Bristol, but having left you we had taken leave of the last friend before our voyage.
               Falmouth was not a place to exhilirate me. We were in the room where I met poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">L.</a> on my former journey: he was the last person with whom I shook hands in England,
               as I was stepping into the boat to embark, – &amp; the first news on my return. when within
               three hours I expected to have <span style="text-decoration: line-through">seen him</span> been welcomed by him was that he was in his grave. Few persons bear about with them
               a more continual feeling of the uncertainty of life, its changes &amp; its chances – than
               I do. Well! well! – I bear with me the faith also, that tho we should never meet again
               in this world, we shall all meet in a better.</p>

                  a similar prize; in the evening there was an assembly &amp; the best dancer was a man
                  with a wooden leg. A short account of six days, – if however I were to add the Bill
                  you would find it a long one.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">We embarked at four on Thursday afternoon. As we sailed out of the harbour the ships
               there &amp; the shore seemed to swim before my sight like a vision. Light winds &amp; favourable,
               but we went before the wind, &amp; my poor inside being obliged to shift every minute
               with the centre of gravity, was soon in a state of insurrection. There is a pleasure
               in extracting matter of jest from discomfort &amp; bodily pain; – a wholesome habit when
               it extends no farther, but a deadly one if it be encouraged when the heart is sore.
               I lay in my birth, – which always <span style="text-decoration: line-through">put</span> reminded me of a coffin whenever I got into it, – &amp; when any one came near me with
               enquiries, uttered some quaint phrase or crooked pun in answer, &amp; growld in unison
               with the intestinal grumbling which might have answered for me. I was not however
               without some day dreams of delight even here, &amp; it will not be long before you will
               be introduced to the Garden which during these hours I laid out amid the snow, &amp; irrigated
               with streams of fire.</p>
            <p class="indent1">On Sunday we saw a homeward bound convoy, &amp; were chased seventy miles by the Frigate
               which was with it, – luckily in our course. Monday brought with it an adventure of
               greater alarm; about six in the morning I heard some one awaken the Captain with news
               that a cutter was bearing down upon us. She carried English colours, but did not answer
               our signals. we fired a gun, she returned it, little doubt was entertained but that
               she was French, &amp; we made ready for action. Another Packet was in company with us,
               carrying six guns, we had ten, – the cutter had fourteen, &amp; I saw the matches smoaking
               as she came near. We hailed her, she answerd in broken English, &amp; past us as if to
               attack us on the other side, or begin with the other Packet. There was a frigate in
               the distance, – we asked what ship it was, – <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp; they answered again in</span> &lt;no <span style="text-decoration: line-through">person</span> one could tell&gt; what they said in reply, but I thought they said the <span class="ital">Vendemiain</span>. It was the Endymion, &amp; the man who spoke was a Guernsey man. I <span style="text-decoration: line-through">laid</span> replaced my musquet in the chest right willingly, &amp; was particularly pleased all
               the rest of the day with having legs &amp; arms, &amp; feeling a head upon my shoulders. Presently
               the Endymion sent a boat to board us, – &lt;it was a morning of business &amp; bustle&gt; the
               sun was shining, – we were all in good spirits, &amp; you know the pleasure which it gives
               to idlers <span style="text-decoration: line-through">on bo</span> at sea when any thing is going on, out of the common routine.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We saw the Berlings on Tuesday night. On Wednesday <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> &amp; I went upon deck at five o clock, – we were off the rock, &amp; the sun seemed to rest
               upon it for a moment as he rose behind. Mafra was visible, presently we could distinguish
               the height of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a>, &amp; the Penha Convent. the wind blew fresh &amp; we &lt;were&gt; near enough the shore to see
               the silver dust of the breakers, &amp; the sea-birds <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx-xxx</span> sporting over them in flocks. A pilot boat came off to us, its great sail seemed
               to be as unmanageable as an umbrella in a storm, sometimes it was dipt half over in
               the water, &amp; it flapt all ways like a womans petticoat in a high wind. We past the
               church &amp; light-house of Nossa Senhora da Guia, the convent of S. Antonio with a few
               trees about it, &amp; the town of Cascaes. Houses were now scattered in clusters all along
               the shore; – the want of trees in the landscape was scarcely perceived, so delightful
               was the sight of land, &amp; so chearful does every thing look under a southern sun.</p>

                  by their fear of the Irish Revolutionists whom our Government wished to have banished
                  to this country. Nothing can be more groundless than this fear. but when an American
                  minister demurred as to affording these men an asylum, it is not to be wonderd that

                           This required that the prisoners give full details of the movement but without implicating
                           any individuals by name. In return they asked permission to emigrate. The United States

               had entered into a pact on 29 July 1798 with the imprisoned United Irish leaders.
               This required that the prisoners give full details of the movement but without implicating
               any individuals by name. In return they asked permission to emigrate. The United States
               refused to accept them and European war ruled out exile elsewhere. The prisoners were
               therefore sent by the British government to Fort George in Scotland on 19 March 1799
               where they remained until 1802, when they were deported to Holland and set at liberty.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
