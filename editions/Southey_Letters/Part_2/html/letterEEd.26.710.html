                  friends – who improve greatly upon acquaintance. I wish sincerely that M<sup>rs</sup> Smith were in better hands – that surgeon is trifling with her merely to swell his
                  bill. he drenches her with medicine – which cannot possibly be necessary for a blow
                  on the head. besides he is a fellow of no talents &amp; nothing but a coach to recommend
                  him.</p>

               less than the bare rent of a house elsewhere. &amp; thus save the embarrassing expence
               of furniture. &amp; the expence of living there is about half the London price. climate
               is the only objection. a winter in London is more trying &amp; that I have stood. if I
               ail in Cumberland why I must take ship from Liverpool two years sooner than business
