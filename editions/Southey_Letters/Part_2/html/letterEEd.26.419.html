               <p>I am fearful that the Post Boy will pass before I can fill the sheet – therefore it
                  will be advisable to begin at the wrong end &amp; tell you what you will be most anxious
                  to know. the inside of the house I have not yet seen but on the ground floor there
                  are three rooms, one of which is the kitchen. into this the street door opens. they
                  are boarded. there is also a back kitchen. the sitting rooms are in front (plague
                  on the builders – the back-kitchen behind. when I go over the houses I shall see how
                  improveable they are. We are not likely to get possession before Michaelmas!!!

                  </div> I mounted the Oxford Mail &amp; rode to the Globe at Newton. thence I walkd about six
                  miles crossing over to the Warminster &amp; Frome Road. the Coach for which I was too
                  late in the morning here <span class="ital">overtook</span> me. I mounted it. eat some bread &amp; cheese at an alehouse where they stopt, &amp; proceeded
                  to Warminster. here it was to dine – &amp; as I found it would not be at Salisbury <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> before six, I thought it would be too late then to reach Fordingbridge that night.
                  so I altered my plan for the campaign. left the coach at Warminster &amp; trudged away
                  for Shaftsbury. read my poem about walking in the heat &amp; learn how I felt.

                  </div> at an alehouse I got some cold meat &amp; strong beer. nothing but strong beer would suit
                  me. by seven o-clock I found myself at Shaftsbury 15 miles from Warminster – after
                  riding 20 miles &amp; walking 21. I looked about the town but did nothing there. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> it stands commandingly on an eminence – I could even distinguish Glastonbury tho more

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At 6 I rose &amp; set out on foot for Blandford, 12 miles to breakfast chiefly over the
                  downs. I met crows in abundance, two weazels, &amp; one humble bee on the way. who seemed
                  to have as little chance of finding a breakfast as myself, for the deuce a flower
                  grew on the short scant turf. the hill sides were in some places quite naked – washed
                  bare by the rains – the skeletons of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">vegetation</span> earth. I had a fine walk. &amp; the clouds canopied me with most cool comfort. after breakfast
                  I pushd on ten miles for Winborne again over downs. this was a tough pull. but still
                  the clouds shaded me – there I got pickled salmon, &amp; more strong beer. then I proceeded
                  tho somewhat faint &amp; wearily, 12 miles more to Christ Church. I entered under S<sup>t</sup> Catherines Hill, &amp; found my way over the marsh &amp; thro the fields behind our old habitation.
                  here I met a hospitable welcome. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BiddlecombeCharles">B.</a> is well &amp; in as good spirits as ever. his mother is as well as ever – his cream as
