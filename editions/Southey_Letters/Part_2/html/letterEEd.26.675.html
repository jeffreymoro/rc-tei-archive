            <p class="indent1">I have been procrastinating my letter day after day in the hope of knowing when we
               may escape from London, a place which fine spring weather is rendering intolerable.
               There are some particulars which should be ascertained before my departure – &amp; these
               are not in my own reach. I wish to know whether I am to continue doing nothing for
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a> another year – probably not. – in that case – is it necessary that I should dangle
               after him to Ireland for a couple of months. these things <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> will find out for me. my <span class="ital">hope</span> is to leave town on Tuesday in the next week. Of what is to be done thereafter it
               would be foolish to say anything – as we know nothing. only – if as I believe my unsecretaryfying
               takes place I shall wish to fix somewhere.</p>

                  have past so idly. Since my last we have had <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> in town &amp; by this time he is in Paris: he is wonderfully improved. you will rarely
                  see so fine a young man. &amp; we have had a procession – a beggarly one God knows to
