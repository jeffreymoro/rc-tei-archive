            <p class="indent1">Grosvenor I think seriously of going abroad. my complaint, so am I told by the opinion
               of many medical men is wholly a diseased sensibility – (mind you – physical sensibility
               –) disordering the functions now of the heart – now of the intestines – &amp; gradually
               debilitating me. climate is the obvious remedy. in my present state to attempt to
               undergo the confinement of legal application were actual suicide. I am anxious to
               be well – &amp; to attempt the profession. <span class="ital">much</span> in it I never shall do – sometimes my principles will stand in my way – sometimes
               the want of readiness which I felt from the first – a want which I always know in
               company, &amp; never in solitude &amp; silence. howbeit I will make the attempt – but mark
               you, if by stage writing, or any other writing, I can acquire independance, I will
               not make the sacrifice of happiness it will inevitably cost me. I love the country
               – I love study – devotedly I love it. but in legal studies it is only the subtitly
               of the mind that is exercised – however I need not philippicize – &amp; it is too late
               to veer about. in 96 I might have chosen physic &amp; succeeded in it – I caught at the
               first plank – &amp; mist the great mast in my reach. perhaps I may enable myself to swim
               by &amp; by. Grosvenor I have nothing of what the world call ambition. I never thought
               it possible that I could be a great Lawyer – I should as soon expect to be the Man
               in the Moon. my views were bounded – my hopes – to an income of 500 a year, of which
               I could lay by half to effect my escape with. <span class="ital">possibly</span> the stage may exceed this, &amp; that at an expence of time on my part allowing three
               parts of the year to other labours. I am not indolent – I loathe indolence. but indeed
               reading law is laborious indolence. it is thrashing straw. I have read &amp; read &amp; read
               – but the Devil a bit can I remember. I have given all possible attention &amp; attempted
               to command volition – no! the eye read – the lips pronounced – I understood – I re
               read it – it <span style="text-decoration: line-through">is</span> was very clear – I remembered the page – the sentence – but close the book – &amp; all
               was gone! Were I an independant man – even on less than I now possess. I should long
               since have made the blessed bonfire &amp; rejoiced that I was free &amp; contented. I need
               not tell you this is only for your own eye.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I suffer a good deal from illness. &amp; in a way hardly understandable by those in health.
               I start from sleep as if death had seizd me – I am sensible of every pulsation – &amp;
               compelld to attend to the motion of my heart, till that attention disturbs it, the
               pain in my side is I think lessened – nor do I at all think it was consumption. organic

               part expressive of respect – of a wish one day to see more of him.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But of these plans you shall know more when they are more moulded into form. in the
               meantime I must raise the supplies – &amp; for this purpose there is Thalaba. my expedition
