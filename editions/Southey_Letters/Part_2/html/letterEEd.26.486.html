                  Some lines will not scan – Men who against Kings &amp;c – is a foot short. Surely the
                  dome of the Invalides – a foot too long, &amp;, We poor Jews when it went, in the same
                  fault. I have scannd these lines so often as to be satisfied the error is not in my
                  toning. In Hexameters of a loftier tone I should object to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">such</span> the placing a verb like “batter” at the end of one line &amp; the “down” at the beginning
                  of the next – as it is almost splitting a word: but in this place the effect is rather
                  good than otherwise. I think you estimate rightly the powers of this metre. perhaps
                  no other is so well adapted for the sort of domestic poetry, if the term be understandable,
                  in which I believe Voss has written his Luise.

                  that their perceptible harmony is obtained by no forced accent or unnatural construction
                  of language. they would very soon become as easy to me &amp; as wieldable as blank verse.
                  &amp; when Thalaba is finished I shall certainly give them the trial of a long and important
                  poem. Whether Mohammed be a hero likely to blast a poem in a Christian country is
