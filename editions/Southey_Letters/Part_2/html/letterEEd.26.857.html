               for Writing’, lines 46-55 and Note, attacked Southey’s <em>Joan of Arc</em> (1796) and (1798). The penultimate poem, ‘The Fisherman’s Wife’, could be read as
               a parody of Wordsworth and lines 115-119 had a Note, ‘The simplicity of that most
               simple of all poets, Mr Wordsworth himself, is scarcely more simple than the language
               of this stanza. Absit invidia dicto [let ill will be absent from these words].’ Southey
               contributed a coruscating review of Bayley’s book to the <em>Annual Review for 1803</em>, 2 (1804), 546-552.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
