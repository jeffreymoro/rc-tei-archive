               <p>I need not say that your last letter gave me great pain, but it was less than what
                  I apprehended from your long silence &amp; your mourning wafer.

                           Susanna Frances Livius (1767-1830), recovered from the birth. In addition, May was

                  </div> the black wafer had made me so fully believe the worst, that the intelligence of your
                  other losses, heavy as they are, came like a light evil. I hope however you will yet

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You say you shall think as badly of mankind as I do. I am heartily grieved that the
                  opinion should be purchased so heavily. I would rather you thought as well of men
                  in their <span class="ital">posse</span> than as badly in their <span class="ital">esse</span>,

                  </div> in their actual state. a system of emulation, of struggling &amp; scrambling necessarily
                  makes them bad. Some years &amp; some observation have modified many of my opinions, but
                  every thing that I have observed in the history of man &amp; in the nature of the mind
                  of man, has tended to confirm &amp; establish the belief that the inequalities of property
                  are <span class="ital">now</span> the cause of moral evil &amp; human misery. I say <span class="ital">now</span>, for they were necessary parts of the process. I conceive this to be the doctrine
                  of Christ, when he so explicitly forbids the existence of power or riches among his
                  disciples. at present, the institutions of society are perpetually counteracting the
                  precepts of religion, for selfishness &amp; acquisition make the basis of the commercial
                  system. the Mosaic dispensation approaches Xtianity in this political system, as it
                  does in every thing else, by its year of jubilee, &amp; agrarian division.

                           Numbers 26: 53-56 and 33: 54 told how the land of Israel was divided by lot among

               <p>To teach such a system which would best secure the happiness &amp; virtue of man appears
                  to me a worthy part of revelation. &amp; without such a system revelation can do comparatively
                  little. the quantum of wickedness in London is probably not less than that of Rome

                  system, beginning with that system &amp; increasing with it. The first Xtians understood
                  the gospel as I understand it, &amp; half a score sects have grown out of parts of it.
