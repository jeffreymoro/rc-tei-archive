                  wind continued till yesterday &amp; has plagued us cruelly by day &amp; night. At Evora we

                  we had a curious party there of his friends drinking wine with us in the room or rather
                  between the four walls where we were pounded – not housed for the night. a deputy

                  day across the field of Ourique &amp; seven long leagues of wilderness to Martimlongo.
                  there was no estalagem. in fact we were in the wilds of Alentejo where hardly ever
                  traveller had penetrated. we were again thrown on charity &amp; again kindly received.
                  this was Tuesday. on Wednesday we crossed the mountains to Tavira – seven leagues
                  – in the Bishops language long leagues – terrible leagues – infinite leagues. the
                  road would be utterly impassable were it not that the host is carried on horseback
                  in these wilds, &amp; therefore the way must be kept open. as we passed one ugly spot
                  the guide told us a man broke his neck here lately. this days journey however was
                  quite new – wherever we looked was mountain – waving – swelling – breasting – exactly
                  like the sea-like prints of the Holy Land which you see in old travels. at last the
                  Sea appeared – &amp; the Guadiana – &amp; the frontier towns Ayamonte &amp; Castro Marim. we descended
                  &amp; entered the Garden – the Paradise of Algarve – there our troubles &amp; labour were
                  to end. we were out of the wilderness – milk &amp; honey indeed we did not expect in the
                  Land of Promise – but we expected every thing else. the sound of a drum alarmed us
                  &amp; we found Tavira full of soldiers. the Governor examined our pass – &amp; I could but
