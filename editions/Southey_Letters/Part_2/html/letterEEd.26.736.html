               <p>Last night arrived a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> of which what follows is an extract. “I have just written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a> respecting the application of the fine (the long disputed business with Downes

                           been in dispute with Herbert Hill over the lease of a property either owned by Hill

                  or whatever it may be to be remitted to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">J. May</a>. I have taken this liberty with him, as you may tell him, because there is a communication
                  open to him &amp; me by means of his Uncle

                           (2)

                  </div> here, because he is in habits of correspondence with you, &amp; because I know, should
                  I stand in need of having any thing from London, or any business there, he will execute
                  it for me. 200£ will be due from Downes, which you must contrive to get remitted there
                  likewise at Xmas. As soon as he receives the remittance I could wish he would inform
                  me.”</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">As this has led me upon matters of business – let me say something of myself. When
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a> made me his secretary I hoped soon to have discharged my debt to you: how that became
               impossible ought to be explained. the salary was 400, &amp; the first quarter being paid
               in Ireland &lt;was&gt; one tenth less. from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a> – a ten days residence there – a journey back to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> &amp; thence to London, intrenched far upon the first quarter. I was nearly eight months
               in London where the whole expences of living are about 40 per cent above what they
               are here. the bills which I have paid on my mother &amp; cousins account are from 90 to
               100£. another years salary that had had no such draw back as this last would have
               set me upright – lasting so short a time as it did it just enabled me to meet that
               expence &amp; the others which it occasioned – &amp; left me no richer than it found me. My
               household expences are now increased by having my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> with me, who has been with me three months &amp; is likely to remain till the Admiralty
               chuse to employ him. five weeks ago I thought of all this as difficulties easily surmountable
               – for then I could calculate upon the labour of every day &amp; its produce sooner or
               later. now these unlucky eyes condemn me to an unprofitable &amp; uncomfortable indolence.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have said this to justify myself, &amp; because there are times when the thought of
               this had been painful. my ways &amp; means are sufficient – but not more &lt;than&gt; so, &amp;
               not without exertion.</p>
