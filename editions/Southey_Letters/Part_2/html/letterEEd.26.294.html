                  to go to sea. &amp; yet I think if his illness had been any ways alarming he would have
                  asked leave of absence from the Factory. I pray you let me have the earliest intelligence
                  you get from Lisbon respecting him. the Letter you sent me related entirely to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Tom</a>, whom he wishes to get on the Lisbon station, where he can assist him probably by

                           But Lord Proby was not Wynn’s cousin, because he was the son of Carysfort’s first

                  situation is sadly altered from what it was when he read these books. – these are
                  painful thoughts. but what retrospect is not painful? I fear life is like a journey
                  – we are never satisfied till we arrive at the end of it. we must always be looking
                  on. &amp; surely this proves a hereafter, or we might sleep away existence like a beast.</p>
