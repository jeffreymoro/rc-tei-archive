                  fill a letter. we are both perpetually busy in unvarying employments. the knowledge
                  of this makes me an unfrequent correspondent – to write is only to spin out into a
                  sheetfull information not more than the answer to a How d’ye do <span style="text-decoration: line-through">?</span> – question. You ask me my opinion of peace. nothing but a series of defeats or a change
                  of ministers can give it to us. the answer to Bonapartes offers is the most clumsy
                  piece of insolence &amp; inconceivable stupidity that ever disgraced an obstinate minister.
