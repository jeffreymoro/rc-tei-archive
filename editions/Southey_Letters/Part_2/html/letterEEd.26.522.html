               <p>Here then we are, thank God. we sailed on Thursday evening the 24<sup>th</sup> at five. our weather all the way was delightful – light winds &amp; favourable – but we
                  bent before the wind. which was rough work in the way – &amp; as my bowels were obliged
                  to shift every moment with the centre of gravity. it did not at all agree with them.
                  We were both miserably sick – I indeed far worse than in my former voyages, &amp; that
                  all the way almost. On Sunday we saw a homeward bound convoy &amp; were chased seventy
                  miles by a Frigate with them – luckily it was in our course. Monday brought with it
                  an adventure. at six I heard the Captain

                  returned it, still hoisting English colours. little doubt was entertained of her being
                  French &amp; we more ready for action. I surrounded <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> with mattresses in the cabin by the Captains advice – she however would go down into
                  the Cockpit. there I escaped from her &amp; took my station with a musquet on the quarter-deck.
                  We were all ready. Another Packet was in company with us carrying six guns

                  </div> – our force was ten, &amp; our efficient Passengers from the Cutter came down between
                  us – Zounds I saw the smoke from her ready matches, we hailed her – she answered in
                  broken English – unintelligibly – &amp; we expected the broadside. her force was fourteen
                  guns. Even when she past us we only supposed it a manoeuvre to get round the other
                  packet, &amp; every moment looked to see French colours hoisted. she was however a Guernsey
                  cutter. So I lost all chance of ever being gazetted. I laid my musquet in the chest
                  right willingly &amp; was particularly pleased with having legs arms &amp; a head all the
                  rest of the day. Soon after the Endymion boarded us. it was a busy morning, &amp; the
                  bustle kept me well for half the day. Tuesday night we made the Berlings. At sun rise
                  Wednesday I rose &amp; saw the Sun resting upon the rock. we ran close along shore – took
                  a pilot out of one of those queer boats, whose sail tosses like a womans petticoats
                  in a high wind – &amp; at ten anchored in the Tagus after an uncommonly short &amp; fine passage. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a> was on the water &amp; on board immediately. the Commissary came with him &amp; by his assistance
                  we passed thro the Fort, where all strangers are now strictly examined &amp; must be vouched
                  for by some settler. this is owing to the fears entertained of the Wild Irishmen whom

               of Almeida on the opposite isthmus, &amp; its ruined castle – still farther where the
               river widens, the shore of Alentejo – the distant height of Cezimbre &amp; its castle.
               about fifteen miles, the cross road – &amp; the boundary formed by the Arrabida mountain.
               the Tagus so superb a river! so busy &amp; alive with its thousand-shaped boats – &amp; yet
               so broad as never to be crowded – lying smooth under this sunny heaven, like the blue
               of burnished armour in the sun, seen where it does not dazzle – &amp; now spotted with
               purple islands by a few thin clouds. views like exist only in climates like these
               – they have a mellowness, a richness, a soft &amp; voluptuous luxuriance &lt;of&gt; which no
               English landscape can help you to form an adequate idea – &amp; the strong light &amp; shade
               varies the scene as the sun moves, now hiding &amp; now bringing forth crags &amp; vineyards
               &amp; churches &amp; habitations.</p>

               it the only three mornings we have been here, &amp; certainly I shall persevere. you would
               wonder at the extent already of my memorandums. I wish you to keep my letters &amp; with
               that idea will regularly send you all that I pick up, that if my own papers should
               by any accident be lost, their place may in some measure be thus supplied. you shall
               therefore receive larger paper to lessen postage, &amp; will always have one upon the
               stocks – not by every packet the expence of postage is considerable, &amp; I may sometimes
               wait the passage of an acquaintance to convey one free.</p>

               <p>Filthy as Lisbon is no infectious disorders are known here – the streets are narrow
                  &amp; the houses high – the people dirty &amp; scantily fed upon poor food – chiefly salt
                  fish – a diet miserably bad &amp; indigestible – yet with all these disadvantages they
                  are as healthy as the inhabitants of any city in the world. An American in a book

                  </div> attributes the exemption from infectious diseases which Lisbon appears to possess,
                  to the number of lime kilns in its vicinity. Lime assuredly is very useful in this
                  way, but the cause is utterly inadequate – it might indeed do were every &lt;other&gt; house
                  a kiln. the more obvious cause is to be found in the strong winds that regularly blow
                  every evening during the hot weather, sweeping down all the windings of the narrowest
                  streets, &amp; rolling the current down every avenue. They had an infected ship here not
