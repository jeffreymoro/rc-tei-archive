            <p class="indent1">That I should run thro London without seeing you is unpleasant to me; &amp; will seem
               strange to you. but will you not allow their due weight to <span class="ital">unavoidables</span>? there were two impediments to prevent me – Time &amp; Space. these Grosvenor I could
               not over come.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It was more than middle day yesterday before I had cleansed myself from my night journey,
               breakfasted – &amp; was ready to go out. I had then business which could not be delayed
               – nor was it over till too late an hour to get to Westminster. I had promised to write
               home by Saturdays mail &amp; that was a business that could not be omitted. this morning
               – <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a> is far away – &amp; I am very weary &amp; am to pass this night in the mail coach. Term can
               be kept to day – as eating is doing no manner of work. I called at Lincolns Inn this
               morning unsuccessfully. yesterday I could not.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Write to me Grosvenor. I shall be at Bath. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> leaves her present house at Midsummer &amp; has not yet found another. my presence is
               indispensable. I send the inclosed as written for the post – &amp; your own. God bless
               you. I am anxious to hear how you proceed.</p>
