                  I should ever feel it, my object is profit &amp; not distinction. but in common law I

               better to go abroad for twelvemonths – than still to expect strength in England. the
               journey will be as useful as the climate from the perpetual excitement of novelty.
               I should certainly prefer going to France – but in this there would be difficulty
