            <p class="indent1">Since my last I have endured a perpetual state of uneasiness on account of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> health. you know we purposed visiting Devonshire. for some time previous to our departure
               she had been exceedingly unwell, – it was thought the journey would benefit her &amp;
               we set out in much hope, fortified with advice &amp; a stock of medecines. We got to Minehead,
               where I intended to pass a fortnight. during the whole of that period she was so exceedingly
               ill as to make me think it expedient to return. she however slowly amended. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridge</a> came to her &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> returned with her, a distance of but a few miles, if she amended we could proceed
               from thence – if not we should be nearer Bristol. I went westwards, for much confinement
               &amp; little sleep had brought back my old evil symptoms with greater violence than ever.
               on my return I find her still slowly amending.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In these circumstances &amp; under this state of mind you will see how impossible it is
               that I should have done anything. I only played with the pen I took up – &amp; if a book
               was open before me read the words &amp; scarcely affixed to them any meaning.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My walk has not perceptibly benefited me – it was from Minehead down the North coast
                  of Somersetshire to Ilfracombe &amp; round by Barnstable Tiverton &amp; Taunton.

                  </div> Lymouth a little village on the coast is the most interesting place I have yet seen
                  in this country. the roads to it on all sides are unpassable by a carriage &amp; it is
                  of course little known. imagine two mountain streams each running down a dell among
                  crags like a long waterfall – the one dell richly wooded, the other winding among
                  bare &amp; stony hills. a fine eminence rises between these dells &amp; where the two streams
                  meet Lymouth stands – they flow into the channel immediately at their junction &amp; of
                  course the roar of the sea forms one sound<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> with the dashing of the rivers. even without the sea this place would be one of the
                  most interesting I ever saw. ascending half a mile from hence up a road serpentinely
                  perpendicular almost you turn into the Valley of Stones – a miraculous place. the
                  range of hills here next the sea are completely stripped of their soil &amp; only the
                  bones of the earth left – stone upon stone. Its origin I could not conjecture. water
                  if it had overwhelmed it must have inundated all the lower lands in the country, for
                  these are very high – &amp; yet the hills on the other side the Valley – not an arrows
                  flight distant are cloathed with herbage. a water spout perhaps – but I am no naturalist
                  to my shame, &amp; so endeavoured to find out a poetic origin for it. was it the work
                  of our aboriginal giants? no – for Goemagog one of the hugest was not so big but Corineus
                  could carry him – ergo no Giants could have been large-limbd enough.

               of precipice. you can hardly imagine the feeling it gave me to close my eyes a minute
