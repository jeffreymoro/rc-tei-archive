                  &amp; the bigotry &amp; interested hopes of his cousin condemned, but saved by the Queens

                  Mary &amp; the Confessor. 2. the danger he incurs by his attentions to the accused Gilbert.
                  3 Gilberts death. 4. Walters arrest – 5 the death of the Queen.</p>

            <p class="indent1">In Mary &amp; her Confessor I design Catholics of the most enlarged minds. sincere, but
               tolerating, &amp; earnest to save Walter. even to hastening his marriage, that the union
               with a woman of such known sentiments might divert suspicion. Gilbert is a sincere
               – but bigotted man: one of the old reformers ready to suffer death for his opinions,
               or to inflict it. Stephen so violent in his hate of heresy, as half to be ignorant
               of his own interested motives in seeking Walters death. but it is from delineating
               the progress of Walters mind that I expect success.</p>
            <p class="indent1">At first he is restless &amp; unhappy, dreading the sacrifices which his principles require.
               the danger of his friend &amp; his death excite an increasing enthusiasm. the kindness
               of the Priest &amp; Marys love overcome him – he consents to temporize – &amp; is arrested.
               then he settles into the suffering &amp; steady courage of a Xtian. to this I feel equal
               &amp; long to be about it. I expect a good effect from the evening hymn to be sung by
               Mary. &amp; from the death of Gilbert. from the great window Mary &amp; the Confessor see
               the procession to the stake &amp; hear the Te Deum. they turn away when the fire is kindled
               &amp; kneel together to pray for his soul. the light of the fire appears thro the window
               – &amp; Walter is describing as performing the last offices of kindness to is martyred
               friend.</p>

               <p>You will perceive that such a story can only excite good feelings. its main tendency
                  will be to occasion charity towards each others opinions. the story has the advantage
                  of novelty. the only martyrdom plays I know are mixed with much nonsense. the best
