                  – in the comprehensive scale – I do affirm it – &amp; that with no mental reservation
                  – not from any vanity, any justifiable pride in the possession – how did I come by
                  him. take your Map of Portugal – look for Cape S<sup>t</sup> Vincents – then let the eye travel<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> diagonally inland. some seven leagues distant in that direction – &amp; the league is
                  four English miles – tho sometimes it may be eight – but these leagues are to be computed
                  at four – do you not see a ridge of mountains? the Serra de Monchique? there I have
                  been – &amp; your finger is now within half an inch of a town about a league below the
                  very cacumen of the sierra – it is the town of Monchique – you have it – &amp; that is
                  his name. It is a pity Grosvenor that your eye could not actually &amp; occularly be in
                  that spot – &amp; that you did not ascend upon a jack ass with me to the Foye, &amp; look
                  around you – &amp; behold a prospect where the eye was bounded only by its own weakness.
                  There Grosvenor was he born. &amp; it is a very Paradise – woods – waters – all that is
                  soothing – all that is magnificent. there is a rain-manufactory upon the summit –
                  &amp; I had a sample of the raw materials. but so it was – I was deadly hungry. how should
                  it be otherwise? we had had much to do &amp; little to eat – &amp; I had not then caught the
                  Tortoise – who is coming to England with me – so that we had nothing in store in case
                  of famine – &amp; at Monchique there were fowls. we did not steal them Grosvenor – they
                  were bought &amp; picked, &amp; spitted upon the small cane – spits Grosvenor are little in
                  use where roasting is unknown.</p>

               <p>But the sight of the meat – for tho fish flesh &amp; fowl are three distinct denominations,

                  that sight – the recollected hunger affects my appetite. there sate Bento

                  the first fruits, tantalized the mouth by its imperfect enjoyment. He also smelt it,
                  &amp; he came, perhaps led by curiosity – for a roast fowl was a thing unheard of in the
                  town – perhaps led by the nose. not in the dancing bear way, but by the silken threads
                  which Nature has given Instinct to rein us.</p>

               it may be doubted whether to have given him <span style="text-decoration: line-through">food</span> &lt;meat&gt; on a fast day had been allowable – this was not a fast day – it was <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Tuesday</span> Monday April 20. &amp; I had reason for imagining that he was no Catholic, tho born &amp;
               bred among Papists. indeed the fact<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> is that the Priests had never attempted to instruct him, he had too much sense to
               be imposed upon – &amp; this they knew. We were feasting &amp; there he stood – in a posture
               of attentive supplication – all upon the watch – ears – eyes – (beautiful eyes –)
               nose – lips –, from one end to the other, &amp; there was the shape of one end</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">[Southey inserts a large C]</p>
            <p>from which figure it is apparent that tho a point be the fit ending for an epigram
               it is not for all other things. We gave him – no matter what. it was enough – it what
               became us to bestow &amp; him to receive. there was no stipulation, it was on our part
               a free gift – not a price. no return was expected – indeed none was deserved. but
               he went home &amp; his dreams were of the fowl, &amp; what a happiness it were to live with
               an Englishman. &amp; the next morning he arose, &amp; forsook all &amp; followed us.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I immediately saw that he was – but there was no one to whom I could communicate the
               discovery till I had reached Lisbon, &amp; that was a laborious journey of nine &lt;days&gt;
               going by Lagos, &amp; Sagres &amp; the Cape. yet it occurred to me often with emotions of
               solitary triumph, &amp; if my pleasure was increased by looking on to your consequent
               mortification, impute it to the constitution of our nature, not to the selfishness
               of the individual. what one gains another must lose. certainly I am proud that he
               is – for certainly he is – indeed, he is. &amp; on my return to Lisbon I asked <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> if he was not – &amp; she affirmed it – not that I needed her testimony to fix my own
               faith. the fact was obvious. the eye assents to it as the mind to a mathematical axiom,
               not from volition – not from the result of reasoning, but from the feeling, the palpable
               perception of truth.</p>
