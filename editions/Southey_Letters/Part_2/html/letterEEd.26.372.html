               <p class="indent6">_________</p>
               <div class="l">The Doctor whisperd to the Nurse</div>
               <div class="l">And the Surgeon knew what he said,</div>
               <div class="l">And he grew pale at the Doctors tale</div>
               <div class="l">And trembled in his sick bed.</div><br><div class="l">Now fetch me my brethren &amp; fetch them with speed,</div>
               <div class="l">The Surgeon affrighted said,</div>
               <div class="l">The Parson my brother, the Undertaker the other,</div>
               <div class="l">Let them hasten or I shall be dead.</div><br><div class="l">The Parson his brother, the undertaker the other</div>
               <div class="l">They hastily came complying,</div>
               <div class="l">And the Surgeons Prentices entered the room</div>
               <div class="l">When they heard that their master was dying.</div><br><div class="l">The Surgeon swore as they enterd his door</div>
               <div class="l">Twas fearful his oaths to hear – </div>
               <div class="l">Now send those Prentices to the Devil,</div>
               <div class="l">For God’s sake my <span style="text-decoration: line-through">children</span> &lt;brethren&gt; dear.</div><br><div class="l">He foamd at the mouth with the rage he felt</div>
               <div class="l">And he wrinkled his black eye brow,</div>
               <div class="l">That rascal Joe would be at me I know!</div>
               <div class="l">But zounds let him spare me now!</div><br><div class="l">Then out they sent the Prentices,</div>
               <div class="l">The fit it left him weak,</div>
               <div class="l">He lookd at his brothers with ghastly eyes,</div>
               <div class="l">And faintly struggled to speak.</div><br><div class="l">All kinds of carcases I have cut up</div>
               <div class="l">And the judgement now must be,</div>
               <div class="l">But Brothers I took care of you,</div>
               <div class="l">Oh pray take care of me!</div><br><div class="l">I have bottled babes unborn he said</div>
               <div class="l">The sextons have been my slaves – </div>
               <div class="l">I have candles made of infant fat</div>
               <div class="l">And flambeaus from rifled graves.</div><br><div class="l">And my prentices now will surely come</div>
               <div class="l">And carve me bone from bone,</div>
               <div class="l">And I who have rifled the dead mens graves</div>
               <div class="l">Shall never have rest in my own.</div><br><div class="l">Bury me in lead when I am dead</div>
               <div class="l">My brethren I intreat,</div>
               <div class="l">And see the coffin weightd I beg</div>
               <div class="l">Lest the Plumber should be a cheat.</div><br><div class="l">And let it be sawdered closely down</div>
               <div class="l">Strong as strong can be I implore,</div>
               <div class="l">And let it be put in a patent coffin</div>
               <div class="l">That I may rise no more.</div><br><div class="l">If they carry me off in the patent coffin</div>
               <div class="l">Their labour will be in vain,</div>
               <div class="l">Let the Undertaker see it bought of the maker</div>
               <div class="l">Who lives by S<sup>t</sup> Martins lane</div><br><div class="l">And bury me in my brothers church,</div>
               <div class="l">For that will safer be,</div>
               <div class="l">And I implore lock the church door</div>
               <div class="l">And pray take care of the key.</div><br><div class="l">And let three men in the vestry sit up</div>
               <div class="l">To save me if they can,</div>
               <div class="l">And give them five guineas if they shoot</div>
               <div class="l">A resurrection man.</div><br><div class="l">And let them watch me for three weeks</div>
               <div class="l">My wretched corpse to save,</div>
               <div class="l">For then I think that I may stink</div>
               <div class="l">Enough to rest in my grave.</div><br><div class="l">The surgeon laid him down in his bed,</div>
               <div class="l">His eyes grew deadly dim,</div>
               <div class="l">Short came his breath &amp; the struggle of death</div>
               <div class="l">Distorted every limb.</div><br><div class="l">They put him in lead when he was dead</div>
               <div class="l">And shrouded up so neat</div>
               <div class="l">And they the leaden coffin weigh</div>
               <div class="l">Lest the Plumber shd be a cheat</div><br><div class="l">And they had it sawderd <span style="text-decoration: line-through">mor</span> closely down</div>
               <div class="l">And examined it oer &amp; oer</div>
               <div class="l">And they had it &lt;put&gt; in a patent coffin</div>
               <div class="l">That he might rise no more.</div><br><div class="l">For to carry him off in a patent coffin</div>
               <div class="l">Would they thought be but labour in vain,</div>
               <div class="l">So the Undertaker saw it bought of the Maker</div>
               <div class="l">Who lives by S<sup>t</sup> Martins lane</div><br><div class="l">And they buried him in <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> his brothers church</div>
               <div class="l">That safer he might be,</div>
               <div class="l">And they lockd the door &amp; would not trust</div>
               <div class="l">The sexton with the key.</div><br><div class="l">And three men in the vestry sit up</div>
               <div class="l">To save him if they can,</div>
               <div class="l"><span style="text-decoration: line-through">And they shall have</span> five guineas he shall have who shoots</div>
               <div class="l">A resurrection man.</div><br><div class="l">The first night with their blunderbusses</div>
               <div class="l">They sat by the vestry fire,</div>
               <div class="l">They had good cheer of porter &amp; beer</div>
               <div class="l">As much as they could desire.</div><br><div class="l">But when the sexton let them in</div>
               <div class="l">As thro the church they went,</div>
               <div class="l">He whispered &amp; offered them a guinea</div>
               <div class="l">That Mister Joseph sent.</div><br><div class="l">But conscience was tough, it was not enough,</div>
               <div class="l">And their <span style="text-decoration: line-through">consciences</span> honesty never swerved,</div>
               <div class="l">And they bade him go with M<sup>r</sup> Joe</div>
               <div class="l">To the Devil as he deserved.</div><br><div class="l">So all night by the vestry fire</div>
               <div class="l">They sat &amp; quaffd their ale,</div>
               <div class="l">And they did drink as you may think</div>
               <div class="l">And told full many a tale.</div><br><div class="l">The second night when the Sexton came</div>
               <div class="l">As thro the church they went,</div>
               <div class="l">He whispered anew &amp; shewd them two</div>
               <div class="l">That Mister Joseph sent.</div><br><div class="l">The guineas were bright &amp; attracted their sight</div>
               <div class="l">They looked so heavy &amp; new,</div>
               <div class="l">And their fingers itchd as tho they were bewitchd</div>
               <div class="l">And they knew not what to do.</div><br><div class="l">But they wavered not long for conscience was strong</div>
               <div class="l">And they thought they might get more,</div>
               <div class="l">And they refused the offer, but not</div>
               <div class="l">So rudely as before.</div><br><p class="indent1">So all night &amp;c.</p><br><div class="l">The third night when the sexton came</div>
               <div class="l">As thro the church they went</div>
               <div class="l">He bade them see &amp; shewd them three</div>
               <div class="l">That M<sup>r</sup> Joseph sent.</div><br><div class="l">They lookd askance with eager glance</div>
               <div class="l">The guineas they <span style="text-decoration: line-through">looked</span> shone bright,</div>
               <div class="l">For the Sexton on the yellow gold</div>
               <div class="l">Let fall his lanthorn light.</div><br><div class="l">And he looked sly with his rogueish eye</div>
               <div class="l">And gave a well-timd wink – </div>
               <div class="l">And they could not stand the sound in his hand</div>
               <div class="l">For he made the guineas chink.</div><br><div class="l">And conscience late that had such weight</div>
               <div class="l">In the trying moment fails</div>
               <div class="l">For well they knew that it was true</div>
               <div class="l">A dead man told no tales.</div><br><div class="l">And they gave all their powder &amp; ball</div>
               <div class="l">And took the gold so bright</div>
               <div class="l">And they drank their beer &amp; made good cheer</div>
               <div class="l">Till now it was midnight.</div><br><div class="l">Then tho the key of the church door</div>
               <div class="l">Was left with the Parson his brother</div>
               <div class="l">It opened at the Sextons touch – </div>
               <div class="l">Because he had got another, – </div><br><div class="l">And in they go with that villain Joe</div>
               <div class="l">To fetch the body by night,</div>
               <div class="l">And all the church lookd dismally</div>
               <div class="l">By his dark lanthorn light.</div><br><div class="l">They laid the pickaxe to the stones</div>
               <div class="l">&amp; they moved them soon asunder,</div>
               <div class="l">&amp; they shovelld away the hard prest clay</div>
               <div class="l">And came to the coffin under.</div><br><div class="l">And they burst the patent coffin first</div>
               <div class="l">&amp; they cut thro the lead,</div>
               <div class="l">&amp; they laughd aloud when they saw the shroud</div>
               <div class="l">Because they had got at the dead.</div><br><div class="l">&amp; they allowd the sexton the shroud</div>
               <div class="l">&amp; they put the coffin back,</div>
               <div class="l">&amp; nose &amp; knees they then did squeee</div>
               <div class="l">The surgeon in a sack.</div><br><div class="l">The watchmen as they past along</div>
               <div class="l">Full four yards off could smell</div>
               <div class="l">And curse bestowd upon the load</div>
               <div class="l">So disagreabell.</div><br><div class="l">So they carried the sack a-pick-a-back – </div>
               <div class="l">And they carvd him bone from bone,</div>
               <div class="l">But what became of the Surgeons soul</div>
               <div class="l">Was never to mortal known.
