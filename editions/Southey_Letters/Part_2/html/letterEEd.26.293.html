               <p>Nay Grosvenor – you could not suppose my silence proceeded from any childish pique.
                  I had much to do &amp; nothing to say. I have no new incident to recount, no new feeling
                  &amp; as for observations – those alone that I am anxious to make can little interest
                  you. Would it please you to hear that I have seen a few gnats buzzing in the lanes
                  at [MS illegible] that the beech trees keep their leaves – that the yew tree looks
                  beautifull in the wood? &amp; yet these are the remarks I have made – . my intercourse
                  with men teaches me nothing worth learning – an evening walk gives me some new images
                  for poetry. In the country I have no feeling but what delights me – fills me, – makes
                  me better. I should be very religious Grosvenor had I a home in the country, where
                  I could always see the sun set, when I could lie down &amp; watch the running water, or
                  sun myself on a primerose bank. I cannot tell you how I feel when every object around
                  reminds me of something so powerful – so beneficent as creative intelligence. In town
                  where are these feelings gone! I am another being. my soul seems annihilated. I have
                  no enjoyment of life there – it is existence – like a Jew brokers existence; &amp; not
                  quite so quiet as a toads in a block of marble. Meliora novi proboque deteriora sequor
