                  </div> &amp; leisure only for one letter, to which you have most claim. On Thursday last we saw
                  the long looked for procession of the Body of God – I give the English name that I
                  may not throw a Portugueze cloak over the naked nonsense of blasphemy. The Pix is
                  empty in all other processions, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">it</span> in this it contains the wafer – So it was the Real Presence. on the preceding night
                  the streets thro which it is to pass are cleaned &amp; strewn with sand – the most miraculous
                  thing I have ever yet witnessed of the Host. the houses are hung with crimson damask
                  from top to bottom. they <span style="text-decoration: line-through">houses</span> are high, very handsome &amp; perfectly regular, &amp; the Street rather longer than Redclift
                  Street. The Soldiers lined the way, their new uniforms were put on &amp; their appearance
                  very respectable. every window &amp; balcony was crowded, the Portugueze were all in full
                  dress, &amp; of the finery of Portugueze full dress you can have but very inadequate ideas.
                  not a jewel in Lisbon but was displayed; rainbows &amp; peacocks are Quaker-comparisons.
                  The banners of the city &amp; its various corporate trades led the way – I never saw banners
                  so clumsily carried. they were stuck out with rods instead of being suffered to play
                  freely, &amp; wave with the wind &amp; roll out their beauties in light &amp; shade. sticks were
                  stuck at right angles in the poles to carry them by; nothing could be more awkward
                  or more laborious for the bearers; they were obliged to walk <span class="ital">round</span> the first, some backwards like lobsters, others crabsideling along, &amp; all toiling
                  with a waste of exertion. Then came a champion in compleat armour, carrying a flag.
                  I pitied him, the armour was a heavy load, &amp; the attitude painfull, both hands holding
                  the flag, so that his horse was led. I saw S<sup>t</sup> George also, who followed him. a wooden <span class="ital">Portugueze</span> S<sup>t</sup> George – his legs stiff striding like the notch of a bootjack, a man walking on each
                  side to hold him on by the feet. He lives in the Castle, &amp; on his way to this procession
                  calls at the Duke of Cadavals,

               <p>Scarcely any part of the procession was more beautiful than a number of fine led horses,
                  their saddles covered with rich emblazonments. the brotherhoods then walked, an immense
                  train, red cloaks &amp; grey cloaks out of number, &amp; all the friars. some few of these
                  indeed were “more fat than friars beseemed,”

                  </div> but there were some that filled me with respect &amp; pity. Old men, grey bearded, thin
                  as austerity could make old age, so pale – so hermit-like – of such a bread &amp; water
                  appearance, that of their sincerity no doubt could be entertained. They quite made
                  me melancholy to see uprightness of intention &amp; energy so misapplied. tho temperate
                  for June the day was hot, &amp; I pitied the shaven heads glistening under the fierce
                  noon sun. their breviaries – their hands – handkerchiefs &amp; cowls were held up ineffectually,
                  two years ago some of their people are said to have died, struck by the sun, in this
                  procession. At that time an accident <span style="text-decoration: line-through">prove</span> happened which gave the Irish friars an opportunity to show they had not degenerated
                  in a foreign land. A stranger dropt with a <span class="ital">coup de soleil</span>. he was dead to all appearance, the Irish friars got him <span style="text-decoration: line-through">at their church</span> &amp; carried him off to be buried. the coffin is always kept open during the service,
                  &amp; before it was finished the Man moved. What do you suppose the Wild Hunies did? they
                  could not bury him then they agreed – but they locked him in the church instead of
                  sending for assistance. the next day the man was dead enough &amp; they finished their
                  job.</p>

                  with it. the crowd close<span style="text-decoration: line-through">d</span> behind – the music – the blaze of the<span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> dresses – the long street thronged – flooded with people. Had this been well managed
                  it would have been one of the finest imaginable sights, but they moved so irregularly
                  &amp; with such gaps that it was a long procession broken into a number of little pieces.
                  it ought also to be seen with Catholic eyes, not with the eyes of a philosopher. I
                  hate <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> this idolatry as much as I despise it, for I know the bloody &amp; brutalizing spirit
                  of popery. Next day S<sup>t</sup> Anthony had a puppet-show. two Negro Saints carried by Negroes formed the most striking
                  feature. they made me smile by reminding me of old Flavell,

                  I said to a Lady who remembered the Auto-da-fes, how dreadful the day of one of those
                  damnable sacrifices must have been to the English residents. no, she said, not at
                  all. it was like these raree-shows expected as a fine sight, &amp; the English by whose
                  window the procession passed, kept open house, as now &amp; gave entertainments. the execution
                  was at midnight indeed – but they ought to have shut up their houses. no English eyes
                  ought to have seen any part of so cursed a spectacle. I never pass the Inquisition,
