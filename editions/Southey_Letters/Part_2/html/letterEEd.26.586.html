               <p>In tribulation of trullibubs &amp; trouble of tripes do I begin O Grosvenor. it is not
                  always easy, as you know to settle ones mind – but prithee take one voyage &amp; it will
                  convince you that it is far more difficult to settle the stomach. I have now been
                  six days &amp; nights at sea, &amp; in that time a lame jackass would have carried me as fast
                  &amp; as far. &amp; Southey what have you been doing? – Oh I have been – very sick. you might
                  rhyme to the question if you please. the weather cock has thought proper to point
                  the wrong way, &amp; in contradiction to all proverbs &amp; all our prayers obstinately stand
                  still. we are just now overjoyed at a change of only two points. I have however discovered
                  an excellent substitute for sea sickness, which you know is so fashionable a remedy
                  for sensory disorders – or rather a method for making people sea sick upon shore.
                  put the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">death</span> patient &lt;to bed&gt; in a long wooden box, six feet by two, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">with bedding</span>, N.B. a coffin will do. hang <span style="text-decoration: line-through">them</span> &lt;him&gt; up in a dark room, rock <span style="text-decoration: line-through">them</span> &lt;him&gt; well, make a great noise &amp; a great stink – &amp; my life for it <span style="text-decoration: line-through">they</span> &lt;he&gt; will soon be as sick as heart can wish. I have made another discovery – that
                  I am very good natured, not having one drop of gall in my gall bladder, when the whole
                  contents of my inside came out in long procession. But even worse than sickness is
                  this insufferable tedium – the mill-stone weight of time! I would write practical
                  comments upon the Book of Job – if there were a Bible on board. A days travelling
                  in wind &amp; wet over a wilderness of gum cistus is positive happiness in comparison.
