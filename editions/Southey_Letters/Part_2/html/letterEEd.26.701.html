            <p>Dear Cottle,</p>
            <p class="indent1">Well done good and faithful editor. I suspect that it is fortunate for the edition
               of Chatterton, that its care has devolved upon you.</p>

                           to Cottle. His initials, ‘J.C.’, were added to the end of his prefatory note on the
                           work. Southey made it clear in the unpaginated ‘Preface’ to vol. 1 that he and Cottle

                  know how to say enough, in the preface, about all other aiders and abetters, but it

                  Bristol churches. Your copy of the ‘Tournament’ being in Chatterton’s own hand-writing
                  is surely the best authority. We are now of one opinion, that Chatterton and Rowley
                  are one.</p>

               <p>I am glad to hear that you have discovered anything worth printing in the British
                  Museum. Doubtless, if you think it worth printing, others will do the same, and it
                  is not our fault, if it be dull or an imperfect work. I transcribed page after page
                  of what would have been worth little if genuine, and not being genuine, is worth nothing.
                  This refers only to the local antiquities, and false deeds of gift, &amp;c. I made a catalogue,
                  and left it with you. Why say, ‘I hope you will not take it amiss.’ I am as ready
                  to thank you for supplying any negligence of mine, as any one else can be. I should
                  have wished for more engravings, but we have gone to the bounds of expense and trouble,
                  in this gratuitous, but pleasant effort to benefit the family of Bristol’s most illustrious
                  bard. Why did you not sign your notes? I can now only say, that much, indeed most
                  of the trouble has devolved on you. J. C. at the end of each note, would have showed
                  how much.

                  about the young lad. ‘Stay,’ said Barrett, ‘and hear what he will say to me.’ Chatterton
                  was sent for. Barrett talked to him on the guilt and folly of suicide. Chatterton
                  denied any intention of the kind, or any conversation to that import. Clayfield came
                  from the closet with the letter in his hand, and asked, ‘Is not this your hand-writing?’
                  Chatterton then, in a state of confusion, fell upon his knees, and heard in sullen
                  silence, the suitable remarks on his conduct.
