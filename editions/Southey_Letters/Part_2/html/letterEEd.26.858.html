                  </div> you the first intelligence which I have received from him! sending his letter rather
                  than transcribing that you may see the shocking manner in which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</a> has suffered him to proceed, when applications were perpetually made to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> for money for his school bills. he was allowed to idle as much as he pleases, kept
                  at home three fourths of his time – &amp; now at the age of fifteen can neither write
                  nor spell!</p>
