               that as a thing of course I should believe myself to be the defaulter, if it were
               not for remembering that the last letter between us was my acknowledgement of the
               fifty pounds. Howbeit I am <span style="text-decoration: line-through">not xx</span> clearly acquitted – for you perhaps have lost sight of me, &amp; supposed that I had
               removed to Cumberland as was my design. that scheme was unexpectedly frustrated. I
               still remain at Bristol, unsettled still – &amp; still expecting a settlement. At present
               treating for a house in Glamorganshire – a very delightful place near Neath. so beautifully
               situated that if as there is every probability, it should be my home next spring,
               I think the country fine enough to ask you to come &amp; let me show it you. for it is
               worth a journey longer than from Hampshire.</p>

                  fluently to her, &amp; am a better nurse than you would perhaps imagine. hitherto she
