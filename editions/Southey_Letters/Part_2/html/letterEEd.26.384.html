               inclemency of the weather &amp; my own state of health, prevented me; I was not well enough
               to go from home with comfort, or to endure the fatigue of so long a journey. since
               the frost has broke I find myself materially better – I have shaken off many of my
               most uncomfortable symptoms, &amp; hope now, by paying my chief attention to my health
               during this summer, to be enabled to pay no attention at all to it in the winter.</p>
