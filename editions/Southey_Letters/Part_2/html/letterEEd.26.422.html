                           Persian favourite who preferred his former simple life as a shepherd to the Court.
                           This was a much-published story in the eighteenth century, about a mythical Persian
                           visier called Alibeg. It derived from the fables of the French clergyman and writer,
                           Francois de Salignac de La Mothe-Fenelon (1651–1715). For an English translation,
                           see Twenty-Seven Moral Tales and Fables (London, 1729), pp. 69–84. Southey removed
                           this passage in the 1799 third edition of his Poems.</span></div>

                  yet has none. tocsin shall go if I can find a better word – but its reference to the
                  French Revolution seems to appropriate it to that place. Misanthropy is so much the
                  best personification I ever made, &amp; so much the feeling with which I wrote the poem,
                  that it must stay. it is in my own mind one of the most original passages I ever conceived.
