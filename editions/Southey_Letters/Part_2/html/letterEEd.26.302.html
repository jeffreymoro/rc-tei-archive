               — no new feelings — no new opinions. we move no longer in the same circles, &amp; no longer
               see things in the same point of view. I never now write a long letter. to those who
               think with me, it is useless to express what they also feel; &amp; as for reasoning with

               my views in life — or rather destroy them. this is the first time that I have expressed
