                  – &amp; I was ill able to bear exhaustion. it left me a nervous fever – &amp; for a fortnight
                  I was unable either to write or read ten minutes together. I am recovered – but only
                  to feel a worse symptom. a pain at the heart, – so settled that I do not think it
                  right any longer to delay consulting those medical persons to whom I can trust myself
                  – we are therefore going to Bristol on Monday.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">What this pain bodes I am at a loss to conjecture. any affection of the heart would
               necessarily affect the circulation – &amp; of this I am not sensible. for pleurisy I have
               not blood enough, or general health. if it be a consumptive symptom I shall remove
               to a warmer climate. one thing cheers me, it has to day &amp; yesterday been less painful

                  possibly I may be driven to Lisbon &amp; so one objection removed. These are the only
