                  out for. A months attendance in our infirmary, he says, will show him as much of the
                  practice as he wants, having seen a good deal in Edinburgh. Now what I plague you
                  for is to ask you to ask how these things are <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxxx</span> get-at-able. in the navy I should judge, they require only application to the Board,
