               miles for, makes me leave it without reluctance. Portugueze scenery suffers less than
               our colder country by winter; the Cork keeps thro the year its foliage – the olive
               also – the firs, the orange &amp; lemon trees; the laurel of this country, &amp; the arbutus
               are all evergreens, I know not whether the mixture of grey boughs among the evergreen
               woods be not rather a beauty than a winter-scene of nakedness. besides the hills that
               are brown-burnt in the summer have now a somewhat of grassiness to the eye – &amp; the
               great aloe is of unchanging magnificence. we lose less than we gain by having an endurable
               sun, &amp; weather for walking. – Yesterday we went nine miles to see fishermen walk up
               &amp; down an almost perpendicular rock. one false step &amp; down they go to be shattered

               hours ride for the sake of seeing them &amp; finding ourselves in a most uncomfortable
               state of apprehension. the rock is shelving &amp; rough – they went bare footed, &amp; fast
               by the help of hands &amp; that part which is usually of more use in rest than in motion
               – Kangaroos indeed use their tails also in walking as you may remember. near this
               place the rock is perforated I know not how. but we lay down &amp; saw a monstrous pit
