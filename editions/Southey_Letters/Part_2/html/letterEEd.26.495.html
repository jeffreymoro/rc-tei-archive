                  at Yarmouth. of this I have received certain intelligence from Yarmouth − &amp; the address

                  must bud forth at last – a leaven which must ultimately ferment &amp; purify society.
                  you see how the subject naturally proceeds – state of females in society, &amp; the evils
                  thereon attendant: benefits deduceable from their increased utility &amp; independance:
                  &amp; then the mode of obtaining this desirable end. If a few leading women could be proselyted,
