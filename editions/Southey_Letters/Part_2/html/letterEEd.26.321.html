               interests you. not so Grosvenor. your first letter followed me here &amp; arrived not
               till late on Thursday night. I answered it the next morning – but a blunder of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> detained it from that days post – &amp; then came in the Saturdays post office sabbath.
               it would be useless now to send it – because your after letter implies other meaning
               &amp; makes me incline to unthink what I then thought. so I will bring it in my pocket
               to vouch that I had not neglected you: &amp; I will then return your last.</p>
