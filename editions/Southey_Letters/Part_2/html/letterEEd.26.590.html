                  man can go as his secretary, it is probable that I shall accompany him. I daily expect
                  to know. It is a scheme of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn’s</a> to settle me in the south, and I am returned to look about me. My salary will be small
                  – a very trifle; but after a few years I look on to something better, and have fixed
                  my mind on a consulship. Now, if we go, you must join us as soon as we are housed,
                  and it will be marvellous if we regret England. I shall have so little to do, that
                  my time may be considered as wholly my own: our joint amusements will easily supply
                  us with all expenses. So no more of the Azores; for we will see the Great Turk, and
                  visit Greece, and walk up the Pyramids, and ride camels in Arabia. I have dreamt of
                  nothing else these five weeks. As yet every thing is so uncertain, for I have received
                  no letter since we landed, that nothing can be said of our intermediate movements.
                  If we are not embarked too soon, we will set off as early as possible for Cumberland,
                  unless you should think, as we do, that Mahomet had better come to the mountain;
