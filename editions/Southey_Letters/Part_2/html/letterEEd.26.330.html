            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Thank God I have at last accomplished the business of settling <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a>, a business which three months ago I almost feared would be impracticable. I write
               to you from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</a>, one of the villages at the end of Durdham Down, two miles from Bristol. the house
               I have taken for her is a very old one. but my revolutionizing hand has already removed
               much rubbish &amp; added some conveniences. there is a garden large enough to supply our
               table, &amp; the back view is extensive, &amp; as beautiful as a prospect can be without any
               characteristic sublimity, which has only hill, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp; wood</span> vale, &amp; wood to vary it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I cannot tell you from what a weight I feel relieved by this change in her situation.
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> too is evidently better. We are as busy as you may conceive, but the fatigue of preparing
               future comfort is itself almost comfortable. I hope <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> may like the place enough, &amp; find it agree with her health so well, as to make it
               her continued home. I should like to make it the place of my summer visit, &amp; feel
               when in London that I had also a home in a pleasanter place.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We came here only on Monday; in a few days I hope all bustle will be over, &amp; I shall
                  quietly settle into regularity. It is a long time since you have written. In my last
                  I enquired for your brother

                  that they are only Irishmen on one side &amp; soldiers on the other, &amp; the conduct of
                  both has been so brutal that one may certainly be easily reconciled to the slaughter
                  of either or both.

               however make me willingly give up the plan, &amp; excepting a visit to Hereford &amp; its
               neighbourhood I shall be stationary here till we remove again to London. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> will receive a regular small income from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">her brother</a>, but <span style="text-decoration: line-through">it has been</span> her removal from Bath has been a heavy expence, &amp; for a short time I keep house.
