               <div class="l">In shuddering pity Thalaba exclaimed,</div>

               <div class="l">Meantime the freed Othatha claspt his knees,</div>

               <div class="l">With joy &amp; hope, “&amp; where is she,” he cried</div>

               <div class="l">“Go,” answered Thalaba,</div>
               <div class="l">“She waits thee at the gates.”</div>
               <div class="l">“And in the triumph,” he replied,</div>

               <div class="l">Glanced on the abyss; way else was none,</div>
               <div class="l">The depth was unascendable.</div>
               <div class="l">“Await not me,” he cried,</div>

               <div class="l">It veiled no friendly form thought Thalaba,</div>

               <div class="l">Raising his hand to save the dazzled sense</div>
               <div class="l">Onward held Thalaba</div>
