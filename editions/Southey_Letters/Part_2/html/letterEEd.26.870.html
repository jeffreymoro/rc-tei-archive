            <p class="indent1">To compleat the wretched history of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> it seems he &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</a> have been actually juggling together how to make me supply him with money &amp; get him
               into the army. supposing that I should the more readily exert myself if made to believe
               that he had quarrelled with her. I learn by his last letter that she continues to
               write to him – &amp; he directs his letters to her at Bristol – where there is correspondence
               then is not much quarrel there – &amp; he says she has sent him no money – thus letting
               the cat out of the bag. As if to prevent all possibility of his return to the navy,
               she has sold his uniforms to a travelling Jew. – Considering all these things &amp; that
               it was impossible either to recommend him to any Captain myself, or expect any friend
               to do it after his conduct at Exeter, I have written to tell him that he &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</a> may settle this matter how they please, for I will have nothing whatsoever to do
               with him till he has [MS obscured] thorough alteration of conduct. his letters &amp; those
               of his creditors have already cost me [MS obscured]ence in postage.</p>
