               <div class="salute">My dear Friend,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">From the day of my last letter, I have been in a comfortless state of compulsory idleness,
               occasioned by a complaint in my eyes. A whole confederacy of evils attacked me immediately:
               swelled face – to that I applied leeches; toothache – that was cured radically; symptoms
               of fever – which were driven out at every sally-port. I have got rid of all, except
               the eye-weakness, and that is very materially amended. Lancing the lower lids was
               the effectual remedy; still they are weak. I am beginning to read and write, but inconveniently,
               and with caution.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A residence in Wales will not place me so much out of your reach as you imagine, if
               I succeed in obtaining <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MaesGywn">Maes Gwyn</a>, for so the house is called. I want to take it furnished, to avoid the first cost
               of furniture, and the encumbrance, if, by good fortune, I should be enabled to remove
               to a more congenial climate. 20<span class="ital">l.</span> is the unfurnished rent; for the use of the goods from 10<span class="ital">l.</span> to 15<span class="ital">l.</span> more may be demanded, if the landlord will let them. It is a lovely spot, in a vale
               among the mountains, eight miles from Neath, with canal carriage within 100 yards
               of the door. From Bristol to Neath is a distance of eighty miles. A friend who should
               leave Bristol by the mail, at one in the mid-day, might reach me at breakfast-hour
               the next morning. I will tell you more about it, and all its desirableness, if the
               business end as I wish.</p>

                  of the kind in England. Mrs. Newton relates an odd dream – if, indeed, it be not a
                  waking dream – akin in imagination and authenticity to Rowley’s Poems. She dreamt
                  that her brother had a monument in Redcliff church, the stones whereof were cementing
                  with a hot substance, that perpetually grew hotter and hotter, till at last it flamed
                  out; – that, being about to dress her dinner, she had no fire, – she remembered these
                  flames, and went to them, and warmed her food upon her brother’s monument. “Now,”
                  says she, “my dream is out.” Surely this is too well put together to be a dream.</p>
