               <p>Since you left London I have hardly had leisure to miss you not from the pressure

                  </div> is all I do in my secretaryship – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My Mother</a> arrived on the Monday – in far worse health than I had expected. indeed she appears
                  far gone in consumption. some symptoms which usually attend that cursed disease do
                  not appear – &amp; this is some little ground of hope. but consumption has not always
                  those symptoms. Of course much time &amp; all attention is taken up –. these evils must
                  come. – My connections in life are dropping off as I advance, &amp; no young ties supply
                  their places. – I will tell you what shape my plans – or my ideas of plans according
                  to Platonic philosophy

                  </div> – have lately been assuming. this foolish place under <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</a> cannot subsist a second year. from no fault on my part nor any unwillingness. but
                  he does not want me – I am utterly useless to him – he is a <span class="ital">weak man</span> &amp; therefore an unsteady one. plan about me he can have had none – what he says today
                  is merely for the sake of saying something – he did not think of it yesterday – &amp;
                  he will not remember it tomorrow. I <span class="ital">know</span> I am right in thus judging – varnish the portrait with all gentlemanlike-courtesy
                  as you will – still this is the likeness. Whether or not he will give me any situation
                  in his own dear country – who can tell? – all I can say is, that as most assuredly
                  I have no claim – so surely it is wisest to have no expectation. If then at the years
                  end – I am as I was at the beginning, my wish is to return to Cumberland, &amp; sit quietly
                  down. if any new changes should make an administration with whom I have any interest
                  – of course a situation in the South of Europe would be very acceptable. if not –
                  I can live in that country to the extent of my wishes upon a very small income. I
                  can be luxuriously lodged for 25 £ a year – &amp; unless I greatly miscalculate can live
                  more comfortably for three pounds a week (including every expence) than I do at this
                  time for more than double that sum. I know not <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> – if only inclination were consulted – how I could be more happily settled than in
                  that leisure &amp; that most lovely country.</p>
