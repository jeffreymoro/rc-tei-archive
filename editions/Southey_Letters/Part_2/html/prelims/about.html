            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Editorial Methodology</span></p>
            <p><em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</em> is divided into eight Parts: I: 1791-1797, II:1798-1803, III:1804-09, IV:1810-15,
               V:1816-21, VI:1822-27, VII:1828-33, VIII:1833-39.</p>
            <p>The General Introduction outlines the project’s research context. In addition, each
               individual Part has a brief introductory essay and a chronology covering key events
               in Southey’s life. </p>
            <p>Throughout the edition, letters are presented in chronological order, each letter
               being assigned its own number. Unpublished letters have all been newly transcribed
               from manuscript. Where letters have been previously published, we have returned to
               and transcribed the original manuscript when it survives. In cases where we have been
               unable to locate the manuscript of a published letter, copy-text is taken from the
               published version and this is recorded in the editorial headnote.</p>
            <p>All letters are transcribed in full and editorial intervention in the text has been
               kept to a minimum. Southey’s original spelling, and mis-spelling, grammar and punctuation
               has been retained. Deletions are indicated by striking through the deleted word or
               phrase, but without any attempt to indicate the heaviness of the deletion: e.g. ‘<span style="text-decoration: line-through">he said</span>’. Throughout the text, ‘x’ is used to indicate an illegible character: e.g. ‘he xxid’.
               Underlining is indicated by italics: e.g. ‘<span class="ital">he</span> said’. Editorial [...] within the text of an individual letter are used to indicate
               issues relating to the manuscript: a tear, cut, missing section or area obscured by
               a seal mark or blot, or a substantial section of a letter in the hand of a co-correspondent.
               See, for example, Letter 56, co-written with Grosvenor Charles Bedford. Editorial
               &lt;...&gt; are used to indicate an authorial insertion of text above or below the line.</p>
            <p>Each letter has an editorial headnote which records the manuscript location and any
               previous instances of publication. It also deals with other relevant issues, such
               as endorsements, watermarks, postmarks, franks, stamps and dating. This edition provides
               important new information about when many of Southey’s letters were actually written,
               and re-dates letters that have been misdated or misleadingly dated by previous editors.
               For example, Southey’s earliest correspondence is here demonstrated to date to late
               1791, rather than 1790 as claimed by John Wood Warter. The following conventions have
               been observed in dating individual letters: [...] is used in headnotes to indicate
               an editorial dating; ‘c.’ to indicate a dating taken from the postmark or from internal
               evidence within an individual letter; ‘before’ is used either when a letter contains
               an authorial date, but there is evidence within the letter that it was begun before
               that time, or when an endorsement on the letter indicates its date of receipt; ‘after’
               is used when a letter contains an authorial date, but there is evidence within the
               letter that it was continued after that time; ‘?’ is used to indicate a dating about
               which there remains some uncertainty.</p>
            <p>Detailed information about Southey’s correspondents, along with other important figures
               in his letters, can be found in the ‘Biographies’ section. Information about where
               Southey lived and the homes of friends which he visited is provided in the ‘Places’
               section of this edition. </p>
            <p>Editorial notes to the text are used to clarify references to persons, books, places,
               and events within the main body of each individual letter. They also identify quotations
               and provide translations of foreign language material.</p>

            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">About the Design</span></p>
            <p>This electronic edition was TEI-encoded by Averill Buchanan under the supervision
               of Laura Mandell and her team at Miami University of Ohio, and with the assistance
               of David Rettenmaier and Mike Quilligan at the University of Maryland. Buchanan used
               the new Word Macros tool developed at Miami University by Holly Connor and Jerry Gannod
               in order to learn TEI encoding. Mandell transformed the TEI files into HTML by using
               modified versions of the transforms provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org">TEI</a>. Dave Rettenmaier and Mike Qulligan designed the splash pages, banners, etc., comprising
               the HTML design. The HTML pages do not use frames but rather make extensive use of
               tables and stylesheets for layout and presentation. The site works best when viewed
               with Mozilla Firefox v. 3, Netscape 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.0, or higher, or a comparable
               browser; earlier browsers may not display everything properly.</p>
