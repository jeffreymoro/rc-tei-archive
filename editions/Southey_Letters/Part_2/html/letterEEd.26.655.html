               of the old &amp; new world are of the same species. for it plainly implies the existence
               of an Alligator in Egypt.’ This is a rather painful pun on the Latin word ‘alligari’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               pyramids and its painted obelisks, colossi and Trajan’s columns, because of the stars
               which shone over them: their cross-section was pretty well round, I think, and their
               heights various. The founder of the Stylite sect Simeon first ascended a little pillar
               of six cubits at the least (or nine feet); then twelve, then twenty-two and finally
               thirty-six, or, as Nicephorus and others say, forty cubits’ height. The barrel or
               cell or room perched on the pillars in which they used to live extended two cubits
               (or three feet) in all directions and was roofless, so that they could gaze at the
               whole of heaven in freedom and by exposure to all the perils of the sky have a greater
               crop and harvest of endurance. Some had doors, some not, because the violence of a
               storm had dislodged part of a wall. Ladders were put in place when either people tried
               to reach them or they went to see others, something they used to do either not at
               all or when invoked at times of great political anxiety. They tortured themselves
               by staying perpetually on their feet, since there was no space to lie or stretch out;
               that they sat I read nowhere, and I think they never did. For his first forty days
               Simeon took care to be tied to a plank; for the next forty he kept position on his
               own without aid, visible from the waist up like a preacher in a pulpit.’ The source
