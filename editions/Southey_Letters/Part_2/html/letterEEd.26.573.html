                  – a view so altogether glorious as opened upon us from its near heights. the preceding
                  day we had<span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> been wetted, &amp; for three days threatened with dark &amp; lowering clouds. of course the
                  Sun was welcome – it dried us &amp; warmed us, &amp; made every thing chearful. the country
                  is hilly &amp; well watered – olives &amp; oranges every where, &amp; cypresses thick as poplars
                  about London. mountains bounded the scene – the farthest object was one snowy summit
                  of the Estrella, glittering in the sun. down the southern boundary a few clouds were
                  floating, so beamy white that they seemed like light condensed to visible shape &amp;
                  substance. The city with its fine convents shone on an eminence over the Mondego,
                  now in the fullness of its waters. Coimbra is the spot of which the historian &amp; the
                  poet scarcely ever loses sight – whatever was interesting in the history or literature
                  of Portugal centered here – &amp; I looked at the city with the strong recollection of
                  old times &amp; old heroes. Knowing what to expect within I was prepared for the contrast
                  – yet was it impossible not to feel disappointment at quitting so rich a scene to
                  enter narrow &amp; stinking streets, crowded with blackguard students, or with townspeople
                  rendered vicious &amp; knavish &amp; impudent by the contagion of the University. the first
                  object was disgusting – passing under an old gateway – the prison fronted us. &amp; two
                  gallows-faced fellows fastened with chains round their necks were standing in the
                  street begging. We met several other prisoners dragging their fetters thro the town
                  on the same employment. Every where in Coimbra some relic of antiquity presents itself,
                  but every where it is mixed with modern patches. In the monastery of Santa Cruz, one
                  of the oldest &amp; most famous establishments in the kingdom I saw nothing so remarkable
                  as – the poultry yard. the royal tombs were comparatively modern &amp; miserably poor
                  after what we had seen at Alcobaça &amp; Batalha. the sword of Alfonso Henrique

                  converted to this useful purpose – cut with canals of running water over which were
                  several small temples – &amp; such geese &amp; ducks – &amp; another sort of wild water bird to
                  me unknown! – so fat – they ought to have been roasted in the Alcobaça kitchen. I
