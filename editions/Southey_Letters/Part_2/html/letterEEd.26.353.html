            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have been I suppose some time in expectation of hearing from me. the indisposition
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">my companion</a> delayed the commencement of our journey for some days, &amp; when we were on the way I
                  found my time of rest fully occupied in necessary business &amp; the due letters home. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MaberGeorge">Maber</a> tells me to take <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> to S<sup>t</sup> Pauls any time before he is twelve years old. this is well. the difficulty now is
                  to get <span style="text-decoration: line-through">from</span> him from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his aunt</a>. on this subject I have repeatedly written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, but I never can get any reply. You remember my writing to him in February after
                  I had seen you &amp; Burn.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>William Burn (dates unknown) was attached to the British Factory, Lisbon.</span></div>
                  </div> the account I sent him of his sister was such that I thought if he did not himself
                  come over to make some settling of her affairs <span style="text-decoration: line-through">himself</span>, he would certainly appoint <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a> to do it. this letter he has never noticed, tho I know by his alluding to one part
                  of it that it reached him. I scarcely know how to act. it is very unpleasant to be
                  always addressing him upon this subject &amp; receive no reply, yet something must be
                  done, &amp; however disagreable the business may be, it certainly will not become less
                  so by being deferred. it is always better to meet evils than to wait for them.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">how it is that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a> is so perpetually embarrassed I am utterly at a loss to conceive. I know the perpetual
               facility of obtaining money in small sums from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> for many many years, may have been one great cause for thoughtless expenditure. there
               is a great degree of weakness in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</a> character. she has never lost the fear she felt when a child for an elder sister
               who has <span style="text-decoration: line-through">perpet</span> always asserted her superiority. &amp; this fear is carried to so criminal a length that
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> has often drawn from her the money which should have gone to discharge her debts,
               &amp; made her borrow <span style="text-decoration: line-through">money</span> &lt;sums&gt; which she saw no prospect of repaying. now I trust there is a stop put to
               this. &amp; now as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> can no longer be supplied by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">her sister</a>, she must be compelled to that line of conduct which if she had adopted twenty years
               ago would have spared her family the greater part of their after difficulties.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a> however expected <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> would still supply her with money from me; this did surprize <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> who knew how utterly impossible this was. even if it were in my power it would be
               wrong to assist her in keeping up a false appearance of high life. but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">cousin</a> are with me, this doubles my house keeping expences, &amp; I have been obliged to pay
               thirteen pounds, the amount of one of my Oxford bills – all of which I thought <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> had discharged, but which I now daily expect to come in upon me. one bill of five
               pounds I have paid which remained of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</a> debts. all this has exhausted the resources up to this time upon which I calculated
               to furnish a house in town. still however I shall do well. I have already seen too
               much the consequences of debt – &amp; I will keep myself unembarrassed.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a> therefore can draw nothing from this quarter, her circumstances require some immediate
               investigation, &amp; as I can get no letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> &amp; I both think it right to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">let</span> write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> is with her three or four days in a week. &amp; says that her habitual violence of temper
               is now increased by long indulgence absolutely to a state of derangement. her grandmother
               resembled her in this particular &amp; died in confinement. this idea makes <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> wretched. what should be done is this. she should by the sale of her furniture pay
               her debts as far as it will go, &amp; live in lodgings upon the income <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> allows her. an income amply sufficient. I know not its exact amount, but have reason
               to believe it is the whole of his Herefordshire preferment, which cannot fall far
               short of 200 a year.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have written all this to you, because you &amp; Burn know so much of our family affairs
               – &amp; because it is not pleasant to have <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> no one to communicate with upon such subjects. whether or no <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a>, like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, will rather let things go on &amp; grow worse, than undertake a very disagreable office
               I know not. it will certainly be proper to state to him her exact situation.</p>
            <p class="indent1">God bless you. I have been somewhat unwell but am better. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is but poorly, tho infinitely better than when she left London. I will write again
               soon. let me hear from you.</p>
