            <p class="indent1">As far as I can conjecture your gout is willing to become gout if it could – the Gout
               medicine may help it on to this. I suppose you should try it in two ways. first by
               drinking 4 5 or 6 glasses at the interval of 1 2 or 3 hours each day. I suppose if
               in 4 5 or 6 days your stomach do not feel a different creature, it will be hardly
               worth while holding on.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But shd you not be careful that there be no vinegar brewed all this time? suppose
               the medicine by changing the stomach, changes all the sensations, a stomach-full of
               wind &amp; sourness will change them all back again. I do not know if I can propose any
               means of prevention you have not already practised. But food not acescent in general,
               with super carbonated In ale (or calcined magnesia in case of costiveness) with ginger
               to check any commencement of acid fermentation seem to me to promise.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The second method must be confined to the time of appearance of gouty inflammation
               about the feet. Then I would urge the medicine, taking a glass (2oz) every 4 5 or
               6 minutes till I glowed red hot. I have more expectation from this cutting &amp; spurring
               than the other gentle lashing. Most medical men would recommend the Bath waters, supposing
               them to connect the letters g o u t with the other sufferings</p>
