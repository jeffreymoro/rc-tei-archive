            <p class="indent1">My dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</a> – We have been at Minehead this last week; and I am still apprehensive that it will
               be the boundary of our journey. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

               <p>This is a fine country; it wants only an open sea, but the sight of the opposite shore
                  flattens the prospects, and deprives them of that impressiveness which only immensity
                  can occasion. As we advance, we are promised a very Paradise – woods, rocks, and a
                  boundless sea – a country little known, and where no post-chaise can pass. What with
                  carts and double horses, we shall get on if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> be but better. Let me talk with you about Mango Capac.

                  </div> I wish I could interest you enough in the subject to induce you to undertake it, to
                  look upon it as the business of your leisure hours – a relaxation from more important
                  studies. Hitherto heroic poetry has been confined almost wholly to the triumph of
                  animal courage – this would be the victory of intellect, the ascendency of a strong
                  mind over ignorance; a difficult subject, but which may be made very striking. I have
                  no maps to see the situation of the lake where Mango first appeared,

                  </div> with regard to its vicinity or distance from the sea; of the lake itself I have found
                  a description since my arrival here. It is very large, surrounding many islands; more
                  than ten rivers of some magnitude flow into it; its waters discharge themselves through
                  one channel, narrow and fathomless, unbridgeable from its depth, unpassable from its
                  whirlpools: the Indians therefore floated a bridge over it, a net-work of twigs and
                  reeds, fastened at either shore and buoyant upon the water. The people who inhabit
                  the islands are a singular race – they say themselves they are not men, but something
                  different from men, and I suppose superior, but this Acosta

                  the lake at pleasure. On the shores of the lake, Mango and his sister first appeared.
                  I have given you a description, at length, of the place; it is very favourable for
                  landscape poetry: if you admit the agency of higher beings than man into the poem,
                  the legislators of Peru may as well be born there as anywhere else; if you do not,
                  they must come from some country advanced in the intellectual progress. China is the
                  nearest. I should, however, prefer Persia and make them the children of one who adhered
                  to the religion of Zoroaster when Mahometan intolerance had nearly extirpated it.

                  </div> There is a fine ground-work of poetry in the circumstance of a brother and sister
                  marrying in the intimate union of feelings, opinions, and plans, which rendered them
                  the only possible partners of each other. If you should think of this seriously, and
                  undertake it, I will send you such circumstances respecting the country and its inhabitants
                  as have fallen in my way in the course of my necessary reading; some things there
                  are which would graft into the story.</p>

               <p>If we were near enough to admit of daily intercourse, I should like to undertake the
                  poem with you, because two people, if my opinion be not ill-founded, would necessarily
                  write a better poem than one, their powers of poetry being granted and their similarity
                  of opinion; the story should be the work of both, each take separate parts, each correct
                  the other’s and add to it whatever ideas occurred to him. When their styles had amalgamated,
                  the work would have double the merit of the single production of either. It is singular
                  that this should only have been done by Beaumont and Fletcher.
