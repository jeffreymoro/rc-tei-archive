            <p class="indent1">The news in your letter has vexed me – &amp; after my manner set me upon discovering all
               the consolations that can be extracted from it. first &amp; foremost that if you go as
               convoy you will not be stationed there. &amp; therefore to sail at this season into warm
               weather is no such bad thing. If you go to Jamaica you will find a whole lot of letters.
               unless they have been burnt at the post office. As you will keep a keen look out for
               all describable things I need give you only one commission – which is that you do
               use your best endeavour to bring home a few live land crabs for me, that I may endeavour
               to rear a breed in England.</p>

                  of any who may wait upon you, if they be at all intelligent concerning their own country,
                  principally what their superstitions are – as whom do they worship? do they ever see
                  apparitions? where do the dead go? what are their burial – their birth – their marriage
                  ceremonies. – what their charms or remedies for sickness. What the power of their
                  priests, &amp; how the priests are chosen, whether from among the people, or if a seperate
                  breed as the Levites &amp; Bramins.

                  </div> You will easily see with what other questions these might be followed up, &amp; by noting
                  down the country of the negro with what information he gave, it seems to me very likely
                  that a very valuable account of their manners &amp; feelings might be collected. Ask also
                  if they know any thing of Timbuctoo, the city which is sought after with so much curiosity,
                  as being the centre of the internal commerce of Africa. This is the way to collect
                  facts respecting the Native Africans &amp; their country – I would engage in twelve months
                  were I in the West Indies to get materials for a volume that should contain more real
                  importancies than all travellers have yet brought home. Ask also what beasts are in
                  their country. they will not know English names for them but can describe them so
                  that you will know them – the Unicorn is believed to exist by me as well as by many
                  others – you will not mistake [MS obscured] the Rhinoceros for one. enquire also for
                  a land crocodile who grows to the length of six eight or ten feet – having a tongue
                  slit like a snakes. my Portugueze speak of such animals in South Africa – they may

                  them. – &amp; what surprizes me more the same knowledge of soundings in our own seas in
                  1400 as at present – which is very strange, for that practice implies a long series
                  of registered experiences. The more I read the more do I find the necessity of going
                  to old authors for information, &amp; the sad ignorance &amp; dishonesty of our boasted historians.
                  If God do but give me life &amp; health &amp; eyesight I will show how history should be written
