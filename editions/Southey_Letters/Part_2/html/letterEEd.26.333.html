                  </div> the Greek metre in which you have translated it is certainly the best that could be
                  chosen but perhaps the most difficult; as the accent should flow so easily that a
                  bad reader may not be able to spoil them. this is the case with your 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; 5<sup>th</sup> lines. an old woman cannot read them out of the proper cadence. indeed this is correct
                  enough in the whole ode except in the word changed which is too commonly made two
                  syllables to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">be</span> stand <span style="text-decoration: line-through">at the</span> in an Anacreontic as one.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I think this metre much improved to an English ear by sometimes ending a line with
                  a long syllable instead of a trochee. this you will see regularly done in the following
                  translation from the Spanish of Villegas.

               he has additional means of supporting himself. the languages <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> which I learnt almost as an amusement have considerably contributed, &amp; still in some
