            <p class="indent1">I cannot argue against toleration. yet is Popery in its nature so very damnable &amp;
               destructive a system that I could not give a vote for its sufferance in England. I
               could no more permit the existence of a monastic establishment, than the human sacrifices
               of Mexican idolatry. you say forbid their endowment – but the great pillars of monkery
               are those orders that cannot be endowed – the whole family of Franciscans. you say
               they are bound by no law &amp; may come out of their convents. but they are bound by their
               own law – by vows blasphemous to Almighty God, &amp; treasonable to human nature &amp; civil
               society. Of all Catholics the Irish are the most bigotted &amp; bloody. <span class="ital">here</span> we know them. there is danger from the increase of Popery – your higher classes –
               your middle class are turning infidels – true. but look at the great body of the poor
               – with what a hunger &amp; thirst for the marvellous they swallow every new dose of superstition.
               observe the growth of methodism – perhaps more nearly connected with popery than is
               generally imagined. I have reason to believe they have arrived at <span class="ital">confession</span> already. All I would prohibit should be the monastic institutions. educate their
               priests in England. tolerate the counter-poisons of Deism &amp; Atheism – the great antidotes.
               these caustics are rooting out the cancer here &amp; in Spain. they will indeed make a
               sore wound – but not a deadly one.</p>

                  knowledge of the greater part of the Kingdom. the northern provinces are yet unvisited.
                  I wish much to remain another year – it would so compleatly suit my inclinations –

                  an English winter, &amp; the worse blasts of an English spring. my stay may be from 4
                  to 6 weeks longer. sooner I cannot well depart – nor for the heats remain later –

                  from the greater employment would render it a bad speculation. for the same reason
                  it will be more advantageous to wait for the slow profits of the great work than again
                  to engage in reviewing – or write rhymes for the Morning Post. these are things for
