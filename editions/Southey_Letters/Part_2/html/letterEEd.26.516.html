                  &amp; short. five days &amp; a half brought us to our port; with light winds the whole of

                  </div> was bearing down upon us, with English colours indeed, but apparently a French vessel.
                  we made a signal which was not answered, we fired a gun, she did the same, &amp; preparations
                  were made for action. We had another Lisbon packet in company, mounting six guns –
                  our own force was ten, the Cutter was a match &amp; more for both, but we did not expect
                  to be taken. – you may imagine <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> terror, awakened on a sick bed – disturbed, I should have said, with these tidings!
                  the Captain advised me to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">cov</span> surround her with mattrasses in the cabin, but she would not believe herself in safety
                  there; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> I lodged her in the cockpit &amp; took my station on the quarter deck with a musket. –
                  how I felt I can hardly tell – the hurry of the scene – the sight of grape shot –
                  bar shot &amp; the other ingenious implements of this sort – the novelty of my fighting
                  – made an undistinguishable mixture of feelings. I was going to fight without any
                  one motive but that of taking my share in the business. my cloaths were of no adequate
                  value to the risk – &amp; they were insured; &amp; if I had had the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">power</span> choice I certainly should far rather have entered Coruña as a prisoner than have proceeded
                  to Lisbon – because four hundred miles land travelling would have been infinitely
                  pleasanter than the continued voyage. the Cutter bore down between us – I saw the
                  smoke from her matches we<span style="text-decoration: line-through">r</span> were so near – &amp; not a man on board had the least idea but than an immediate action
                  was to take place. We hailed her – she answered in broken English &amp; passed on. “tis
                  over! cried somebody. not yet – said the Captain – &amp; we expected she was coming round
                  us or about to attack our comrade vessel. She was English however, manned chiefly
                  from Guernsey, &amp; this explained her frenchified language. you will easily imagine
                  that my sensations at thus ending the business were very definable – one honest simple
                  joy – that I was in a whole skin! I laid the musket in the chest with considerably
                  more pleasure than when I took it out. I am glad this took place – it has shown me
                  what it is to prepare for action.</p>

                  I go in this country he may go with me. It even amused me to renew my acquaintance
                  with the fleas, who opened the campaign immediately on the arrival of a foreigner.
                  We landed yesterday, about ten in the morning, &amp; took possession of our house the
                  same night. our house is very small &amp; thoroughly Portuguese, little rooms all doors
                  &amp; windows, odd but well calculated for coolness. from one window we have a most magnificent
                  view over the river, Almada Hill, &amp; the opposite shores of Alentejo, bounded by hills
                  about the half-mountain height of Malvern –. the bed room is of a good size. in this
                  climate seperate beds are necessary. I did not know this till I saw two prepared.
                  – to day is a busy day – we are arranging away our things – &amp; seeing visitors. these
                  visits must all be returned – then ends the ceremony – &amp; then I may chuse retirement.
                  I hurry over my letters for the sake of feeling leisure to begin my employments. the
                  voyage by depriving me of all rest &amp; leaving me too giddy to sleep well, will with
                  the help of the fleas break me in well for early rising. the work before me is almost
                  of terrifying labour. folio after folio to be gutted – &amp; the immense mass of collateral
                  knowledge which is indispensable. but I have leisure, &amp; inclination – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> who has been looking half her time out of window, has just seen – “really a decent

                  in an English winter. but the most ridiculous thing is a substitute for a close-stool
                  up in the garret – it is so high that I am obliged to sit like a boy just breeched
