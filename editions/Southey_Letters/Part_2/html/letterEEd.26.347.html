               <p>I thank you for your remarks on the Eclogue,

                  </div> &amp; shall profit by them. I am partial to “There was” because it is a nursery tale beginning,
                  but in this case it will be better to preserve a dramatic form throughout. the traveller
                  shall be made modern in his taste – but whether it be well to have any thing like
                  discovery in these short pieces I am doubtful. The following eclogue does not please
                  me so much as the first, but it is seditious &amp; true to nature. it wants something.
                  I had introduced &lt;it&gt; by some descriptive lines but they were useless &amp; now it seems
                  to want description. again I have a traveller, &amp; as I am afraid I shall want another
                  of these peripatetics, this is a reason for making the first the owner of the mansion.</p>

               <div class="l">A wedding Sir, −</div>
               <div class="l">Two of the village folk; &amp; they are right</div>
               <div class="l">To make a merry time o’nt while they may;</div>
               <div class="l">Come twelvemonths hence I warrant them they’d go</div>

               <div class="l">Woman</div>
               <div class="l">No – both are young enough.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">Perhaps the man</div>
               <div class="l">Is idle then, &amp; one who better likes</div>
               <div class="l">The alehouse than his work.</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">Why Sir for that –</div>
               <div class="l">He always was a well-conditioned lad,</div>
               <div class="l">One who’d work hard &amp; well, &amp; as for drink,</div>
               <div class="l">Save now &amp; then mayhap at Xmas time,</div>
               <div class="l">Sober as wife could wish.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">Then is the girl</div>
               <div class="l">A shrew, or else untidy; one who’d welcome</div>
               <div class="l">Her husband with a most unruly tongue,</div>
               <div class="l">Or drive him from a foul &amp; wretched home</div>
               <div class="l">To look elsewhere for comfort. is it so?</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">She’s notable enough; &amp; as for temper</div>
               <div class="l">The best good-humourd girl! – dye see that house</div>
               <div class="l">There by the willow trees whose grey leaves shine</div>
               <div class="l">In the wind? She lives a servant at the farm;</div>
               <div class="l">And often as I came to weeding here</div>
               <div class="l">I’ve heard her singing as she milkd her cows</div>
               <div class="l">So chearfully, – I did not like to hear her,</div>
               <div class="l">Because it made me think upon the time</div>
               <div class="l">When I had got as little on my mind</div>
               <div class="l">And was as chearful too. – but she would marry</div>
               <div class="l">And folks must reap as they have sowd. God help her!</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">Why Mistress. if they both are well inclin’d</div>
               <div class="l">Why should not both be happy?</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">They’ve no money.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">But both can work, &amp; sure as chearfully</div>
               <div class="l">She’d labour for herself as at the farm.</div>
               <div class="l">And he won’t work the worse because he knows</div>
               <div class="l">That she will make his fireside ready for him</div>
               <div class="l">And watch for his return.</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">All very well.</div>
               <div class="l">A little while.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">And what if they are poor</div>
               <div class="l">Riches can’t always purchase happiness,</div>
               <div class="l">And much we know will be expected there,</div>
               <div class="l">Where much was given.</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">All this I’ve heard at church</div>
               <div class="l">And when I walk in the churchyard or have been</div>
               <div class="l">By a death-bed, tis mighty comforting.</div>
               <div class="l">But when I hear my children cry for hunger</div>
               <div class="l">And see them shiver in their rags – God help me!</div>
               <div class="l">I pity those for whom these bells ring up</div>
               <div class="l">So merrily upon their wedding day,</div>
               <div class="l">Because I think of mine.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">You have known <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxxx</span> trouble,</div>
               <div class="l">These haply may be happier.</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">Why for that</div>
               <div class="l">I’ve had my share, some sickness &amp; some sorrow,</div>
               <div class="l">Well will it be for these to know no worse.</div>
               <div class="l">Yet would I rather hear a daughters knell</div>
               <div class="l">Than her wedding peal Sir, if I thought her fate</div>
               <div class="l">Promised no better things.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">Sure sure good woman</div>
               <div class="l">You look upon the world with jaundiced eyes.</div>
               <div class="l">All have their cares, they who are poor want wealth</div>
               <div class="l">They who have wealth want more; so are we all</div>
               <div class="l">Dissatisfied, yet all live on, &amp; each</div>
               <div class="l">Has his own comforts.</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">Sir d’ye see that horse</div>
               <div class="l">Turnd out to common here by the wayside?</div>
               <div class="l">He’s high in bone, you may tell every rib</div>
               <div class="l">Even at this distance. mind him – how he turns</div>
               <div class="l">His head to drive away the flies that feed</div>
               <div class="l">On his galld shoulder! – theres just grass enough</div>
               <div class="l">To disappoint his whetted appetite.</div>
               <div class="l">You see his comforts Sir!</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>
               <div class="l">A wretched beast!</div>
               <div class="l">Hard labour &amp; worse usage he endures</div>
               <div class="l">From a bad master, but the lot of the poor</div>
               <div class="l">Is not like his.</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">In truth it is not Sir!</div>
               <div class="l">For when the horse lies down at night, no cares</div>
               <div class="l">About tomorrow vex him in his dreams.</div>
               <div class="l">He knows no quarter day, &amp; when he gets</div>
               <div class="l">Some musty hay, or patch of hedge row grass</div>
               <div class="l">He has no hungry children to claim part</div>
               <div class="l">Of the half meal.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller</div>
               <div class="l">Tis idleness makes want,</div>
               <div class="l">And idle habits. if the man will go</div>
               <div class="l">And spend his wages by the alehouse fire</div>
               <div class="l">Whom can he blame if there is want at home?</div>
               <div class="l">Woman.</div>
               <div class="l">Aye – idleness! the rich folks never fail</div>
               <div class="l">To find some reason why the poor deserve</div>
               <div class="l">Their sufferings. is it idleness I pray you</div>
               <div class="l">That brings the fever or the ague fit?</div>
               <div class="l">Is it idleness that makes small wages fail</div>
               <div class="l">For pressing wants? tis six years since these bells</div>
               <div class="l">Rung on my wedding day, &amp; I was told</div>
               <div class="l">What I might look for, – but I did not heed</div>
               <div class="l">Good counsel. I had lived in service Sir,</div>
               <div class="l">Knew never what it was to want a meal,</div>
               <div class="l">Laid down without one thought to keep me sleepless</div>
               <div class="l">Or trouble me in sleep, had for a Sunday</div>
               <div class="l">My linen gown, &amp; when the pedlar came</div>
               <div class="l">Could buy me a new ribbon. &amp; my husband</div>
               <div class="l">A towardly young man &amp; well to do,</div>
               <div class="l">He had his silver buckles &amp; his watch,</div>
               <div class="l">There was not in the village one who lookd</div>
               <div class="l">Sprucer on holydays. we married Sir</div>
               <div class="l">And we had children, but as wants increasd</div>
               <div class="l">Wages did not. the silver buckles went,</div>
               <div class="l">So went the watch, &amp; when the holyday coat</div>
               <div class="l">Was worn to work, no new one in its place.</div>
               <div class="l">For me – you see my rags! – but I deserve them,</div>
               <div class="l">For wilfully – like this new married pair.</div>
               <div class="l">I went to my undoing.</div>
               <div class="l">Traveller.</div>

               <div class="l">And – God forgive me! – but I often wish</div>

               <div class="l">How hard it is after a long days work</div>
               <div class="l">To come to such a wretched home as this,</div>
