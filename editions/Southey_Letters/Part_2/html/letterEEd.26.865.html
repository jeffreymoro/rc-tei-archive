            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I wrote to you on Thursday concerning <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">my wretched brother Edward</a>. perhaps you may &lt;have&gt; thought my conduct somewhat rigorous, but it proceeded from
               a deep-founded knowledge &amp; feeling of his character. this evening another draft has
               arrived for three pounds, from a gunsmith – &amp; the boy himself writes to say that he
               has drawn these bills – as I cannot suppose his situation can be free from expence
               – &amp; he encloses his taylors bill also to show – he says that he has not been extravagant.
               this bill is £11-16-3 ½. When I tell you that this boy is not yet fifteen you will
               feel shocked at so early an instance of shamelessness.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There is but one course that I can pursue. if you should – or if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> should procure a ship, I will beg &lt;you&gt; to calculate the expence of his journey to
                  join it, &amp; remit it him with two pounds more for his washing, &amp; if he continues on
                  board I will from time to time supply him, always sparingly, for he is not to be trusted.
                  From the embarrasments which he has thus wickedly contracted he must get out how he
                  can. The gentleman

                  </div> at whose house he is must be something to blame in having sufferd it – what can he
                  have gone in debt with a gun-smith for – unless which is very probable he has bought
                  a fowling piece &amp; taken out a licence to shoot! he tells me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<sup>rs</sup> Tyler</a> has borrowed ten guineas of this M<sup>r</sup> Barham. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> I am sure shuts his eyes to that womans conduct. to her utter meaness &amp; dishonesty.
                  I have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my poor Mothers</a> example to warn me. she literally was, as she knew she was, destroyed by the perpetual
                  fret &amp; fever in which her sister kept her, by perpetually extorting from her what
                  money she got, guinea by guinea as it came in, in consequence of which her own debts
                  were daily accumulating – for else she would have had none. With her eyes broad open, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my poor Mother</a> always yielded to her, wrote begging letters in her own name – or rather copied them
                  – that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<sup>rs</sup> Tyler</a> might have the money – she even twice attempted to raise money in my name from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">poor Thomas</a> – &amp; from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> whom she had never seen. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</a> was always the cats-paw, &amp; still continued to be so in spite of every effort I could
                  make, tho whenever she spoke of it it was with the bitterest tears – tho it kept her
                  sleepless at night &amp; induced those dreadful sweats of mental suffering which God forbid
                  you should ever know but by report, tho it wore away her very vitals &amp; actually brought
                  her to the grave. She scarcely ever mentioned <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> name without tears – to think that she was always made the conduit thro which his
                  money was to be draind. What must he think of me – she would say – &amp; God knows it
                  is never for myself. – Oh Christ! it is not a letter that can tell you the infamy
                  I have known – &amp; the affliction that I have endured, – nor how that woman has pilfered
                  from me at the very time that she has been calumniating &amp; insulting me. When that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">poor Cousin of mine </a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">died</span> &lt;was dying&gt; – of all my relations the only one who had any affinity of heart or intellect
                  with me – she had no support but from me. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<sup>rs</sup> Tyler</a> had quarrelled with her, but she used to send to get her money from her, when she
                  had no strength to withold it, guinea by guinea &amp; when to prevent this I sent smaller
                  sums – shilling by shilling – &amp; almost in the very hour of her death – which was attended
                  with agonies that make me shiver whenever I recollect them – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">this wretched Edward</a> was sent to plunder her &amp; actually abusd &amp; <span class="ital">cursed</span> her for attempting to withold the few shillings which she had in her power. I learnt
                  this from Danvers who God bless him! is the friend of all who want a friend &amp; has
                  as excellent a heart as God ever made to show me what a human heart can be. When in
                  the newspaper her death was mentioned she was particularized as niece to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<sup>rs</sup> Tyler</a> – the woman wrote a paragraph to contradict it which the Printer would not insert
                  knowing it to be a lie, – &amp; among all her friends declared that this <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillMargaret">Peggy</a> had past for her niece there was great reason &lt;to think&gt; she was a Bastard. – If this
                  be madness, it is of so wicked &amp; truly devilish a nature that it actually looks like
                  possession.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">This has led me astray. my resolution is never to embarrass myself where there is
               not a manifest &amp; commanding duty. for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> I must do what I can – or rather what you enable me to do – because it is furthering
               him &amp; indispensable to his welfare in life. but should he show himself incorrigibly
               prodigal I will wash my hands of him. so with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> I will &lt;not&gt; toil &amp; fret away the powers which God has given me for better purposes.
               to support the extravagancies of any unprincipled profligate tho he were tenfold my
               brother. If he chuses so to act as that either he or I must suffer it shall be himself.
               I will not be victim of any mans ill-conduct. you I am sure will be satisfied that
               I have done right in protesting his drafts &amp; refusing to pay his bills.</p>
