               <p>We have of late been very uneasy respecting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> in the Mars. The gazette relieved us by making honourable mention of him, &amp; luckily
                  we knew nothing of his wounds, till his own letter informed us last night.

                  </div> His escape has been almost miraculous – he was by the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodAlexanderCaptain">Captain</a> when the Boatswain

                  as he imagined only wanting a leader. he cried out will you follow me? they answered
                  yes by G– Sir to Hell! <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> got upon the anchor &amp; from thence on board the Hercules – he had just made his landing
                  good whence he received a thrust from a pike in his right thigh, &amp; immediately a second,
                  which made him loose his hold &amp; he fell <span style="text-decoration: line-through">beneat</span> between the two ships. as he was falling they made a third thrust at his back. the
                  pike glanced from his shoulder blade so as to pass twice thro <span style="text-decoration: line-through">all</span> his cloaths &amp; take out a small piece of flesh. providentially as he fell he caught
                  hold of a rope hanging from the anchor, hung by it &amp; got upon his own deck. he then
                  clapt his hand to the wounds on his thigh, &amp; felt them bleeding profusely, the blood<span style="text-decoration: line-through">y</span> running down his leg. he was fearful lest he should faint with loss of blood &amp; be
                  thrown overboard, &amp; so made his way to the cock pit. his letter is written in high
                  spirits – but the horrible scene he witnessed, particularly in the cock pit – has
                  strongly impressed him. we expect him home. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoodAlexanderViscount">Ld Bridport</a> sent him word that he would not forget him.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I have always I trust been sensible of the folly &amp; wickedness of these war systems
               – &amp; yet methinks I feel it somewhat more strongly now. here are ninety men killed
