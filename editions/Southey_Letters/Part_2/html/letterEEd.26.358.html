               <div class="salute">My dear friend</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am making enquiries for some school suitable for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>. a fellow collegian of mine was usher at a school in Devonshire, at Kingsbridge.
               to him I shall write &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">mark</span> learn particulars. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</a> is in orders himself, a good scholar, indeed there were few equal to him at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</a>, &amp; a man of more faultless character I never knew. I think from his attachment to
               me, if he still be at Kingsbridge that he would pay more than common attention to
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</a>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the meantime it is necessary to remove <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>, as at present he is an incumbrance to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Har</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a>. will you be good enough to house him for one night? it is not without something
               like reluctance that I ask this, willingly as you will do it. but he is too young
               to shift for himself. With one nights rest he will be fit for another journey. he
               had better travel by night, on account of the time for beginning &amp; ending his journey;
               &amp; in the coach that goes from the Saracens Head, Snow Hill, or the Bolt-in-Tun. Fleet
               Street.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Since my return I have been very much troubled with a return of my indisposition.
               I can account for it by two days inactivity during the wet weather, but it is a sad
               thing to be affected by not taking exercise for two days &amp; those not successive ones.
               so now be the weather what it will I walk. this destroys much time &amp; much comfort.
               my head indeed is not idle. I pursue my plans, view my purposed subjects in every
               different light, &amp; mature them in these walks. but all this does not make it the more
               agreable to get wet thro.</p>

               <p>The story of the Pythoness stolen away by a young Thessalian,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           for her prophecies, uttered under the influence of vapours rising from the earth.
                           The priestess was originally always a young virgin, but after Echecrates the Thessalian
                           kidnapped and raped the incumbent, the priestess was always chosen from among old
                           women.</span></div>
                  </div> strikes me as the best adapted for scenic representation, by the pageantry it allows,
                  &amp; by its capability of dramatic effect. I have not access to Diodorus Siculus,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                  </div> the author who relates the fact, &amp; in whom possibly names &amp; dates might be found.
                  as yet the vague outline only of a few characters &amp; scenes is present to my mind,
                  &amp; for the story I have no plan. perhaps I must connect some historical event with
                  it. for instance the irruption of the Gauls under Brennus;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Chieftain of a group of Gauls who invaded Greece in 279 BC. They were defeated at
                           Delphi and Brennus committed suicide.</span></div>
                  </div> – at present the idea is fermenting in my head. I see something fine in the scenery
                  – Parnassus – the Temple – the adytum. &amp; something <span style="text-decoration: line-through">to</span> dramatic in the Pythoness <span class="ital">then</span> a young woman, exposed to a maddening vapour by the villainy of the Priests, &amp; probably
                  believing herself chosen by Apollo to the distinguishd suffering. then the Thessalians
                  superstitious horror – like a traveller on the hill top in a fog I know there must
                  be a fine prospect, but cannot see it yet. however let the subject please me ever
                  so much, I will adhere to my intention of making six skeletons before I dress up one
                  &amp; breathe life into it. the drama would not be my choice. it is not my own ground,
                  but I think I can stand upon it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have begun the ninth book of Madoc,
