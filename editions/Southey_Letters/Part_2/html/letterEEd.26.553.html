                  my arrival in Portugal. I have had enough unpleasant intelligence. My acquaintance

                           wood brings forth – and the season of spring comes on. So of men one generation springs

                  saw the white palace chimneys for the last time, there was time enough in a four hours’
                  ride to remember and regret what I had left. The mosquitoes treated me like a stranger
                  on my return: they found out a hole in the net. I rose in the night, and killed nine
                  who had entered the breach, which I also closed; but my hands, arms, face, and neck,
                  bear the marks of the assault. It was not till we arrived in Lisbon that I was sensible
                  of the astonishing difference between the city and <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> in climate. These people do nothing to correct their country: everywhere some tree
                  or other will grow. The olive, the chestnut, the pine, require not a moist soil, the

                  reached us. Strange as it must appear, we are not yet certain what the disease is.
                  A stupid indifference prevails respecting our danger, which is imminent; and people
                  speak of it as a slight disorder, which it is not worth while to avoid by leaving
                  Lisbon, if it comes, – as a fever curable by the slightest medicines, – when every
                  post brings worse and worse tidings of its ravages. At Cadiz it has ceased, but only
                  because its work was done. The fire went out for want of fuel; 4000 only escaped contagion,
                  8000 died, the remainder fled or recovered. Yesterday’s news from Seville stated the

                  of eminence, who will, for a hundred guineas, board and instruct him for four or five
                  years, that is, till he is old enough, after a year’s London study, to practise for
                  himself. For the first time in my life I have the power – at least it appears so –
                  of raising this sum. My metrical romance goes by the “King George” to market,

                  </div> and I ask this sum as the price of a first edition. I have little doubt of obtaining
                  it. I had designed to furnish a house with this money, and anchor myself; but this
                  is a more important call. When the bargain is concluded, I shall desire <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> to lodge the price with you. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> will thus be settled till he is launched into the world, and will then have a profession
                  to support him, – a useful and honourable profession, which will always secure him
                  bread and independence. Norwich obviously offers itself as the most desirable place
                  in which to settle him, where he has all his acquaintances and friends. There <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W. Taylor</a> will look out for a situation – if indeed he has not one already in view. Otherwise
                  Bristol would be thought of, and there I shall cause inquiries to be made. It will
                  greatly rejoice me to have this affair accomplished to my wish. In the last few months <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry’s</a> mind appears to have grown rapidly, and he is perhaps more awake to the future at
                  seventeen, than I am at seven and twenty. You remember the old doggerel, that “Learning
                  is better than house or land.” ‘Tis a lying proverb! A good life-hold estate is worth
                  all the fame of the world in perpetuity, and a comfortable house rather more desirable
                  than a monument in Westminster Abbey.</p>
