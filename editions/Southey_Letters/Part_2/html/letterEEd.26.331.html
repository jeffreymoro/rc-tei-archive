               been waiting for a new direction, &amp; many employments have kept me silent. It was not
               till the Thursday evening preceding quarter day that a house was found at all suitable
               for us, &amp; you can hardly conceive in what perpetual occupation I have been since we
               took possession. pulling down &amp; putting up; - upholsterer – carpenter – mason – painter
               – paperer in succession, till of a filthy old barn looking house we have made a clean
               &amp; comfortable dwelling. It is at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</a>, a village two miles from Bristol, in the pleasantest part of this country. there
               is a tolerable garden behind the house, in which excepting some half dozen rose bushes,
               every thing is calculated for use. the view over the garden is very beautiful, a fertile
               &amp; woody vale, bounded on each side by hills, &amp; terminated by a range of hills ten
               miles distant. the most interesting parts of the country are near at hand, &amp; ten minutes
               walk would convey me to one of the most beautiful glens I ever saw.</p>
