                  for me from Lisbon. two of the oldest &amp; rarest chronicles − the best book upon Abyssinia

               but I am weary of vagabonding about − &amp; have now a pressing motive for settling. Nor

               I could ride a broomstick. About the where of my abiding place there is little hesitation.
               Bristol has not enough society. for that Norwich is the best place − but the neighbourhood
               of London allows a readier intercourse <span style="text-decoration: line-through">of</span> with booksellers − &amp; in ceasing to be a Secretary I must become a Scribbler. My stay
