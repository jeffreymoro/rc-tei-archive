            <p>Dear Coleridge,</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The map of Ireland is a beautiful map – mountains, and lakes, and rivers; which I
                  hope one day to visit with you. St. Patrick’s Purgatory

                           poem, ‘St Patrick’s Purgatory’, appeared in the Morning Post, 8 May 1798. The Giant’s
                           Causeway is further east, on the Antrim coast.</span></div>
                  </div> and the Giant’s Causeway lie in the same corner. Where ‘Mole, that mountain hoar,’
                  is, I cannot find, though I have hunted the name in every distortion of possible orthography.

                           It is not surprising that Southey could not locate this mountain as the name ‘Mole’
                           was an invention of Spenser’s to describe the Ballyhoura and Galty Hills near his
                           home in county Cork.</span></div>
                  </div> A journey in Ireland has, also, the great advantage of enabling us to study savage
                  life. I shall be able to get letters of introduction, which, as draughts for food
                  and shelter in a country where whiskey-houses are scarce, will be invaluable. This

                           Fleetwood (1805), but Southey is referring to Godwin’s Faulkener, a Tragedy in Prose

                  the attentions of the great: a worse fault is that vice of metaphysicians – that habit
                  of translating right and wrong into a jargon which confounds them; which allows everything,
                  and justifies everything. I am afraid, and it makes me very melancholy when I think
                  of it, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</a> never will be to me the being that he has been. I have a trick of thinking too well
                  of those I love, better than they generally deserve, and better than my cold and containing
                  manners ever let them know: the foibles of a friend always endear him, if they have
                  coexisted with my knowledge of him; but the pain is, to see beauty grow deformed –
                  to trace disease from the first infection. These scientific men are indeed, the victims
                  of science; they sacrifice to it their own feelings, and virtues, and happiness.</p>
