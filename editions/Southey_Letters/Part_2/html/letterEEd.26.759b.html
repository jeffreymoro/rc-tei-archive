                  – and as critics say of that epistle, recently translated, very well done. It is worthless
                  labour, a flocci-nauci-nihili-pili-fication! If you are going to translate, take something
                  not done before, something from the <em>Silvae</em> of Statius,

                  forth good meat. He loses the odour and taste in the digestion. Even if your genius
