            <p class="indent1">I cannot plead the multiplicity of employments, or the time occupied in surveying
               new scenery &amp; mingling with new acquaintance as a reason for not earlier announcing
               my arrival at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</a>. I found <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> confined to his great armed chair by the sciatica; which had proceeded from the lumbago
               &amp; was, &amp; indeed is, expected to go off in an acute rheumatism. this therefore has
               precluded all visiting, &amp; in a country so flat as this I have found few inducements
               to ramble without the society of the friend who would have guided me to every interesting
               spot.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On Friday &amp; Saturday <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a> was with us – a young man of fortune, much diffidence, much genius &amp; very uncommon
                  acquirements. he it was who translated the Lenora of Burger in the M Magazine.

                  </div> I have been exceedingly pleased with him, &amp; that as much from what I have heard of
                  his domestic virtues as from the personal proofs I received of his taste &amp; talents.

            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a>, I hear from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, has written to me since I left Bath, &amp; his account of his own health is an alarming
               one. the oppression on his chest continues. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> is, as you may imagine, very anxious that he should try the effect of English air.
               I am uneasy respecting him, &amp; earnestly wish he were here.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The accounts I receive of my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> are of a more promising nature. I believe I told you that there was reason to hope
               he was getting into the good graces of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">my fathers eldest brother</a>. he is now with him, &amp; the old gentleman (if I may so call a man of 55) has clothed
               him, &amp; said that he shall no longer trouble his mother for money whilst he wants more
               than his pay.</p>
            <p class="indent1">There are as many peculiarities almost in this part of England as tho I were in a
               foreign country. the town consists of three or four long streets that run parallel
               with each other, these are intersected by numberless narrow Rows, as they are called.
               &lt;to the number of 150,&gt; &amp; the carts here are constructed to go thro these Rows, so
               that the wheels are placed under the body. they only half bake their bread, because
               they say it would not be heavy enough if they baked it more. puddings are eat with
               every thing almost to the exclusion of vegetables. the butter is all very bad, &amp; sold
               by the pint. the coast is hideously flat – &amp; the effect of a sea view totally destroyed
               by the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">multit</span> number of vessels perpetually anchoring in the roads: these deprive you of the idea
               of immensity, &amp; the shore is so flat as to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">exhibit</span> make the sea (when I have seen it) quiet almost like a lake – there are no waves
               – no repetition of that eternal roar which elsewhere makes it so delightful to lie
               down upon the beach &amp; listen to the sound.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On the other hand the vast flat gives to the land view, a kind of ocean immensity;
                  the same circular distance, the same bending down of the horizon. When we are at M<sup>r</sup> Mannings I shall have opportunities of catching the minuter characteristics of the
                  scenery, which it is my intention to delineate in blank verse.

                  </div> you know I love descriptive poetry, tis a species that blends with the domestic feelings,

               somewhat lower than they should do when I am away, a long absence is not calculated
