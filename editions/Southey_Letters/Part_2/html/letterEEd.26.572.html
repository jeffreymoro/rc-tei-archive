                  of grapes, has tempted me either to industry or idleness. I return rich in materials:
                  a twelvemonth’s work in England will produce a first volume of my History, and also

                  the easy business of hunting out everything to be seen has taken up no small portion

                  and go home to digest. In May we return; and, on my part, with much reluctance. I
                  have formed local attachments and not personal ones: this glorious river, with its
                  mountain boundaries, this blessed winter sun, and the summer paradise of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a>. I would gladly live and die here. My health is amended materially, but I have seizures
                  enough to assure me that our own unkindly climate will blight me, as it does the myrtle

                  through a starved country? On the other hand, this country may turn round, may join
                  the coalition, seize on English property, and bid us all decamp; this was apprehended;
                  and what dependence can be placed upon utter imbecility? Were it not for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, I would fairly see it out, and witness the whole boderation. There is a worse than

                  for Portugal, – this conquest which would excite good feelings against innovation;
                  if there was peace, the business would probably be done at home. England is now the
                  bedarkening power; she is in politics, what Spain was to religion at the Reformation.
                  Change here involves the loss of their colonies; and an English fleet would cut off

                  accelerate revolution, because the begging friars, mostly young, are mostly discontented,
                  and the rich friars everywhere objects of envy. I have heard the people complain of
                  monastic oppression, and distinguish between the friars and the religion they profess.
                  I even fear, so generally is that distinction made, that popery may exist when monkery

                  than usual prudence, left her in it; it is understood that this country may make her
                  own terms, and submit to France without incurring the resentment of England. When
                  the Portuguese first entered this happy war, the phrase of their ministers was, that
