            <p class="indent1">I know not why distance by water should occasion neglect of letter-writing more than
               distance by land. but my English correspondents have proved the fact to me – &amp; I in
               my turn, have given you sufficient reason to believe it. We were in Lisbon on May
               day, look at the date above &amp; pardon &amp; absolve him that doth truly repent.</p>
            <p class="indent1">First of my health, the immediate object of this emigration. The effect of climate
               has been what I expected &amp; wished. night seizures I have none. the irregularity of
               my heart is lessened, not removed, I eat voraciously, &amp; above all enjoy an everlasting
               sunshine of spirits. Something of this is assuredly owing to the total change of scenery
               &amp; society, but the climate has been the great cause. In England, summer &amp; winter,
               I sit by the fire, − I have never seen a fire since our departure from Falmouth. the
               society here is <span style="text-decoration: line-through">not</span> rather such as would depress than elevate <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> &lt;the&gt; spirits of a man accustomed to freedom of speech &amp; intellectual intercourse.
               literature here is none, &amp; I am too fond of tranquillity ever to utter a political
               opinion where <span style="text-decoration: line-through">every</span> a true Catholic uniformity of sentiment prevails. I hunger &amp; thirst for the intercourse
               of my friends, &amp; yet feel the climate so sensibly, that if only inclination were to
               be consulted, I should perhaps pitch my tent here, &amp; settle in a country where the
               will of the sovereign is paramount &amp; the Inquisition consummates the church establishment.</p>

               <p>The political situation of Portugal is far more critical than when I last visited
                  it. a foolish treaty with Russia has offended Spain,

                           Spain, which had severed ties with Russia after Paul I (1754–1801; Tsar of Russia
                           1796–1801), though an Orthodox Christian, assumed the title of Grand Master of the

                  to shut us out of the Mediterranean this port will not again be left for the English
                  fleet. we are inclined here to believe Lisbon will be the point aimed at by the Brest
                  fleet: it can make no resistance. the forts are weak, soon silenced, or soon past:
                  the English force very trifling, the city without fortifications. the Spanish forces
                  alone, should the attack be made by land, are equal to the conquest of the country.
                  they are only Spaniards you will say, but they would have only Portugueze for their
                  enemies, &amp; numbers would decide the contest. But it is the fear of Spain for her own
                  tottering government that has preserved this. the revolutionary torrent when let loose
                  will not follow the line of demarcation. The Spaniard is therefore carefull how he
