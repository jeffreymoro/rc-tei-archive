                  </div> – whence after a wearisome delay because the Captain waited for more passengers –
                  I sailed on Sunday last at noon. the wind was favourable – it failed before we were
                  out of the river – we fell down only with the tide, &amp; so dead a calm prevailed all
                  night, that the ship was perfectly still as a house. there was not one heaving on
                  the waters – I never saw the sea so smooth – not a curl – a ripple – a wrinkle. the
                  shores in view, Flint – &amp; Caernarvonshire, &amp; the mountains among which I had so lately
                  been journeying. I quite enjoyed the sunset. All day Monday we tacked &amp; retacked with
                  light &amp; unkind winds to weather Holyhead, but in vain. at evening we stood for Beaumarais
                  Bay, &amp; there lay to, waiting the midnight tide. the wind rose about one in the morning.
                  we were then in the Race of Holyhead, a rough sea, of infamous character. it blew
                  a heavy gale – the vessel shipped much water – it came pouring into the cabin, &amp; our
                  pumps were both at work, thump – thump – a melancholy sound at all times! &amp; with the
                  working of the ship, &amp; the cries of young children, &amp; the roar of the wind &amp; the waves
                  – faith it was an ugly concert. at dawn the wind abated, &amp; we had arrived beyond the
                  race into smoother water. the Sun rose hazily, we were near land, yet could see nothing,
                  &amp; the steersman could only go by guess. in consequence when we were near enough to
                  see the shore, it was found that we were too far North of Dublin bay, &amp; could not
                  possibly reach it that night. the Captain a civil careful man, willingly consented
                  to land at Balbriggen. I never sailed with a better man. he never left the deck during
                  night, &amp; his only drink – on shore or at sea, was buttermilk – or milk. At Balbriggen
                  then we landed – a little fishing &amp; bathing town, fifteen &amp; a half miles from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</a> – Irish miles – for all things all topsy turvy here, of which eleven here equal to
                  fourteen in England. no means of conveyance to the capital – we sent two miles &amp; a
                  half to a single Inn – for five chaises, while we dined. the messenger returned with
                  one coach. in that we shipped the women &amp; children, loaded a car with the luggage,
                  &amp; proceeded with it on foot to the Inn – so after leaving the packet, we slept in
                  the Man of War, so the Inn is called – because its sign is a Saracens head, with a
                  pipe in his mouth. – In my company I was more than usually fortunate. the Wife of
