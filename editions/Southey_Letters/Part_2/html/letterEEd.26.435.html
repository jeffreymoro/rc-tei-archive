                  of 1796 we were so far reconciled as to resume the common intercourse of acquaintance.
                  Something was owing to the interference of common friends, more to our connection
                  by marriage, &amp; probably what most influenced me was that habit of mind which induces
                  us rather to remember the good qualities of a lost friend than his faults, &amp; to select
                  for remembrance<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> chiefly what is pleasurable to recollect. With similar pursuits &amp; similar opinions

            <p class="indent1">You have proposed a great question requesting the doctrine of rewards &amp; punishment;
               that man, the creature of hopes &amp; fears should be worked on by hope &amp; fear religiously
               applied seems wisely adapted to our imperfect generation. but the fact is, as it appears
               to me, that men are very little influenced by them, that the present absorbs us, the
               wicked acting from the strong impulse of the moment − &amp; the good likewise; both for
               the immediate gratification derived from the act, according as their habitual feelings
               are gratified by actions good or evil. the doctrine seems inefficacious. &amp; for the
               picture it holds out of a future existence it is only by an allegorical interpretation
               that a thinking mind can understand it by substituting remedy for punishment.</p>
