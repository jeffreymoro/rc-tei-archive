            <p class="indent1">God be thanked my stay in this hateful town is well nigh at an end. At three o clock
               – that is within the next twenty minutes the cart comes which conveys the land division
               of books to the waggon. At ten tomorrow comes a waggon for those who go by sea, &amp;
               in all 21 tea chests, &amp; a box as big as two. A pretty labour it has been to pack them,
               &amp; ten times worse it would have been, if I had not taken it leisurely, &amp; done something
               towards it, more or less, every day.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Tomorrow at four in the afternoon I start for Salisbury, &amp; Friday leave Salisbury
               for Taunton. Monday I hope to get to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PooleThomas">Pooles</a>, &amp; either Tuesday or Wednesday to Bristol. I think you had better not join me at
               Stowey, because you could not come so near <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">M<sup>r</sup> T Southey</a> without offending him. – unless you went on.</p>
            <p class="indent1">When we meet you shall hear the whole history of four weeks spent in incessant labour
               of one kind or other. I have not written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> because it has been absolutely impossible unless the time had been stolen from sleep.
               Neither you nor any one else who has not seen it – can conceive how unremittingly
               I have been busied in one way or other –</p>
