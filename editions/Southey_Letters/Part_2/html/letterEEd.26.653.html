                  him, but God knows my power is not much &amp; I see no end to embarrassment after embarrassment.
                  the first &amp; most promising scheme is to tow him after that good ship the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a>. he can certainly do the business of a comms. accomptant in a public office, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> will assuredly have the inclination to serve him.
