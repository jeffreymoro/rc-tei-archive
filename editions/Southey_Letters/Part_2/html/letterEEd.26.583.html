               <p>I am about to return, for some half dozen cogent reasons. it is better get off leisurely
                  than wait the hurry of expulsion which cannot be far distant. summer is near – to

                  course it is preferable. if not I must perforce take the Packet – it is enormously
                  dear – now 20 guineas each person. it cost sixty pounds to bring us here from Bristol.
                  – to clear myself here I drew a few days since for 40 £. the most irksome expence
                  is what my books will cost at the English custom houses, a heavy &amp; disgraceful duty
                  which ought to be abolished. – When I shall have been six or eight months in England
                  some of my crops will be in such a state of forwardness that I can subsist upon them
                  till all arrears are cleared. Wherever I may land you will suffer me to draw on you
                  for the passage &amp; journey. I have spent largely in books – yet often spared when I
                  would willingly have spent. my collection however will supply long labour &amp; repay
                  it. when I have gone thro it will be time enough to collate &amp; compare &amp; correct with
                  other authors. It is of all toil the pleasantest – my notes will be essential otter

                  Francisco &amp; the Redeemer – from the birth in the manger – to the five wounds of crucifixion,
