                  </div> I am sorry to state that this is not the case, the number of copies subscribed for
                  is barely sufficient to defray the expence of publication. The motive for which the
                  work was undertaken explains why it has been delayed.

            <p class="indent1">I have therefore to request the assistance of your Correspondent and the other admirers
               of Chatterton. The merit of his works is now sufficiently known: hitherto they have
               been published only for the advantage of strangers and pilferers; they are now collected
               with the hope of rendering the age of his sister comfortable. I am unwilling to begin
               printing till five hundred copies are engaged: if the well-wishers to the undertaking
               will exert themselves once more, that number will soon be filled, the work shall then
               immediately be sent to press.</p>
