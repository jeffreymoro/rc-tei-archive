                  </div> – &amp; have not seen what I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> about its manner. everywhere where possible the story is told in the very phrase of
                  the original chronicles which are almost the oldest works in the Castilian language. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">this song</span> the language in itself poetical becomes more poetical by necessary compression – if
                  it smack of romance – so does the story. in the notes the certain will be distinguished
                  from the doubtful, passages quoted, &amp; references to author &amp; page uniformly given.
                  Thus much for this which is no specimen of my historical style. indeed I do not think
                  uniformity of style desirable – it should rise &amp; fall with the subject &amp; adapt itself
                  to the matter. moreover in my own judgement a little peculiarity of style is desirable,
                  because it nails down the matter to the memory – you remember the facts of Livy –
                  but you remember the very phrase of Tacitus &amp; Sallust,
