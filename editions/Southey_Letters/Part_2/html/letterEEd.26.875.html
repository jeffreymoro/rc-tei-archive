                  you &amp; feel thankful that there are such men as you in the world. you say you think

                  nothing – his board &amp; lodging make the main cost. You know how I am circumstanced
                  – I have no debt but to you &amp; that contracted wholly, or almost wholly, on his account.

                  has been very thoughtless &amp; unfeeling. I have a letter from him written with a sufficient
                  conviction of his own folly &amp; its consequences. he had borrowed ten guineas to pay
                  the lecture fees, on a promise to repay them at Xmas – &amp; by Xmas the six pounds remaining
                  from his journey – &amp; the five he was to receive from Norwich would be gone I conclude
                  – so that your last supply was inevitably mortgaged, &amp; he will be pennyless. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">will a you had</span> will you therefore remit him ten pounds more. As soon as the Lectures are over I will
                  send for him here &amp; keep him the summer months – this will be some saving – &amp; in the
                  winter, if I find him capable of it as he ought to be, will turn over some reviewing
                  to him that he may begin to live by the sweat of his brow. Before the next quarter
                  I think <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> will make some arrangement for him.</p>
