                  </div> the hill on which we live, is very unpleasant bare, burnt, hills, bearing nothing
                  but wind-mills. the valley of Alcantara, over which the great Aqueduct passes is indeed
                  very striking, it winds among these hills, &amp; perhaps owes much of its beauty to the
                  contrast – like the villages in the South Downs – &amp; that beautiful valley on the left
                  of the road from Salisbury to Deptford Inn. in rich countries they would not be noticed
                  – but here – they are like water in the deserts. The whole road to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> is thus ugly &amp; uninteresting – the road paved all the way, a very Devils-bowling-alley
                  –. you can imagine no scenery more wearying. but Eastward of Lisbon it is totally
                  different. there all is rich &amp; beautiful – exquisitely beautiful now that the green
                  corn &amp; the vineyards give it all the fresh verdure of an English landscape. yesterday
                  evening I took a long ride there with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> about the valley of Chellas, the gardens of which delightful spot chiefly supply Lisbon.
                  the place is intersected by a thousand bye lanes, unenterable by carriage – &amp; as intricate
                  as one of the last propositions in Euclid,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> all angles &amp; curves. in this scenery there is scarcely an English feature – orange
                  trees in the gardens, &amp; vine-covered trellis-walks – olive-trees growing in the corn
                  fields, &amp; now in full blossom – the blossom is somewhat like the old-mans-beard of
                  our hedges, not so striking at a distance as when looked into, but it gives a greyness
                  to the tree, a sober blossom in character with the dusky foliage. fig-trees – their
                  broad leaves so green &amp; rich – &amp; a few broad-headed pine-trees – here &amp; there, &amp; cherres
                  apricots &amp;c in the gardens varying the verdure. in the gardens is usually a water-wheel,
                  &amp; the garden is veined with little aqueducts. these wheels creak eternally – &amp; such
                  is the force of association that the Portugueze reckon this creaking among the delights
                  of the country – they think of water, &amp; the garden revived by it. the country looks
                  covered with wood – not indeed of forest size – but large enough for beauty, &amp; all
                  useful. the fences are either walls – &amp; the walls are soon covered with luxuriant
                  vegetation in this country, – or aloe-guarded banks. &amp; the aloe is magnificent – the
                  stem of the blossom looks &lt;almost&gt; like a piece of timber. &amp; the fennel grows finely
                  as a weed – you know its handsome leaf, fine as vegetable threads – or like <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> hair fine &amp; curled, its blossom growing tall <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp; to be seen at some distan</span>, a fine yellow flower distinguishable at a considerable distance from its size. &amp;
                  the acanthus, the plant that gave a man of genius the idea of the Corinthian capital
                  which he in consequence invented. bl[MS obscured] these with wild roses, &amp; woodbines
                  – more profusely beautiful than I ever saw them elsewhere &amp; you have the idea of these
                  bank-fences. our way was up &amp; down steep hills, whence we looked over the valley,
                  its scattered houses, &amp; here &amp; there a convent – always a beautiful object, &amp; sometimes
                  the river, &amp; its far shore like a low cloud. It was dusk before we returned &amp; the
                  fireflies were awake – flashing about the banks, &amp; then putting out their candles,
                  &amp; again in light – like faery fire-works. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> when first in this country had lost himself in a lane at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> – it was evening – he had heard nothing of these fireflies – &amp; some hundred rose at
                  once before him. he says he thought there was a volcano beginning under his feet.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The warm weather is come. we shut our windows to exclude the heated air, &amp; our shutters
               to darken the room. – if half the money expended upon the Souls in Purgatory were
               employed in watering the streets, we should be relieved from the torment of burning
               – yet is the heat more endurable than the intense light. this is insufferably painful
               – the houses are white – the stones in the street white – the very dust bleached –
               &amp; all reflect back upon us the scorching sun. the light is like the white quivering
               of a furnace fire: it dazzles &amp; makes the eyes ache – &amp; blindness is very common.
               At evening the sea breeze rises – a sudden change! tremendous for an invalid – but
               it purifies the town, &amp; then owl-like we come out of our nests. – At <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a> we shall be cool. we wait only for the Processions of the Body of God, &amp; S<sup>t</sup> Antony the 12 &amp; 13<sup>th</sup> of June – &amp; the Heart of Jesus on the 20<sup>th</sup> &amp; the first Bull-fight which will be about that time.</p>

               <p>The Butchers annually pay a certain sum to Government – like tax or turnpike men in
                  England. veal is prohibited – there are however smugglers who carry on a contraband
                  trade in veal, &amp; better mutton than is to be procured in the legal way. one of these
                  was taken up near our door a few days since, a public calamity I assure you. The Portugueze
                  servants do not like mutton, &amp; &lt;they&gt; mutinied in an English family the other day
                  on this account. a tax of one rea per pound on all meat sold in Lisbon, raises the
                  fund for the Aqueduct. a light tax (about the fifth of a halfpenny) for so great a
                  benefit. the water is indeed purchased from the Gallegos

                  more value than in England, our friends are perhaps like our daily comforts, their

                  makes me lazy &amp; yet I have read enormously &amp; digested much. laziness is the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">cou</span> influenza of the country. the stone cutter will lay his head upon the stone at which

                  power of sleeping where they will. Everlasting noise is another characteristic of
                  Lisbon. their noon-fireworks – their cannonading on every fool pretext – their bells

                  bell ding-donging – for bell <span class="ital">ringing</span> would convey the English idea of music, &amp; here it is only noise. A merchant not far
