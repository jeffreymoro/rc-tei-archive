               <p>I thank you for your enquiries for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a>. he arrived here this morning soon after your letter, from which you will readily
                  conclude that his wounds are slight &amp; in a fair way. he has three wounds, made with
                  a pike in an attempt to board L’Hercule; his escape was almost miraculous, he fell
                  at the second thrust between the two ships, &amp; caught a rope as he fell.
