                    acquainted. I was injured &amp; resented it. in the close of
                    1796 we were so far reconciled as to resume the common
                    intercourse of acquaintance. Something was owing to the
                    interference of common friends, more to our connection by
                    marriage, &amp; probably what most influenced me was that
                    habit of mind which induces us rather to remember the good
                    qualities of a lost friend than his faults, &amp; to select
                    for remembrance<del rend="strikethrough">s</del> chiefly
                    what is pleasurable to recollect. With similar pursuits
                    &amp; similar opinions we differed in practice, &#8722; but unless

                    circumstances he related to me of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> were such as to render it impossible
                    for me, without hypocrisy, not at once to throw off all
                    acquaintance with him; they represented him as perpetually
                    by every means &amp; in every place abusing me, &amp;
                    inventing tales of the most groundless calumny. I believed

        <p rend="indent1"> You have proposed a great question requesting
                    the doctrine of rewards &amp; punishment; that man, the
                    creature of hopes &amp; fears should be worked on by hope
                    &amp; fear religiously applied seems wisely adapted to our
                    imperfect generation. but the fact is, as it appears to me,
                    that men are very little influenced by them, that the
                    present absorbs us, the wicked acting from the strong
                    impulse of the moment &#8722; &amp; the good likewise; both for
                    the immediate gratification derived from the act, according
                    as their habitual feelings are gratified by actions good or
                    evil. the doctrine seems inefficacious. &amp; for the
                    picture it holds out of a future existence it is only by an
                    allegorical interpretation that a thinking mind can
                    understand it by substituting remedy for punishment.</p>
