        <p rend="indent1"> I should long ere this have written to acknowledge the
                    hospitality I found at Norwich, but that I thought the mere formality of a
                    letter of thanks would be as little agreable to you as to myself. I therefore
                    copy for you an Eclogue just written; for two reasons, as a plea for writing &#8211;
                    &amp; because it was suggested by your conversation. What you told me of the
                    German Eclogues revived some almost forgotten plans, &amp; enabled me to correct
                    them. I purpose writing some which may be called English, as sketching features
                    peculiar to England: not like the one which you read to me of Goethe<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749&#8211;1832).</note>
                    which would suit any country with Roman ruins. like the Germans I would aim at
                    somewhat of dramatic interest. &amp; some of my plans will allow me to introduce
                    that quiet sedition which the Anti-Jacobine<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was downplaying his political reputation: the
                            <title>Anti-Jacobin; or, Weekly Examiner</title>, 1 (20 November 1797),
                        p. 7, had identified Southey as the leader of a &#8216;New School&#8217; of highly
                        seditious poets.</note> has denounced me for, in that which is already
                    written there is nothing of this merit. it rather favours old prejudices. I like
                    it myself &#8211; perhaps because it is newly written &#8211; perhaps because I drew from
                    the recollection of such a scene. If I were near you I should profit by your
                    opinions &amp; your knowledge; &#8211; &amp; I should be sorry if a two days journey
                    should totally <del rend="strikethrough">xxtx</del> cut off my intercourse with
                    one whom I highly respect, &amp; whom if the age of our acquaintance justified
                    me, I should gladly call friend.</p>
