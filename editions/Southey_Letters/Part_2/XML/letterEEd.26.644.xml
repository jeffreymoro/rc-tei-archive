                    she has been delirious – that symptom is gone – she now
                    keeps her bed – rising only to have it made – &amp; unable
                    to rise without assistance. for my own part I do not expect

                    on my way. In one way I like the prospect before me –
                    inasmuch as there appears little danger of a second
