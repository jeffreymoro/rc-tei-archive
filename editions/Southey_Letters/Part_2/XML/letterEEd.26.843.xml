                        privateer on 30 July 1803. The <hi rend="ital">King George</hi> was taken to
                        the Spanish port of Vigo, and Southey lost his books.</note> Among them was
                    the oldest Poem about the Cid,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">An edition
                        of &#8216;El Cantar de Mio Cid&#8217;, the oldest Spanish epic poem, probably from the
                        13th century.</note> &amp; the oldest Gothic codes.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The Visigothic Code, promulgated in 642 and 654 and
                        translated into Spanish in the 13th century.</note> Surely in time of war
                    our Packets ought to be armed vessels or frigates. We give our mail coach a
                    guard &amp; yet leave our foreign mails to the mercy of every French
                    privateer.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My eyes are very bad again. this is a sore evil &amp; I fear it
                    will cling to me. in other respects I am well &amp; should be sufficiently happy
                    were it not for the stinging recollection how much happier I have been. in
                    company I am not less alive &amp; chearful than ever, but when alone I feel
                    myself sadly different from what I was &#8211; as if the roots which attach me to
                    earth were all loosened. my head does not teem with plans &amp; hopes as it used
                    to do. I go to Madoc &amp; my history with a feeling that when I have finished
                    them my work will be done. this feeling makes me regard them with deeper
                    interest &amp; proceed more perseveringly least they should not be finished.</p>
