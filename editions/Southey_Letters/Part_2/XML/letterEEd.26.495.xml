                    an unpleasant delay, which prevents me from making any
                    arrangement. the more leisurely I consider every thing, the
                    more my inclination increases towards the Lisbon plan. I
                    could indeed obtain an English passport for the South of
                    France, but it might be difficult to obtain the French one &#8722;

                    clear-headed calculating man, one capable of unravelling any
                    subject however perplexed, &amp; elucidating any truth,
                    however obscure. the book <hi rend="ital">must</hi> be made
                    into a volume, that it may be visible &#8211; for all pamphlets
                    die away from their size. but it shall be as small a volume
                    as possible. of present good resulting from it I have little
                    expectation &#8211; but feel the certainty that it will be a seed
                    that must bud forth at last &#8211; a leaven which must ultimately
                    ferment &amp; purify society. you see how the subject
                    naturally proceeds &#8211; state of females in society, &amp; the
                    evils thereon attendant: benefits deduceable from their
                    increased utility &amp; independance: &amp; then the mode of
                    obtaining this desirable end. If a few leading women could
                    be proselyted, much might now be done; if they would but
                    discountenance the men-tradesmen who occupy female
                    situations half the work would be accomplished.</p>

                    without any education or any reading, she is one of the
                    cleverest girls I ever saw. we were a week at her fathers &#8211;
                    the family is large &amp; the whole management devolved upon
                    her. yet she was never hurried, &#8722; the dairy, the management
                    of the kitchen (&amp; you know what work farmers men make
                    there) all were under her. whatever ornament was about the
                    house she had made, worked the carpets &#8211; painted the chairs
                    &amp;c, &#8722; &amp; with all this had found time to spin in the
                    course of the winter, a quantity which was mentioned as
                    remarkably great. her person is very pleasant &#8211; her eyes
                    quick &amp; animated always by good humour, &amp; the wish
                    to oblige. such I thought her.</p>
