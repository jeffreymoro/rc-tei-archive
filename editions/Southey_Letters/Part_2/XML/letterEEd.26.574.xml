                    &amp; return. Miss E. Petrie however was taken ill &#8211; luckily
                    one of her visitors was Surgeon to the Army &#8211; so we left
                    them there &amp; proceeded with the better number of four
                    persons all better suited for the journey &amp; for each
                    other. We slept at Alcoba&#231;a &#8211; or did not sleep &#8211; for it was
                    our worst night. indeed it made <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> feelingly
                    understand my account of flea-biting. there was also a water
                    mill under the window &#8211; very picturesque &#8211; but a little too
                    loud for so near a neighbour. Alcoba&#231;a was one mark of our

                    I observed most of the young women near were drest in their

                    stone work so miraculously beautiful exists no where but in
                    this secluded village. Will you believe me when I tell you
                    that the front of &lt;a&gt; stone pillar<del rend="strikethrough">s</del> is cut into a rich foliage,
                    &amp; the pillar itself hollowed behind the leaves? that
                    painting could not trace the large leaves more truly or
                    dispose them with finer taste, &amp; that no workmanship in
                    the softest materials could possibly exceed the delicacy
                    &amp; sharpness which the stone cutters chisel has produced?
                    I had seen accurate prints &#8211; &amp; yet stood lost entirely
                    in wonder &amp; admiration. The present Queen<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Maria I (1734-1816, Queen of

                        Batalha Monastery, but it is difficult to identify a
                        particular English architect who worked on the building.
                        The most likely candidate is Master Huguet (d. 1438),
                        whose nationality is much debated.</note> tho the

                    this country it is the childish vanity of subjects &amp;
                    sovereigns to do something themselves &#8211; never to compleat
                    what their predecessors have begun. thus is the Kingdom full
                    of new ruins &#8211; houses begun &amp; never finished. &amp; thus
                    have these beast-barbarians left the noblest work of <del rend="strikethrough">ark</del> architecture that any
                    country can boast of exposed to the weather for four hundred
                    years. Perhaps the Architect feared this neglect &amp; by
                    some unknown varnish or coating secured his own immortality.
                    for the stone is not discolourd or cankered, or in the
                    slightest degree injured. Time has spared the great work of
                    genius. not a moss &#8211; not a lichen has fretted one spot &#8211;
                    &amp; yet the very same stone used in modern buildings
                    decays in half a century. the Earthquake<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The earthquake of 1755,
                        which destroyed much of Lisbon.</note> too just shook

                    its power &amp; did no injury. Till I saw Batalha I thought

                    &#8211; &amp; sorely disliked the feel of cold water. they all ran
