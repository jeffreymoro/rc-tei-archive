        <p>A correspondent in your last Number enquires why the
                    publication of Chatterton&#8217;s works,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Works of Thomas
                            Chatterton</title> (1803), edited by Southey and
                        Joseph Cottle.</note> for the benefit of his sister, has
                    been delayed.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Monthly Magazine</title>, 13 (February
                        1802), 29.</note> A bookseller had informed him that the
                    subscription was ample.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">According to the pseudonymous author of
                        the letter, the bookseller had also informed him that
                        &#8216;the delay lay with Mr. Southey&#8217;, <title>Monthly
                            Magazine</title>, 13 (February 1802), 29.</note> I
                    am sorry to state that this is not the case, the number of
                    copies subscribed for is barely sufficient to defray the
                    expence of publication. The motive for which the work was
                    undertaken explains why it has been delayed.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The edition had been
                        undertaken to raise funds for Chatterton&#8217;s impoverished
                        sister Mary Newton (1749-1804; <title>DNB</title>), and
                        her daughter.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have therefore to request the assistance of
                    your Correspondent and the other admirers of Chatterton. The
                    merit of his works is now sufficiently known: hitherto they
                    have been published only for the advantage of strangers and
                    pilferers; they are now collected with the hope of rendering
                    the age of his sister comfortable. I am unwilling to begin
                    printing till five hundred copies are engaged: if the
                    well-wishers to the undertaking will exert themselves once
                    more, that number will soon be filled, the work shall then
                    immediately be sent to press.</p>
