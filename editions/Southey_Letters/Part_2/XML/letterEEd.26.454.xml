                    only in the part [MS torn] the great outline is distinct, in
                    this compleatly differing from the unconnected &amp;
                    unsystematizable fables of Hindoo absurdity. in <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> time this heap of matter
                    may ferment into form &amp; life &#8211; but now my head is only
                    susceptible of aching &amp; fever &amp; all nervous feelings
                    of pain &amp; agitation. to night I try if opiates will send
                    me to sleep &amp; when I sleep preserve me from broken yet
                    connected dreams, more fatiguing than wakefulness.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I often wish myself at Bristol &#8211; &amp; if, as
                    I have more &amp; more reason to apprehend a constitution,
                    debilitated by the worst possible management in childhood,
                    the most ruinous system of coercion from all things proper,
                    should for ever incapacitate me from the labour &amp;
                    confinement of professional studies &#8211; why I shall probably
                    look to Bristol as my haven. tis the place where I have ever
                    most felt myself at home, where I have when absent myself
                    remembered my dearest friends, where I could walk
                    confidently in darkness thro every winding. I have
                    experienced more pain &amp; pleasure there than elsewhere
                    &amp; these things twist into a strong cord of
                    attachment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God bless you. excuse a half letter from a
                    sick man. at all times I should be glad to give you my hand,
                    but now I should be glad to offer you my pulse &#8211; that I
                    might have faith &amp; be cured. here the people would
                    poison me if I sent for the commonest drug.</p>
