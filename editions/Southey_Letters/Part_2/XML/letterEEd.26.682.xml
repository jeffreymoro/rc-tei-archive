        <p rend="indent1"> The Monastic History is to me extremely
                    interesting. the detail of a very odd system. &amp; the
                    biography of a very odd breed of mortals, whose cerebrella I
                    think must have been organized in a different way from mine.
                    Anecdotes of folly or fraud, &amp; not unfrequently of both
                    so blended that they cannot be seperated, perpetually
                    stimulate &amp; waken ones attention in these folios. they
                    have something like the interest of a fairy tale &#8211; the
                    manners, opinions &amp; feelings they describe are so
                    utterly out of the sphere of English sympathy. their main
                    historical value is mere accident. A good monk illuminates
                    his own Convent only for the honour &amp; glory of the
                    order, but we see what is passing by, by the light. There is
                    a sort of sportsman-pleasure in this startling information.
                    besides it always comes fairly &#8211; it is accidental &#8211; not
                    wilfull evidence.</p>

                        English translation and compilation of three of these

                    the good chance to find him alone &amp; at leisure for

                    am making up &#8211; or rather have made up my own plans. &amp;
                    after weighing maturely &amp; considerately the relative

                    the neighbourhood of London &#8211; I decidedly prefer the last.
                    because it gives me access to public &amp; private libraries
                    &#8211; &amp; places me within reach of the booksellers, with whom
                    I may from time to time engage in <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxx</del> works of obscure profit. The neighbourhood
                    of London means your neighbourhood, for the convenience of
                    finding a house, &amp; the comfort of living in it when
                    found. The nearness of many acquaintance is a matter of
                    luxury &#8211; but one friend within a half hours walk is among
                    the necessaries of life. it is as essential almost as air
                    &amp; water. </p>
