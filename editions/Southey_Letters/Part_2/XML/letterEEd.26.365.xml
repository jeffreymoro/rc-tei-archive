        <p rend="indent1"> I heard yesterday from Norfolk concerning <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>, my friends there have
                    found out a situation for him far better than I could reasonably hope to have
                    met with. it is with a <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Maurice</ref> near Lowestoff, a dissenting minister whom I once
                    met at <ref target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref>. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> has frequently visited
                    for some days at his house, &amp; <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref> was pleased with him. he has ten pupils at sixty guineas a
                    year, &amp; will take <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>
                    for thirty. requesting however that this may not be mentioned to any other
                    persons than those concerned. thirty guineas are the terms of the Kingsbridge
                    school where <ref target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref> is
                    usher, &amp; there &lt;are&gt; fifty boys there. of course there must be a
                    material difference in the attention paid to each of them. <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref> has been anxious to have
                    him under his care, &amp; <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William
                        Taylor</ref> who has written to me upon the subject, promises to take care
                    of him in the holydays. you see <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> is very fortunate.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref> I hear
                    a very good character. he is attentive to the morals of his pupils &amp; anxious
                    to inculcate Christian <del rend="strikethrough">morality</del> principles. his
                        wife<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Priscilla Maurice (d. 1854), n&#233;e
                        Hurry, the daughter of a Yarmouth merchant.</note> is a woman of great
                    talents, &amp; their pupils enjoy the comforts of domestication &amp; its
                    advantages. I am much gratified by all these circumstances, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> could not have made
                    such friends without deserving them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wrote to you on Friday last transmitting an account of a young
                        man<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to May, [28 December
                        1798], Letter 363. For Lamb&#8217;s letter about the unnamed &#8216;young man&#8217; see Edwin

                        154&#8211;155.</note> in sad distress from <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref>, whom he hoped you could serve. it was directed to Bedford
                    Square. I take it for granted you are now in the country. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We had an adventure this morning which has much amused us. As we
                    were beginning breakfast, a well dressed woman entered the room, &amp; said she
                    was come to take a little breakfast with us. we thought she was deranged. this
                    however was evidently not the case, &amp; it was not without great difficulty I
                    refrained from laughing at the oddity of the visit during the whole of the meal
                    time. When she had done she rose up &amp; askd what was to pay, &amp; as you may
                    suppose was somewhat confused when she found that we did not keep a public
                    house. the poor woman breakfasted I believe in a state of very uncomfortable
                    doubt, for the sight of my books which fronted her might have shown her that she
                    had made some blunder. She was walking from Bristol some little way farther into
                    the country, &amp; found herself so cold &amp; hungry that she determined to
                    breakfast on the road.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My complaint is relieved, &amp; when it returns affects me less
                    because I am accustomed to it &amp; acquainted with its cause. when the weather
                    will permit it bathing is prescribed for me. I take exercise daily, &amp; ether
                    every night.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> An odd circumstance occurred to me on Monday; a man who had been
                    at school with me,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; however,
                        the scheme is similar to that executed by Jonathan Boucher (1738&#8211;1804;
                            <title>DNB</title>) in <title>A Supplement to Dr. Johnson&#8217;s Dictionary
                            of the English Language; Or, A Glossary of Obsolete and Provincial
                            Words</title> (1807).</note> but who had not for fourteen years ever
                    noticed me, tho we often met in the streets, requested an hours conversation
                    with me &#8211; &amp; this was to say that he thought a Glossary of the English
                    language would be a very useful &amp; very lucrative work, that he had written
                    some sheets, but wanted the talents &amp; the learning requisite (&#8211; which God
                    knows he did!) &#8211; that he could command the money necessary for publication &amp;
                    an extensive subscription. in short he wanted my assistance &amp; my name. What
                    he meant by a Glossary it was not very easy to comprehend; he had an idea that

                    far as I could unravel his meaning it was to make a dictionary of elegant words
                    which gentlemen would be very glad to use if they understood them, &amp; which
                    would save them the trouble of studying Johnsons two folios.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Johnson (1709&#8211;1784; <title>DNB</title>),
