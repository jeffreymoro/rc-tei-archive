        <p rend="indent1"> I thought I recognized your seal &#8211; &amp; it
                    gave me very great pleasure to find myself not forgotten by
                    persons who I often recollect with pleasure &amp; gratitude.
                    Six years have elapsed since I left school, &amp; since last
                    I saw you. All my views in life &amp; many of my opinions
                    have been changed more than once during that period; the
                    result is &#8211; that at twenty four I am married, without a
                    want, almost without a wish unsatisfied. Time &amp;
                    Experience have done me much good, &amp; somewhat tamed me:
                    imagine me taller &amp; still thinner than in 1792, &amp;
                    with even spirits which nothing either elevates or
                    depresses, &amp; you will have most of the alterations that
                    the interval has produced.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been married two years, according to
                    the Gipsey prophecy at Norwood,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Norwood Common in Surrey was a popular
                        destination for Londoners on a day out and home to a
                        number of well-known gipsy fortune-tellers.</note> which
                        <ref target="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Tom</ref> may
                    recollect &#8211; but alas of the promised five children &amp;
                    good fortune I have as yet no appearance. the first however
                    Time may give me, &amp; the Law, my present study, may
                    possibly one day accomplish the rest of the prediction. be
                    that as it may I am happy.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> hitherto we have been obliged to live in
                    lodgings. I have now the prospect of soon enjoying the
                    comforts of a house. at present I am employed in settling
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my
                        mother</ref>, &amp; with her we shall pass the Autumn,
                    for I am sorry to add that my wifes health has obliged us to
                    quit London for the present, &amp; thus interrupted my
                    professional pursuits. I have been alarmed by her
                    indisposition, but she is now better, &amp; indeed my
                    prospects are in every direction brightening. I have had
                    some difficulties, but they are over. necessity joined with
                    inclination to make me an author, &amp; now only the
                    pleasant motive remains. I acquired some money &amp; more
                    reputation. the one soon went, but it supported me when I
                    had no other support. the other I trust will not be lost. I
                    have many plans &amp; great ones to execute should it please
                    God to allow me life &amp; leisure.</p>

                    remember of the school boy.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I beg my remembrances to all your family. I
                    have often thought of them, &amp; recollected Rye with
                    pleasure. the newspapers have [MS torn] given me some [MS
