                    from Esseck to the north, and nine from Colocza to the
                    south. This otherwise small place is memorable for two great
                    battles here fought; the first between Lewis king of

                    Prince Lewis (being about twenty years old) with twenty-five
                    thousand men, fought three hundred thousand Turks; when
                    being overpowered by numbers, twenty-two thousand of the
                    christian army were slain upon the place; five thousand
                    waggons, eighty great cannon, six hundred small ones, with
                    all their tents and baggage, were taken by the victors; and
                    the king, in his flight over the brook <hi rend="ital">Curass</hi>, fell into a quagmire, and was swallowed
                    up: after which Solyman took and slew two hundred thousand
                    Hungarians, and got such a footing in this kingdom, that he
                    could never be expelled. This fatal battle was fought
                    October 29. The second in some part retrieves the loss and

                    difficulty, passed that river, then extremely swelled with

                    Esseck with an army of an hundred thousand men, so strongly,
                    that it was not possible to attack him in that post without

                    it the 23d of the same month; whereupon the 29th, the Prime
                    Visier passed that river at Esseck, and upon August 12th,
                    there followed a bloody fight, in which the Turks lost one
                    hundred pieces of cannon, twelve mortars, all their
                    ammunition, provisions, tents, baggage, and treasure, and

                    it.&#8221;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been thus minute in copying the above
                    particulars attached to the description of this place, as
                    they record two curious historical facts (one of which is
                    alluded to by your correspondent) which may prove
                    interesting to some of your readers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Saltzbach, where the celebrated Marshal
                        Turenne<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Henri de

                    the place described in our geographical books and maps &#8212;
                    spelt &#8220;S<hi rend="ital">u</hi>ltzbach &#8212; a small town in
                    Nortgow (a province of Germany) in the upper palatinate of
                    the Rhine, one mile distant from Amberg to the south-east,
                    which gives the title of a prince to some branches of the
                    palatine family.&#8221; The &#8220;<title>Encyclopedia
                        Britannica</title>&#8221; gives the name of the place
                        &#8220;Saspach.&#8221;<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Marshal Turenne was killed in battle with Imperial
                        forces in 1675 at Sasbach in Baden, so the
                            <title>Encyclopedia Britannica</title> was almost
                        correct. But the place described as Sultzbach, near
                        Amberg, was in Bavaria and unconnected to the site of
                        Turenne&#8217;s death.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> In our literary desiderata, a true
                    orthography seems particularly wanted in maps and
                    geographical books, where the names are often so egregiously
                    mis-spelt, as to make it difficult to recognize them as the
                    places meant; and this error, especially in maps, I suspect
                    to be principally owing to surveyors adopting the provincial
                    pronunciation, which, in many instances, is quite foreign to
                    the spelling.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is too, a shameful neglect in the
                    compilers of our modern gazetteers, which is that of copying
                    the descriptions of places from former publications, without
                    giving themselves the trouble to enquire what alterations
                    may have taken place in the course of time, what
                    improvements may have been made in public buildings, trade,
                    or manufactures, &amp;c. or their decline; by which means
                    error becomes perpetuated from one generation to another.
                    Some curious specimens of which might be selected, that
                    would prove these otherwise useful publications to be, in
                    general, mere catchpennies and the sources of much
                    misinformation. I am, your&#8217;s,</p>
