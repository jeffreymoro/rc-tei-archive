        <p rend="indent1"> Send me your Ink receipt &#8211; &amp; without loss
                    of time, for look what a vile mulatto composition is here,
                    &amp; all kickman-jiggery of manuscripts must be at a stand
                    till I get something better. this being of the first
                    importance comes first. in the same letter tell me when you
                    will set forward for these Lakes &amp; Mountains. God bless
                    them! I look with something like awe &amp; envy at their
                    unchangeableness. It is but two years since I left them,
                    &amp; I would give two ears to wake and find it all but a
                    dream, &amp; that I was as in September 1801. but ones
                    dreams are not at our own disposal. by day I am the great
                    Autocrat of my own thoughts &amp; feelings, &amp; could, I
                    am sure, utter jokes &amp; quaintities upon the rack. but by
                    night the poor brain gets loose, &#8211; I &amp; the Blue Devil
                    battle it like the Persian Gods<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, the principles
                        of light and darkness in the Zoroastrian
                        religion.</note> with alternate victory in light &amp;
                    darkness. by day I beat him &#8211; but the cowardly Indigo
                    Beelzebub gets at me when I am asleep, &amp; it is but poor
                    consolation to abuse him thus in the morning after a nights

                    bore the journey well &amp; we arrived safe &amp; sound
                    yesterday, the third evening</p>

        <p>So I made this poem, &amp; then you know could laugh by way
                    of consolation. I have you to thank you for all the kind
                    attentions we received at <ref target="places.html#Congreve">Congreve</ref>. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> was certainly the better for being there.
                    She is at first somewhat more dispirited here as I expected.
                    indeed the sight of the <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">little
                        Sara</ref>, &amp; her infantine sounds produce in me
                    more shootings of recollection than are good.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sara Coleridge was born 23
                        December 1802 and so was three months younger than

          <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> had taught me to expect something

                    one who beheld her. Sometimes I feel as if it were fit that
                    she should grow up an Angel. few men have had more of these
                    weanings of the heart from earth than have been dealt to me!
                    All who were about my infancy are gone &#8211; I have no friends
                    left but those of my own making &#8211; all the faces that I first
                    learnt to love have been taken away, &amp; all prematurely.
                    as far as survivorship gives the feeling, I am old already &#8211;
                    but this has been the heaviest blow &amp; has gone the

                    till you go with me into the fells &amp; vallies. tell me
                    that you will come &amp; I will write full directions where
                    to stop &amp;c. You must see this country once, &amp; when
                    could you see it so well? I have no fixture-feeling about
                    me. no symptoms of root-striking here. Alas! what am I but a
                    feather driven by the wind &amp; God knows where the wind
                    may drive me next. When I so far forget ten years experience
                    as to form a plan or indulge a hope &#8211; my heart goes to
                    Portugal. this is a wonderful country here, it does every
                    thing to the mind except gladden it &#8211; but there is a life
                    &amp; joy-giving power in the very air of Portugal &#8211; even to
                    breathe was a pleasure there &#8211; I would give one eye to blind
                    Fortune if she would let me look on the Tagus with the
                    other. N.B. She should have the sore one tho!</p>
