        <p rend="indent1"> We have been buried in the snow &amp; delayed
                    with the thaw. all our bottles &amp; jugs burst with the
                    frost &#8211; &amp; if I had been corked &amp; put out at night I
                    might have burst too. News we have none. the loss of the
                    Ambuscad as you may suppose excited much surprize.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                            <title>Ambuscade</title> had been captured by the
                        French on 14 December 1798 while blockading the port of
                        Rochefort.</note> peace is more necessary &amp; more
                    distant than ever &#8211; I look on at what passes in this world,
                    silently, but not without emotion, nor without hope. Lisbon
                    is I think in serious danger. if so <ref target="people.html#HillThomas">my Uncle</ref> may be
                    expected in England: I do not think the French can possibly
                    be fools enough to spare it longer. that port taken, the
                    Mediterranean is again theirs, &amp; Egypt safe. Nelson<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Horatio Nelson,
                        Viscount Nelson (1758&#8211;1805; <title>DNB</title>), whose
                        victory at the Battle of Aboukir Bay, 1798, was widely
                        celebrated in verse; see, for example, William Sotheby

                    than the other Admirals to celebrate him. but he will not
                    have a place in my Kalendar.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Nelson may have been excluded from the
                        planned, but unexecuted, &#8216;The Kalendar&#8217;, but he was the
