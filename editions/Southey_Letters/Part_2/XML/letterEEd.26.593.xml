          <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter found me on the point of setting
                    out for Worcester, to meet <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, with whom
                    I was to take counsel as to my future destination. He will
                    procure for me the place of secretary to some legation in
                    the south of Europe, &#8211; probably to Naples.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The proposal by Wynn that
                        Southey should become Secretary to Sir William Drummond
                        (c. 1770-1828; <title>DNB</title>), classical scholar,
                        poet and diplomat; Charge d&#8217;Affaires in Denmark
                        1800-1801, Minister-Plenipotentiary in Naples 1801-1803
                        and 1807-1808, and Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in
                        1803.</note> This will be a permanent establishment,
                    with a prospect and probability of something better; it will
                    settle me, also, in a good climate, which I feel an object
                    of more importance than I could wish. I know not what the
                    salary may be &#8211; small certainly, but certainly more than
                    adequate to the official duty, which will allow me ample
                    leisure for my historical pursuits.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I perceive, by your account, that a bill for
                        30<hi rend="ital">l</hi>., which I exchanged at
                    Falmouth, had not then reached you; my two journeys in
                    Portugal, the return home, and, above all, the heavy expense
                    of the books which I have purchased will account for the
                    balance, and, I trust, acquit me of all extravagance. In the
                    spring, my appointment will probably take place, the person
                    who at present holds the office at the Neapolitan court<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Arthur Paget
                        (1771-1840; <title>DNB</title>),
                        Minister-Plenipotentiary in Naples 1800-1801 and Austria
                        1801-1806; Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire
                        1807-1809.</note> (or rather the Sicilian, for Palermo
                    is the residence) being then expected to remove. I shall
                    then, I trust, soon be able to lighten myself of all debts,
                    though the sense of obligation, as it ought, will ever
                    remain. An unhappy circumstance precludes me from
                    immediately lessening the balance. The costs of my cousin
                        <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margaret&#8217;s</ref>
                    illness &#8211; a year&#8217;s heavy illness &#8211; must be defrayed by me:
                    she may yet linger some months, though recovery is
                    impossible, and from me her support must also continue to be
                    derived. Under this pressure I need not apologise for delay.
                    I have written to my London publisher, proffering him
                    another poem,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey
                        offered Longman either <title>Madoc</title>, a version
                        of which had been written in 1797-1799, or <title>The
                            Curse of Kehama</title>, which he had begun in
                        Portugal.</note> to be ready for the press by the end of
                    the winter, but requesting a part of the payment now, an
                    offer to which he doubtless will accede. On this I should
                    have lived and sequestered my quarterly remittances to you.
                    But for these demands I am in deep water; but I can swim,
                    and happily there is land in sight.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will ask why I treat for a poem rather
                    than for the materials which, with so much cost and labour,
                    I have procured in Portugal. To Portugal I must one day
                    return, to correct those materials when they are digested,
                    and to gather what remains. It is even possible that I may
                    one day hold an official situation in that country. To
                    publish any thing now would be barring the doors of the
                    archives against me: my first volume must touch popery to
                    the quick. Thus have I a year&#8217;s labour lying dead. These,
                    then, are my plans. I am about soon to visit <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>; his house will hold us, and there I
                    shall devote myself to labour as unremitting as will be
                    consistent with health and prudence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I look with anxiety for Lisbon news. Should
                        <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        uncle</ref> return to England, as I hope and expect, it
                    will relieve me from a weight of much anxiety. He is much
                    pleased with the prospects which are opening upon me. If
                    they only gave me a prudent opportunity of seeing Italy,
                    that were much; but they also afford rational expectations
                    of opulence, while they bestow immediate independence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have not mentioned your sister,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">May had five sisters;
                        the identity of the one mentioned here is
                        uncertain.</note> and I inquire for her with hesitation
                    and fear.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We move for Cumberland as soon as my business
                    is transacted with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, and my affairs here settled. In the
                    autumn it is possible that I shall pass a few weeks with
                        <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, in
                    Wales, and take my long-intended journey in the steps of
                    &#8220;Madoc.&#8221; I dream of Sicily, &#8211; of reading Theocritus,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Theocritus (3rd
                        century BC), Greek poet from Sicily.</note> and taking a
                    peep down the crater of Mount Etna. Direct to me as before.
                    I would thank you for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>, if
                    the language of thankfulness were not so scanty. There are
                    not bells enough to ring a change. I hope he will do well:
                    he has made his own choice, and must make his own way.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey
