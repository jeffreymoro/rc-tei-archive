        <p rend="indent1"> I do not think you rightly understood my
                    opinions upon the Orientalists. to climate I attribute very
                    little, even referring the sensuality usually attributed to
                    it, to the effect of polygamy. However the more the subject
                    engages my thought &amp; as yet I have only thought about
                    it, the more it convinces me that every fact may be warped
                    to suit a system, &amp; that every system must be erroneous.
                    the evidence of facts (&amp; Lord Grenville risques another
                    campaign for the sake of obtaining it)<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Wyndham Grenville,

                            <title>DNB</title>), had given a speech to the House

                        to negotiate with Napoleon.</note> proves that under the
                    same climate, the same religion &amp; the same government,
                    the state of society has been very different. climate will
                    influence the mode of life &#8211; nothing else. the noon-nap

                    to connect with the Beguinage,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In a letter to Southey, 4 January 1800,
                        Rickman had proposed a system of &#8216;beguinages&#8217;, modelled
                        on lay Catholic communities of women in the Low

                    in the early part some of the Sisters might find employment,
                    &amp; the girls might be drafted off to learn each her
                    profession in the establishment. the possible employments
                    are numerous. they are indeed all, except those that do not
                    require muscular strength; farriers, blacksmiths &amp;
                    coalheavers &#8211; these will remain to the men I think
                    exclusively. our difficulty I fear will be in acquiring for
                    the establishment that respectability, which religion gave
                    it in the catholic countries. this will be the first
                    obstacle to filling the establishment, but it can only exist
