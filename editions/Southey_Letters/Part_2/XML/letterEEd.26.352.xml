                    of the place I date from, &amp; if she have a map to refer
                    to, very probably she may miss the name. we are however near
                        <ref target="places.html#Lanthony">Lanthony</ref>, if
                    not the most important certainly the most agreable object of
                    our journey. by <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref>&#8217;s letter this day put in the post office
                    at Brecon, you will have learnt how we travelled up a most
                    delightful glen to the mountain top, &amp; how after
                    hobbling over turnpike roads, which would have overturned
                    any broad wheeld waggon, we reached <ref target="places.html#MerthyrTidvil">Merthyr Tidvil</ref>,
                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#MaberGeorge">Maber</ref>. him
                    I found the same as ever, civil, formal, &amp; tiresome;
                    however the conversation about <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> was
                    happily introduced &amp; that matter is well settled. this
                    has reconciled me to my journey &#8211; for otherwise Edith I
                    should have half repented it. I often wish myself at home.
                    all these mountain beauties are pleasant enough to see, but
                    they will be pleasanter to recollect.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What have we seen? woods &#8211; mountains, &amp;
                    mountain glens &amp; streams. in those woods are
                    comprehended all imaginable beauty. sometimes we have been
                    winding up the dingle side, &amp; every minute catching the
                    stream below thro the wood that half hid it, always hearing
                    its roar. then over mountains where nothing was to be seen
                    but hill &amp; sky, their sides rent by the winter streams.
                    sometimes a little tract of cultivation appeared up some
                    coomb. places so lovely, so beautiful, &#8211; they lookd as tho
                    no taxgatherer ever visited them. I have longed to dwell in
                    one of these solitary houses in a mountain vale, sheltered
                    by the hills, &amp; the trees that grow finely round the
                    house, the vale rich by the soil swept down from the hills a
                    stream before the door, rolling over large stones, pure
                    water, so musical too &#8211; &amp; a child might cross it. yet at
                    wet seasons it must thunder down, a torrent. in such scenes
                    there is a simpleness of sublimity fit to feed
                    imagination.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We left <ref target="places.html#MerthyrTidvil">Merthyr</ref> this
                    morning after a great breakfast. <ref target="people.html#MaberGeorge">Maber</ref> asked us to
                    sleep but without meaning us to accept his invitation I
                    believe. his wife is a good natured woman &#8211; we drank tea
                    &amp; suppd there on Friday, &amp; dined &amp; spent the
                    evening on Saturday. the morning <del rend="strikethrough">wxx</del> was better past at the inn, whence <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> wrote
                    to his mother, &amp; I finished a letter to <ref target="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</ref>. at two
                    we reached Brecon, a distance of 18 miles. a little but
                    clean ale house afforded us <del rend="strikethrough">eig</del> eight pennyworth of bread cheese &amp; ale.
                    &amp; we departed for <ref target="places.html#Crickhowel">Crickhowel</ref>, a stage of 13 more. a woman whom we
                    met &amp; of whom we asked the distance, measured it by the
                    &#8216;great inn&#8217; at Bwlch on the way, &amp; we determined to halt
                    there. before we got there heavy rain overtook us, &amp; we
                    were <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> wet the lower half
                    when we reachd the &#8216;great inn at Bwlch&#8217; which is not quite
                    so good as the memorable ale alehouse at Tintern. however we
                    have seen good beds here, the cream was good, &amp; the tea
                    excellent thanks to <ref target="people.html#MaberGeorge">Mabers</ref> peach leaves which we put in
                    requisition.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So we have eat, drank, dried ourselves &amp;
                    grown comfortable. also we have had the pleasure of the
                    Landlords company, who being somewhat communicative &amp;
                    somewhat tipsy, gave us the history of himself &amp; family
                    &amp; of his own &amp; his daughters complaints. hers <del rend="strikethrough">was xx</del> is a sore leg. his is
                    not.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We reach <ref target="places.html#Crickhowel">Crickhowel</ref> to breakfast tomorrow. <ref target="places.html#Lanthony">Lanthony</ref> is not far
                    from thence, but whether we reach Hereford that night, or
                    the next day to dinner is uncertain. hitherto, except the
                    trifling inconvenience of this evenings rain our whole
                    journey has been fortunate &amp; pleasant. the waterfalls
                    indeed were deficient in the slight article of &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211; water.
                    all else has equalled our expectations.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I much like the appearance of the Welsh
                    women. they have all a [MS torn]ter in their countenances,
                    an intelligence which is very pleasant [MS torn] round
                    shrewd national physiognomy is certainly better than that of
                    the English peasantry &amp; we have uniformly met with
                    civility. there is none of the insolence &amp; brutality
                    which characterises our colliers &amp; milkwomen.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At <ref target="places.html#MerthyrTidvil">Merthyr</ref> we witnessed the very interesting custom
                    of strewing the graves. they are fenced round with little
                    white stones, &amp; the earth, in the coffin shape, planted
                    with herbs &amp; flowers, &amp; strewn with flowers. two
                    women were thus decorating a grave, the one a middle aged
                    women, &amp; much affected. this affected me a good deal.
                    the custom is so congenial to ones heart &#8211; it prolongs the
                    memory of the dead, &amp; links the affections to them.</p>

          <p>Monday morning.</p>
          <p rend="indent1"> Last night was not so comfortable as last
                        evening. our sheets were beastly dirty &amp; we could
                        procure no clean ones. dirty sheets are not an endurable
                        evil, so we pulled them out &amp; lay in our cloaths
                        between the blankets. I did not easily get to sleep from
                        the idea of nastiness, &amp; the howling of the wind.
                        however this morning I woke refreshed &amp; rejoiced at
                        daylight. we are now at <ref target="places.html#Crickhowel">Crickhowel</ref>
                        where we have breakfasted. <ref target="places.html#Lanthony">Lanthony</ref> is

                        obscured] tomorrow. this part of Brecknockshire is most
                        beautiful. the Usk rolling [MS obscured] a rich &amp;

                        every day now our faces are turned homewards.</p>

                        find a letter at Hereford. the clouds fell all last
