<salute>My dear Sir</salute>

<p rend="indent1"> It is I believe nearly six months since I
                    have had any communication with you, or any account of you
                    but what the newspapers gave me. it is not however too late
                    to offer you my congratulations &amp; best wishes upon the
                    occasion that placed your name there.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Biddlecombe had married
                        Catherine Lacy on 4 June 1798. The event was reported in
                        the Press (e.g. <title>Express and Evening
                            Chronicle</title>) on 9 June 1798.</note> did you
                    receive a copy of Joan of Arc<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Joan of Arc</title> (1798).</note>
                    in May? I sent it the very day on which I left Bath for a
                    long journey to <ref target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref> &amp; <ref target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref>. On my return I found <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref> in
                    the bustle of quitting one house without having fixed upon
                    another to remove to. We took one at last at this place,
                    little more than two miles from Bristol, over Durdham Down,
                    &amp; this is likely to be our home till <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> health
                    can bear London air &amp; London confinement.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> My brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> soon recovered
                    from his wounds, &amp; as soon as he had joined his ship
                        <ref target="people.html#HoodAlexanderViscount">Lord
                        Bridport</ref> removed him to the Royal George. We now
                    shortly expect him home as the ship is at Spithead &amp;
                    about to be docked. he has about six months longer to serve
                    &amp; will I doubt not do well in the navy.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> For myself, I am busy with a second edition
                    of my Letters, &amp; with a second volume of Poems,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A second, revised
                        edition of Southey’s <title>Letters Written During a
                            Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> was
                        published in 1799. Southey’s two volume collection
                            <title>Poems</title> appeared in 1799: volume one
                        was a third edition of the collection first published in
                        1797; volume two consisted of poems published previously
                        (though not under Southey’s own name) in the
                            <title>Morning Post</title> and the <title>Monthly
                            Magazine</title> or published for the first time. It
                        included the six ‘English Eclogues’.</note> both which
                    will be published by Christmas. you will find in them some
                    tolerable ballads, &amp; half-a-dozen Eclogues, in my own
                    judgement the best of my smaller pieces. at present more
                    time than I can either willingly or conveniently spare is
                    taken up in walking eight miles every day, which I do in
                    obedience to medical advice. I have been a good deal
                    indisposed, &amp; at the heart, which is an awkward place.
                    they tell me I have sate too much &amp; walked too little,
                    &amp; this daily journey, for so I may call it, is my chief
                    prescription. it has I think already rendered the seizures I
                    complained of less frequent &amp; less violent.</p>
