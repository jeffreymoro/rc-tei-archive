        <p rend="indent1"> I have delayed writing some time in the hope of recovering your
                    last letter. its loss cannot be attributed to misdirection. a large packet from
                        <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> has never reached me. by
                    the same post he wrote under cover to <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</ref> inclosing a forty pounds bill &#8211; else that also had gone. &#8211; If
                        <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> will house the boxes I shall
                    be greatly obliged to him &#8211; it vexes &amp; hurts me that you should be troubled
                    for my account on all sides.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My Mother</ref> does not mend. a bowel
                    complaint this last week has much alarmed me. it is tamed, but a very very
                    little would now destroy her. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">her sister</ref> are wholly employed
                    in nursing. two days she kept her bed, &amp; she must not leave her room till a
                    great amendment takes place. I am a good deal there &#8211; to the still further
                    lessening of my little leisure. tho she certainly is not consumptive, the decay
                    is so total that I hardly can hope her recovery. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is miserably &amp; vexatiously
                    depressed in spirits. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</ref>
                    are very good &#8211; uncommonly good. she suffers no pain, &amp; is even chearful.
                    only at times she regrets having left Bristol &#8211; because she should have liked to
                    have been buried with my father. yet if the <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> &lt;winter&gt; should not relapse to its severity we may yet
                    make her weather it out <del rend="strikethrough">xx xxx xxx</del> &#8211; &amp; in
                    the summer take out a new lease. there is no dangerous disease about her &#8211; nor
                        <del rend="strikethrough">has she reached</del> is her age great.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am very desirous to see the Catalogue &#8211; because <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> has bought so many
                    books since my return, that now when a work comes in my way, I do not venture at
                    the hap-hazard to purchase it. my inclinations more &amp; more lead me towards
                    history &#8211; &amp; that pursuit again is continually stimulating me by its abundant
                    subject, to poetry. I have a treaty on foot &#8211; to write in the Courier<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s hope of writing for the London
                        newspaper <title>The Courier</title> &#8216;ended in smoke&#8217;; see Southey to
                        Charles Danvers, 26 January 1802, Letter 652.</note> &#8211; &amp; if I can so add
                    two guineas, or two &amp; a half weekly to my income &#8211; it will be very
                    convenient. in that case of course I shall get a paper &#8211; I will send it daily to
                    you &#8211;. in one of my beloved old Spaniards I found a wild story the other day,
                    which I am half disposed to stitch up into a play for the stage<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The identity of the &#8216;wild story&#8217; is unknown and
                        Southey did not turn it into a play.</note> &#8211; happily my dreaming does not
                    keep me idle &#8211; it only amuses the intervals from employment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref> is at last settled in
                    town for the winter, with Charlotte Smith,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Charlotte Turner Smith (1749-1806; <title>DNB</title>), poet
                        and novelist; author, among many other works, of <title>Celestina</title>
                        (1791) and <title>The Old Manor House</title> (1793). She was an old friend
                        of Mary Barker; the two spent the winter together in London in
                        1801-1802.</note> whom I like very much &#8211; tho it gave me an uncomfortable
                    surprize to see her look so old &amp; broken down. I like her manners &#8211; by
                    having a large family she is more humanized, more akin to <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> common feelings &#8211; than most literary women.
                    tho she has done more, &amp; done better than other women writers, it has
                    &lt;not&gt; been her whole employment &#8211; she is not looking out for admiration
                    &amp; talking to show off. I see in her none of the nasty little envies &amp;
                    jealousies common enough among the cattle &#8211; what she likes &#8211; she likes with
