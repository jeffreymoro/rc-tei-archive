                    while I have thought, that you have ruined your style by
                    germanisms, latinisms &amp; Greekisms: that you are sick of
                    a surfeit of knowledge &#8211; that your learning breaks out like
                    scabs &amp; blotches upon a beautiful face. I am led by
                    indolence &amp; by good nature always rather to feel dislike
                    than to express it. &amp; if another finds the same fault
                    that has displeased me in your writings, have always
                    defended them more zealously than if they had been my own.
                    but faults they are, faults anywhere, &amp; tenfold

                    history. Would that I could now in my turn impress you with
                    the same conviction. Crowd your ideas as you will &#8211; your
                    images never can be too many &#8211; give them the stamp &amp;
                    autograph of William Taylor, but let us have them in
                    English, plain perspicuous English, such as mere English
                    readers can understand. Ours is a noble language &#8211; a
                    beautiful language. I can tolerate a germanism, for family
                    sake, but he who uses a Latin or a French phrase where a
                    pure old English word does as well, by God he ought to be

                    you not to undertake an office so inadequate &amp; so
                    unsuited to your powers. you are incurring all the
                    disadvantages of that public authorship which till now you
                    had wisely avoided. Every body knows that William Taylor
                    edites the Iris. Even here I have heard it. but is William
                    Taylor to learn that detraction is the resource &amp; the
                    consolation of inferiority &#8211; that every one of his
                    acquaintance who feel themselves inferior will gladly
                    flatter themselves by dwelling upon &amp; magnifying every
                    error or resemblance of an error that he may commit? the
                    world always expect more than they can find, &amp; to this
                    evil you are peculiarly subject because you have hitherto
                    kept yourself back. I doubt whether precipitancy be so
                    dangerous as such witholding. What ought not to be expected

                        In Greek legend, Orion was a great hunter who was turned

                        suggests a number of the gods urinated on an ox hide,

                        reveal the infant Orion. If Southey was referring to
                        this story, he could be making a joke about the joint
