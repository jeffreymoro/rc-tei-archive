<p rend="indent1"> Here I am – knee deep in brick, mortar &amp;
                    deal shavings, superintendant of the revolutionizing our
                    dwelling. But we are in an uncomfortable state of anxiety
                    about poor <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>.
                    for these eight weeks we have not heard of him – &amp; a
                    paragraph in the papers states that a brig was seen lying in
                    Ferrol, which was supposed to be the Sylph.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">It was widely reported in
                        the British Press in early October 1799, e.g. <title>St
                            James’s Chronicle</title>, 5 October 1799, that the
                        brig, <hi rend="ital">Sylph</hi>, on which <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom Southey</ref>
                        was serving, had been captured and was at the Spanish
                        port of Ferrol.</note> I know not whether any tidings
                    could be obtained from the Admiralty – if there could I
                    should be obliged to you to call there &amp; make enquiry –
                    but it appears to me that if they had any tidings the loss
                    of the ship would be gazetted. </p>

                        Bedford (2–3 August 1799, Letter 425) to search Picart’s
                            <title>Ceremonies</title> for the custom of Florida
                        Indians of digging up their dead relatives each year. He
                        found a description of a similar ceremony among the

                    send you once more to your books. in Sir John Maundeviles

                        reprint of an influential 14th-century travel book.
                        Southey referenced the ‘account’ in the notes to
                            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), Book 7,

                        Fields, Southwark, South London. Both were well known
                        for providing cheap amusements.</note> where he used to

                    that he had Houris &amp; Paradise to reward those who obeyed
                    him, even in this life. in your copy of Maundevile you will
                    find it page 336. will you copy me the passage. I have
                    business with the old Gentleman &amp; would have as many

                    plenty – those who &lt;do&gt; not like high seasoned ones
                    will find somewhat plainer by its side. Send me something

<p rend="indent1"> Grosvenor can you never make a weeks leisure
                    to visit me? now indeed – unless you were studying scenery
                    for a picture or poem upon the Deluge – the country is not
                    worth seeing. but if Spring Summer &amp; Autumn are only
                    missing &amp; not dead – why when one of them is found
                    surely surely you might come. here, is the New Forest to be
                    seen – &amp; the Island – &amp; me – &amp; you shall help me
                    to dig in the garden – &amp; we will go up the church tower,
                    &amp; I will be as idle &amp; as happy as you can wish.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Do you know that I have seen a man
                    exceedingly like you, &amp; what is curious is that
                    indecision is the prominent feature in his character. but
                    for the face resemblance I never saw <hi rend="ital">so
                        striking a-one</hi>. if that phrase <hi rend="ital">looks</hi> as ugly to your eye as it does to mine, you
