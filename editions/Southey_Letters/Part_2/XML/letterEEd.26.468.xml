                    can acquire independance, I will not make the sacrifice of
                    happiness it will inevitably cost me. I love the country &#8211; I
                    love study &#8211; devotedly I love it. but in legal studies it is
                    only the subtitly of the mind that is exercised &#8211; however I
                    need not philippicize &#8211; &amp; it is too late to veer about.
                    in 96 I might have chosen physic &amp; succeeded in it &#8211; I
                    caught at the first plank &#8211; &amp; mist the great mast in my
                    reach. perhaps I may enable myself to swim by &amp; by.
                    Grosvenor I have nothing of what the world call ambition. I
                    never thought it possible that I could be a great Lawyer &#8211; I
                    should as soon expect to be the Man in the Moon. my views
                    were bounded &#8211; my hopes &#8211; to an income of 500 a year, of
                    which I could lay by half to effect my escape with. <hi rend="ital">possibly</hi> the stage may exceed this,
                    &amp; that at an expence of time on my part allowing three
                    parts of the year to other labours. I am not indolent &#8211; I
                    loathe indolence. but indeed reading law is laborious
                    indolence. it is thrashing straw. I have read &amp; read
                    &amp; read &#8211; but the Devil a bit can I remember. I have
                    given all possible attention &amp; attempted to command
                    volition &#8211; no! the eye read &#8211; the lips pronounced &#8211; I
                    understood &#8211; I re read it &#8211; it <del rend="strikethrough">is</del> was very clear &#8211; I remembered the page &#8211; the
                    sentence &#8211; but close the book &#8211; &amp; all was gone! Were I
                    an independant man &#8211; even on less than I now possess. I
                    should long since have made the blessed bonfire &amp;
                    rejoiced that I was free &amp; contented. I need not tell
                    you this is only for your own eye. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I suffer a good deal from illness. &amp; in a
