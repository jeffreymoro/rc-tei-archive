                    is nothing more than old Gatholonabes, tamed down to suit

<p rend="indent1"> Grosvenor I think seriously of going abroad.
                    my complaint, so am I told by the opinion of many medical
                    men is wholly a diseased sensibility – (mind you – physical
                    sensibility –) disordering the functions now of the heart –
                    now of the intestines – &amp; gradually debilitating me.
                    climate is the obvious remedy. in my present state to
                    attempt to undergo the confinement of legal application were
                    actual suicide. I am anxious to be well – &amp; to attempt
                    the profession. <hi rend="ital">much</hi> in it I never
                    shall do – sometimes my principles will stand in my way –
                    sometimes the want of readiness which I felt from the first
                    – a want which I always know in company, &amp; never in
                    solitude &amp; silence. howbeit I will make the attempt –
                    but mark you, if by stage writing, or any other writing, I
                    can acquire independance, I will not make the sacrifice of
                    happiness it will inevitably cost me. I love the country – I
                    love study – devotedly I love it. but in legal studies it is
                    only the subtitly of the mind that is exercised – however I
                    need not philippicize – &amp; it is too late to veer about.
                    in 96 I might have chosen physic &amp; succeeded in it – I
                    caught at the first plank – &amp; mist the great mast in my
                    reach. perhaps I may enable myself to swim by &amp; by.
                    Grosvenor I have nothing of what the world call ambition. I
                    never thought it possible that I could be a great Lawyer – I
                    should as soon expect to be the Man in the Moon. my views
                    were bounded – my hopes – to an income of 500 a year, of
                    which I could lay by half to effect my escape with. <hi rend="ital">possibly</hi> the stage may exceed this,
                    &amp; that at an expence of time on my part allowing three
                    parts of the year to other labours. I am not indolent – I
                    loathe indolence. but indeed reading law is laborious
                    indolence. it is thrashing straw. I have read &amp; read
                    &amp; read – but the Devil a bit can I remember. I have
                    given all possible attention &amp; attempted to command
                    volition – no! the eye read – the lips pronounced – I
                    understood – I re read it – it <del rend="strikethrough">is</del> was very clear – I remembered the page – the
                    sentence – but close the book – &amp; all was gone! Were I
                    an independant man – even on less than I now possess. I
                    should long since have made the blessed bonfire &amp;
                    rejoiced that I was free &amp; contented. I need not tell
                    you this is only for your own eye. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> I suffer a good deal from illness. &amp; in a
                    way hardly understandable by those in health. I start from
                    sleep as if death had seizd me – I am sensible of every
                    pulsation – &amp; compelld to attend to the motion of my
                    heart, till that attention disturbs it, the pain in my side
                    is I think lessened – nor do I at all think it was
                    consumption. organic affection it could not have been – else
                    it had been constant – &amp; a heart disease would not have
                    been perceived <hi rend="ital">there</hi>. I must go abroad,
                    &amp; recruit under better skies. not to Lisbon. I will see
                    something new – &amp; something better than Portugueze. Ask
                        <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> about
                    Italy – about Trieste – &amp; the way thro Vienna – &amp;
                    say something to him on my part expressive of respect – of a
                    wish one day to see more of him. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> But of these plans you shall know more when
                    they are more moulded into form. in the meantime I must
                    raise the supplies – &amp; for this purpose there is
                    Thalaba. my expedition will not be a ruinous one, &amp; it
                    shall be as oeconomical as it ought. I will at least <del rend="strikethrough">xxx xxxx</del> return w[MS torn]
