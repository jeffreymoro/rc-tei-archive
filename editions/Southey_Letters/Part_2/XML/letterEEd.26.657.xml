                    for of course I cannot remove many books for so short a

                    opinion. it is delightful poetry badly put together. an
                    exquisite picture in a clumsy frame. Margaret is a noble
                    girl &#8211; the other characters not so well conceived. A better
                    imitation of old language I have never seen &#8211; but was the
                    language of the serving men ever the language of nature?
                        <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref> has
                    copied the old writers &#8211; I suspect that they did not copy
                    existing characters. those quaint turns of words &amp;
                    quainter contortions of thought never could be produced by
                    ignorant men. the main incident of the play &#8211; (the
                    discovery) is too foolish &#8211; the effect produced too
                    improbable. Withal so beautiful is the serious dialogue that
                    it more than redeems the story. most I like the concluding
                    scene.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am half amused &amp; half provoked by the
                    civilities which my Secretaryship procures me. &amp; receive
                    them with an accurate sense of their value. I on my part
                    also am more civil perhaps than usual. my wish is to get
                    abroad, &amp; I am old enough never to kick away the stone
                    which I may want to step upon. abroad I must go &#8211; so says my
                    head &amp; my whole intestinal canal &amp; my inclination.
                    Lisbon of course is the place desirable. I would compound
                    for Madrid. it is a hateful city &#8211; &amp; only its books can
                    atone for a bad situation both as to earth &amp; heaven. If
