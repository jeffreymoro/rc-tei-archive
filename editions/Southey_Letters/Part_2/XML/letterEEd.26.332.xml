        <p rend="indent1"> Your letters have all reached me safely; &amp; this is the
                    earliest possible answer to the last enquiring one. I ought to have acknowledged
                    the receipt of that with the draft &#8211; but you know not how busy I have been in
                    revolutionizing the house.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have Bootes Suit at Law,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Boote (d. 1782), <title>An Historical Treatise of an Action or Suit
                            at Law</title> (1766).</note> &amp; after reading it find it a book to
                    be referred to, &amp; not to be remembered; for to recollect so many formul&#230;, so
                    little differing from each other, can only be attained by much practice, unless
                    indeed a man were gifted with the verbal memory of Jedediah Buxton.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Jedediah Buxton (1707&#8211;1772; <title>DNB</title>)
                        was renowned for his abilities at mental arithmetic.</note> The book points
                    out much that wants reform in the practice. the man would do much good who
                    should be the Reformer of English law.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall take your advice respecting Milton; &#8722; it may I think be
                    doubted whether a poet (allowing him enough previous knowledge of the best
                    authors) would most improve himself by studying the best writers, or reading the
                    obscure ones. I speak of epic writers. I read ten books of the Italia Liberata
                    when at <ref target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref>, &amp; Trissino taught
                    me very clearly what ought to be avoided in epic poetry.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Gian Giorgio Trissino (1478&#8211;1550), <title>Italia Liberata dai
                            Goti</title> (1547&#8211;1548).</note> it is astonishing how servilely these
                    fellows imitate the established writers. The great advantage of Madocs story is
                    that the whole &amp; all its parts are unlike any thing before it. Every
                    incident appears to me original.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Who is this Welshman about to publish the MS.S.? will he be
                    blockhead enough to print them without translations &#8722; for the Magazine gives no
                    intimation on this head.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Monthly
                            Magazine</title>, 5 (June 1798), 445 had announced &#8216;that a gentleman, a
                        native of Wales, has generously resolved to publish, at his own expence, all
                        the antient Welsh manuscripts&#8217;. The &#8216;gentleman&#8217; was Owen Jones (1741&#8211;1814),
                        a wealthy, Welsh-born, London furrier and antiquarian. The result was
                            <title>The Myvyrian Archaiology</title> (1801&#8211;1807). It did not include
                        translations from the Welsh. Southey used it in the notes to
                            <title>Madoc</title> (1805).</note> If such be his intention, the scheme
                    will drop. I am much interested in its being carried into execution.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Did you ever see Percys translation of a Chinese novel?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Percy (1729&#8211;1811;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>Hau Kiou Choann or The Pleasing
                            History</title> (1761).</note> it is very extraordinary that such a book
                    should have lain nearly 40 years on the booksellers shelves in such obscurity.
                    it is worth a dozen such books as Sir G. Stauntons.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">George Staunton, 1st Baronet (1737&#8211;1801; <title>DNB</title>),
                            <title>An Authentic Account of the Earl of Macartney&#8217;s Embassy from the
                            King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China</title> (1797).</note> the
                    British Critic<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        be republished.</note> has the merit of making it known.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A very good work has passed thro my hands called a Series of
                    Plays exemplifying the effects of the stronger passions. the author (whoever he
                    may be) bids fair to become an honour to English literature.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Joanna Baillie (1762&#8211;1851; <title>DNB</title>),
