                    may well imagine. It is some time since I have been astonished, &amp; I believe
                    nothing less than the skies falling could astonish me &#8211; but after travelling all
                    night &#8211; &amp; being seasick on the way, she arrived here in good spirits, health
                    as good as when you left her &#8211; &amp; so we are all going to the play to night to

                        chalk drawings of Southey and other members of his circle, including his
                        mother, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Lamb and William Wordsworth.

                    &amp; I should be much surprized at any wrong &#8211; or immoral action in him &#8211; but

                    despize &#8211; he is full of them. I do not respect him, &amp; I cannot love, where I
                    cannot respect. but if any exertion of mine could serve him, if a leg or an arm
                    would be of use &#8211; I should be ready always to proffer myself to assist him. My

                    estimate men according to their genius. I want men who will act with me, not

        <p rend="indent1"> I was surprized this morning in looking at the large play bills,
                    to see a grand ballet announced as in preparation called Joan of Arc &#8211; or the
                    Maid of Orleans.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;An Entire New Grand
                        Historical Ballet of Action, called Joan of Arc, or the Maid of Orleans&#8217;,
                        was announced widely in the London Press at this time (e.g. in <title>The
                            Oracle</title>, <title>Star</title>, <title>True Briton</title>, 26
                        January 1798). It was first performed at Covent Garden on 12 February
                        1798.</note> methinks they should send me a ticket of admittance. be this
                    said ballet good, bad, or indifferent, it will be an excellent advertisement for
                    my book.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of
                            <title>Joan of Arc</title>, published in 1798.</note> but when that book
                    will be out, as I have no telescope view of futurity, it is not possible for me
                    to guess.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You naval men may amuse yourselves in speculating upon
                    &lt;guns-&gt; gun-boats &#8211; rafts, &amp; all the curious inventions that keep
                    London in alarm.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">In early 1798 the
                        build-up of French troops in the Channel ports led to widespread invasion
                        scares. One of the more bizarre manifestations of these fears was the rumour
                        that the French had constructed a giant raft that could transport 60,000
                        troops across the Channel.</note>
