<p rend="indent1"> I did not receive your letter till yesterday evening. to <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> I shall immediately write,
                    advising him, unless any situation quite to his liking should occur, to ship
                    himself for Bristol. poor fellow – I will do what I can for him, but God knows
                    my power is not much &amp; I see no end to embarrassment after embarrassment.
                    the first &amp; most promising scheme is to tow him after that good ship the

                    inclination to serve him. If that fails (for the papers speak of a change in

                        as The Speaker, 1802-1817.</note> we must either apprentice him, or look out
                    some clerks place. It was a rare fortune that gave me this years salary from

                    could have weathered it. with the year it will end – &amp; I shall endeavour to
                    get some birth abroad – Spain – Italy – Egypt – anywhere to be warm. I am sorry

                    offence at my letter, which was certainly a very proper &amp; respectful one. he

                    suppose will put him to school, even if his other relations do nothing. I do not
                    yet decide upon the old mans meaning as he is too angry to be understood. but if
