                    yours &#8211; I have been a twenty days journey into the country &#8211;
                    to Torres Vedras, Caldas, Alcoba&#231;a, Batalha, Leiria,

                    very exact, &amp; I believe as good as prints can be &#8211; but
                    it is only eye-sight that can give a competent idea of that
                    most miraculous building. I allude most to the unfinished
                    chapel of Emanuel<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Manoel I (1469-1521, King of Portugal
                        1495-1521).</note> &#8211; the great Emanuel, who seems to
                    have bestowed the whole plunder of the East, in collecting
                    to Portugal the whole genius of Europe. The largest possible
                    scale upon which a view could be taken would necessarily
                    lose all the smaller ornaments &#8211; &amp; every ornament is of
                    that perfect workmanship &amp; delicacy, &amp; in a taste so
                    harmonious to the whole, that it cannot be omitted with
                    destroying the effect of the whole. In every other Gothic
                    building <del rend="strikethrough">I have</del> (florid
                    Gothic as this is) I have seen ornaments crowded together,
                    neither beautiful seperately nor grouped &#8211; the grotesque is
                    usually prevalent &#8211; but here like every thing in Emanuels
                    reign &#8211; it is as if Rafaelle<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Raffaelo Sanzio da Urbino (1483-1520),
                        Italian Renaissance painter.</note> had designed Gothic
                    ornaments. there is that perfect elegance. the hollow work
                    is so finely executed &#8211; that one princely personage about
                    fourscore years ago, &amp; the present Queen<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Maria I (1734-1816, Queen of
                        Portugal 1777-1816).</note> also &#8211; <hi rend="ital">commanded a part to be hammered away</hi> to convince
                    themselves that it was not a plaister joined to the stone! </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The perfect preservation of the stone is
                    quite unaccountable. it has stood for 300 years unroofed
                    &amp; exposed to the weather &#8211; yet the work is as sharp as
                    if the chissel had just left it. not a blade of grass or of
                    moss has rooted there, nor one lichen cankered it. I have
                    heard it surmized that the architect by some unknown varnish
                    hardened the stone. stone of the same colour &amp; which
                    coming from a near quarry may be supposed to be the same &#8211;
                    moulders away in half a century. &#8211; We have larger buildings
                    in England, &amp; churches perhaps as fine &#8211; not finer, nor
                    do I recollect any of such simple grandeur. but the
                    unfinished chapels of Emanuel are certainly of unique
                    excellence. there is nothing elsewhere like them.</p>
