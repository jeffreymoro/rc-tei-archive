                    neither recollect the time or subject of my last letter. yet

                    &amp; expressed a full satisfaction with all the
                    arrangements that have been made for him. On my return to
                    Lisbon I found a letter from him, a manly &amp; sensible
                    letter, of a spirit that anticipated success &amp; bids fair
                    to deserve &amp; obtain it. &#8211; I drew on you yesterday again.
                    as I have no propensity to extravagance it is useless to
                    regret expences unavoidable &amp; well bestowed. the work of
                    twelvemonths in England will balance my accounts with <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> you, &amp; again set me

                    laughed with us by day &amp; enjoyed the scenery, &amp; at

                    da Cruz, a village under Ourem, mid-way between Leiria &amp;
                    Thomar. the road is little frequented, &amp; the only two
                    rooms at the Estalagem were employed as warehouses for

                    &amp; I slept <hi rend="ital">sweetly</hi> under it. the
                    next morning among the villagers who were standing to gaze
                    at us I saw a schoolboy lingering with his book under his
                    arm. a fine boy about 12 years old. I looked at his book &#8211;
                    the only one he learns. it was &#8220;Directions for a converted

                    mind wasted. he is immersed in mills &amp; wheels &amp; the
                    dirty work of a manufactory. I grew intimate enough to

        <p rend="indent1"> Waterhouse &amp; I left our party there &amp;
                    proceeded to Abrantes. the passage of the Zezere was the
                    only circumstance interesting on the way. it is a fine river
                    &#8211; like all mountain streams of irregular &amp; untameable
                    force. in summer it is fordable. in winter the ferry price
                    varies according to the resistance of the current from one
                    vintem to nine. it then enters the Tagus with equal waters &#8211;
                    sometimes with a larger body &#8211; for as the rains have fallen
                    heavier North or East, the one river with its rush almost
                    stagnates the other. We crost it in its tamest part; hills
                    of our Clifton height were its banks covered with cistus
                    &amp; heath &amp; the fragrant plants of this country, the
                    water beautifully clear, flowing over sand. A little below
                    its junction we all embarked &#8211; at Barquinha, &amp; returned
                    down the Tagus thro flat &amp; objectless shores. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I would speak of Batalha if I were certain

                    situated &#8211; nor a view so altogether glorious as we witnessed
                    when approaching it. We had been well wetted the preceeding
                    day from Pombal to Condeixa. the Sun of course was welcome &#8211;
                    it shone upon one snowy summit of the Estrella &#8211; the
                    farthest object visible &#8211; &amp; down the southern boundary
                    of mountains clouds were floating so beamy white &#8211; that they
                    seemed like light condensed to a visible shape &amp;
                    substance. the city itself with its fine convents shining on
                    an eminence over the Mondego, now in the fullness of its
                    waters &#8211; Our letters there procured us much attention &amp;
                    we saw every thing. for the students &#8211; I never elsewhere saw
                    such a mob of impudent blackguards</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is an actual scarcity in the country.

                    of any alteration for the worst thus however it is. they now

                    the women also have learnt the true London alehouse manners.
                    Of their charges you may judge by this &#8211; from Leiria to
                    Coimbra we were four persons. on that road going &amp;
                    returning our nightly charges always ran from 3//000 to
                    3//600. at Leiria our number was exactly doubled &#8211; &amp; all
                    the rest of the way the expences of the doubled party never
                    exceeded 2//500. &#8211; At the Fabric<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">A large glass and crystal factory at
