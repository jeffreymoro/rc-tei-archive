        <p rend="indent1"> You will see by the date above, that I have travelled westward
                    from London. I had some thought of advancing to Norwich, but the plan which I am
                    about to communicate has made me delay that till I be settled nearer.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> The review of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lathoms Poem<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s comment is obscure. Diana Lathom
                        (dates unknown), n&#233;e Ganning, was in 1803 the estranged wife of Francis
                        Lathom (1774-1832; <title>DNB</title>). There is no evidence that Mrs Lathom
                        wrote, let alone published, poetry. &#8216;Mrs Lathom&#8217; could, then, be a joke.
                        Francis Lathom was a habitu&#233; of Norwich literary circles and probably knew
                        William Taylor. &#8216;Mrs&#8217; could refer to Latham&#8217;s rumoured homosexuality. In
                        which case, the &#8216;lost&#8217; review was possibly of <title>Orlando and Seraphina;
                            or, the Funeral Pile, an Heroic Drama</title> , published in 1800 but

                    could have been selected because of least general or national concern, but that
                    there was cause enough for war. my belief is that invasion will be attempted &#8211;
