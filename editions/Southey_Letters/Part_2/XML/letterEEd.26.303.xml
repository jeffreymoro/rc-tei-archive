        <p rend="indent1"> I was on Monday last summoned to Bath in consequence of an
                    alarming increase in <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</ref>
                    illness. She had taken fresh cold, &amp; tho I found her somewhat amended by
                    bleeding still her state of health appears both to myself &amp; the Physician
                    who attends her,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> to
                    require a speedy removal to a better climate. I wrote immediately to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>, trusting that he is
                    safely arrived but almost I fear that this may be too late. the hopes I yet
                    entertain of her recovery are only founded upon the sudden amendment which
                    change of scene &amp; of surrounding circumstances has heretofore effected in
                    her.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> also is very unwell. she has
                    now good advice, &amp; air as good as this country can furnish. these are
                    unpleasant subjects, &amp; I have said enough.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> tells me he has seen you,
                    &amp; that you agree with him in thinking a house fit for the purpose may be
                    found ready built. I doubt whether you can find one with land enough annexed,
                    &amp; well situated for our purpose. it is however worth trying. Mr Martin has
                    opened a wide field for enquiry by proposing to appropriate the useless funds of
                    charity to new institutions.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Matthew
                        Martin (1748&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>), secretary to the Society for
                        Bettering the Condition and Improving the Comforts of the Poor. The Society
                        had been founded in December 1796.</note> the Authority of Parliament would
                    be necessary for this, but the Society<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Society for bettering the Condition of the Poor&#8217; inserted in another hand,
                        probably Warter&#8217;s.</note> of which he is a member, have influence enough to
                    effect it; &amp; were a general enquiry set on foot into the application of the
                    funds left for charitable purposes, much iniquity would be brought to light,
                    &amp; a fund would be discovered of very great value to relieve the lower
                    classes. Of late I have been making some enquiries into one charity at Bath,
                    where an estate left to support 13 poor persons has increased to the value of
                    100,000 pounds; the paupers receive little more than they ever did, &amp; the
                    remainder of the 5000&#163; per annum, goes to nobody knows who. The minister who has
                    their Chapel is said to share 2000 annually, &amp; a rascally Lawyer picks 500 a
                    year out of the spoils.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had
                        earlier in the year written to Richard Locke (1737-1806; <title>DNB</title>), enquiring about the financial
                        mismanagement of the Blue Alms Charity, Bath; see Robert Southey to James
                        Losh, 28 March [1798], Letter 299. In 1792, the master of the Blue Alms
                        Charity was Rev. Dr Chapman (dates unknown), a Canon of Bristol
                            Cathedral,<title> The New Bath Directory, for the Year, 1792</title>
                        (Bath, 1792), p. 9. He possibly also acted as its minister. The lawyer is
                        unidentified.</note> In enquiring into this iniquity, other peculations as
                    enormous have been pointed out to me. The state of the poor requires some
                    effectual relief, &amp; the nation would find funds that would go far towards
                    relieving them, by merely correcting such abuses as these.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is no reason why the House of Commons should not do this.
                    but I have the example of the Slave Trade before my eyes, &amp; have ceased to
                    expect any thing good from that quarter.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The momentum against the slave trade that had built up in the late 1780s
                        had been dissipated by the outbreak of war with revolutionary France in 1793
                        and on 3 April 1798 the House of Commons had rejected by 87 votes to 83 a
                        motion to give William Wilberforce (1759&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>) leave to
                        introduce a bill abolishing the slave trade.</note> It may however be

                    such parts of his character as need not be known. they show us the cravings of a
                    heart that wanted &amp; deserved an equal companion, &amp; which when plunging
                    into sensuality felt its own degradation &amp; the emptiness of sensual
                    enjoyment. There seemd a perpetual struggle between his soul &amp; body. I do
                    not look upon Rousseau with blind admiration, he was a miserable man &amp; I
                    think of him with feelings of regret &amp; compassion that make him the more
                    interesting. Read his Levite of Ephraim, with the exception of two similes, it
                    is in my judgement a perfect poem.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Rousseau, <title>Le Levite d&#8217;Ephraim</title> (1781).</note> &amp; read his
