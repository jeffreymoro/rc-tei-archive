        <p rend="indent1"> I have been for some time in expectation of hearing from you, but
                    you probably have been waiting for a new direction, &amp; many employments have
                    kept me silent. It was not till the Thursday evening preceding quarter day that
                    a house was found at all suitable for us, &amp; you can hardly conceive in what
                    perpetual occupation I have been since we took possession. pulling down &amp;
                    putting up; - upholsterer &#8211; carpenter &#8211; mason &#8211; painter &#8211; paperer in succession,
                    till of a filthy old barn looking house we have made a clean &amp; comfortable
                    dwelling. It is at <ref target="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</ref>, a village
                    two miles from Bristol, in the pleasantest part of this country. there is a
                    tolerable garden behind the house, in which excepting some half dozen rose
                    bushes, every thing is calculated for use. the view over the garden is very
                    beautiful, a fertile &amp; woody vale, bounded on each side by hills, &amp;
                    terminated by a range of hills ten miles distant. the most interesting parts of
                    the country are near at hand, &amp; ten minutes walk would convey me to one of
                    the most beautiful glens I ever saw.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> here I begin to feel myself at home, &amp; am already enough
                    acquainted with the house to go about in the dark; this is the criterion I think
                    of intimacy with a dwelling place. to day my books are to arrive; two windows
                    that have been blocked up on account of the tax,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Since 1696 all houses in England had been liable to pay a tax
                        of 2 shillings per annum. However, if they had more than 10 windows (7 from
                        1766) the occupier paid double this rate. In consequence, many householders
                        had blocked up windows to avoid paying the higher duty.</note> form two
                    convenient recesses for them, I have knockd up some shelves there, &amp; when my
                    box arrives from <ref target="places.html#Cottles">Cottles</ref> I shall need no
                    other society. The Chinese have a good proverb &#8220;To read an excellent book the
                    first time is to gain a new friend: to read over one we have perused before, is
                    like meeting with an old friend.&#8221;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Oliver

                    note in it, chiefly from the Spanish reply to the Sermon. the Spanish Jew has
                    replied with learning &amp; moderation, &amp; I strongly suspect that the most

                    this book: I allude to the supposed defence of an Atheist who finds his mistake
