                        the review says &#8216;of course no hint is given of the massacre at Jaffa, and
                        the more atrocious tale of the poisoned soldiers&#8217;. Napoleon Bonaparte
                        (1769-1821, First Consul 1799-1804, Emperor of the French 1804-1814) had
                        conquered Jaffa in March 1799, ordering the execution of 3,000 Turkish
                        soldiers. When he evacuated Jaffa on 27 May 1799 he ordered 50 or so
                        soldiers who could not accompany the army because they were too ill with
                        plague to be poisoned with laudanum &#8211; though there is no record of any of
                        them dying from this &#8216;treatment&#8217;.</note> this has been omitted. I tell you
                    these as anecdotes how these things are carried on. for the whole business of
                    reviewing I connect as little pride with it as pleasure, &amp; am perfectly

                        his verse survive. Some of it exhorts the Spartans to bravery and was turned
                        into marching songs by the Spartan army. Possibly Wynn had suggested Southey
                        should translate some of Tyrtaeus&#8217;s verses to aid the patriotic effort in
