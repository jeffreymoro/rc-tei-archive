                    the newspapers would have indeed alarmed me. I have seen
                    your name in the Sun, Star &amp; Courier as being on board

                        newspapers had reported the presence of a Mr Williams
                        Wynn on board, Southey had confused his friend with his
                        older brother, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (1772&#8211;1840;
                            <title>DNB</title>). The passengers had also
