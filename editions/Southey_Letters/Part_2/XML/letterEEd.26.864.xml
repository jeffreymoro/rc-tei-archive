        <p rend="indent1"> I have been very much vexed by <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref>. As if
                    he had not behaved sufficiently ill already there came
                    yesterday a letter, by the handwriting &amp; shape from some
                    very low tradesman &#8211; inclosing a draft on me for acceptance
                    for five pounds thirteen shillings, saying that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> E. S.</ref> had informed the holder I was
                    advised. this letter had been directed to Bristol. As you
                    may suppose I was as much perplexed as provoked &#8211; on
                    consulting &amp; deliberating what to do I determined not to
                    accept the bill, that a lesson now may save him from one of
                    more serious consequences hereafter. &amp; in fact if I once
                    suffered him to begin the boy has so little shame &amp; so
                    little principle that I should never be safe. To the holder
                    I said that I was at a loss to conceive what circumstances
                    could have justified a respectable tradesman in cashing a
                    bill for a boy of fifteen. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> will be
                    obliged to refund what money is left or return what articles
                    he may have bought &#8211; &amp; the fright &amp; mortification
                    will do him good &#8211; if any thing can do him good, but indeed
                    I have &amp; long have had a very hopeless opinion of him.
                    Clothes he cannot have wanted, having had a plain suit just
                    before he went to sea, &#8211; nor if he did want them can he be
                    excused for procuring them without any consent or knowledge
                    &amp; taking up money in my name with a lie in his mouth
                    that I was advised. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To him I said that for every worthy purpose
                    he might depend upon my assistance &amp; exertion to the
                    utmost of <del rend="strikethrough">power</del> my power but
                    that I never would become an accomplice in any wrong action
                    that he might commit by conniving or abetting it when done.
                    I had before sent him a one pound bill to pay for his
                    washing (for it was not right to trust him with more) &amp;
                    should as soon as ever a ship could be obtained, supply him
                    with means to get on board. this lesson will teach him that
                    I can act decidedly. &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I think it very probable that when he is
                    again got on board, he will again leave his situation &amp;
                    go to <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his
                        Aunt</ref> &#8211; that they will quarrel again that at last
                    he will turn sharper or strolling-player. his destiny will
                    be better than his deserts if he ends in the last. You I
                    know will hope better things, but I cannot shut my eyes nor
                    disbelieve my own intuitive fore feelings. When <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>
                    returned last from England he said to me he never knew a boy
                    like him turn out well, or <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> be good for anything. if you knew how very
                    reservd <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        Uncle</ref> is respecting any of his family you would
                    feel how strongly he must have been impressed to say
                    this.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When he gets on board if he continues I will
                    take care to supply him tho I pinch myself let me know what
                    you should think sufficient to allow him. pinched I shall be
                    to do it &#8211; for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> is a heavy weight upon me &#8211; &amp; I am
                    already much in debt to <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> on his account. he himself has no
                    feeling upon the subject, but spends away &amp; incurs
                    debts, careless so they &lt;be&gt; paid with what difficulty
                    the money is to be f<del rend="strikethrough">aid</del>ound.
                    I hope he will mend at Edinburgh as he promises &#8211; but I have
                    little faith in his promises.</p>

          <date when="1803-12-10">Saturday Dec. 10.</date> So far I had
                    written yesterday. this evening a Gunsmith of Exeter sends
                    me another draft of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> for three pounds &#8211; &amp; the boy himself
                    incloses me besides all this a Taylor bill of eleven pounds
                    sixteen &#8211; to show me he says that he has not been
                    extravagant. It is indeed very fortunate that I acted as I
                    did in the first instance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God bless you <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>. I am grieved
                    to fret &amp; fever you as this needs must do. write &#8211; &amp;
                    expect to hear again &#8211; I trust on pleasanter subjects in a
                    few days.</p>
