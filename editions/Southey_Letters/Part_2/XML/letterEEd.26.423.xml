        <p rend="indent1"> Since my last I have visited <ref target="places.html#Burton">Burton</ref>. I went on foot, sleeping at Shaftsbury.
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</ref> lives within a few miles of that town, &amp; if his character had
               been as interesting as his poetry I would not have passed without seeing a man to whom I am indebted for many hours of pleasure, &amp;
               many interesting &amp; I may add good &amp; meliorating feelings. to have seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</ref>, the careless fine gentleman, would have
               destroyed the charm of his productions, which have already half lost their effect from my knowledge that they did not proceed, that
               they could not proceed, from the habitual character of the man.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We do not get possession of our cottage till Michaelmas.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">29 September
                  1799.</note> the place is at present habitable, we must be there to make it comfortable, by the help of papering white-limed walls,
               &amp; furnishing them with books &amp; the paraphernalia of leisure &amp; literature. our rent will not exceed, if it come up to, eight
               pounds &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe</ref> takes the premises &amp; keeps to himself a field
               belonging to them. there is a garden, which we shall find unstock&#8217;d, but which stands well &#8211; it is sufficiently large to hold
               gooseberry &amp; currant bushes for a great devourer of fruit-pies, to raise cabbages &amp; potatoes enough for our consumption &amp;
               allow room for a few flowers next the house, for I would not have my eyes &amp; nose starved in the country. there is a fishpond,
               supplied by a spring that rises very near the house. before the door is room enough for a few flowers &amp; shrubs between the house
               &amp; road &#8211; at present the <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> space is open &amp; stoned. I look forward to many pleasant summers
               there, as much as a man can look forward who has experienced something of the uncertainty of future prospects.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the interval till Michaelmas <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, her younger sister &amp; I
               go into Devonshire, to the Northern Coast. Ilfracombe is the place we look to for our longest residence. I am told the scenery is wild
               &amp; impressive &#8211; there I expect to finish my play, which from the moment I quit this place, &amp; our departure is fixd for Tuesday
               or Wednesday, will become the great object of my thoughts.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Madoc is finished; even in its uncorrected state, this is a matter of much pleasure to me, &amp; I will lose as little
               time as I can in correcting &amp; fitting it for publication. if I live it is my determination not to publish it for many years &#8211; I
               would build upon it my after reputation, &amp; correct in the maturity of life what was produced in the warmth of younger years: but I
               am anxious to have it ready because in case of my death this work might be made of important value to my family; &amp; to neglect it
               would be like neglecting to make a will where the property would otherwise be improperly disposed of.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A heavily revised version of <title>Madoc</title> was eventually published in 1805.</note> you will I think see this
               in the same point of view.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At present it extends to fifteen books. but in one part of my plan I have failed, &amp; so compleatly that it will not
               require the sacrifice of more than three hundred lines to alter it: this was the attempt to identify Madoc with Mango Capac.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Manco Capac, in legend the first Inca. The connection between Madoc and Capac was suggested in John
                  Williams (<hi rend="ital">c</hi>.1732&#8211;1795; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom</title>, 2 vols
                  (Edinburgh, 1789), II, pp. 424&#8211;425.</note> therefore I mean to change the scene from South to North America, to Florida whither
               probably Madoc went.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">For the idea that Madoc settled in Florida, see John Williams (1727&#8211;1798),
                     <title>An Enquiry into the Truth of the Tradition, Concerning the Discovery of America, by Prince Madog ab Owen Gwynedd, About
                     the Year, 1170</title> (London, 1791), p. 48.</note> I have to graft the story on the N. American manners &#8211; in themselves very
               striking, but I have but a very dim sort of second sight into the how this is to be done, &amp; as usual find the want of books. Mango
               Capac will serve me for the subject of a seperate poem hereafter, &amp; now amuses me with vaguer outlines &amp; views of the
                  future.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey failed in his ambition to write a poem about Manco Capac.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The hours which I gain by early rising are appropriated to a poem which I write with a view to publication &amp;
               immediate emolument &#8211; you have I believe heard me mention it &#8211; The Destruction of the Dom Daniel.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The early, working-title for <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801); see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed.

          <p>&lt;If you could meet with a set of Niebuhrs Travels in French for me I should be much obliged to you. I want the book for my
                  Dom-Daniel &#8211; &amp; the translation is miserably mutilated.&gt; <note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">French editions included
                     Carsten Niebuhr (1733&#8211;1815), <title>Description de l&#8217;Arabie</title>, trans. E. L. Mourier (1774) and <title>Voyage en Arabie

                        Arabia</title>, trans. Robert Heron (1792), but this was abridged, much to Southey&#8217;s disappointment.</note>
