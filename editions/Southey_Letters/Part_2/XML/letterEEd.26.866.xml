                        brother</ref> had procured his regular discharge &#8211; &amp;
                    said nothing about his reestablishment in the Suffisante

                    me she is sent abroad. But a worse business has come out
                    since. the young rascal has drawn two bills upon me, one for
                    three pounds to pay <hi rend="ital">a gunmaker</hi> &#8211; the
                    other for 5&#8211;13 &#8211; I know not for what, &#8211; &amp; moreover
                    modestly sends me a taylors bill for two complete suits

                    11&#8211;16&#8211;3&#189; to convince me he says that he has not been
                    extravagant. Of course I have protested his drafts &amp;
                    refused to pay his bills, &amp; he &amp; <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</ref> &amp;

                        his acquaintance is unclear.</note> may manage the

        <p rend="indent1"> All this I wrote to <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">May</ref> by the last post.
                    It is clear enough that he is completely adrift &amp; that
                    if he do not take to the sea he will go on as a sharper till
                    he probably comes to the proper &amp; customary termination
                    of such a trade. I think he should be shipped off for some
                    foreign station, or if he be too bad for the navy, for some
                    long voyage. that he can turn out well is utterly
                    impossible. I however must not omit doing all I can to put
                    him in a fair way &#8211; as for embarrassing myself for him that
                    I will never do. I have already incurred a debt to <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">May</ref> by what I have
                    done to help on <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> in

                        and was revising it for publication. It did not appear
                        until 1805.</note> to clear off. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> These things however shall not give me any
                    permanent vexation. they will needs irritate &amp; inflame
                    at first, but I have a stock of practical stoicism which has
                    often stood me in good stead. You assigned a cause for the
                    tone of my former letter which probably does exist but
                    assuredly did not exhilirate me. it is to me far more a
                    cause of fear than of hope. I would rather forego delight
                    than hazard tranquillity. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I mean to publish Madoc next winter &amp; to
                    try to have the whole profits myself without letting the
                    booksellers go halves. if you can get me some subscribers I
                    know you will. a guinea for a quarto to be paid on delivery.
                    But if this mode of publication sound or feel unworthily to
                    you &#8211; tell me so &#8211; &amp; my wares shall go to market. This
                    will clear me with the world. I should have had money to
                    spare but for such perpetual drains. Sic vos non vobis<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Thus you [do what is]
