                    might be collected. Ask also if they know any thing of Timbuctoo, the city which
                    is sought after with so much curiosity, as being the centre of the internal
                    commerce of Africa. This is the way to collect facts respecting the Native
                    Africans &amp; their country &#8211; I would engage in twelve months were I in the
                    West Indies to get materials for a volume that should contain more real
                    importancies than all travellers have yet brought home. Ask also what beasts are
                    in their country. they will not know English names for them but can describe
                    them so that you will know them &#8211; the Unicorn is believed to exist by me as well
                    as by many others &#8211; you will not mistake [MS obscured] the Rhinoceros for one.
                    enquire also for a land crocodile who grows to the length of six eight or ten
                    feet &#8211; having a tongue slit like a snakes. my Portugueze speak of such animals
                    in South Africa &#8211; they may exist in the Western Provinces.</p>

                    curious facts respecting early navigation have come to light. I find the needle
                    &amp; the quadrant used in the Indian seas before any European vessel had ever
                    reachd them. &#8211; &amp; what surprizes me more the same knowledge of soundings in
                    our own seas in 1400 as at present &#8211; which is very strange, for that practice
                    implies a long series of registered experiences. The more I read the more do I
                    find the necessity of going to old authors for information, &amp; the sad
                    ignorance &amp; dishonesty of our boasted historians. If God do but give me life
