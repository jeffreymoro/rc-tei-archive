                        Southey dates this letter as &#8216;May 4.99&#8217;. But its contents, including
                        references to the recently-published Annual Anthology (1799),
                        Southey&#8217;s walking-tour in north Somerset and his new lodgings in Exeter, all
                        date the letter to early September 1799. </p>

                    fullness of an organ-swell upon the feelings. I have felt it from the rythm of

                    from the soul of the poetry, arising from the beauty of the body only &#8211; I
                    believe a man who did not understand a word of it would feel pleasure &amp;
                    emotion at hearing such lines read with the tone of a poet. the character drawn
                    of Theora is I think out of place &#8211; it is not a common character. &amp; the
                    story is no ways influenced by it. the passion to be excited is <hi rend="ital">pity</hi>, not admiration.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must not press the subject of poetry upon you &#8211; only do not
                    lose the feeling, &amp; the habit of seeing all things with a poets eye. at
                    Bristol you have a good society &#8211; but not a man who knows any thing of poetry.

                    apprenticeship, or involves the necessity of such multifarious knowledge. I want
                    an equal reader to judge my poems, one whose knowledge &amp; taste is
                    commensurate with mine, who has thought as much upon the subject &#8211; or else one
