        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have for sometime past been thinking
                    seriously &amp; anxiously upon the future. if you knew the
                    nature of my own talents as well as I know them myself &#8211; if
                    you had oftener seen them tried in conversational argument,
                    you would I think be convinced that they are <del rend="strikethrough">here</del> &lt;<del rend="strikethrough">the work</del> less&gt; calculated
                    for common law than for any other possible employment. is
                    not the chancery line<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Civil law cases held before the Court of
                        Chancery.</note> equally profitable? as for ambition it
                    must be set out of the question &#8211; it is impossible I should
                    ever feel it, my object is profit &amp; not distinction. but
                    in common law I am not equal to the coarse brow beating
                    methods of practise, &#8211; &amp; for the criminal part I could
                    not take any share in <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> a
                    case of life &amp; death without <del rend="strikethrough">forfi</del> sacrificing my feelings &amp; my peace of
                    mind. why not chancery? I will labour with all possible
                    diligence &amp; with conscientious assiduity &#8211; &amp; will
                    not this procure me practice?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am uneasy at time <del rend="strikethrough">on</del> unavoidably lost. now better &#8211; now worse &#8211;
                    there is danger that hypochondriacal feelings may take root
                    in me, &amp; the sooner I adopt some efficacious remedy the
                    better. it is better to go abroad for twelvemonths &#8211; than
                    still to expect strength in England. the journey will be as
                    useful as the climate from the perpetual excitement of
                    novelty. I should certainly prefer going to France &#8211; but in
                    this there would be difficulty &amp; delay. Trieste is
                    accessible &#8211; &amp; the journey thro Germany safe. at Trieste
                    I can judge of the security of Italy, &amp; perhaps remove
                    to Padua or Vicenza, the places recommended by <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of late I have done nothing except some

                    expense would be inconvenient, &amp; it will be as well to
                    make up my plans here, &amp; not visit London till it lies
                    in my way to Hamburgh. Immediately on my return I will take
                    a house in London &amp; settle to my profession.</p>

                    her health alone would be motive sufficient. &#8211; my eyes &amp;
                    ears are sufficiently open &amp; quick &#8211; &amp; I shall
                    certainly pick up an hundred pounds worth of matter upon my
                    way. &#8211; did I tell you that the copy right of my Joan of Arc
