        <p rend="indent1"> Since last I wrote I have seen something of
                    South Devon. a country which has been so over-praised as
                    compleatly to disappoint me. some particular spots were
                    striking, but the character of the whole is bald &#8211; high
                    hills, with hedges &amp; no trees, &amp; broad views that
                    contained no object on which the eye could fix. I remember
                    with most pleasure a little vale amid high hills of which
                    one was well wooded, many streams intersected it, &amp; all
                    over the green vale were fine old ash trees, as if a grove
                    had been rooted up &amp; these left standing. the ash is our
                    most <hi rend="ital">beautiful</hi> tree, not our <hi rend="ital">finest</hi>, but in a quiet secluded scene
                    our most appropriate &#8211; the leaves are so transparently
                    green, &amp; hang with so feathery a lightness, &amp; the
                    bark is more strongly coloured than that of any other tree.
                    there was a mill in this vale, quite a comfortable dwelling,
                    a saw-pit by &#8211; just enough of man to enliven the scene &#8211; not
                    to spoil it. it pleased me mightily.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Near Totness I fell in with a country man who
                    talked of the Duke of Somerset,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Adolphus Seymour, 11th Duke of
                        Somerset (1775&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>), antiquarian
                        and mathematician. His seat near the Devonshire town of
                        Totnes was Berry Pomeroy Castle.</note> (he has a seat
                    near &amp; had just been at it.) he was a strange foolish
                    sort of young man, he said, who loved to walk about by him
                    self. Dartmouth is finely situated &#8211; but on the whole
                    Devonshire fell very flat upon the eye after the North of
                    Somersetshire which is truly a magnificent country.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been much indisposed, unless I take so
                    much exercise as almost to preclude doing anything else, my
                    pulse intermits &amp; I have the old symptoms. you are
                    mistaken in supposing I play pranks with myself. the gazeous

                    it, &amp; I took it from curiosity first, afterwards as a

                    tell you that trials had been made at Bristol with pieces of
                    wood which had actually cured paralytic cases?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The quack remedy Perkins
                        Patent Tractors, created by Elisha Perkins (1741&#8211;1799).
                        Drawing on experiments conducted by Luigi Galvani
                        (1737&#8211;1798), Perkins theorized that redirecting the
                        body&#8217;s natural electricity could draw out pain and
                        disease. He developed brass and iron rods of about 4
                        inches in length, with one flat side and one round side
                        with one blunt end and one pointed end. The practitioner
                        held the rods in his hand and rested the point of the
                        rods on the skin. Then he stroked or drew the tractors

                            on the Human Body</title> (1798). The subject of
                        much controversy, Perkinism was attacked by James
                        Gillray (1757&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>) in his satirical
                        print &#8216;Metallic Tractors&#8217; (1801). The experiments
                        carried out at the Bristol Infirmary (probably by a Mr.
                        Smith and his colleagues) and various Bristolian medical
                        establishments to expose the quack medicine behind
                        Perkinism are described in John Haygarth (1740&#8211;1827;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>Imagination, As a Cause

                    the inference is that faith works the cure. there is always
                    a difficulty in distinguishing between the effect of a
