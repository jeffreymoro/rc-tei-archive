        <p rend="indent1"> I wrote to you on Thursday concerning <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">my wretched brother
                        Edward</ref>. perhaps you may &lt;have&gt; thought my
                    conduct somewhat rigorous, but it proceeded from a
                    deep-founded knowledge &amp; feeling of his character. this
                    evening another draft has arrived for three pounds, from a
                    gunsmith &#8211; &amp; the boy himself writes to say that he has
                    drawn these bills &#8211; as I cannot suppose his situation can be
                    free from expence &#8211; &amp; he encloses his taylors bill also
                    to show &#8211; he says that he has not been extravagant. this
                    bill is &#163;11-16-3 &#189;. When I tell you that this boy is not yet
                    fifteen you will feel shocked at so early an instance of
                    shamelessness.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is but one course that I can pursue. if
                    you should &#8211; or if <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> should procure a ship, I will beg
                    &lt;you&gt; to calculate the expence of his journey to join
                    it, &amp; remit it him with two pounds more for his washing,
                    &amp; if he continues on board I will from time to time
                    supply him, always sparingly, for he is not to be trusted.
                    From the embarrasments which he has thus wickedly contracted
                    he must get out how he can. The gentleman<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Barham Foster-Barham
                        (1763-1822), a wealthy merchant in the West India trade
                        and partner in Plummer, Barham &amp; Co. How Edward
                        Southey had made his acquaintance is unclear.</note> at
                    whose house he is must be something to blame in having
                    sufferd it &#8211; what can he have gone in debt with a gun-smith
                    for &#8211; unless which is very probable he has bought a fowling
                    piece &amp; taken out a licence to shoot! he tells me that
                        <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Tyler</ref> has borrowed ten guineas of

                    fever in which her sister kept her, by perpetually extorting
                    from her what money she got, guinea by guinea as it came in,
                    in consequence of which her own debts were daily
                    accumulating &#8211; for else she would have had none. With her
                    eyes broad open, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my poor Mother</ref> always yielded to her, wrote
                    begging letters in her own name &#8211; or rather copied them &#8211;

                    had never seen. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My
                        mother</ref> was always the cats-paw, &amp; still
                    continued to be so in spite of every effort I could make,
                    tho whenever she spoke of it it was with the bitterest tears
                    &#8211; tho it kept her sleepless at night &amp; induced those
                    dreadful sweats of mental suffering which God forbid you
                    should ever know but by report, tho it wore away her very
                    vitals &amp; actually brought her to the grave. She scarcely
                    ever mentioned <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        Uncles</ref> name without tears &#8211; to think that she was
                    always made the conduit thro which his money was to be
                    draind. What must he think of me &#8211; she would say &#8211; &amp; God
                    knows it is never for myself. &#8211; Oh Christ! it is not a
                    letter that can tell you the infamy I have known &#8211; &amp; the
                    affliction that I have endured, &#8211; nor how that woman has
                    pilfered from me at the very time that she has been
                    calumniating &amp; insulting me. When that <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">poor Cousin of mine </ref>
          <del rend="strikethrough"> died</del> &lt;was dying&gt; &#8211; of
                    all my relations the only one who had any affinity of heart
                    or intellect with me &#8211; she had no support but from me. <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Tyler</ref> had quarrelled with her, but
                    she used to send to get her money from her, when she had no
                    strength to withold it, guinea by guinea &amp; when to
                    prevent this I sent smaller sums &#8211; shilling by shilling &#8211;
                    &amp; almost in the very hour of her death &#8211; which was
                    attended with agonies that make me shiver whenever I
                    recollect them &#8211; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">this wretched Edward</ref> was sent to plunder her
                    &amp; actually abusd &amp; <hi rend="ital">cursed</hi> her
                    for attempting to withold the few shillings which she had in
                    her power. I learnt this from Danvers who God bless him! is
                    the friend of all who want a friend &amp; has as excellent a
                    heart as God ever made to show me what a human heart can be.
                    When in the newspaper her death was mentioned she was
                    particularized as niece to <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Tyler</ref> &#8211; the woman wrote a paragraph
                    to contradict it which the Printer would not insert knowing
                    it to be a lie, &#8211; &amp; among all her friends declared that
                    this <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Peggy</ref> had
                    past for her niece there was great reason &lt;to think&gt;
                    she was a Bastard. &#8211; If this be madness, it is of so wicked
                    &amp; truly devilish a nature that it actually looks like
                    possession.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This has led me astray. my resolution is
                    never to embarrass myself where there is not a manifest
                    &amp; commanding duty. for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> I
                    must do what I can &#8211; or rather what you enable me to do &#8211;
                    because it is furthering him &amp; indispensable to his
                    welfare in life. but should he show himself incorrigibly
                    prodigal I will wash my hands of him. so with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> I will
                    &lt;not&gt; toil &amp; fret away the powers which God has
                    given me for better purposes. to support the extravagancies
                    of any unprincipled profligate tho he were tenfold my
                    brother. If he chuses so to act as that either he or I must
                    suffer it shall be himself. I will not be victim of any mans
                    ill-conduct. you I am sure will be satisfied that I have
                    done right in protesting his drafts &amp; refusing to pay
                    his bills.</p>
