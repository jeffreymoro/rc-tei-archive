                        Herbert Southey for the <title>Critical Review</title>.
                        Its identity is unknown, and indeed it may not have been
                        published. Henry Herbert Southey later contributed to
                        the <title>Annual Review</title>.</note> to

                            Review</title>, 1799-1804.</note> its insertion does
                    not depend upon me, however – unless another account should
                    already be printed, I suppose he will in common decency
                    oblige me. You directed your letter to <hi rend="ital">me</hi> at <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Corrys</ref>, instead of inclosing
                    it to him – in consequence it was charged at the Post
                    Office. the outside should be to him only – &amp; remember
                    you cannot send above an ounce weight.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Your reading now would be more immediately
                    pleasant, &amp; every way more profitable – if you erected
                    land-marks as you went along. Hearing that you are at

                        (1532).</note> an idea occurred to me which you may
                    think of at leisure – &amp; if you like pursue. about two or
                    perhaps three year &lt;ago,&gt; a violent tho a well
                    directed attack was made against the Italian Poets, in
                    particular Ariosto, in the Monthly Magazine.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">See <title>Monthly

                        ‘G.T.’.</note> I know you like Ariosto, – &amp; if you
                    could <del rend="strikethrough">with</del> critically defend
                    the Orlando Furioso – it would not be difficult to get your
                    paper inserted in the same Magazine – &amp; thus put you
                    perhaps in a way of adding a little to your yearly income,
                    while you improved yourself still more – I should like to
                    help you in tracing the history of that Paladin story thro
                    all its families, from Turpin<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Archbishop Turpin, 8th-century Archbishop
                        of Reims, and reputed author of the 12th-century
                        forgery, <title>Historia de Vita Caroli Magni et
                            Rolandi</title>, an early source for the story of
                        Orlando.</note> – or from ought older than Turpin – if
                    it can be found, analysing &amp; criticising the various
                    poems. if this made too large a digression in my own book
                    upon Spanish literature<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey may have still been considering
                        writing a book on the history of Spanish (and
                        Portuguese) literature.</note> – it might be published
                    in a separate form. Pulci<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Luigi Pulci (1432-1484), Italian poet,

                    within your reach – the rarer books I will hunt out, &amp;
                    furnish all the triumphant poems upon Roncesvalles that are
                    to be found in Spanish<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The battle of Roncesvalles in the
                        Pyrenees in 778 was a minor affair, in which part of the
                        rearguard of Charlemagne’s (742-814; King of the Franks
                        768-814, Holy Roman Emperor 800-814) army was defeated
                        by local Basque forces. In legend it became the site of
                        the last stand of the hero Roland, and the paladins of
                        Charlemagne (of whom Orlando was one). There is an
                        alternative Spanish tradition in which Roland was
                        defeated by the legendary hero Bernardo del Carpio,
                        whose deeds were most famously commemorated in Bernardo
                        de Balbuena (1561-1627), <title>El Bernardo</title>
                        (1624).</note> – I think you would like some such
                    leisure pursuit – that the subject would stimulate you
                    sufficiently, &amp; eventually the result be useful &amp;
                    creditable.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Literary habits are not acquired late in
                    life. if you think them worth acquiring, this is the time.
                    they are always a source of pleasure – &amp; that pleasure
                    the most lasting. a more palpable &amp; pressing motive may
                    be urged to you. at present you are plentifully supplied
                    with money, but hereafter you will be compelled to
                    oeconomize, – if the resources of literature should not be
                    absolutely <hi rend="ital">necessary</hi>, you will find
                    them <hi rend="ital">convenient</hi>. I would <hi rend="ital">now</hi> young as you are – introduce you to
                    the Reviews – if it were in my power. but in this way I have
                    no influence whatever. I could not even transfer my own
                    employment on going abroad – neither can I now recover
                    it.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You imagine me in the high road to wealth
                    &amp; power – &amp; travelling full gallop – the whole truth
                    is that for the next year I have an income without working –
                        <hi rend="ital">not</hi> exceeding what I should have
                    else have earned &amp; received. that what I write – in my
                    vocation – will be for <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Corry</ref> instead of a
                    newspaper or a bookseller, &amp; that at the years end the
                    only certainty is that I shall be richer – by whatever my
                    leisure hours may have produced. A <hi rend="ital">possibility</hi> exists that some birth may be given me
                    in Ireland – a bare possibility – <del rend="strikethrough">naked as the legal phrase expre</del> to which I have
                    no claim – of which no expectation. the South of Europe is
                    still the point of my wishes. a Secretaryship – &amp; the
                    regular salary there is but £300 – would satisfy my wants –
                    &amp; I would for it abandon far brighter prospects than lie
                    before me. the climate annoys me here, &amp; I find no
                    advantages in England to counterbalance that heavy evil.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I wish it were in my power to visit Norwich –
                    but God knows when that will be. if there were no other
                    objection – I am tethered here.</p>
<p rend="indent1">
<ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> is
                    going on miserably &amp; in a way that distresses all his
                    friends. he is earning a poor &amp; precarious subsistence
                    by writing for Philips<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Richard Phillips (1767-1840;

                    which he has neither activity nor knowledge. there is a hope
                    – but a very poor one – that some office may be found for
                    him in Ireland – if he will stoop to the duties of common
                    attention. I labour to convince him, that if he has the
                    power of ever producing any thing great – any situation is
                    more favourable than that of a hackney author. that he ought

                    literary rank. he writes well – but he <del rend="strikethrough">really</del> possesses no knowledge
                    – &amp; from the little use he ever made of leisure I may
