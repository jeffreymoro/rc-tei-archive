                        Pyrenees in 778 was a minor affair, in which part of the
                        rearguard of Charlemagne&#8217;s (742-814; King of the Franks
                        768-814, Holy Roman Emperor 800-814) army was defeated
                        by local Basque forces. In legend it became the site of
                        the last stand of the hero Roland, and the paladins of
                        Charlemagne (of whom Orlando was one). There is an
                        alternative Spanish tradition in which Roland was
                        defeated by the legendary hero Bernardo del Carpio,
                        whose deeds were most famously commemorated in Bernardo
