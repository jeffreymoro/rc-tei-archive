                    overturned &lt;in a stagecoach&gt; which gave him an opportunity of experiencing

                    loved no one in his youth has no one to love him in his age. besides he is proud
                    of having realized a large fortune by his profession &amp; is fond of his own

                        to sell his Llanelli estate, in South Wales, for several years. John Southey
                        did not buy the property.</note> I think which he has been treating about to
                    fix the family name he says in Wales. Now with this feeling it gratifies his
                    vanity that that name is already known in the world. I shall tread softly upon
                    the ice &#8211; but I will see if it will bear.</p>
