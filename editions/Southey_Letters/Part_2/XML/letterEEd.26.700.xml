        <p>This story of the Dog is so exceedingly painful that I have

                        (1555-1620) served as a captain in the 1598 expedition
                        that first colonised New Mexico. His epic
                            <title>Historia de la Nueva M&#233;xico</title> (1610),
                        Canto 19, lines 221-244, described how he was forced to
                        kill his dog for food. However, he then found he was
                        unable to eat the animal.</note> was a wretched poet &#8211;
                    his whole work is minute narrative in the baldest language
                    without one glimpse of imagination. but this shocking story
                    he could not fail to relate pathetically. here the fault of
                    his general manner became a beauty &#8211; just as the rusty
                    weathercock must be sometimes with the wind &amp; the

                        making. In so far as Warton ascribed an origin to Gothic
                        architecture, he looked to the influence of Arabic
