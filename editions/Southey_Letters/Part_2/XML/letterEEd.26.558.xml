                    remain he must not &amp; ought not. to himself it must be

                    has literally no home, &amp; this difficulty of an
                    intermediate resting place is what now distresses me. I have
                    sent my Thalaba to market &amp; demand an hundred guineas
                    for a first edition. getting this sum I do not doubt,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey received &#163;115

                        attending medical lectures in London (Taylor to Southey,

                        354).</note> &#8211; &amp; my former one was only imagined the
                    most practicable when formed, not the best. Will you make
                    enquiry in your part of the world if such a situation can be
                    procured for him? &amp; if it can, signify it to <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> &#8211; Richmond

                    this purpose. Among you I know it must be his wish to settle
                    &#8211; nor elsewhere have I any motive for preference of place.

                    my inclinations are decidedly hostile to this scheme &#8211; but I
                    must not lightly &amp; hastily reject it. my constitution
                    unhappily requires a warmer climate than England, of this my

        <p rend="indent1"> But it is time to talk of Portugal. we have
                    as yet escaped the yellow Fever, &amp; the yellow Fever will
                    effectually guard us against the French &amp; Spaniards, if
                    any danger could be apprehended from invasion. no such
                    danger has ever existed. before a French army could scale
                    Lisbon the whole species would be embarked &#8211; &amp; here the
                    property is kept in chests ready at a moments alarm. the
                    multitude of ships always in the Tagus would take off the
                    more valuable merchandise &#8211; plunder therefore cannot allure
                    the French here. the remaining bales of cotton would not pay
                    their soldiers &#8211; nor the sugar casks sweeten their lemonade.
                    besides provisions are scarce both here &amp; in Spain. a
                    hostile army could not subsist six weeks. If however the
                    French should chuse to take possession of Lisbon in order to
                    distress England &#8211; the blow would speedily recoil. a fleet
                    would block up the Tagus &amp; famine speedily drive them
                    over the Pyrenees. Spain &amp; Portugal must one day blend
                    into one country. the hour is not yet come. one country is
                    not strong enough to conquer &#8211; both too unenlightend to
                    unite. You then as well as we, will wonder at the enormous
                    army quartered here &#8211; if you can wonder at any ministerial
                    absurdity. the most probable opinion here is that it is a
                    collusion between the courts of Madrid &amp; Lisbon managed
                    by France &#8211; to get as many English troops here as possible &#8211;
