                        and 115.</note> &amp; it has been a subject of much amusement.

                    be croaking there. what I think the worst part of the Anti Jacobine abuse is the
                    lumping together men of such opposite principles. this was stupid. We should
                    have all been welcoming the Director not the Theophilanthrope.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Louis Marie de la Revelliere-Lepeaux
                        (1753&#8211;1824), leading member of the five-man Directory that was the supreme
                        executive power in France 1795&#8211;1799 and chief promoter of the deist religion
                        of Theophilanthropy. The verse accompanying the <title>Anti-Jacobin</title>
                        cartoon had concentrated on presenting the radical writers as enthusiasts
                        for Theophilanthropy.</note> The conductors of the Anti Jacobine will have
                    much &lt;to&gt; answer for in thus inflaming the <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> animosities of this country. they are labouring to produce the
                    deadly hatred of Irish faction &#8212; perhaps to produce the same end. Such an
                    address as you mention might probably be of great use &#8212; that I could assist you
                    in it is less certain. I do not feel myself at all calculated for any thing that
                    requires methodical reasoning &#8212; &amp; tho you &amp; I should agree in the main
                    object of the pamphlet, our opinions are at root different. The old systems of
                    government I think must fall; but in this country the immediate danger is on the
                    other hand, from an unconstitutional &amp; unlimited power. Burleigh<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Cecil, Lord Burleigh (1521&#8211;1598;

                        unless by parliaments&#8217;, was also attributed to another Elizabethan
                        statesman, Francis Bacon (1561&#8211;1626; <title>DNB</title>).</note> saw how a

                    prophesied the fall of English Liberty when the Legislature should become
                    corrupt. you will not agree with me in thinking his prophecy fulfilled.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Violent men there undoubtedly are among the Democrats as they are
                    always called. but is there any one among them whom the Ministerialists will
                    allow to be moderate? the Anti-Jacobine certainly speaks the sentiments of

                    lamentable poem but the notes are very amusing. I fancy it is in most old
                    libraries. <del rend="strikethrough">its ballad matter</del> I do not see any
                    thing there that promises well for ballads. there are some fine Arabic
                    traditions that would make noble poems. I was about to write one upon the Garden

                    the groundwork of what I thought a very fine story. but it seemed too great for
                    a poem of 3 or 400 lines</p>
