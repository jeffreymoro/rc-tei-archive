        <p rend="indent1"> My first letter is to you &#8211; to give you the
                    earliest notice of our safe arrival. We staid five days with
                        <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref> &#8211;
                        <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> could
                    nowhere have been so comfortable. <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss B.</ref> is really
                    attached to us, &amp; I know few persons &amp; scarcely any
                    women who possess so much good sense &amp; good humour.
                    yesterday we reached this place. I feel more pain at the
                    sight of little <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref>
          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Sara
                        Coleridge was born 23 December 1802 and so was three
                        months younger than Margaret Southey.</note> than I had
                    apprehended. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> had written much of her fine
                    countenance to me. she is indeed a fine child &#8211; but not such
                    as her whom we have lost. her age &#8211; her little voice sting
                    me to recollections that I must blunt &amp; wear out, for
                    they are not avoidable. I am as chearful as those about
                    &lt;me&gt; could wish &#8211; for that is to be commanded &#8211; but my
                    sleep is harrassed by dreams &#8211; &amp; the moment I cease to
                    be actively employed either in reading or conversation I
                    feel that I am not happy enough to be idle. So common an
                    affliction ought not to so weigh me down &#8211; yet she was not a
                    common child &amp; when I look at other children that
                    thought will recur, &amp; when I am alone in spite of sore
                    eyes I cannot forbear from making them still sorer.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> is still in Scotland, he is expected
                    for three weeks unless he be taken ill, which is very
                    probable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This morning must be a time for
                    letter-writing. that task once <hi rend="ital">overgot</hi>
                    (as they say in Staffordshire) I shall fall to my usual
                    employments. In the disturbance of our departure I forgot to
                    beg <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> to write
                    after me &amp; tell me of his wife<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John King had married Emmeline Edgeworth
                        (1770-1847) in 1802. She had just given birth to a
                        daughter, Zoe King (1803-1881).</note> &#8211; this was remiss
                    &#8211; &amp; I am anxious to hear of her. tell him I will write
                    to him in my second batch. this will serve to let him know
                    that we are safe among the mountains, &amp; perhaps he will
                    answer the enquiry which I make thro you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> An army of letters had arrived here before
                    me. the ugly one by way of Bristol was from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref>. another
                    was a letter of condolence from <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>! a very
                    curious letter, so characteristic of a very simple but good
                    hearted man &#8211; that, tho I could not &lt;but&gt; smile at his
                    simpleness I shall always like him the better for it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is now two years since we left this place,
                    &amp; in that time the old Mountains &amp; their Lakes, have
                    not changed as I have done. there is something aweful in the
                    unchangeableness &amp; duration of these <del rend="strikethrough">then</del> things of Nature to one
                    who has so lately felt the instability of human existence. I
                    shall be the better for dwelling among them at least the
                    poet-part of me, which is the best part, will be fed &amp;
                    fostered, whatever may become of what S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
