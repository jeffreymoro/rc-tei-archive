        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot plead the multiplicity of
                    employments, or the time occupied in surveying new scenery
                    &amp; mingling with new acquaintance as a reason for not

                    expected to go off in an acute rheumatism. this therefore
                    has precluded all visiting, &amp; in a country so flat as
                    this I have found few inducements to ramble without the

                    have been exceedingly pleased with him, &amp; that as much

                    account of his own health is an alarming one. the oppression

                    as you may imagine, very anxious that he should try the

                    money whilst he wants more than his pay. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are as many peculiarities almost in
                    this part of England as tho I were in a foreign country. the
                    town consists of three or four long streets that run
                    parallel with each other, these are intersected by
                    numberless narrow Rows, as they are called. &lt;to the
                    number of 150,&gt; &amp; the carts here are constructed to
                    go thro these Rows, so that the wheels are placed under the
                    body. they only half bake their bread, because they say it
                    would not be heavy enough if they baked it more. puddings
                    are eat with every thing almost to the exclusion of
                    vegetables. the butter is all very bad, &amp; sold by the
                    pint. the coast is hideously flat &#8211; &amp; the effect of a

                    the roads: these deprive you of the idea of immensity, &amp;
