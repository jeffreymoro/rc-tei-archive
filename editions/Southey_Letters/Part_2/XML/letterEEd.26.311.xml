                    to you to convey to them. I came here only to see them dispatched. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My Mother</ref> I hope will recover –
                    tho she often alarms me. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    gives me deeper apprehensions – I often fancy her better – but the next day
                    destroys the hopes I would indulge – &amp; makes me think that she is slowly –
                    but certainly declining. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> My dear friend I am prepared for the future – &amp; it is well

                        Uncles</ref> health? this sometimes makes me uneasy. Our prospects were
                    brightening – &amp; if Death should get among us now! – I have begun my
                    additions to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book – &amp; shall dilate it to a

                        significant changes Southey made to <title>Joan of Arc</title> (1798) was to
                        replace the ninth book with entirely new material. The old ninth book (as
                        published in <title>Joan of Arc</title> (1796)) was revised and appeared as
                        ‘The Vision of the Maid of Orleans’ in <title>Poems</title>, 2 vols
