                    should have been Herbert<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s eldest son was, indeed, named
                        Herbert (1806-1816).</note> &#8211; &amp; that was the only
                    reason why I <del>should</del> perhaps rather wished one.
                    but whatever may be the case eighteen years hence &#8211; till
                    that age daughters are the most desireable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My reasons for fixing in Cumberland seem to
                    me valid. I am offered part of a house<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    the great expence of furnishing a house is avoided. in
                    itself an embarrassing thing, &amp; which would become an

                    the London price. I shall by this saving without altering

                    of a years labour &#8211; for at least that would be necessary to
                    meet the increased expences. what is saved is gained. it

                    by that time my materials will be manufactured. if my health
                    fails before &#8211; it is but moving sooner than I wish, &amp; I
                    shall be just a hundred miles from Liverpool &#8211; whence there
