<salute>My dear Harry</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent1"> I thank you for your ode of Anacreon.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Anacreon (570–488 BC), Greek poet.</note> the Greek metre in
                    which you have translated it is certainly the best that could be chosen but
                    perhaps the most difficult; as the accent should flow so easily that a bad
                    reader may not be able to spoil them. this is the case with your 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> lines. an old woman cannot read them
                    out of the proper cadence. indeed this is correct enough in the whole ode except
                    in the word changed which is too commonly made two syllables to <del rend="strikethrough">be</del> stand <del rend="strikethrough">at the</del>
                    in an Anacreontic as one.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I think this metre much improved to an English ear by sometimes
                    ending a line with a long syllable instead of a trochee. this you will see
                    regularly done in the following translation from the Spanish of Villegas.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Esteban Manuel de Villegas (1585–1669),
                        ‘De Si Mismo’, in Vincente de los Rios (1736–1779), <title>Las Eroticas, y
                            Traduccion De Boecio</title>, 2 vols (Madrid, 1774), I, pp.
                        192–193.</note> the original metre is that of Θελω
                    λεγείν
                        Ατρειδην,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Greek translates as ‘I want to say Agamemnon’.</note>
                    &amp; the verses flow as harmoniously as those of Anacreon.</p>

<ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> is about to send a parcel
                    to <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> in which you will find
                    a letter from your <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">Mother</ref> &amp;
                    a guinea &amp; half – enough to buy a hat &amp; some stockings. the stockings
                    you had better buy at Nottingham. I have written to <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> by the same conveyance.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> We are now tolerably settled at <ref target="places.html#MartinHall">Martin-hall</ref>. I have laboured much in
                    making it comfortable, &amp; comfortable it now is. our sitting room is large,
                    with three windows, &amp; two recesses once windows, but now converted into
                    book-cases, with green baize hanging half way down the books as in the <ref target="places.html#CollegeGreenBristol">College Green</ref>. the room is
                    papered with cartridge paper bordered with yellow vandykes edged with black. I
                    have a good many books tho not all that I want, as many of my most valuable ones
                    are lying in London. I shall be very glad to get settled in a house at London,
                    where I may collect all my chattels together &amp; move on contentedly for some
                    dozen years in my profession.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You will find little difficulty either in Anacreon or in Homer,
                    the language will soon become familiar to you, &amp; you will I hope apply
                    yourself to it with assiduity. I remember <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref> promised to give you
                    some instruction in German when you were well enough acquainted with the ancient
                    languages to begin the modern ones. I need not tell you how valuable such
                    instruction would be, or how gladly I should avail myself of such an opportunity
                    were it in my power. It is of very great advantage to a young man &lt;to&gt; be
                    a good linguist; he is more respected &amp; may be more useful; his sources of
                    pleasure are increased, &amp; what in the present state of the world is to be
                    considered, in case of necessity he has additional means of supporting himself.
                    the languages <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> which I
                    learnt almost as an amusement have considerably contributed, &amp; still in some
                    degree do contribute to my support.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You will send me your other translations from Anacreon &amp; in
                    return I will always send you some piece which you had not before seen. I wish
                    you would sometimes on a fine evening walk out, &amp; write as exact a
                    description of the sunset – &amp; the appearances of every thing around as you
                    can. you would find it a pleasant employment, &amp; I can assure you it would be
                    a very useful one. I should like you to send me some of these sketches – not of
                    sunset only, but of any natural scene. if you have Ossian<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Ossian, the supposed author of a cycle of Celtic
                        heroic poems, probably composed by James Macpherson (1736–1796;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> at hand you may see what I mean in the
                    descriptions of night by five Scotch Bards. your neighbourhood to the sea gives
                    you opportunities of seeing the finest effects of sun rise, fine weather or
                    storms. &amp; you may contrast it with inland views – &amp; forest scenery of
                    which I believe you will see much in Nottinghamshire.</p>
