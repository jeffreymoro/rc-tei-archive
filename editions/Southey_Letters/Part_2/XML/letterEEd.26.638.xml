                        Chancellor</ref> had not existed. true that the salary
                    is gained without effort &#8211; &amp; so much exertion saved
                    should be accounted gain. with the year it must end, &amp;
                    my ultimate gain will be that little knowledge of Ireland
                    may be acquired in the next visit. it is worth a years hard
                    travelling to see a floating island.</p>
