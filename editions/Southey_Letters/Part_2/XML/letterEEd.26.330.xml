        <p rend="indent1"> Thank God I have at last accomplished the business of settling
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref>, a business which
                    three months ago I almost feared would be impracticable. I write to you from
                        <ref target="places.html#Westbury">Westbury</ref>, one of the villages at
                    the end of Durdham Down, two miles from Bristol. the house I have taken for her
                    is a very old one. but my revolutionizing hand has already removed much rubbish
                    &amp; added some conveniences. there is a garden large enough to supply our
                    table, &amp; the back view is extensive, &amp; as beautiful as a prospect can be
                    without any characteristic sublimity, which has only hill, <del rend="strikethrough">&amp; wood</del> vale, &amp; wood to vary it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot tell you from what a weight I feel relieved by this
                    change in her situation. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> too
                    is evidently better. We are as busy as you may conceive, but the fatigue of
                    preparing future comfort is itself almost comfortable. I hope <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref> may like the place
                    enough, &amp; find it agree with her health so well, as to make it her continued
                    home. I should like to make it the place of my summer visit, &amp; feel when in
                    London that I had also a home in a pleasanter place.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We came here only on Monday; in a few days I hope all bustle will
                    be over, &amp; I shall quietly settle into regularity. It is a long time since
                    you have written. In my last I enquired for your brother<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Watkin Williams Wynn (1772&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>),
                        older brother of Charles Watkin Williams Wynn.</note> &#8212; if his hurt was a
                    slight one. this Irish business is very dreadful. it is one comfort that they
                    are only Irishmen on one side &amp; soldiers on the other, &amp; the conduct of
                    both has been so brutal that one may certainly be easily reconciled to the
                    slaughter of either or both.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A planned
                        revolution by the United Irishmen had got off to a faltering start on 23 May
                        1798, but fighting continued intermittently until September.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thought to have seen Wales this summer &amp; had expected much
                    pleasure. other reasons however make me willingly give up the plan, &amp;
                    excepting a visit to Hereford &amp; its neighbourhood I shall be stationary here
                    till we remove again to London. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my
                        mother</ref> will receive a regular small income from <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">her brother</ref>, but <del rend="strikethrough">it has been</del> her removal from Bath has been a
                    heavy expence, &amp; for a short time I keep house. I now believe she will
                    recover her health. indeed the prospect before me is fairer than I ever remember
                    it. </p>
