                        From an unfinished Poem on Mounts-Bay&#8217; by Humphry Davy,
                        pp. 281&#8211;286.</note> I should much like to insert. for
                    the most part it is very good &#8211; but some of the epigrams are
                    obtuse &#8211; or else my comprehension is. As far as 29 all is
                    fair satire &amp; well executed. 33 I do not like. the bull
                    contained in these lines &amp; the flat conclusion do not
                    characterize the poem &#8211; which inaccurate as it is in
                    thought, is the work of no ordinary talents. 38. I do not
                    well understand &#8211; unless it mean that you like &amp; yet
                    dislike the lines. 54 is a misrepresentation. it was the
                    Acolhuan who would not fight. 67 is an excellent analysis of
                    an inane poem. 69 would be better if only its conclusion
                    were preserved. <del rend="strikethrough">77. I know
                        not</del>. Selene is too long. I wonder at your praise
                    of the Song of Pleasure. the latter Stanzas of the Sons of
                    Genius from Thus the pale moon &#8211; to scorn the lunar ray &#8211;
                    appear to me worth a myriad of such poems. it has luxury of
                    language &#8211; but nought else. I have burnt piles of such
