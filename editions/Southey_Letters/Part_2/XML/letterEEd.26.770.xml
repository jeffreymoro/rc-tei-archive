                    however I am glad to hear you have got a house (for I was
                    fearful you would have been obliged to go into lodgings for
                    want of one) &amp; still more glad that it is an old house.

                    Even the clipt yews interest me, &amp; if I found one in any
                    garden that should become mine, in the shape of a peacock I
                    should be as proud to keep his tail well spread as the <del rend="strikethrough">first</del> man was who first
                    carved it. in truth I am more disposed to connect myself by
                    sympathy with the ages that are past, &amp; by hope with
                    those that are to come, than to vex &amp; irritate myself by
                    any lively interest about the &lt;existing&gt;

        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter was unusually interesting &amp;
                    it dwells upon my mind. I could &amp; perhaps will, one day
                    write an Eclogue upon leaving an old place of

                    you say of yourself impresses still more deeply upon me the
                    conviction, that the want of a favourite pursuit is your
                    greatest source of discomfort &amp; discontent. It is the

                    time for want of a dinner, when I had not eighteen pence for
                    the ordinary, nor bread &amp; cheese at my lodgings. but do
