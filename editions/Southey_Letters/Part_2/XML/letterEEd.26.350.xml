        <p rend="indent1"> I have written to <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> &amp;
                    urged to him the first &amp; more immediate difficulties
                    that oppose his plan,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Burnett&#8217;s scheme to leave his post as a unitarian
                        minister and train as a doctor.</note> as a reason for
                    at least delaying it. these reasons strike me more forcibly
                    than they can do you from what I know of his connections in
                    this part of the country. his father is a wealthy farmer,
                    just retired from business, but already dissatisfied with
                        <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</ref> for
                    rejecting the profession <del rend="strikethrough">tha</del>
                    he intended for him. <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> has a brother in law who has done him no
                    kind offices, &amp; his own brothers &amp; sisters were I
                    have heard, somewhat jealous of him who was to be the
                    gentleman of the family. he has never mentioned it to me,
                    but from many circumstances I know he has not been treated
                    quite kindly at home. from that quarter I see little to
                    hope. <ref target="people.html#EstlinJohnPrior">Estlin</ref>
                    is a good man, but he has many claims upon his <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> purse, &amp; then he will
                    be sadly grieved &amp; perhaps angry. he has the sectarian
                    spirit stronger than any man I ever knew. certainly <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> will
                    meet with no assistance from him. &amp; for <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref>, he has so
                    many idle habits of expence that he is himself always in
                    want. he is one of a very large family, &amp; his father
                    complains of his thoughtlessness in money matters. all this
                    is very hopeless. I have besought him to think again, &amp;
                    have urged him to set about some literary employment, to try
                    his strength; half his discontent arises from mere
                    indolence. it may amuse the present, &amp; he will find it
                    well to have something ready for the future. the period
                    after his graduation does not alarm me so much, I look
                    forward to an improved situation <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> myself, &amp; the means of assisting him. but I
                    do not see how the first difficulties can be surmounted,
                    &amp; yet fear his resolution is irrevocable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> has
                    promised me his tragedy<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably an early version of Lloyd&#8217;s
                            <title>The Duke D&#8217;Ormond, a Tragedy</title>
                        (1822).</note> &amp; I have been for some time vainly
                    expecting it. you have well charactered him. a long
                    acquaintance would enable you to add to what you have said,
                    not to alter it. <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> is precipitate in all his feelings, &amp;
                    ready to be the dupe of any one who will profess attachment.
                    I never knew a man so delighted with the exteriors of
                    friendship. he was once dissatisfied with me for a coldness
                    &amp; freedom of manner, it soon wore off, &amp; I believe
                    he now sincerely regards me, tho the only person who has
                    ever upon all occasions advised &amp; at times reproved him,
                    in unpalliated terms. certainly he is a powerful reasoner,
                    but he has an unhappy propensity to find out a reason for
                    every thing he does, &amp; whether he drinks wine or water
                    it is always metaphysically right. his feelings are always
                    good, but he has not activity enough for beneficence. I look
                    at his talents with admiration but almost fear that they
                    will leave no adequate testimony behind them. I love him,
                    but cannot esteem him, &amp; so I told him. he thinks
                    nothing but what is good, but then he only thinks. I fear he
                    will never be useful to others, or happy in himself.</p>
