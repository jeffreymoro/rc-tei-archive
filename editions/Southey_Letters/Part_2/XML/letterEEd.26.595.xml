<salute>Dear William Taylor</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent1"> Your letter in spite of Norfolk frosts &amp;
                    Norfolk flats would have excited in me some half desire to
                    diet for life upon Norfolk puddings &amp; turnips &amp;
                    turkies – if destiny did not invite me to a better country.
                    I have the hope &amp; prospect of visiting Italy in a
                    prudent way – as Secretary to some legation there – an
                    office of little trouble, with the prospect of
                        advancement.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                        proposal by Wynn that Southey should become Secretary to
                        Sir William Drummond (c. 1770-1828; <title>DNB</title>),
                        classical scholar, poet and diplomat; Charge d’Affaires
                        in Denmark 1800-1801, Minister-Plenipotentiary in Naples
                        1801-1803 and 1807-1808, and Ambassador to the Ottoman
                        Empire in 1803.</note> you will not wonder that I
                    joyfully look <del rend="strikethrough">for</del> to a
                    residence in that country, &amp; the prospect of a permanent
                    income, without that eternal anxiety about ways &amp; means
                    which have so long harrassed me. This is for your own eye
                    only. my destination will probably be Palermo – if peace
                    comes, as likely to any of the other states – &amp; as
                    willingly. Ultimately I look to Lisbon – &amp; certainly to
                    a long absence from England – to me less an object of regret
                    than it would be to most persons, not merely from my state
                    of health, but from my peculiar circumstances. I have never
                    been settled in England – never had a home there – my
                    friends are scattered – nowhere two in a place. from my
                    family (excepting <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henrys</ref>
                    prospects) I receive no comfort, &amp; can communicate none
                    to them. thus without anchor or cable it is but to hoist
                    sail &amp; away! – </p>
<p rend="indent1"> To the other part of your letter – a visit to
                    Norwich would promise much pleasure. but look at the map. –
                    &amp; there is a wretched distance between. besides my time
                    is otherwise allotted. I am going to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, to pass the
                    Autumn with <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> – to work like a negro – &amp; to
                    arrange his future plans with my own. he is miserably ill,
                    &amp; must quit England for a warmer climate or perish. I
                    found letters announcing his determination to ship himself
                    &amp; family for the Azores, the only spot his finances
                    could reach. this I have stopt; &amp; the probability is
                    that he will accompany me abroad. thus <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> will have
                        <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">one sister</ref>
                    with her to reconcile her to an abandonment of the rest –
                    &amp; I shall have with me the man, to whom, in all the ups
                    &amp; downs of six years, my heart has clung with most
                    affection, despite even of its own efforts.</p>

                    that the power of choice is best in other hands. Of Portugal

                    there <hi rend="ital">is</hi> a fault of story – a want of
                    sufficient concatenation of events – perhaps inevitable from
                    the subject. yet I have found no lack of interest in the
                    readers – who have followed the story breathlessly – <del rend="strikethrough">&amp;</del> nor do I see more
                    motive – human motive for Huon<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Huon was the central figure in Christoph
                        Martin Wieland (1733-1813), <title>Oberon</title>

                    fairly with Vathek<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">William Beckford (1760-1844; <title>DNB</title>),

                    existing work – &amp; I think may stand by its side for
                    invention. there are parts of the poetry which I cannot hope
                    to surpass. yet I look with more pride to the truth &amp;
                    the soul that animates Joan of Arc.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Joan of Arc</title>
                        (1796).</note> there is the individual Robert Southey

                    his imagination in the enchanted fabric. for this also I
                    build the hope – the confidence of my own immortality upon
                    Madoc. because in a story diversified as that of Thalaba,
                    human characters are well developed, human incidents well
                    arranged – because it will be as new in the Epic as this is
                    in the Romance, &amp; assert a bolder claim to originality
                    than has been asserted since the voice of Homer awoke its
                    thousand echoes. – I expect with some wishfulness your
                    remarks on the second volume. Book 8. the voyage in B.

                    situation – that were I on the spot – eyes &amp; ears would
