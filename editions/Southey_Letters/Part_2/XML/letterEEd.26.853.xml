                    been supposed, individuals possess knowledge which there was no motive for

                    intelligence respecting the East, than two of his own Jew subjects came &amp;
                    told him they had been there. the commercial spirit of the Moors is truly
                    astonishing &#8211; Dutchmen or East India Directors could not be more jealous of
                    their monopolies. the little kingdoms which Gama found resemble Homers

                    this. The Hindoos too wanted coral from the Portugueze &#8211; odd fellows when it
                    grows in their own seas. I believe the Portugueze conquests to have been the
                    chief cause that barbarized the Mohammedans; their spreading commerce would else
                    have raised up a commercial interest, out of which an enlightened policy might
                    have grown. The Koran was a master piece of policy, attributing sanctity to its
                    language &#8211; Arabic thus became a sort of free-masons passport for every believer
