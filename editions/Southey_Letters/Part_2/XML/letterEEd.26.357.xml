                    that he was writing in haste &amp; would write more fully
                    soon. I shall be in town either on Wednesday or Thursday

                    present I am unexpectedly perplexed about <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>,
                    who I thought was properly situated till he should be old

                    educate him myself is utterly impracticable. my time was

                    to walk eight miles a day, &amp; read &amp; write less, <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> I have been much
                    indisposed in consequence of too sedentary a life, &amp;

                    to think the book makers who travel in Wales very stupid not
                    to write more entertaining volumes. we were but seven days
                    &amp; a half walking to Hereford, one of which was spent

        <p rend="indent1"> I am very glad you like my letters,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A second, revised
                        edition of Southey&#8217;s <title>Letters Written During a
                            Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> was
                        published in 1799.</note> because from knowing the
                    country you can judge of their merit. to me it appears that
                    the requisites for a traveller who means to publish his
                    journal, are a quick eye &amp; quick comprehension. if he
                    can add to these botanical &amp; mineralogical knowledge
                    &amp;c it is well, but these scientific views are of less
                    import. very few persons are interested in the soil or
                    plants of Spain, but sketches of the people &amp; scenery,
                    if characteristic &amp; well chosen, necessarily amuse every
                    body. the book will be ready by Xmas. I am sorry that we
                    have been obliged after all to abandon the idea of giving
                    prints, as the expence would occasion loss. the first cost
                    of engraving six only would be 36 guineas &#8211; which with
                    retouching &amp; working off would run up the whole at least
                    to 50.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When I see you I will show you my English
                        Eclogues,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Six

                    publishing plans which promise me at the expence of very
                    little trouble, a little but regular profit. I am a good
                    deal better since this exercise has been prescribed. but it
                    takes up a great part of my time.</p>
