        <p rend="indent1"> I was about to write when your letter arrived
                    &#8211; the newspapers had told me your marriage.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John May married Susanna
                        Frances Livius (1767&#8211;1830) on 12 December 1799. The
                        marriage was reported in <title>The Oracle</title>, 13
                        December 1799.</note> &#8211; God bless you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> the debility left by my nervous fever I have
                    recovered, &amp; the pain at heart has abated. I have
                    &lt;had&gt; the advice of five medical <del rend="strikethrough">men</del> &lt;practitioners&gt; &#8211;
                    do not suspect me of hypochondriacal extravagance &#8211; my
                    friendships here are among scientific men &#8211; they agree in
                    not thinking it a topical affection. <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref> has
                    known five or six persons similarly affected &#8211; some of whom
                    have desired in their wills to be opened &#8211; but &#8211; he added &#8211;
                    they have none of them died yet. At night I have my old
                    symptoms in a very distressing degree &#8211; feelings which I
                    believe no one in health could well conceive.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am advised to change climate, &amp;
                    seriously think of so doing. it is only indisposition that
                    has hitherto prevented me from giving myself up to
                    professional labour. compelled as I am, almost to pass my
                    days in idleness, &amp; abstain from pursuits the most
                    intensely gratifying, how is it possible that I could endure
                    the confinement of a lawyers office, &amp; the tedium of
                    studies which only duty could make endurable? my health once
                    established I will make every effort. of success I am not
                    sanguine in expectation. <del rend="strikethrough">it</del>
                    I never believed myself qualified for the profession. my
                    powers are only vigorous in solitude or in the society that
                    imposes no restraint. I am easily confounded &#8211; you may
                    recollect the similar temporary want of talent in Rousseau.
                    I resemble him in nothing else. &#8211; to reestablish my health
                    is the great immediate object &#8211; without that I am paralysed
                    for every effort. Abroad then I think of going. Of course
                    Lisbon offered itself as the most accessible place &#8211; but on
                    reconsideration I am inclined to think of some other abode.
                    If my health compels me to go abroad, the expence of time
                    &amp; money which it will occasion, it must be my business
                    to defray as far as I can by the journey itself, this
                    therefore is a motive for a new route. another is that I
                    will not go alone &#8211; to leave <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> would be
                    saving very little at the expence of much lonely anxiety on
                    her part, &amp; some on my own &#8211; besides she herself is of
                    delicate health &amp; likely to be benefitted. now this
                    would not be convenient to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>
                    certainly, &amp; perhaps not agreable. therefore I have
                    lookd farther south &amp; thought of Trieste. <hi rend="ital">there</hi> I could judge of the security of
                    Italy, in safety myself &#8211; &amp; the sea would always be open
                    &#8211; or a retreat into Germany. as yet these are flying
                    thoughts &#8211; but the advice of my medical advisers &amp; of my
                    friends induces me to it &#8211; &amp; the recollection of what I
                    was at Lisbon &amp; what I am now in animal strength.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My brothers <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>

                    is the sad want of diffidence; in my judgement the great

                    now approaching to the important period of life. in my own
                    case, early habits of solitude, &amp; feelings that shrink
                    from observation counterbalanced the dangers of an
