                    when last I took pen in hand for that purpose. after
                    receiving your last I wrote to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>

                    part of his conduct. this evening his answer has arrived &#8211;
                    &amp; thank God it has satisfied me as I am sure it will
                    you. What he meant by saying <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylor</ref> had enabled him to remove &#8211; was
                    &#8211; that he had answerd for his debts: the 20&#163; was what
                    removed him &amp; of which he expected to have 7&#163; left on
                    his arrival &#8211; as in fact he had 6. he did not mention the
                    present in his letter to you from haste &#8211; not from
                    concealment, as he <hi rend="ital">had read <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylors</ref> letter which did mention

                    to you that he may be thus far exculpated. I do it as you
                    may conceive with real pleasure &amp; a lightened heart. He

                    about to remove &#8211; his dinners are to cost him fifteen pence
                    daily. I hope he feels seriously &amp; am disposed to think
                    so. the fact is that at Norwich his information had outgrown
                    his situation, &amp; he was tempted to indolence the more

                    needful. my hope is that this tumultuous state of the world
                    will not continue long. Yet I confess that every thing looks
