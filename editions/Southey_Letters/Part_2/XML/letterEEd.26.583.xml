          <salute>Dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am about to return, for some half dozen cogent reasons. it is
                    better get off leisurely than wait the hurry of expulsion which cannot be far
                    distant. summer is near &#8211; to remove for a short time to <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> would be troublesome &amp; disjoint
                    all my studies &#8211; to remain <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> here would be
                    taking a spell of Purgatory. if a decent ship offers for Bristol of course it is
                    preferable. if not I must perforce take the Packet &#8211; it is enormously dear &#8211; now
                    20 guineas each person. it cost sixty pounds to bring us here from Bristol. &#8211; to
                    clear myself here I drew a few days since for 40 &#163;. the most irksome expence is
                    what my books will cost at the English custom houses, a heavy &amp; disgraceful
                    duty which ought to be abolished. &#8211; When I shall have been six or eight months
                    in England some of my crops will be in such a state of forwardness that I can
                    subsist upon them till all arrears are cleared. Wherever I may land you will
                    suffer me to draw on you for the passage &amp; journey. I have spent largely in
                    books &#8211; yet often spared when I would willingly have spent. my collection
                    however will supply long labour &amp; repay it. when I have gone thro it will be
                    time enough to collate &amp; compare &amp; correct with other authors. It is of
                    all toil the pleasantest &#8211; my notes will be essential otter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Attar, essence of rose-petals.</note> of folios.

                    reigns &amp; reached the first important period &#8211; the quantity that has been
                    read to form these pages affords a fine exemplification of the infinite
