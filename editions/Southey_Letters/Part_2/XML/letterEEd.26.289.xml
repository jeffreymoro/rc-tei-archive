                        poet.</note> was a count of the holy Roman empire, lord of Yrian, head of
                    the Rebolledos of Castille, knight of the order of Santiago, comendador and
                    alcayde of Villanueva de Alcardete, governor and captain general of the Lower
                    Palatinate, general of artillery, minister plenipotentiary in Denmark, minister
                    of the supreme council of war, &amp;c. &amp;c. but if Rebolledo had not been a
                    poet, these titles would have been remembered only in the family pedigree, and
                    on his own monument. On the 31st of May, 1597, he was baptized in Leon, his
                    native city. From his earliest years, says the Spanish biographer, our
                    Bernardino discovered his inclination for that happy union of arms and letters,
                    which so many have made.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Juan Jos&#233; Lopez
                        de Sedano (1729&#8211;1801), <title>El Parnaso Espa&#241;ol</title>, 9 vols (Madrid,
                        1768&#8211;1778), V, p. xxxiii.</note> Two centuries ago this union was less
                    extraordinary than at present: in England we had a Raleigh and a Sydney.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Raleigh (1557&#8211;1618;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and Philip Sydney (1554&#8211;1586; <title>DNB</title>),
                        English soldiers and poets.</note> Spain affords more instances; Lope de
                    Vega served in the Armada; Garcilaso died in battle, and the poem of Ercilla was
                    written in his tent.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Lope Felix de Vega
                        Carpio (1562&#8211;1635), prolific Spanish poet and playwright, who served in the
                        Armada sent to invade England in 1588 on the <hi rend="ital">San Juan</hi>.
                        Garcilaso de la Vega (1501&#8211;1536), Spanish poet and soldier, who died at Nice
                        from wounds received in battle at Le Muy. Alonso de Ercilla y Zuniga
                        (1533&#8211;1594), Spanish soldier and author of <title>La Araucana</title>
                        (1569&#8211;1589).</note> But the world is grown wiser, though it may not have
                    grown better, and the trade of war, once held so honourable, is now estimated as
                    it should be. At the age of fourteen Rebolledo entered into the fleet of Naples
                    and Sicily, in which service he remained eighteen years, and honourably
                    distinguished himself. Afterwards he served in Lombardy, under Spinola.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Ambrogio Spinola Doria, Marqu&#233;s de los
                        Balbases (1569&#8211;1630), Italian-born military commander who served in the
                        Spanish forces.</note> At the siege of Casal, his right arm was broken by a
                    musket ball.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The siege of Casale in
                        Montferrat, 1628&#8211;1629, was an important engagement in the War of the Mantuan
                        Succession (1628&#8211;1631), a subsidiary part of the Thirty Years War
                        (1618&#8211;1648).</note> Perhaps the poet remembers his wound, when, in that part
                    of his &#8220;<hi rend="ital">Selva Militar y Politica</hi>,&#8221; which treats of besieged
                    places, he enumerates, among the provisions necessary for the siege, physicians,
                    surgeons, and medicine chests.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Selva

        <p rend="indent1"> After serving in the Low Countries, and negociating with many of
                    the German powers, the count was appointed plenipotentiary to the court of
                    Denmark. But Copenhagen was besieged during his residence there, and for two
                    years the Spanish ambassador assisted in defending the town. After so many toils
                    and dangers he returned to Madrid, full of years and of glory; new honours were
                    accumulated upon him, and he died in that city, universally respected, at the
                    age of fourscore.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Amid the toils and occupations of so adventurous a life,
                    Rebolledo produced those poems that have ranked him among the nine Castilian

                    perhaps villages of Berberana and Lezama, a stream falls from the height of a
                    mountain into a deep valley; through which a current of air continually passes,
                    with such force, as to scatter the water on its fall, and sweep it away in
                    vapour. The vapour, on its elevation, condenses and falls in perpetual rain.
