                    been my guest, &amp; to whom I have been showing all the
                    seeables of Bristol. they are documents that I am better
                    able to value than to use &#8211; howbeit I shall thank you to
                    replace the volumes when they are transferred to <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref>. You
                    expect some pages from me to bind up with them. how can <hi rend="ital">you</hi> have been so mistaken in
                    calculation? I have no skill in that kind of alchemy &#8211; in
                    extracting essence of numerals &#8211; surely you know this &amp;
                    know also that in whatever requires continuous &amp; patient
                    thought I am deficient. that I follow like the greyhound by

                    important establishments that could be devised. I look for
                    many &amp; permanent benefits to this country &#8211; that is to
                    the civilized world &#8211; from you &#8211; if apoplexy or fever do not
                    prevent them. this deserves to be the first. in whatever way
                    you can make me useful you may command me &#8211; but do not
                    expect too much. We want communities for men also &#8211; convents
                    without vows or religious ceremonies &#8211; colleges without the
                    previous apprenticeship to fellowships &#8211; where for a
                    moderate rent men of leisure might enjoy a common table
                    &amp; a good library. We want something very different from
                    both these institutions &#8211; public stews. if I did not think
                    you <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> agreed with me I

                    destroyed &#8211; there would be a huge hue &amp; cry against them
                    from your rascally vital Xtian members. but reason &amp;
                    humanity &amp; the public good would prevail. were I in the
                    house of commons I should think the subject worth all my
                    efforts.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will not be pleased to hear that <hi rend="ital">upon calculation</hi> instead of
                    domesticating at Richmond I find it right to remove to the
                    mountains of Cumberland. yet you must allow the resolution
                    is a prudent one. Under the same roof with <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> I can have as many rooms as I want,
                    well furnished &#8211; for twenty guineas a year. the place &amp;
                    the rooms we know, &amp; all the circumstances. now in or
                    near London my rent &amp; taxes would be double that sum &#8211;
                    &amp; it would be necessary to furnish the house &#8211; an
                    expence &lt;for&gt; which all my ways &amp; means would be
                    difficultly sufficient &#8211; even with a resource of which I
                    should be unwilling to avail myself &#8211; the hasty publication
                    of some hasty poem. for access to books &#8211; I have enough raw
                    materials to occupy a three years labour. if the climate
                    hurt me &#8211; patience! it is but removing to Lisbon two years
                    sooner than business would call me there &#8211; &amp; Liverpool

                    expences also is nearly as 40 to 100. the Lakes &amp; the

                    enough for my wants. for twelvemonths I have not written
                    above two hundred verses &#8211; only enough to satisfy me that
                    the power is not past away. perhaps you will like this
                    symptom. the fact is that in compiling history much of the
                    work is mere idleness for one who loves reading &#8211; a book
                    &amp; a pencil to mark your way. the mass of volumes which
                    it is necessary to examine is enormous &#8211; but that is all
                    easy sauntering pastime. then again so many parts of the
                    process are going on that variety of employment serves
                    instead of rest. there are always three narratives on the
                    stocks at once. one reign in its first rude stage &#8211; another
                    in its chrysalis state &#8211; a third fairly <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> copied upon fair paper. if
                    I am tired of the Kings I go to the Saints &#8211; if the Xtians
                    are dull there are the Moors to amuse me. for serious moods
                    there are chapters that require thought &amp; reasoning &#8211;
                    &amp; in the quaintness of my heart I conceive notes.</p>
