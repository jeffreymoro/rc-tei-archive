        <p rend="indent1"> On Tuesday we crossed the river to Casilhas
                    point &#8211; procured jack asses &amp; proceeded to a place
                    called Costa<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Costa da

                    Costa is a collection of fishermens huts on the sand, in a
                    line with it, on the south side of the river. the ride is
                    about seven miles, over a hilly country, that every where
                    displayed novel &amp; striking views. for the foreground
                    huge aloes &amp; the prickly pear &#8211; the broom &amp; furze in
                    blossom &#8211; broad-headed firs every where where the sandy soil
                    was not cultivated for vines or olives &#8211; the sweep of the
                    bay southward skirted by the pine-covered plains &#8211; &amp; the
                    mountain boundary &#8211; behind us Lisbon on its heights &#8211; &amp;
                    the river blue &amp; boundless as a sea. thro a cleft in a
                    sand bank &#8211; a winter ravine way for the rains, we first saw
                    the Costa at about half a mile below us, the most singular
                    view I ever beheld &#8211; huts all of thatch scatterd upon the
                    sand &#8211; we descended by a very steep way cut thro the sand
                    hill &#8211; the sand on either side fretted by the weather like
                        <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> old sculpture long
                    weather worn. all below belongs to the sea &#8211; but on the bare
                    sands a numerous tribe have fixed their habitations &#8211; which
                    exactly resemble the wigwams of the Nootka savages.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Nootka was the name
                        that Europeans gave to an island, an inlet and a group
                        of peoples on the Pacific coast of Canada.</note> &#8211; a

                    with the ground without &#8211; two only symptoms showed us that
                    we were in a Xtian country &#8211; a church &#8211; the only stone
                    building &#8211; &amp; a party stretched upon the sand at cards.
                    the men live by fishing &#8211; &amp; a stronger race I never saw
                    &#8211; or more prolific, for children seemed to swarm. as parties
                    from Lisbon are frequent here there are two or three hovels
                    of entertainment. ours had ragged rhymes upon its walls
                    recommending us to drink by the barrel &amp; not by the
                    quart ale-house advice in lines almost as long as the poem
                    upon Pharaoh King of Egypt.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Identity uncertain; possible candidates

        <p rend="indent1"> In riding to Odivellas I saw somewhat curious
                    &#8211; it was a Padro&#241;<del rend="strikethrough">a</del> by the
                    road side. we have no other word in English &#8211; &amp; it
                    occurs often in romance &#8211; for a place raised by the wayside
                    where a station or inscription is placed: there was an image
                    of Christ there &#8211; &amp; some unaccountable inscriptions
                    about robbery &amp; hiding heaven in the earth, which a
                    series of pictures in tiles behind, explained. A hundred
                    years ago the church at Odivellas was robbed of the church
                    plate &amp; of the sacrament &#8211; then I saw the thief playing
                    at skittles when the sacristan of the church past by &#8211; whom
                    he followed in &amp; hid himself &#8211; then I saw him robbing
                    the altar &#8211; next &#8220;you shall see how he hid the
                    church-dresses in the house of a woman &#8211; &amp; here he is
                    burying the sacrament plate in a vineyard upon this very
                    spot. here he is examined upon suspicion &amp; denies all,
                    &amp; says who ever did the sacrilege ought to have his
                    hands cut off. here he is taken in the act of stealing the
                    fowls of the convent &#8211; &amp; he confesses all. here they dig
                    up the hidden treasure &amp; carry it back in a solemn
                    procession &#8211; here he is going to execution &#8211; here you see
                    his hands cut off according to his own sentence &#8211; &amp; here
                    he is strangled &amp; burnt. It is remarkable that in almost
                    all these tiles the face of the criminal is broken to pieces
                    &#8211; probably in abhorrence of his guilt. The loss of the Wafer
                    has been ever regarded as a national calamity &#8211; to be
                    lamented with public prayers &amp; fasts &amp; processions.

                        may have possibly been related to Martin Petrie (d.
                        1805), a Commissary in the British Army.</note> a Doctor
                    at Aldea da Cruz of whom we besought houseroom one night in
                    distress told us with more truth than politeness that four
                    women were a mighty inconvenience. We did not find them so &#8211;
                    they made our chocolate at morning. laughed with us by day &#8211;
                    enjoyed the scenery, packed our provisions basket, &amp; at
                    night endured flea-biting with a patience that entitles them
                    to an honourable place in the next martyrology. All Lisbon I
                    believe thought us mad when we set out &#8211; &amp; they now
                    regard our return with equal envy as only our complections
                    have suffered &#8211; to detail the journey would be too long &#8211; we
                    asked at Santarem if they had room for us &#8211; they said plenty
                    &#8211; we begged to see them &#8211; they had two rooms &#8211; four men
                    a-bed in one &#8211; one fellow a bed in the other, at Pombal
                    Waterhouse &amp; I slept in public &#8211; in a room that served
                    as a passage for the family. Men &amp; women
                    indiscriminately made the Ladies beds. one night we passed
                    thro a room wherein eight men were sleeping &#8211; who rose up to
                    look at us &#8211; something like a picture of the resurrection.
                    these facts will enable you to judge of the comforts &amp;
                    decencies of Portugueze &#8211; they once wanted us &#8211; 4 women
                    &amp; two men &#8211; to sleep in two beds in one room.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Yet bad as these places are the Mail Coach
                    has made them still worse. that is it has rendered the
                    people less civil &amp; made the expences heavier.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We crost the Zezere. a river of importance in
                    the history of Portugal, as its banks form the great
                    protection of Lisbon. it is the place where a stand might
                    most effectually be made against an invading army. the river
                    is fine &#8211; about our Avon width at Rownham, &amp; flowing
                    between hills of our Clifton &amp; Leigh height that are
                    covered with heath, &amp; gum-cistus. the water is
                    beautifully clear, &amp; the bottom sand. like all mountain
                    streams the Zezere is of irregular &amp; untameable force.
                    in summer horsemen ford it. in winter the ferry price varies
                    according to the resistance of the current &#8211; from one vintem
                    to nine &#8211; that is from a penny to a shilling. It then enters
                    the Tagus with equal waters &#8211; sometimes with a larger body,
                    for as the rains may have fallen heavier East or North, the
                    one river with its rush almost stagnates the other.</p>
