                    earlier it happens the less is the calamity. it is <del rend="strikethrough">th</del> in your case rather a
                    subtraction from future, than from present happiness. it is
                    better to see the bud wither, than to behold the blossom
                    cankered, or the fruit blighted. You have had so much to
                    apprehend that the real loss is comparatively little. Your

                    effect &#8211; &amp; do not let it be long before it arrives.</p>

                        identified the &#8216;R.S.&#8217;, author of an article on

                    is doing something for this also. You will find me close to

                    analytical, &amp; to the best of my judgement selecting the

                    passages of every book under <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> examination. this is profitable labour, but
                    not pleasant for one capable of &amp; aspiring to better
                    things. When I am dead, &amp; my works estimated with no
                    personal reference, it will be regretted that I should ever
                    have been obliged to review dull books &amp; write dull

                    &#8211; but in that court I shall cast the plaintiff. in every
                    specific accusation against the plan of Thalaba <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">the critic</ref> is
                    wrong. Is he less so in his general attack of my system of
                    poetry? This is to be considered.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There certainly is a design in the most part
                    of my poems to force into notice the situation of the poor,
                    &amp; to represent them as the victims of the present state
                    of society. the object is to make my readers think &amp;
                    feel &#8211; as for the old Antijacobine cry that it is to make
                    the poor rebellious that is too absurd to require answer.
                    the Poor do not read books of poetry upon fine paper, nor
                    are the poems addressed to their capacities of
                    understanding. the charge which the Scotch critic makes
                    applies to me far more than to <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>

                    &amp; poetry are not antithetic terms, but instead prose

                    act of uniformity for all metrical language. &amp; my system
                    is to &#8220;suit the word to the action.&#8221; for dialogue &#8211; for the
