        <p>The subject of your letter is important.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A
                        reply to Rickman&#8217;s letter to Southey, 4 January 1800, proposing a system of
                        &#8216;beguinages&#8217;, modelled on lay Catholic communities of women in the Low
                        Countries, in which poor single women could work and live together.</note> I
                    had considered it cursorily, for my mind has been more occupied by the possible
                    establishment of a different state of society, than by plans for improving the
                    present. To my undertaking the work you propose I wish there were no obstacles,
                    but a very important one exists in the nature of my own powers. The compositions
                    in which I have indulged have encouraged rapidity of feeling, a sudden
                    combination of ideas, &#8211; but they have been unfavourable to regular deduction
                    &amp; methodical arrangement. another objection arises from my present plans. I
                    wish to try the effect of a better climate in removing nervous disorders which
                    are, &amp; long have been, growing upon me. However, I am impressed by your
                    letter, &amp; should much like to talk with you upon the subject &amp; map out
                    the country before us. Have you not leisure for a visit to Bristol? We shall be
                    truly glad to have you our guest, &#8211; &amp; here is a rich chemical harvest to be
                    reaped.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not see why you, a man of leisure should not execute the
                    work you propose to me. the only possible advantage of my executing it is, that
                    I have, what the booksellers call, a good name, &amp; could thus procure a
                    degree of immediate attention. But an able book sooner or later must make its
                    way. It is has often excited my wonder, not that you buried yourself &#8211; (for I
                    love the country &amp; its quietness) but that you buried your knowledge at <ref target="places.html#ChristChurch">Xt Church</ref>. The studies which
                    constitute your amusement might produce emolument, a solid benefit &#8211; for of
                    reputation I do not suppose you ambitious. Were you disposed to print even your
                    loose memorandums &#8211; such as the remarks you made upon the Edda<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly Rickman&#8217;s response to Amos Simon
                        Cottle&#8217;s <title>Icelandic Poetry, or the Edda of Saemund translated into
                            English Verse</title> (1797).</note> &#8211; the account of the camp at

                    &#8211; but these things you are perpetually writing &amp; the additional labour of
                    thought would be none. I had even thought of writing to propose this to you.</p>

                    had made it destroy the man in the act of murder, using a natural agent as a
                    miraculous interposition. To this poem I have planned a useful appendage,
                    extensive notes relative to Eastern customs &amp;c, &amp; speculations upon the
                    causes of the slavery &amp; degradation of that part of the world, &amp; upon
                    the possible remedies.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    engross my attention. the History of Spanish &amp; Portugueze literature is a
                    subject on which I design to bestow much labour, &amp; in which much useful
                    matter may be conveyed.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not
