                    she has often been tricked out in her finery. she was just about to leave off
                    her long cloaths when it arrived; as spring comes on her caps are to be laid
                    aside, &amp; she looks so much better without a cap that I feel a sort of
                    womanly wish to have her fashion changed.</p>

                    refers to the Romish doctrine of supererogation. I have picked up a considerable
                    number of Catholic books at a waste paper price, the controversial works printed
                    at S. Omers &lt;&amp; Douay&gt; &amp; Paris &amp; in Holland about the beginning

                    acquainted with. Southwell the author was a Jesuit &amp; a Poet of <del rend="strikethrough">some</del> much merit, who suffered death under
