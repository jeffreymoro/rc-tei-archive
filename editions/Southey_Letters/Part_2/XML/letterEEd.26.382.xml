                    the press closes on it. in the first line &#8211; would it not be
                    better by an easy transposition to get rid of the
                    superfluous syllable &amp; write it <hi rend="ital">O Keswic
                        oer thy lake?</hi> for should not rhymeless odes be as
                    harmonious as possible? in the second <hi rend="ital">sail</hi> &amp; <hi rend="ital">gale</hi> rhyme. is not
                    the second stanza incongruous? a cloud fathoming the sky
                    seems to reverse the fact. stanzas 5 &amp; 7. it would I
                    think be better to continue the conditional tense. 15. <hi rend="ital">streak</hi> &amp; <hi rend="ital">cheek</hi>. 16. I would rather <hi rend="ital">time</hi>
                    destroyed you than <hi rend="ital">woe</hi>. 23. is not <hi rend="ital">sear</hi> an inapplicable word? 30. the moon
                    does not <hi rend="ital">wind</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not think the ode too long. a bad poem
                    cannot be too short, the reverse is not quite true &#8211; &amp;
                    yet I am always sorry to come to the end of what has
                    delighted me. will you have the stanzas seperated in
                    printing, or connected as they sometimes run into each
                    other? &amp; what signature do you chuse? I have a curious
