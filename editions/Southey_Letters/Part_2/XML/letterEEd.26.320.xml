                        who lived in Ormesby, a village to the north of
                        Yarmouth. See <title>The Poll for a Member to Serve in
                            Parliament, for the Borough of Great Yarmouth, in
                            the County of Norfolk; Taken on Friday the 29th of
                            May, 1795</title> (Yarmouth, 1795), p. 19. The names
                        of his wife and daughters are unrecorded.</note> distant
                    six miles from <ref target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref>; we came here yesterday to dinner, we
                    leave it tomorrow evening. I have begun some blank verse to
                    you, &amp; laid it aside because if I do not tell you
                    something about this place now I shall not do it at all.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Manning is a little
                    man, about sixty, he seems to possess great good nature,
                    &amp; much benevolence. as a dissenter he was born to
                    principles of civil &amp; religious liberty, &amp; it is no
                    small merit in a rich dissenter to have adhered to those
                    principles. his two daughters are married; they are
                    accomplished women, at least I conclude so, for the house is
                    decorated with their drawings which are very good. One of
                    them I have seen; she is somewhat deaf, &amp; has that
                    estimable reserve which makes acquaintance difficult. her
                    appearance is interesting, she is not handsome but there is
                    that in her bright grey eyes which is better than beauty,
                    intelligence &amp; feeling. I cannot much like her husband –
                    he seems good natured but I should not judge him capable of
                    that affection necessary to make such a woman happy. Were I
                    a woman, with my present feelings, I do not think I should
                    ever marry, for men are sad beasts.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The ci-devant governess of the daughters
                    still lives with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Manning. I am very much pleased with
                    her. She is not young &amp; never was handsome; but she has
                    good sense, information &amp; great good nature. if you can

                    alterations &amp; some liveliness, you will have a tolerable
                    idea of Miss Marshall, the tones of their voices are
                        alike.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Miss
                        Marshall’s first name and dates are unknown.</note> M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Manning has a lethargic complaint, it
                    prevents her from saying much, but she is attentive &amp;
                    friendly. so much for the inhabitants of Ormsby.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> This part of England looks as if Nature had
                    wearied herself with adorning the rest with hill &amp; dale,
                    &amp; squatted down here to rest herself. you must even
                    suppose a very Dutch looking Nature to have made it of such
                    pancake flatness. an unpromising country; &amp; yet <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> I could be
                    very happy with such a home as this. I am looking from the
                    window over green fields as far as I can see, no great
                    distance, <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> the hedges are
                    all grubbed up in sight of the house which produces a very
                    good effect, a few firs, acacias, white thorns &amp; other
                    trees are scattered about. a walk goes all round, with a
                    beautiful hedge of laylocks – laburnums, the gueldres rose,
                    barbary shrubs &amp;c &amp;c. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> you would
                    not wish a sweeter scene, &amp; being here I wish for
                    nothing but you. half an hours walk would reach the sea
                    shore. I had almost forgot one with whom I am more intimate
                    than any other part of the family – Rover – a noble dog –
                    something of the spaniel, but huge as a mastiff, &amp; his
                    black &amp; brindled hair curling close – almost like a
                    Ladies wig. a very sympathizing dog I assure you, for he
                    will not only shake <del rend="strikethrough">his</del>
                    hands. but if I press his paw, return the pressure. moreover
                    there is excellent Nottingham ale,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Nottingham ale was celebrated in popular
                        song, providing the refrain of ‘When Venus the goddess

<p rend="indent1"> In <ref target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref> I saw but one woman who pleased me. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Edmund Hurry.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably the wife of the Yarmouth
                        merchant Edmund Cobb Hurry (1762–1808); see <title>The

                        (Yarmouth, 1795), p. 16. Edmund Hurry could have been
                        the man described as one of the ‘first merchants’ of
                        Yarmouth, who in 1796 lent John Thelwall (1764–1834;
                            <title>DNB</title>) a warehouse as a lecture venue.
                        When the event disintegrated into violence, a younger
                        member of the Hurry family helped to rescue Thelwall
                        from the mob; see Thelwall’s <title>An Appeal to Popular

                    she is a very interesting woman, about thirty – an excellent

                    dwell has induced that kind of misanthropy which exists only

                    assimilate had time allowed. I speak of her from <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnetts</ref>
                    account. I saw but little of her, enough to be prepossessed
                    in her favour.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The society at <ref target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref> is
                    certainly bad enough. the men are mere sailours – the women
                    mere sailours wives &amp; daughters. yet in the
                    neighbourhood of Martin<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Martin (dates unknown) had
                        resigned from his post as Minister to the Old Meeting,
                        Yarmouth, in 1797 and been replaced by <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George
                            Burnett</ref>.</note> &amp; <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref>,
                    the <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Bishop</ref>
                    enjoys advantages which he would not find elsewhere. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Manning seems much attached to him,
                    perhaps even over-rates his merits. he wishes him to be a
                    frequent guest here, to make it his place of study, &amp;
                    come often for a months residence. he is a good old man. I
                    am very comfortable here <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> – but my
                    heart is always wandering – think you that I should
                    otherwise have sent you so many sheets full of nothing?</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The cows in this country have no horns. this
                    I think a great improvement in the breed of horned cattle;
                    &amp; this kind is found most productive. another
                    peculiarity about <ref target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref> is the number of arches formed by the
                    jaw bones of a whale. they trade much with Greenland there.
                    the old walls &amp; old gates of the town are yet standing.
                    the town is certainly a pleasing one. I left it however with
                    pleasure to enjoy the quietness of Ormsby, &amp; I shall
                    leave Ormsby with equal pleasure for the society of Norwich.
                    in short every movement is agreable because it brings me
                    homewards. </p>

<p rend="indent1"> We went yesterday in the morning to the ruins
                    of Caister Castle, once the seat of Fastollfe, where
                    defeated at Patay &amp; disgraced in consequence of his
                    flight, he retired to quarrel with his neighbours.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Caister Castle, a few
                        miles to the north of Yarmouth, was built by Sir John
                        Fastolf (1380–1459; <title>DNB</title>), the landowner
                        and solider whose retreat from the battle of Patay in
                        1429 had led to the charge of cowardice. Although he was
                        later vindicated, his reputation was permanently
                        scarred. In later life he had the reputation for being
                        litigious.</note> the ruin is by no means fine compared
                    with several that I have seen, but all these things produce
                    a pleasant effect upon the mind – &amp; besides it is well
                    when I am writing about the man to have some knowledge of
                    every thing now knowable respecting him. in the evening we
                    returned with <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref> to Norwich. on the way we left the
                    chaise &amp; crossd a moor on foot in hope of hearing the
                    bitterns cry. it was not till we were just quitting the moor
                    that one of these birds thought proper to gratify us – then
                    he began – &amp; presently we saw one. so that I reenterd
                    the chaise highly satisfied. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> At Ormsby I could have remained with
                    pleasure. Miss Marshal would make any place pleasant – she
                    has a compleat ascendancy over all the family, such as
                    superiour ability &amp; good nature, will everywhere attain
                    to. moreover she has quick feelings &amp; no nasty
                    affectation. I told her the story of Kosciusko &amp; the
                    gingerbread baker.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">When Thaddeus Kosciusko (1746–1817) visited Bristol in
                        June 1797, a local gingerbread baker made a cake
                        inscribed with ‘To the gallant Kosciusko’. Informed that
                        Kosciusko was too ill to receive the gift in person, the
                        baker charged into his sickroom and burst into tears at
                        the sight of the Polish patriot; see Robert Southey to

                        Letter 233.</note> &amp; the tears came instantly into
                    her eyes. now this story is an excellent test of feelings.
