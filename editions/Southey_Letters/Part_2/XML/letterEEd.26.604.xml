                    dissipated make but poor excuses &#8211; nor were it better
                    alledge how many of my friends have the same cause of
                    complaint. From <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref> you know the contents of my
                    letters to him. Since their date I know nothing more of my
                    own destination, nor indeed do I soon expect it. some
                    situation I look to in Italy, of salary equal to the
                    expenditure of an unexpensive man, &amp; of business
                    sufficiently easy to allow leisure for literary amusement,
                    from which I hope to afford the superfluities. you will not

                    life, &amp; happily it suits my inclination as well as my
                    health. that it removes me from my friends is a less evil to
                    me than it would be to those who have known more family
                    comforts. settle where I would, letter-intercourse would be
                    my only means of communicating with most of my friends &#8211;
                    &amp; it matters little whether that be done by a ship or a
                    mail coach. Immediate <hi rend="ital">ease</hi> of

                    writes me that the English must probably soon leave

                    originating in the court of Lisbon, or even in Spanish
                    influence, but from the foolish &amp; plundering spirit of

                        June 1801), 1,200 British troops arrived on the
                        Portuguese island of Madeira in order to protect British

                    him in a tone which long intimacy surely justified, &amp;
                    with an earnestness which only long affection would have
                    produced. he has not replied, &amp; what I have seen in his
                    letters to <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> was only such as equally vexed &amp;
                    provoked me. he writes as a man of neglected merit, offended
                    with the world for overlooking talents &#8211; which he has never
                    given the world an opportunity of estimating. meantime he
