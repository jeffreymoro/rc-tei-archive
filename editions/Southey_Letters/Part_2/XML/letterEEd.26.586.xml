        <p rend="indent1"> In tribulation of trullibubs &amp; trouble of tripes do I begin O
                    Grosvenor. it is not always easy, as you know to settle ones mind &#8211; but prithee
                    take one voyage &amp; it will convince you that it is far more difficult to
                    settle the stomach. I have now been six days &amp; nights at sea, &amp; in that
                    time a lame jackass would have carried me as fast &amp; as far. &amp; Southey
                    what have you been doing? &#8211; Oh I have been &#8211; very sick. you might rhyme to the
                    question if you please. the weather cock has thought proper to point the wrong
                    way, &amp; in contradiction to all proverbs &amp; all our prayers obstinately
                    stand still. we are just now overjoyed at a change of only two points. I have
                    however discovered an excellent substitute for sea sickness, which you know is
                    so fashionable a remedy for sensory disorders &#8211; or rather a method for making
                    people sea sick upon shore. put the <del rend="strikethrough">death</del>
                    patient &lt;to bed&gt; in a long wooden box, six feet by two, <del rend="strikethrough">with bedding</del>, N.B. a coffin will do. hang <del rend="strikethrough">them</del> &lt;him&gt; up in a dark room, rock <del rend="strikethrough">them</del> &lt;him&gt; well, make a great noise &amp; a
                    great stink &#8211; &amp; my life for it <del rend="strikethrough">they</del>
                    &lt;he&gt; will soon be as sick as heart can wish. I have made another discovery
                    &#8211; that I am very good natured, not having one drop of gall in my gall bladder,
                    when the whole contents of my inside came out in long procession. But even worse
                    than sickness is this insufferable tedium &#8211; the mill-stone weight of time! I
                    would write practical comments upon the Book of Job &#8211; if there were a Bible on
                    board. A days travelling in wind &amp; wet over a wilderness of gum cistus is
                    positive happiness in comparison.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A

                    England! England! Oh I do long to stand on firm ground &amp; eat fresh bread

                    no dairy increase their comfort by keeping a milch goat? &#8211; Cannot some means be
                    devised of preserving a man in madeira like a fly for a voyage &#8211; &amp; should
                    there not be a reward offered for a discovery how to entrance such unhappy
                    persons as like me are obliged to cross the sea? N.B. this is well worth the
                    attention of government &amp; the East India company for transporting troops,
                    &amp; the experiment might be tried upon Botany Bay Convicts who ought to have
                    been hung. or in the next expedition to the Coast of France &lt;or Holland&gt;
                    it being of little import whether the men die on the way &#8211; or be killed when
