        <p rend="indent1"> We arrived here on Tuesday night &#8211; to meet ill news &amp;
                    discomfort. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> glanced her eye
                    upon a newspaper &amp; saw that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>
                    was a prisoner at Ferrol.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">It was widely
                        reported in the British Press in early October 1799, e.g. <title>St James&#8217;s
                            Chronicle</title>, 5 October 1799, that the brig, <hi rend="ital">Sylph</hi>, on which <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom
                            Southey</ref> was serving, had been captured and was at the Spanish port
                        of Ferrol.</note> at least his ship is there, but whether there has been an
                    action &amp; whether he is safe or not, we must wait to learn. this suspence is
                    one of the comforts of war, &amp; we have had our share. <ref target="people.html#BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe</ref> who undertook to
                    manage for us here, has managed badly, so that on our arrival we find the house
                    in possession of the old tenant who seems disposed to stick there. so we have
                    turned into lodgings &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my

                    house-hunting while I write. there is no doubt of our soon finding one, so the
                    inconvenience is only temporary &amp; we are likely to better suit ourselves.

                    marshes are flooded of course, this does no harm &amp; makes by moonlight a
                    scene of magnificent dreariness. it impressed me much on my arrival &#8211; the ruins
                    &amp; church by moonlight &amp; the waters out &#8211; &amp; the sky stormy &amp;

                    the wind, now heard alone.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the winter I hope to see you here. the circumstance that
                    detains you in town is an affecting one. death is a strange thing &#8211; life &amp;
                    death are both mysteries, which it is well to contemplate that we may feel our
                    own littleness. it is wonderful how we use words &amp; understand them not &#8211; or
                    not below the surface of their meaning.</p>
