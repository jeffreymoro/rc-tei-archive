                    same way. the Scribe hath made out a catalogue of all books published since the
                    commencement of 97 upon finance &amp; scarcity. he hath also copied a paper
                    written by J. R.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Rickman.</note>
                    containing some Irish Aldermans hints about oak bark, &amp; nothing more hath
                    the Scribe done in his vocation. duly he calls at the <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Chancellor&#8217;s</ref> door &#8211; sometimes he
                    is admitted to immediate audience, sometimes kicketh he his heels in the
                    antechamber (once he kicked them for cold, but now there is a fire), &#8211; sometimes
                    a gracious message emancipates Him for the day. secresy hath been enjoined to
                    him as to these state proceedings. &#8211; on three subjects he is directed to read

                    order. alas! they are heathen Greek to the Scribe! he hath indeed in days of old

                    &amp; remembereth the general principle established. he pre-supposeth that about
                    corn, as about every thing else, the fewer laws the better. of finance he is
                    even more ignorant. concerning the tythes, something knoweth he of the Levitical

            <title>Leviticus</title> 27:

                    of a commutation for Land, something suspecteth he why they are to be altered.
