<p rend="indent1"> I was very glad to see your hand writing
                    again. <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref>
                    did not rightly, it appears, understand my leaving Bristol;
                    it was merely to keep a term, that is to eat three
                    indifferent dinners in bad company.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I know not how to say any thing about
                    settling <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref> under <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref>,
                    except by stating to you how I am circumstanced respecting
                    him. it is not easy to take care of a ready-made family
                    without a ready-made fortune, <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> is no ways
                    connected with me except by friendship, he knew that it
                    would greatly embarrass me to support <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref>,
                    &amp; offered to <del rend="strikethrough">dis xxx</del>
                    discharge his school bills. his intent was to place him
                    under his own tutor, a <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">brother of
                        Coleridge</ref>; but the school was full, &amp; Henrys
                    age would otherwise have been an objection. <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> then
                    requested me to look out any school or situation which I
                    thought proper. Under these circumstances you will see the
                    impropriety of my placing him at all expensively, &amp; were
                        <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref>
                    to lower his terms to the thermometer of my feelings, that
                    would be burthening me with another obligation. I cannot
                    educate him myself, I have no time, my family is already
                    quite as large as my means, &amp; the utter retirement in
                    which we live would be unfavourable for an age when he ought
                    to be forming friendships. I should like him to be with <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref>
                    because he himself wishes it, &amp; because there would be
                    less danger of his contracting any vices there than in a
                    large &amp; promiscuous school, &amp; this is what is most
                    to be feared. the danger you mention I fear he would be
                    likely to incur in most situations. what do you think the
                    lowest sum which it would not be improper to propose to <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref>?</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have been much indisposed &amp; my recovery
                    I am afraid will be slow. my heart is affected, &amp; this
                    at first alarmed me because I could not understand it.
                    however I am scientifically satisfied that it is only a
                    nervous affection. sedentary habits have injured my health,
                        <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> this prescription of
                    exercise prevents me from proceeding with the works that
                    interest me, &amp; only allows time for the task labour
                    which is neither pleasant to look on to or to remember. my
                    leisure is quite destroyed. had it not been for this I
                    should ere now have sent you the remainder of my Eclogues,
                    it is now almost too late for the volume is

<l rend="indent3"> Lived in our village, one from his youth

<l rend="indent3"> Quite dark – &amp; yet he was a merry man

<l rend="indent5"> No Sir! poor fellow – he was wise

<l rend="indent3"> To be content at home, &amp; twas a

<l rend="indent3"> As comfortable Sir, even tho I say
                        it,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> As any in the country. he was left</l>
<l rend="indent3"> A little boy when his poor father
                        died,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Just old enough to totter by himself</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And call his mothers &lt;name.&gt; we two
                        were all,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And as we were not left quite
                        destitute</l>
<l rend="indent3"> We bore up well. in the summer time I
                        workd</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Sometimes a-field. then I was famd for
                        knitting</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And in long winter nights my spinning
                        wheel</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Seldom stood still. we had kind
                        neighbours too</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And never felt distress. so he grew
                        up</l>
<l rend="indent3"> A comely lad, &amp; wondrous well
                        disposed;</l>
<l rend="indent3"> I taught him well. there was not in the
                        parish</l>
<l rend="indent3"> A child who said his prayers more
                        regular,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Or answered readier thro his
                        catechism.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> If I had foreseen this! but tis a
                        comfort</l>
<l rend="indent3"> We do’nt know what we’re born to.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> But how came it</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He chose to be a Sailor.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> You shall hear Sir.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> As he grew up he used to watch the
                        birds</l>
<l rend="indent3"> In the corn – childs work you know, &amp;
                        easily done</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Tis an idle sort of task, so he built
                        up</l>
<l rend="indent3"> A little hut of wicker work &amp;
                        clay</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Under the hedge to shelter him in the
                        rain.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And then he took – for very idleness</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To making traps to catch the
                        plunderers,</l>
<l rend="indent3"> All sorts of cunning traps that boys can
                        make.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Propping a stone to fall &amp; shut them
                        in</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Or crush them with its weight, or else a
                        springe</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Swung on a bough. he made them cleverly – </l>
<l rend="indent3"> And I – poor foolish woman, I was
                        pleasd</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To see the boy so handy. you may
                        guess</l>
<l rend="indent3"> What followed Sir from this unlucky
                        skill.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He did what he should not when he grew
                        older – </l>
<l rend="indent3"> I warnd him oft enough, but he was
                        caught</l>
<l rend="indent3"> In wiring hares at last, &amp; had his
                        choice</l>
<l rend="indent3"> The prison or the ship.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> The choice at least</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Was kindly left him, &amp; for broken
                        laws</l>
<l rend="indent3"> This was methinks no heavy
                        punishment.</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Woman.</l>
<l rend="indent3"> So I was told Sir, &amp; I tried to think
                        so – </l>
<l rend="indent3"> But twas a sad blow to me. I was usd</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To sleep a nights soundly &amp;
                        undisturbd – </l>
<l rend="indent3"> Now if the wind blew rough it made me
                        start</l>
<l rend="indent3"> And think of my poor boy tossing
                        about</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Upon the roaring seas! &amp; then I
                        seemd</l>
<l rend="indent3"> To feel – that it was hard to take him
                        for me</l>
<l rend="indent3"> For such a little fault! – but he was
                        wrong</l>
<l rend="indent3"> Oh very wrong – a murrain on his
                        traps</l>
<l rend="indent3"> See what theyve brought him to!</l>
<l rend="indent5"> Traveller.</l>
<l rend="indent6"> Well well take comfort</l>
<l rend="indent3"> He will be taken care of if he lives – </l>
