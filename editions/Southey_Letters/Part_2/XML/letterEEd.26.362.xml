                    did not rightly, it appears, understand my leaving Bristol;
                    it was merely to keep a term, that is to eat three
                    indifferent dinners in bad company.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I know not how to say any thing about

                    except by stating to you how I am circumstanced respecting
                    him. it is not easy to take care of a ready-made family
                    without a ready-made fortune, <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> is no ways
                    connected with me except by friendship, he knew that it
                    would greatly embarrass me to support <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref>,
                    &amp; offered to <del rend="strikethrough">dis xxx</del>
                    discharge his school bills. his intent was to place him
                    under his own tutor, a <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">brother of
                        Coleridge</ref>; but the school was full, &amp; Henrys
                    age would otherwise have been an objection. <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> then
                    requested me to look out any school or situation which I
                    thought proper. Under these circumstances you will see the
                    impropriety of my placing him at all expensively, &amp; were
                        <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref>
                    to lower his terms to the thermometer of my feelings, that
                    would be burthening me with another obligation. I cannot
                    educate him myself, I have no time, my family is already
                    quite as large as my means, &amp; the utter retirement in
                    which we live would be unfavourable for an age when he ought
                    to be forming friendships. I should like him to be with <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref>
                    because he himself wishes it, &amp; because there would be
                    less danger of his contracting any vices there than in a
                    large &amp; promiscuous school, &amp; this is what is most
                    to be feared. the danger you mention I fear he would be
                    likely to incur in most situations. what do you think the
                    lowest sum which it would not be improper to propose to <ref target="people.html#MauriceMichael">Maurice</ref>?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been much indisposed &amp; my recovery
                    I am afraid will be slow. my heart is affected, &amp; this
                    at first alarmed me because I could not understand it.
                    however I am scientifically satisfied that it is only a
                    nervous affection. sedentary habits have injured my health,
                        <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> this prescription of
                    exercise prevents me from proceeding with the works that

                    which is neither pleasant to look on to or to remember. my
                    leisure is quite destroyed. had it not been for this I
                    should ere now have sent you the remainder of my Eclogues,
