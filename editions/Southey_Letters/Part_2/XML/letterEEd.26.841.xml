          <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will, perhaps, have been wondering that I
                    had not earlier written; and earlier I certainly should have
                    written had there been any thing pleasant to communicate.
                    Here we are, after a long and wearying journey, little short
                    of the whole length of England. On the way, we stayed five
                    days with our friend <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref>, whom you saw with us in London. This
                    halt was every way desirable, for <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> was in
                    wretched health when we left Bristol, hardly recovered from
                    a very sharp attack of fever; but she was impatient to be
                    gone. I could tell you what feelings came upon me at leaving
                    the house wherein I had been so happy and so afflicted; but
                    it would be folly not to suppress thoughts that end only in
                    pain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Nothing in England can be more beautiful than
                    the site of this house. Had this country but the sky of
                    Portugal, it would leave me nothing to wish for. I shall
                    make the experiment this winter; and, if my health bear up
                    well till the next summer, shall look for no other home.
                    But, in truth, my expectations have been so often blighted,
                    that when I think of any plans for the future, it is with
                    the same sort of incredulity that I recollect a dream.
                    Meantime, I make myself as comfortable as I can: to be away
                    from my books is a sore evil. I have sent enough by the
                    waggon to employ me till the experiment of climate be fairly
                    tried; and if it should succeed, can then, without
                    imprudence, collect my scattered sheep. My head, too, is
                    happily well stored with raw materials, which will not be
                    soon exhausted by the manufactory, &#8211; and <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> is company enough. For one whose habits
                    are so sedentary as mine, and whose inclinations cling so
                    obstinately to the hearth-stone, it is of some consequence
                    to be in a country that tempts him to exercise. I have been
                    round the Lake, and up Skiddaw, and along the river Greta,
                    and to Lodore. If air and exercise were the <hi rend="ital">panacea</hi>, here I must needs be well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wish it were in my power to give you a good
                    account of <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>; she is very unwell, and at present
                    incapable of any enjoyment. It has been a heavy blow upon
                    us. My own mind is active even to restlessness, and it has
                    now been exerted to its force, &#8211; still the effect is deeper
                    and will be more lasting than I expected. I cannot shut out
                    the shooting recollections that flash upon me. If I yielded
                    to my inclination, it would keep me sauntering in solitude &#8211;
                    dreaming of the other world, and the state of the dead. I
                    trust, however, to give you a good sum of my winter&#8217;s
                    work.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My baggage is arrived &#8211; as few books as
                    possible, though enough for many a hard week&#8217;s occupation.
