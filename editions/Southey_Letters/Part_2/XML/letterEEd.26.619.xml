                    yet they will mend when I get home. it is not good for man
                    to be alone &#8211; &amp; tho it were good, it would not be
                    agreable. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Where should I lodge in town to be near Great
                    George Street? I think the River streets from <ref target="places.html#Strand">the Strand</ref> are not too
                    far. &amp; a more important question &#8211; shall I know as much
                    of you when we are in the same place &#8211; as when half the
                    island seperates us? &#8211; now Grosvenor make you a good
                    resolution &#8211; &amp; look you keep it.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Oh &#8211; I had almost forgotten two points of
                    antiquity. It is the opinion of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> that the Irish are descended from
                    certain aboriginals who escaped the deluge in a cock boat,
                    that rested upon Mount Taurus. &#8211; my own idea is that they
                    are of Cretan race &#8211; the descendants of Pasiphae.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Both these stories connect
                        the Irish to bulls. Taurus was the name of a bull in
                        Greek mythology. Pasiphae, Queen of Crete, fell in love
                        with him and their child was the Minotaur.</note>
