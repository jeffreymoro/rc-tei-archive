                    cares &amp; calculations &amp; hopes that I shall very long
                    feel the loss. but enough of this. I have something of your
                    philosophy. which old Epictetus<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Epictetus (c. 55-135 AD), Greek Stoic

                    foolish it is to foster unavailing thoughts of
                    disquietude.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The disturbances &amp; inconveniences of a
                    sick house have hitherto kept me from seeing your

                    are bad rooms, &amp; unfurnished. still if I can hire
                    furniture I am disposed to like the scheme &#8211; because we
                    become as independant as dwellers in the Inns of Court or
                    Colleges, &amp; because I may doubtless lock up my books

                        government funds. In fact, he was participating in a
                        parliamentary expenses scandal. The secretarial post was
                        a front, and Corry fraudulently diverted Southey&#8217;s

        <p rend="indent1"> The uncomfortable state of feelings to which
                    of late I have been subject, have produced some good. I felt
