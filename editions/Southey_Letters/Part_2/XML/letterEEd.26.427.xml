        <p rend="indent1"> Since my last I have endured a perpetual
                    state of uneasiness on account of <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> health.
                    you know we purposed visiting Devonshire. for some time
                    previous to our departure she had been exceedingly unwell, &#8211;
                    it was thought the journey would benefit her &amp; we set
                    out in much hope, fortified with advice &amp; a stock of
                    medecines. We got to Minehead, where I intended to pass a
                    fortnight. during the whole of that period she was so
                    exceedingly ill as to make me think it expedient to return.
                    she however slowly amended. <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> came to her &amp; <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> returned
                    with her, a distance of but a few miles, if she amended we
                    could proceed from thence &#8211; if not we should be nearer
                    Bristol. I went westwards, for much confinement &amp; little
                    sleep had brought back my old evil symptoms with greater
                    violence than ever. on my return I find her still slowly
                    amending.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In these circumstances &amp; under this state
                    of mind you will see how impossible it is that I should have
                    done anything. I only played with the pen I took up &#8211; &amp;
                    if a book was open before me read the words &amp; scarcely
                    affixed to them any meaning.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My walk has not perceptibly benefited me &#8211; it
                    was from Minehead down the North coast of Somersetshire to
                    Ilfracombe &amp; round by Barnstable Tiverton &amp;
                        Taunton.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">For

                    little village on the coast is the most interesting place I
                    have yet seen in this country. the roads to it on all sides
                    are unpassable by a carriage &amp; it is of course little
                    known. imagine two mountain streams each running down a dell
                    among crags like a long waterfall &#8211; the one dell richly
                    wooded, the other winding among bare &amp; stony hills. a
                    fine eminence rises between these dells &amp; where the two
                    streams meet Lymouth stands &#8211; they flow into the channel
                    immediately at their junction &amp; of course the roar of
                    the sea forms one sound<del rend="strikethrough">s</del>
                    with the dashing of the rivers. even without the sea this
                    place would be one of the most interesting I ever saw.
                    ascending half a mile from hence up a road serpentinely
                    perpendicular almost you turn into the Valley of Stones &#8211; a
                    miraculous place. the range of hills here next the sea are
                    completely stripped of their soil &amp; only the bones of
                    the earth left &#8211; stone upon stone. Its origin I could not
                    conjecture. water if it had overwhelmed it must have
                    inundated all the lower lands in the country, for these are
                    very high &#8211; &amp; yet the hills on the other side the Valley
                    &#8211; not an arrows flight distant are cloathed with herbage. a
                    water spout perhaps &#8211; but I am no naturalist to my shame,
                    &amp; so endeavoured to find out a poetic origin for it. was
                    it the work of our aboriginal giants? no &#8211; for Goemagog one
                    of the hugest was not so big but Corineus could carry him &#8211;
                    ergo no Giants could have been large-limbd enough.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Geoffrey of Monmouth
