<p rend="indent1"> An unhappy continuance of ill winds so long
                    delayed the packet that only this day my letters arrived, it

<p rend="indent1"> The crowd of news harrasses me. in England
                    ones private politics are served up at their due intervals –

                        uncle, Herbert Hill, had proposed that Henry Herbert
                        Southey might become an Anglican clergyman, a path that
                        Southey had rejected. This would mean Henry would have
                        to attend Oxford University and subscribe to the 39
                        Articles of the Church of England.</note> but – it is
                    morally impossible that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>
                    ever can believe all the nine &amp; thirty absurdities. you
                    know &amp; I know how these things must shock one who thinks
                    at all. what I dread is – first his danger at the University
                    – <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>
                    is very vain – &amp; to escape the soul &amp; body-pollution
                    of Oxford debauchery requires a stronger moral constitution
                    than his appears to be. he has talents – &amp; he has lived
                    among a society of free-<hi rend="ital">speakers</hi>.
                    moreover the recollection of my opinions would outweigh a
                    folio full of church authorities with him. I fear – that he
                    will profess &amp; disbelieve – sign all &amp; believe none.
                    If otherwise – if he could swallow all – so much the better.
                    I shall abstain from all advice. how can I persuade him to
                    that which I would not do myself? &amp; to influence him
                    against it would be unjust to the little world of his
                    relations. I wish him sincerely to embrace the offer, if he
                    can sincerely embrace it. his choice is made – &amp; so some

<p rend="indent1"> The Death of the Prime Minister<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey seems to have
                        confused two different events. The head of the
                        Portuguese Treasury and former Secretary of State (prime
                        minister) in 1786-1788, Tomas Xavier de Lima Teles da
                        Silva, Marquess of Ponte de Lima (1727-1800), had died
                        on 23 December 1800. But while his successor as
                        Secretary of State in 1788-1801, Luis Pinto de Sousa
                        Coutinho, Viscount of Balsemao (1735-1804), was
                        dismissed on 6 January 1801, he was still very much
                        alive, remaining in the ministry as Foreign Secretary
                        until 21 May 1801 and returning as Secretary of State in

                    changes. the paper money by a few common sense regulations
                    is recovering its credit. alarms occasionally prevail of
                    France &amp; Spain – foolishly enough – as I believe some of
                    my former letter may have sufficiently proved. the <del rend="strikethrough">Plague</del> Yellow Fever dozes in
