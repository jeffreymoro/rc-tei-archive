                        Institution, London, Davy MSS.  Previously  published:
                        John Davy (ed.), Fragmentary Remains, Literary
                            and Scientific, of Sir Humphry Davy, Bart.
                        (London, 1858), pp. 47-48.Dating note: The letter
                        was written from Dublin. Similarities between this and
                        letters to Edith Southey and John May of 16 October 1801
                        (Letters 616 and 615 respectively), giving Southey’s
                        postal address, suggest that this was written around
                        that time. Southey left Dublin on 23 October
                        1801.</p>

<p rend="indent1"> It is since we parted at Bristol that I read
                    the Gowrie,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William
                        Rough, <title>The Conspiracy of Gowrie</title> (1800).
                        Rough had been a schoolboy at Westminster with Southey
                        in 1786-1792. His first book was <title>Lorenzino di
                            Medici, and Other Poems</title> (1797).</note> &amp;
                    indeed after what you had said, I read it with astonishment.
                    you had praised it, &amp; your praise passed current with me
                    – perhaps because I had received so much of it myself, but
                    still more because on other subjects I had never heard it
                    ill bestowed. the Gowrie I thought very, very bad. there
                    were imitations from all writers – a leading dash of the

                        Trinity College, Oxford 1793-1794, when Southey had been
                        at <ref target="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</ref>. He had to leave after an altercation
                        with some fellow students led him to fire a shotgun at
                        the closed shutters of a window.</note> running thro the
                    whole. no character, no feeling, no truth of nature.
                    metaphor heaped upon metaphor, an eternal reasoning –
                    soliloquizing conversations about nothing. <ref target="people.html#RoughWilliam">Rough</ref> promised
                    much when a school boy, but I am satisfied that he never
                    will perform any thing great. his first book was feeble –
                    this is turgid, the palsy – &amp; the dropsy. he has not a
                    healthy genius.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I now remember who the author of Gebir is. he
                    was a contemporary of mine at Oxford – of Trinity, &amp;
                    notorious as a mad Jacobine. his Jacobinism would have made
                    me seek his acquaintance but for his madness. he was obliged
                    to leave the University for shooting at one of the Fellows
                    thro the window. all this I immediately recollected on
                    getting at his name. – how could you compare this mans book
                    with <ref target="people.html#RoughWilliam">Roughs</ref>?
                    the lucid passages of Gebir are all palpable to the eye –
                    they are the master touches of a painter – there is power in
                    them, &amp; passion, &amp; thought &amp; knowledge.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I was travelling in Wales, thro the country
                    of Madoc,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had
                        finished a version of <title>Madoc</title> in 1797-1799,
                        but was revising it for publication. It did not appear
                        until 1805.</note> when <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> summoned
                    me hither. Upon that poem I meant to have employed myself,
                    &amp; to have laboured at it, compleatly recasting the
                    metal. now I know little what leisure will be left me, but
                    there is no reason to fear unremitting task work. in common
                    prudence the offer could not be refused, &amp; there were
                    also feelings of a higher order which left me no choice.
                    What <del rend="strikethrough">little</del> I have heard of
                    the rulers here is very favourable. they are encouragers of
                    science &amp; literature, laborious in removing old
                    grievances, <del rend="strikethrough">wash</del> cleaning
