        <p rend="indent1"> Before my departure from England I proceed to
                    state to you all my arrangements, as far as they are made.
                    first as to pecuniary matters reviewing of course must be
                    suspended, &amp; I have for some months ceased writing for
                    the news-paper,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had ceased contributing poems to the
                            <title>Morning Post</title> in December 1799.</note>
                    owing to inability from ill-health. the loss is not less
                    than an hundred a year. but an old school fellow (a
                    clergyman, by <del rend="strikethrough">na</del> name <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsly</ref>)
                    understanding from <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> that I was going abroad, immediately offered
                    me, thro him, an hundred pounds: a sum which will defray the
                    expences of the journey, the voyage, &amp; the personal
                    expences necessary to clothe us for <del rend="strikethrough">a</del> twelvemonths absence. this
                    done, my annual income remains, <del rend="strikethrough">f</del> &#163;160.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The amount of Southey&#8217;s annuity from Wynn.</note> which
                    you will receive quarterly for me, &amp; to which amount I
                    will draw on you. <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> there
                    will be also from ten to twenty pounds due from the Critical
                    Review, which I shall direct to be paid to you. &#8211; I shall
                    send over my Thalaba for publication from Lisbon &#8211; this will
                    assuredly, tho I reserve the <del rend="strikethrough">afte</del> copyright of the after editions, produce
                    &#163;100. Some one of my friends,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</ref>.</note> who is connected with
                    the booksellers, will transact the business for me, &amp;
                    the money shall be deposited in your hands. this is my fund
                    for our return. if peace permits I will return over the
                    Pyrenees &#8211; &amp; in that case the journey will pay its own
                    expences. my destined employment in Portugal you are
                    acquainted with. in order to keep up my connection with the
                    Critical Review I have engaged to review Portugueze books &#8211;
                    &amp; Spanish if I can get them.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">This arrangement fell through.</note>
                    there will be so little to do that it cannot be estimated at
                    more than ten pounds worth &#8211; but it continues my connection:
                    the Annual Anthology remains charged for some articles which
                    I wish to have sent for <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> in
                    the autumn, &amp; for ten pounds towards the maintenance of
                        <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">my cousin
                        Margaret</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> &#8211;
                    this is the most awkward circumstance. I had been looking on
                    to a house in London where he could have had a home when he
