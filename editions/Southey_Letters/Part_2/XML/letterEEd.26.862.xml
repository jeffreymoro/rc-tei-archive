        <p rend="indent2"> Thus far had I written yesterday immediately
                    on receiving yours. this evening there arrives a letter
                    inclosing a draft on me for five pounds thirteen drawn by
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">my brother
                        Edward</ref> &#8211; the letter by the hand writing comes from
                    some low tradesman &#8211; it is dated Exeter &amp; says that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> informed
                    the writer I was duly advised &amp; requests it may be
                    accepted &amp; returned by return of post. it had been
                    directed to Bristol. I am very much disturbd &amp;
                    distressed by this circumstance. For what he can have
                    incurred the expence God knows. &amp; for a boy of fifteen
                    to be taking up money in my name is a thing which must not
                    be permitted. You know as much of his situation as I do,
                    &amp; if he be at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Barhams<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">John Barham Foster-Barham

                        Southey had made his acquaintance is unclear.</note> by
                    invitation to spend his Xmas his washing bills are all the
                    expences he need incur. I know not what to do &amp; never
                    stood so much in need of advice. my first feeling was
                    immediately to return the draft unaccepted, that the boy may
                    feel the consequences of his ill conduct immediately &#8211; for
                    sure I am in my own mind that he must be made to feel sooner
                    or later, &amp; that if he be now encouraged to rely on me I
                    shall never be safe. &#8211; On consulting with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Coleridge</ref> I
                    have done this &#8211; &amp; have told the holder of the draft
                    that not knowing the cause or occasion I could not conceive
                    what circumstances could have justified a respectable
                    tradesman in cashing a draft for a boy <del rend="strikethrough">just</del> &lt;of&gt; fifteen. &#8211;
                    &amp; I have said to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> that he ought to know as I would always
                    exert myself to the utmost to serve him &amp; assist him in
                    any worthy pursuit, so he ought to be sure that I would
                    never become an accomplice in any immoral action by giving
                    my after sanction. this lesson will teach him that I can act
                    decidedly.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Could I with propriety have detained the
                    draft I should have awaited your advice. as that could not
                    be I think what has been done is on the whole best &#8211; painful
                    as it is. He can have no excuse for what he has done, having
                    without my knowledge &amp; against my known opinion quitted
                    the situation in which I had placed him.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">On the brig-sloop HMS <hi rend="ital">Suffisante</hi>.</note> clothes he could
                    not want having been fitted for the navy in August &amp;
                    having a new plain suit just before, &amp; being by his own
                    account at a private house he can have no justifiable
                    expence to that amount. the holder of the draft says <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> told him
                    I was advised &#8211; this was not the case &#8211; the boy thought to
                    take me by surprize. I feel confident that if I had in this
                    instance yielded he would have imagined me in his power
                    &amp; proceeded from bad to worse. As it now stands the

                    frighten him &#8211; the man must take back whatever he has

                    accepted a draft from a boy. &#8211; I thought to have ended the
                    letter very differently but thus it is I am plagued &amp;
                    thus it will continue to be. It was <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref>
