                        Second</ref> has quarrelled with me in the oddest of all
                    possible ways. he says I treated him with neglect &amp;
                    contempt in London. &amp; that another person saw it as well
                    as himself. there is reason to believe he means <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref>, &amp; if it
                    be so <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref>
                    has been making some mistake about him as well as me, taking
                    jest perhaps for sober earnest. this however is the least
                    part of my offence. I &amp; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> he says have been the cause of all his
                    unhappiness &amp; what he justly calls idiotism. we never
                        <hi rend="ital">treated</hi> him properly. now <hi rend="ital">treated</hi> is here used in the Dispensary
                    sense of the word. &#8220;Every human being can influence the mind
                    of another human being if placed near him, &amp; upon this
                    great truth all the principles of education depend&#8221;. <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> the <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Second George</ref>
                    laid down this proposition in Bristol streets at noon day,

                    that every body might hear him, &amp; rolling his eyes to
                    see who listened. well &#8211; now for the <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxx</del> minor. but you &amp;
                        <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> did not properly influence my mind.
                    &amp; so the syllogism was to end in a quarrel. that is he
                    gravely desired never to see me while he was in Bristol. his
                    mind was not healthy enough to form a sound result (tho he
                    was sure he was right) &#8211; &amp; if on his recovery from a
                    stomach complaint he found out that he had been mistaken in
                    thinking thus harshly of me &#8211; why he would let me know. All
                    this is truly absurd &#8211; but certain old habits of affection
                    make me sorry for it. damn his fools head &#8211; he has been
                    feeding upon Scotch metaphysics &amp; now brings up a crude
                    mouthful at every eructation. he <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxx</del> walks tiptoe &amp; talks of his &#8220;high
                    moral views of things &amp; principles of action above those
                    of common men.&#8221; common men! by God he is an uncommon one.
