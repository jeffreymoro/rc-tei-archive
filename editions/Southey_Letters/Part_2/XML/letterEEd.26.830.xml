        <p rend="indent1"> I wrote to you yesterday in haste &amp; since
                    that, <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has
                    been seized with what would have been fever if it had not
                    been stopt in time. Of course it delays our departure, but I
                    trust not later than Monday. Thoroughly comfortless as this
                    house is become I know not whether this illness should
                    altogether be considered as a misfortune &#8211; bodily suffering
                    in some degree acts as an antidote against worse feelings.
                    in all probability she has brought it on herself by refusing
                    to take food for almost three days &#8211; now she takes medicines
                    more patiently than she ever did (you know her mulishness of
                    old) &#8211; in the hope of getting well &amp; departing.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I too am suffering for want of uniform self
                    command. my eyes which God created for the purpose of
                    reading &amp; writing I used as water works with a womanly
                    profusion by fits, the one presently became sore &#8211; &amp;
                    warm salt water proved a most vile collyrium. let what will
                    happen, grief must find some other vent in me. You see the
                    original sin begins to appear again in me. in truth I can be
                    chearful &amp; joyous even now, &amp; shall soon be
                    contented &#8211; but to be as happy as I was four weeks agone &#8211;
                    so calmly &amp; completely happy, &amp; so awake to that
                    happiness as to break out into fits of boyish sportiveness
                    as I then did &#8211; O Christ it must be a long time before that
                    blessed state be restored to me. the pain of amputation is
                    over &#8211; but God knows how I miss the limb! &amp; I could
                    &amp; would go on but these damned hydraulics begin to work,
                    &amp; if I cry I must actually roar. I never before
                    understood the force of Quarles&#8217;s quaint phrase to be
                    pickled in the brine of one&#8217;s own tears.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Quarles (1592-1644;
