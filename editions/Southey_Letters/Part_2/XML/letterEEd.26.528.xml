                    live, is very unpleasant bare, burnt, hills, bearing nothing
                    but wind-mills. the valley of Alcantara, over which the
                    great Aqueduct passes is indeed very striking, it winds
                    among these hills, &amp; perhaps owes much of its beauty to
                    the contrast &#8211; like the villages in the South Downs &#8211; &amp;
                    that beautiful valley on the left of the road from Salisbury
                    to Deptford Inn. in rich countries they would not be noticed
                    &#8211; but here &#8211; they are like water in the deserts. The whole
                    road to <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> is
                    thus ugly &amp; uninteresting &#8211; the road paved all the way,
                    a very Devils-bowling-alley &#8211;. you can imagine no scenery
                    more wearying. but Eastward of Lisbon it is totally
                    different. there all is rich &amp; beautiful &#8211; exquisitely
                    beautiful now that the green corn &amp; the vineyards give
                    it all the fresh verdure of an English landscape. yesterday
                    evening I took a long ride there with <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>
                    about the valley of Chellas, the gardens of which delightful
                    spot chiefly supply Lisbon. the place is intersected by a
                    thousand bye lanes, unenterable by carriage &#8211; &amp; as
                    intricate as one of the last propositions in Euclid,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Euclid (fl. 300 BC),

                    in this scenery there is scarcely an English feature &#8211;
                    orange trees in the gardens, &amp; vine-covered
                    trellis-walks &#8211; olive-trees growing in the corn fields,
                    &amp; now in full blossom &#8211; the blossom is somewhat like the
                    old-mans-beard of our hedges, not so striking at a distance
                    as when looked into, but it gives a greyness to the tree, a
                    sober blossom in character with the dusky foliage. fig-trees
                    &#8211; their broad leaves so green &amp; rich &#8211; &amp; a few
                    broad-headed pine-trees &#8211; here &amp; there, &amp; cherres
                    apricots &amp;c in the gardens varying the verdure. in the
                    gardens is usually a water-wheel, &amp; the garden is veined
                    with little aqueducts. these wheels creak eternally &#8211; &amp;
                    such is the force of association that the Portugueze reckon
                    this creaking among the delights of the country &#8211; they think
                    of water, &amp; the garden revived by it. the country looks
                    covered with wood &#8211; not indeed of forest size &#8211; but large
                    enough for beauty, &amp; all useful. the fences are either
                    walls &#8211; &amp; the walls are soon covered with luxuriant
                    vegetation in this country, &#8211; or aloe-guarded banks. &amp;
                    the aloe is magnificent &#8211; the stem of the blossom looks
                    &lt;almost&gt; like a piece of timber. &amp; the fennel
                    grows finely as a weed &#8211; you know its handsome leaf, fine as
                    vegetable threads &#8211; or like <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> hair fine &amp; curled, its blossom growing
                    tall <del rend="strikethrough">&amp; to be seen at some

                    idea of these bank-fences. our way was up &amp; down steep
                    hills, whence we looked over the valley, its scattered
                    houses, &amp; here &amp; there a convent &#8211; always a
                    beautiful object, &amp; sometimes the river, &amp; its far
                    shore like a low cloud. It was dusk before we returned &amp;
                    the fireflies were awake &#8211; flashing about the banks, &amp;
                    then putting out their candles, &amp; again in light &#8211; like

        <p rend="indent1"> The warm weather is come. we shut our windows
                    to exclude the heated air, &amp; our shutters to darken the

                    more endurable than the intense light. this is insufferably
                    painful &#8211; the houses are white &#8211; the stones in the street
                    white &#8211; the very dust bleached &#8211; &amp; all reflect back upon
                    us the scorching sun. the light is like the white quivering
                    of a furnace fire: it dazzles &amp; makes the eyes ache &#8211;
                    &amp; blindness is very common. At evening the sea breeze
                    rises &#8211; a sudden change! tremendous for an invalid &#8211; but it
                    purifies the town, &amp; then owl-like we come out of our

                    procured in the legal way. one of these was taken up near
                    our door a few days since, a public calamity I assure you.

                    just reached me &#8211; a welcome visitant. here a letter is of
                    tenfold more value than in England, our friends are perhaps
                    like our daily comforts, their value hardly understood till
                    we are deprived of them. &#8211; I go on comfortably, the weather
                    makes me lazy &amp; yet I have read enormously &amp;
                    digested much. laziness is the <del rend="strikethrough">cou</del> influenza of the country. the stone cutter
                    will lay his head upon the stone at which he has worked,
                    &amp; sleep, tho it be hot enough to boil a beef[MS
                    obscured] very days are lazy. it was but yesterday I saw a
                    great son of a bitch, (literally,) let a mule step upon him
                    from sheer laziness, &amp; then he rose howling &amp; <hi rend="ital">walked</hi> away. the fellows lie sleeping
                    every where in the streets &#8211; they seem to possess the power
                    of sleeping where they will. Everlasting noise is another
                    characteristic of Lisbon. their noon-fireworks &#8211; their
                    cannonading on every fool pretext &#8211; their bells to every
                    goat in a flock &amp; every mule in a drove prove this &#8211;
                    above all their everlasting bell ding-donging &#8211; for bell <hi rend="ital">ringing</hi> would convey the English idea
                    of music, &amp; here it is only noise. A merchant not far

                    was near him, &amp; the Invalids were disturbed &amp; of

                    that he would have the goodness to dispense with the

                    at last when Maria was cleaning the adjoining room we heard
                    it. she was laying the dust &amp; in the same way as she
                    damps the cloaths in ironing &#8211; by taking a great mouthfull
                    of water &amp; then squirting it out, &#8211; this is the
