                        legend, Nicostrata (or Carmenta) was the daughter of
                        Ionius, King of Arcadia. She and her son settled on the
                        site of the future city of Rome, where she invented the
                        alphabet used in Latin and taught it to the local
                        people. Rickman and Turner had drawn Southey&#8217;s attention
                        to a Latin verse quoted in Pietro Crinito (1475-1507),
                            <title>De Honesta Disciplina</title> (1504), Book
                        17, which told this story and claimed that an alphabet
                        was taught to the Goths by Gulfilas (c. 311-382), Arian
                        bishop of the Visigoths, before they settled in Spain.
                        In fact, Gulfilas invented a specific Gothic alphabet
                        when he translated the Bible into Gothic. The Visigoths
                        did not reject Arianism for Catholicism until 589 and
                        their Kingdom in Spain lasted until the Arab invasion of
                        711-712.</note> But may not the lines refer to the
