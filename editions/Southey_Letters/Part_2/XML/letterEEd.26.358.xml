          <salute>My dear friend</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am making enquiries for some school suitable for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>. a fellow collegian of
                    mine was usher at a school in Devonshire, at Kingsbridge. to him I shall write
                    &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">mark</del> learn particulars. <ref target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref> is in orders himself,
                    a good scholar, indeed there were few equal to him at <ref target="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</ref>, &amp; a man of more
                    faultless character I never knew. I think from his attachment to me, if he still
                    be at Kingsbridge that he would pay more than common attention to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the meantime it is necessary to remove <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>, as at present he is an
                    incumbrance to <del rend="strikethrough">Har</del>
          <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge"> Burnett</ref>. will you be good enough
                    to house him for one night? it is not without something like reluctance that I
                    ask this, willingly as you will do it. but he is too young to shift for himself.
                    With one nights rest he will be fit for another journey. he had better travel by
                    night, on account of the time for beginning &amp; ending his journey; &amp; in
                    the coach that goes from the Saracens Head, Snow Hill, or the Bolt-in-Tun. Fleet
                    Street. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Since my return I have been very much troubled with a return of
                    my indisposition. I can account for it by two days inactivity during the wet
                    weather, but it is a sad thing to be affected by not taking exercise for two
                    days &amp; those not successive ones. so now be the weather what it will I walk.
                    this destroys much time &amp; much comfort. my head indeed is not idle. I pursue
                    my plans, view my purposed subjects in every different light, &amp; mature them
                    in these walks. but all this does not make it the more agreable to get wet
                    thro.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The story of the Pythoness stolen away by a young
                        Thessalian,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Pythia was the title
                        given to the priestess of Apollo at Delphi, who was famous for her
                        prophecies, uttered under the influence of vapours rising from the earth.
                        The priestess was originally always a young virgin, but after Echecrates the
                        Thessalian kidnapped and raped the incumbent, the priestess was always
                        chosen from among old women.</note> strikes me as the best adapted for
                    scenic representation, by the pageantry it allows, &amp; by its capability of
                    dramatic effect. I have not access to Diodorus Siculus,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Greek historian of 1st century BC. This story appears in
                            <title>Biblioteke</title>, 16.26.</note> the author who relates the
                    fact, &amp; in whom possibly names &amp; dates might be found. as yet the vague
                    outline only of a few characters &amp; scenes is present to my mind, &amp; for
                    the story I have no plan. perhaps I must connect some historical event with it.
                    for instance the irruption of the Gauls under Brennus;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Chieftain of a group of Gauls who invaded Greece in 279 BC.
                        They were defeated at Delphi and Brennus committed suicide.</note> &#8211; at
                    present the idea is fermenting in my head. I see something fine in the scenery &#8211;
                    Parnassus &#8211; the Temple &#8211; the adytum. &amp; something <del rend="strikethrough">to</del> dramatic in the Pythoness <hi rend="ital">then</hi> a young woman,
                    exposed to a maddening vapour by the villainy of the Priests, &amp; probably
                    believing herself chosen by Apollo to the distinguishd suffering. then the
                    Thessalians superstitious horror &#8211; like a traveller on the hill top in a fog I
                    know there must be a fine prospect, but cannot see it yet. however let the
                    subject please me ever so much, I will adhere to my intention of making six
                    skeletons before I dress up one &amp; breathe life into it. the drama would not
                    be my choice. it is not my own ground, but I think I can stand upon it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have begun the ninth book of Madoc,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The manuscript version of <title>Madoc</title>, completed in
                        1799, had fifteen books.</note> &amp; look on to the completion of the poem. this
                    will be a great thing done. &amp; however pleasant a journey may be, I am always
                    glad to arrive at the end of it.</p>
