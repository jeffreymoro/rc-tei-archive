        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter seems to hint at an employment
                    quite incompatible with my inclinations &amp; talents &amp;
                        pursuits.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Rickman
                        had probably suggested Southey take up a post as a
                        tutor.</note> there is no employment, if I rightly
                    apprehend you, for which I am less fitted. I have learnt too
                    irregularly to teach with method. besides tasks of this kind
                    so teaze &amp; tire the mind that it becomes unfit for
                    anything. the common business of the world may be done with
                    the eye &amp; the hand &#8211; while the brain sleeps; &#8211; but in
                    this &#8211; tis the horse in the mill &#8211; effort without
                    advancing.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I forgot to ask whether &#8211; &amp; you have not
                    mentioned if certain boxes of books were deposited at your
                    house the day of your departure? my flock must be gathered
                    together. I shall look out a house about Richmond &amp;
                    settle myself as soon as circumstances permit our removal. I
                    have caught some little calculation from you, &amp; find
                    that whatever makes me lose time from my history<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s uncompleted
