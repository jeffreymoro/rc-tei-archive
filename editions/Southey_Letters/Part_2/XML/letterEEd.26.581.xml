                    will it be out &#8211; , &amp; I am somewhat vexed that the Letter
                    was lost in which you acknowledged the receipt of the last
                    splice &#8211; as you probably said whether to your taste it was
                    spliced well or not.</p>

                        equally between a stack of hay and a pail of water,
                        between which it was unable to choose, being both hungry
