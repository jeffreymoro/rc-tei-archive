                    that the situation of private secretary is not enough
                    advantagious or permanent. they are therefore using their
                    influence to have me nominated Secretary of Legation at some
                    Italian state. an office of more ostensible importance &amp;
                    to which no personal dependance is attached. that at Palermo

                        seems to have failed him. Andreas Schottus (1552-1629)
                        was a Belgian Jesuit scholar; but though he wrote on
                        Spanish history, most importantly the <title>Hispania

                        in 1579 by Andreas Weschel. Southey later obtained a
                        copy (no. 1420 in the sale catalogue of his
