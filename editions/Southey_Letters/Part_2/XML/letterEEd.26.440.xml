                        and writer. Suspicions about his &#8216;loose morals&#8217; were correct. In 1797 he
                        fathered an illegitimate son. Though he had no great opinion of his own
                        paintings, Jackson had exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1771. His
                            <title>Four Ages</title> (1798) was a collection of miscellaneous
                        essays.</note> has taste to a certain extent. he seems to be an old man of

                    Jackson was ever friendly to him he had for some time avoided his society on
                    that account. his music I take for granted. his pictures are always well
                    conceived, the creations of a man of genius &#8211; but he cannot execute &#8211; his trees

                    thank him for his &#8220;Four Ages&#8221;, a man with a name may publish such a book &#8211; but
                    when a book is merely a lounging collection of scraps &#8211; the common place book

                    with a pocket full of music, or poems, to know how he liked them. his <hi rend="ital">friends</hi> plague on the word &#8211; his relations I mean, thought
                    this was a sad life for a man of family, so they drove him to London. poor
                    fellow said Jackson &#8211; there did not live a purer creature &#8211; &amp; if they would
                    have let him alone he might &lt;have&gt; been alive now. in London his feelings

                    London, or of the hereditary insanity I know not. but this was the commencement
                    of his madness. on being refused admittance at Sir Joshuas, he broke the windows
                    &#8211; &amp; was taken to Newgate! Some weeks after Jackson unknowing of what had
                    passed went to London, &amp; enquired for Bampfylde. Lady B. his mother<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Jane Bampfylde (1720&#8211;1789), wife of

                    away went Jackson &amp; knockd at every door till he found the right. it was a
                    miserable place. the woman of the house was one of the worst class of women in
                    London. she knew B. had no money &amp; that he had been then three days without
                    food. Jackson found him with the levity of derangement. his shirt collar &#8211; black
                    &amp; ragged &#8211; his beard a two months growth. he said he was come to breakfast &#8211;
                    &amp; turnd to a harpsichord in the room literally he said to let B. gorge
                    himself without being noticed. he took him away &#8211; gave his mother a severe
                    lecture &amp; left him in decent lodgings &amp; with a decent allowance,
                    earnestly begging him to write. he never wrote. the next news was his

                    returned, but he was dying in a consumption. he was urged by his Apothecary to
                    leave the house in Sloane Street, where he was well treated &#8211; &amp; go into
