        <p rend="indent1"> It is many a week since I have written to or heard from you,
                    &amp; probably you as well as myself have been silent more from industry than
                    idleness. &amp; silent I should have continued till my commissions from Lisbon
                    arrive &amp; enable me to say when I shall appear in town, if I had not a
                    question to propound to my Oracle.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> How is it that debasing the coin produces such ruinous effects,
                    in countries that not carrying on any extensive commerce, have but very little
                    dealing with foreign states? &amp; at a period when there were no Birmingham
                        traders<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A common term for
                        forgers.</note> to set up a mint of their own? the people always have
                    complained that such a measure has increased the price of every thing &#8211; was this
                    effect produced merely by increasing the current value, &amp; so lessening the
                    value of money by increasing the quantity? if so &#8211; paper money acts in the same
                    manner &#8211; &amp; I want you to explain why a piece of copper may not <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> pass for five shillings &#8211; or five guineas
                    as well as a piece of silver paper. It is very clear that base money will not do
                    for foreign traffic &#8211; but the iron money of Sparta served at home as well as
                    gold. the Castilian trade in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century was too
                    trifling to account for the general complaint. &#8211; When you have half an hours
                    leisure do make this matter plain to me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> That rascally Scotch Review of John Woodville<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        (1802).</note> provoked me bitterly by its dishonesty, in exaggerating every
                    fault &amp; overlooking every beauty. the last lines of that play are some of
                    the finest that ever I remember &amp; the whole is full of beauty. the story
                    indeed is very defective, &amp; that from a love of imitation. <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref> loves the Old Plays &amp; thinks

                    winter &#8211; perhaps the Autumn of next year all my materials here will be gone
                    thro, &amp; then I should go over, &amp; fix no period for my return. Now as
                    things are, perhaps it would be my wisest way to go over at once &amp; collect
                    what I can while I can. but then I shall be wishing myself at home. &amp; to
                    look one way &amp; now another is not the way for any one, except a waterman, to
                    get on. Since you heard from me I have had a sad diabetes, a complaint to which
                    I have been often subject &#8211; in consequence probably of general weakness, &amp;
                    both last Autumn &amp; last Spring I felt the climate like a confirmed
                    valetudinarian. now I do not value my self so little as to think myself as well
                    underground as above it, for certainly I am good for something else beside
                    church yard manure. &amp; moreover I like life, for I enjoy it, &amp; have as
                        <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> much reason to like it &amp; as much
                    actual happiness as falls to the lot of most men. And I do verily believe that
                    were I settled in such a climate as that of Lisbon it would renew my lifehold
                    lease, &amp; give me a better tenure, &amp; a chance of a much longer life than
                    I can possibly have here &#8211; where I am going on somewhat like a myrtle at a
                    parlour window in London. If there should be an army sent to Portugal, as there
                    was last war, I think I would try to get some <hi rend="ital">civil</hi>
                    appointment &#8211; there are plenty of such appointments with good pay &amp; good
                    rations into the bargain, &amp; perhaps <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref> interest might help me
                    to one &#8211; I could do the business &amp; yet have leisure.</p>
