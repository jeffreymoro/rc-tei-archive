                        1831), a banker based in Bristol.</note> is willing to take <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> into his bank, if you &amp;
                    I will become his bondsmen, bound for 500 &#163; each. the situation is thought a
                    favourable one. it is for seven years &#8211; at a salary of 12 &#163; the first &#8211; 15 the
                    second, &amp; increasing 5&#163; every succeeding year &#8211; at the expiration of that
                    time he is calculated for any situation which requires accomptant knowledge. to
                    be bound for the good conduct of any body is always hazardous &amp; never wise,
                    but it is sometimes right &#8211; &amp; so I conceive it to be in the present case.
                    write me your opinion &#8211; &amp; that as soon as you can that Savary may be
                    answered. the obvious advantage of the situation is that he will be receiving
                    something towards his maintenance during this apprenticeship; its objection that
                    it leads, in all likelihood, only to a bare support. but it must be remembered
                    that <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> is very slow, &amp;
                    therefore unlikely to forward himself in any way of life &#8211; &amp; this neither
