                    not to be overlooked; society, too, is something; and Italy has never been
                    without some great mind or other, worthy of its better ages. When we are well
                    tired of Italy, why, I will get removed to Portugal, to which I look with
                    longing eyes as the land of promise. But, in all sober seriousness, the plan I
                    propose is very practicable, very pleasant, and eke also very <hi rend="ital">prudent</hi>. My business will not be an hour in a week, and it will enable
                    me to afford to be idle &#8211; a power which I shall never wish to exert, but which I
                    do long to possess. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

                    released is a varnishing phrase; and death is desirable, when recovery is
