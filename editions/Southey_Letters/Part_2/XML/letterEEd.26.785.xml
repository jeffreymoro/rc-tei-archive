        <p rend="indent1"> My letter would be a valuable one if the
                    ability of suggesting any fit subject for your talents were
                    equal to the good will with which it is attempted.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Novels are generally interesting in
                    proportion as they excite our attention by what is new. I
                    think the manners &amp; customs of other countries &amp;
                    other times afford mines of such novelty as yet unransacked.
                    the materials are easily acquired from our numerous books of
                    travels. It will be far more difficult to keep up the
                    metaphysical costume. if I did not believe you were capable
                    of overcoming this difficulty I should &lt;not&gt; offer the
                    suggestion. some materials for thinking may be afforded by
                    thus contrasting the opinions &amp; institutions of
                    different countries, &amp; enforcing what is true
                    everywhere.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The French Atala<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand
                        (1768-1848), <title>Atala</title> (1801).</note> owed
                    all its celebrity to its scenery &amp; manners &#8211; it had the
                    effect of the serious pantomimes at our theatres &#8211; Oscar

                        translations of this &#8216;grand serious pantomimic ballet&#8217;
                        appeared in 1789 and 1790.</note> &amp; all its scenery,
                    &amp; tenfold as much painted with ten-thousand fold more

                        (1787).</note> have this advantage in a high degree. I
                    do not know a single English novel that possesses it. Many
                    plans have at various times occurred to me &#8211; but the seed
                    never remained long enough to germinate. I remember one
                    which would almost be the antithesis to Atala &#8211; a Portugueze
                    on her way from India to the mother country to become a nun,
                    wrecked on the coast of Africa &amp; falling into the power
                    of the Caffers &#8211; the best savages of whom we have yet heard
                    &#8211; to convert her &amp; her father Confessor till he marries
                    her to a negro might form the groundwork of a story.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    dwell upon the darker side of the picture, the scene &lt;of
                    a gloomier action&gt; may be laid among the fiercer American
                    tribes &#8211; or in Hindostan. Mango Capac, the Civilizer of Peru
                    has always appeared to me an excellent hero for a
                    philosophical romance, but I have felt the full difficulty
                    of forming any solution, short of miracle, for his appearing
                    where he did &amp; improving savages by so wonderful a
                    conquest of intellect over ignorance.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> Whenever I have thought of writing a novel
                    among my own ways &amp; means, to develope some single
                    character has been the main object of the plan. Such for
                    instance as a man who accustoms himself to look at every
                    thing in a ridiculous point of view, till by laughing at
                    every thing, he laughs away every good principle. A great
                    mind ruined by a little failing would well deserve to be
                    delineated &#8211; by indecision &#8211; or procrastination, or by that
                    excess of good humour which submits to weaker intellects
                    rather than inflict pain. I have dwelt with more pleasure
                    upon the ideal character of a man renouncing fair prospects
                    for principle, throwing himself upon the world with the
                    belief that while he can obtain food, raiment or shelter it
                    is beneath him to be unhappy, &amp; being happy in
                    consequence of that belief.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">A description of Southey&#8217;s planned novel
