        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have been I suppose some time in
                    expectation of hearing from me. the indisposition of <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">my companion</ref>
                    delayed the commencement of our journey for some days, &amp;
                    when we were on the way I found my time of rest fully
                    occupied in necessary business &amp; the due letters home.
                        <ref target="people.html#MaberGeorge">Maber</ref> tells
                    me to take <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pauls any time
                    before he is twelve years old. this is well. the difficulty
                    now is to get <del rend="strikethrough">from</del> him from
                        <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his aunt</ref>.
                    on this subject I have repeatedly written to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>,
                    but I never can get any reply. You remember my writing to
                    him in February after I had seen you &amp; Burn.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Burn (dates unknown)
                        was attached to the British Factory, Lisbon.</note> the
                    account I sent him of his sister was such that I thought if
                    he did not himself come over to make some settling of her
                    affairs <del rend="strikethrough">himself</del>, he would
                    certainly appoint <ref target="people.html#ThomasDr">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas</ref> to do it. this letter
                    he has never noticed, tho I know by his alluding to one part
                    of it that it reached him. I scarcely know how to act. it is
                    very unpleasant to be always addressing him upon this
                    subject &amp; receive no reply, yet something must be done,
                    &amp; however disagreable the business may be, it certainly
                    will not become less so by being deferred. it is always
                    better to meet evils than to wait for them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> how it is that <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</ref> is
                    so perpetually embarrassed I am utterly at a loss to
                    conceive. I know the perpetual facility of obtaining money
                    in small sums from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> for many many years, may have been one
                    great cause for thoughtless expenditure. there is a great
                    degree of weakness in <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</ref>
                    character. she has never lost the fear she felt when a child
                    for an elder sister who has <del rend="strikethrough">perpet</del> always asserted her superiority. &amp;
                    this fear is carried to so criminal a length that <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> has
                    often drawn from her the money which should have gone to
                    discharge her debts, &amp; made her borrow <del rend="strikethrough">money</del> &lt;sums&gt; which she
                    saw no prospect of repaying. now I trust there is a stop put
                    to this. &amp; now as <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> can no
                    longer be supplied by <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">her sister</ref>,
                    she must be compelled to that line of conduct which if she
                    had adopted twenty years ago would have spared her family
                    the greater part of their after difficulties.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</ref>
                    however expected <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> would still supply her with money from
                    me; this did surprize <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> who
                    knew how utterly impossible this was. even if it were in my
                    power it would be wrong to assist her in keeping up a false
                    appearance of high life. but <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref>
                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">cousin</ref>
                    are with me, this doubles my house keeping expences, &amp; I
                    have been obliged to pay thirteen pounds, the amount of one
                    of my Oxford bills &#8211; all of which I thought <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> had
                    discharged, but which I now daily expect to come in upon me.
                    one bill of five pounds I have paid which remained of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</ref>
                    debts. all this has exhausted the resources up to this time
                    upon which I calculated to furnish a house in town. still
                    however I shall do well. I have already seen too much the
                    consequences of debt &#8211; &amp; I will keep myself
                    unembarrassed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</ref> therefore can draw nothing from this
                    quarter, her circumstances require some immediate
                    investigation, &amp; as I can get no letter from <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>,
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my

                        Thomas</ref>. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> is with her three or four days in a
                    week. &amp; says that her habitual violence of temper is now
                    increased by long indulgence absolutely to a state of
                    derangement. her grandmother resembled her in this
                    particular &amp; died in confinement. this idea makes <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref>
                    wretched. what should be done is this. she should by the
                    sale of her furniture pay her debts as far as it will go,
                    &amp; live in lodgings upon the income <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>
                    allows her. an income amply sufficient. I know not its exact
                    amount, but have reason to believe it is the whole of his
                    Herefordshire preferment, which cannot fall far short of 200
                    a year.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have written all this to you, because you
                    &amp; Burn know so much of our family affairs &#8211; &amp;
                    because it is not pleasant to have <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> no one to communicate with upon such subjects.
