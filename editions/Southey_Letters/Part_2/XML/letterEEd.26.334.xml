        <p rend="indent1"> If you hold your intention of visiting Ireland (a country which
                    is about to experience the blessings of a regular government somewhat in the way
                    Holland did under Philip 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> &#8722;)<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The attempted revolution by the United Irishmen which began
                        on 23 May 1798 had largely been crushed by this time. Radicals in Britain
                        remained intensely critical of the government&#8217;s use of executions,
                        deportations and torture to punish the rebels and suppress dissent, and
                        Southey is comparing the situation in Ireland with that of the Protestant
                        Netherlands under the absolute rule of the Spanish Catholic Philip II
                        (1527&#8211;1598; reigned 1556&#8211;1598). After a period of discontent and repression,
                        in 1566&#8211;1572 the Netherlands successfully revolted against Spanish
                        rule.</note> can you not make your way thro Bristol? we have a spare bed
                    room &#8722; &amp; the most beautiful spots in this country are within a very easy
                    walk.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not like your plea for the torture in Ireland.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The British army had been engaged in a sustained
                        campaign in Ireland since late 1796 to destroy arms held by those they
                        identified as potential rebels. The declaration of martial law in March 1798
                        confirmed the army could use whatever methods it chose and these included
                        torture. The best-known local method was &#8216;pitchcapping&#8217; &#8211; forcing a helmet
                        of boiling tar onto the head of the victim.</note> it is not a general one &#8722;
                    &amp; tho it may hold good possibly in some cases, it appears to me liable to
                    the unanswerable objections against <del rend="strikethrough">breaking</del>
                    infringing a general principle for a particular good. It has been carried too to
                    its worst lengths in Ireland: not merely to compel a discovery of arms, but to
                    compel them to discover the hiding places of accused persons. Hervey<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey (1762&#8211;1798;
                            <title>DNB</title>), Protestant lawyer and one of the leaders of the
                        Irish rising in Wexford. He was arrested on 26 May 1798 on the basis of
                        information disclosed under torture by Anthony Perry (c. 1760&#8211;1798), a
                        leader of the United Irishmen in Wexford.</note> was found out in this
                    manner. bad as the Irish are &#8722; &amp; God knows I have a most evil opinion of the
                    half-christened herd &#8722; I cannot but think the ruling party in Ireland worse.
                    under whatever term it may be vieled, the torture has been to all intents
                    introduced in that country. &#8722; there was a time when an Englishman if he saw the
                    rack carried into his neighbours house, would have objected to it on the idea
                    that it might soon come to his own: &#8722; but the excesses of the French have
                    frightened us now &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">there is</del> I wish there
                    was no more danger of an utter despotism than there is of anarchy. Burleigh<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">William Cecil, Lord Burleigh (1521&#8211;1598,
                            <title>DNB</title>). This saying has also been attributed to another
                        Elizabethan statesman, Francis Bacon (1561&#8211;1626, <title>DNB</title>).</note>
                    was wise when he said that England never could be undone but by a
                    parliament.</p>
