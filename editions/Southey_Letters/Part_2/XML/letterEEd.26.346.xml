<salute>My dear friend</salute>
</opener>
<p rend="indent1"> I have been long silent. we are with <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref>,
                    &amp; in rambling about this country much time has been
                    employed.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You ask me my opinion how a Lawyer should
                    act. they tell me he should undertake any cause, because if
                    he refuses to be the advocate he makes himself the judge. my
                    dear friend this may be true – but I never go to my head for
                    an answer when my heart is ready with one. certainly I would
                    not plead in a bad cause. I <hi rend="ital">feel</hi> it
                    would be wrong. I have no love for the profession – but I
                    have a strong &amp; honourable love of independance, &amp;
                    would labour for it. Sometimes I think I have mistaken the
                    road. of all modes of life that of a clergyman would best
                    suit my habits &amp; feelings. I should have been happy
                    &amp; useful in the church had my creed permitted it. were I
                    again at liberty to chuse my way of life I should not
                    hesitate at becoming a dissenting minister. Ambition I have
                    none; &amp; a little satisfies me. I want nothing but
                    independance &amp; leisure for my favourite studies. these
                    the law will I hope afford me, &amp; that not at too late a
                    period. I should have been more useful as a minister &amp;
                    better satisfied. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> Who do you think is in London of all men –
                    but Leopold Berchtold<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Leopold, Graf von Berchtold (1759–1809), Austrian
                        philanthropist.</note> – ! <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> has seen him, he expressed his
                    satisfaction at what I had said of him, &amp; gave <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> his book upon the plague for me.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Leopold, Graf von

                    remain some months longer in London, &amp; very much do I
                    regret my absence. I wish you knew him – &amp; that he knew
                    the garden scheme, &amp; your plan for the beggars,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘garden scheme’
                        was a convalescent home to assist the poor after their
                        discharge from hospital; see Robert Southey to Charles
                        Watkin Williams Wynn, [25 March] 1798, Letter 298; for
                        the scheme to assist the indigent see Robert Southey to

                    perhaps <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> set them on
                    foot in other countries. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have procured access to the Cathedral
                    Library here.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s uncle, Herbert Hill, was Chancellor of
                        Hereford Cathedral and responsible for the
                        Library.</note> it does not contain many books, but I
                    find enough to employ me busily &amp; agreably for six hours
                    every morning – that is from Friday last till Wednesday next
                    when we depart from hence. in the course of ten or twelve
                    days we shall reach home, &amp; I shall be glad to return to
                    regularity. I love to write at my own desk – to see my books
                    by me, &amp; to look every evening from the same window at
                    the setting sun. On my return I shall begin your book.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; possibly
                        a manuscript book of poems and/or other writings Southey
                        was compiling for John May.</note> as I am about to
                    publish enough with the Vision of the Maid to make a
                        volume,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Poems</title> (1799).</note> of course none
                    of those pieces will be included. but I have many besides –
                    wholes in themselves, the parts only of a greater plan which
                    will be long in hand. it is called the Kalendar, &amp; the
                    name will almost explain its nature, which resembles that of
                    Ovids Fasti tho greatly improved.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘Kalendar’, a sequence modelled on
                        Ovid’s (43 BC–AD 17) <title>Fasti</title>, was never
                        completed.</note> I shall take the natural history of
                    the year as I proceed, &amp; instead of confining myself to
                    the church holydays, select from history &amp; the annals
                    &amp; festivals of all countrys whatever appears fit for
                    poetry. already I have some 1500 lines written. my metres
                    vary with my subjects. the work will fill at least two
                    volumes the small size, for the notes must be extensive.
                    &amp; I think it will be popular &amp; useful. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> I shall have much of Madoc to show you in
                    November – as on my return I shall certainly resume my early
                    rising, &amp; early employment. the plan is now compleat,
                    &amp; is I think very fine.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">By this time Southey had written at least
                        four books of <title>Madoc</title>
