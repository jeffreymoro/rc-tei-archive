        <p rend="indent1"> Here then we are, thank God. we sailed on
                    Thursday evening the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> at five. our
                    weather all the way was delightful &#8211; light winds &amp;
                    favourable &#8211; but we bent before the wind. which was rough
                    work in the way &#8211; &amp; as my bowels were obliged to shift
                    every moment with the centre of gravity. it did not at all
                    agree with them. We were both miserably sick &#8211; I indeed far
                    worse than in my former voyages, &amp; that all the way
                    almost. On Sunday we saw a homeward bound convoy &amp; were
                    chased seventy miles by a Frigate with them &#8211; luckily it was
                    in our course. Monday brought with it an adventure. at six I
                    heard the Captain<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Bayntun Yescombe (1765&#8211;1803), Captain of the
                        Falmouth Packet, <hi rend="ital">King
                        George.</hi>
          </note> awakened with news that a
                        Cutter<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Fortunately, the &#8216;cutter&#8217; turned out to be the British
                        frigate HMS <hi rend="ital">Endymion</hi>.</note> was
                    bearing down upon us. she did not answer to our signals. we
                    fired a gun &#8211; she returned it, still hoisting English
                    colours. little doubt was entertained of her being French
                    &amp; we more ready for action. I surrounded <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> with
                    mattresses in the cabin by the Captains advice &#8211; she however
                    would go down into the Cockpit. there I escaped from her
                    &amp; took my station with a musquet on the quarter-deck. We
                    were all ready. Another Packet was in company with us
                    carrying six guns<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                            <hi rend="ital">Prince Ernest</hi>.</note> &#8211; our
                    force was ten, &amp; our efficient Passengers from the
                    Cutter came down between us &#8211; Zounds I saw the smoke from
                    her ready matches, we hailed her &#8211; she answered in broken
                    English &#8211; unintelligibly &#8211; &amp; we expected the broadside.
                    her force was fourteen guns. Even when she past us we only
                    supposed it a manoeuvre to get round the other packet, &amp;
                    every moment looked to see French colours hoisted. she was
                    however a Guernsey cutter. So I lost all chance of ever
                    being gazetted. I laid my musquet in the chest right
                    willingly &amp; was particularly pleased with having legs
                    arms &amp; a head all the rest of the day. Soon after the
                    Endymion boarded us. it was a busy morning, &amp; the bustle
                    kept me well for half the day. Tuesday night we made the
                    Berlings. At sun rise Wednesday I rose &amp; saw the Sun
                    resting upon the rock. we ran close along shore &#8211; took a
                    pilot out of one of those queer boats, whose sail tosses
                    like a womans petticoats in a high wind &#8211; &amp; at ten
                    anchored in the Tagus after an uncommonly short &amp; fine
                    passage. <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My
                        Uncle</ref> was on the water &amp; on board immediately.
                    the Commissary came with him &amp; by his assistance we

                    attributes the exemption from infectious diseases which
                    Lisbon appears to possess, to the number of lime kilns in
                    its vicinity. Lime assuredly is very useful in this way, but
                    the cause is utterly inadequate &#8211; it might indeed do were
                    every &lt;other&gt; house a kiln. the more obvious cause is
                    to be found in the strong winds that regularly blow every
                    evening during the hot weather, sweeping down all the
