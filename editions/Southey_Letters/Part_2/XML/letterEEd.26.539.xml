        <p rend="indent1"> I have in my life received so many letters to
                    disturb &amp; distress me that I never open one without some
                    kind of fear. poor <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Peggy</ref>! &#8211; her disease I thought incurable &#8211; but
                    still it was intermitting &amp; its long intervals might be
                    intervals of enjoyment. she would always be dependent &#8211; but
                    I am looking on to better days, &amp; trusted that at some,
                    no very remote time, I should be able to settle her as I
                    wished. this intelligence will haunt &amp; hurt me.
                    recovered as I am still my mind is in a state of childish
                    weakness. <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        Uncle</ref> was ill lately with a sick headache &#8211; I was
                    not aware that he is subject to them &amp; lay awake the
                    whole night listening to hear him breathe &#8211; the consequence
                    was that the startings &amp; head seizures returned. it was
                    not merely climate that I wished to seek as medicinal, it
                    was the plunging into &lt;new&gt; scenes &#8211; the total
                    abandonment of all irksome thoughts &amp; employments &#8211; it
                    has succeeded. my spirits have been as my letters exhibited
                    them. the loss of a <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref> here damped me for some days, &amp;
                    they will not now soon recover their tone. the death of
                    Patty Cottle<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">One of
                        Joseph Cottle&#8217;s relatives, possibly his sister Martha,
                        who died in 1800, aged 15.</note> I expected as certain.

                    these have happened &#8211; &amp; I have only been three months in
                    Portugal. thank God you give us no bad accounts of your
                    Mother. I have many friends in England, but none whom I hope
                    more earnestly to see again &#8211; But to change the subject. &#8211;
                    as the Post brought me no letters from Bristol we were
                    vexed, angry with all our friends &#8211; but wondering that <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> had
                    not written &#8211; &amp; indeed I had sent to Lisbon to have
                    particular enquiry made at the office thinking there
                    certainly must be a letter from you. the packet reached me
                    this morning. I pray you remember that &amp; take pattern. I
                    am among <hi rend="ital">acquaintance</hi>, &amp; cannot
                    hear too frequently from my friends. We had a delightful
                    companion for a short time here &#8211; a <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref> &#8211;
                    brimfull full of every thing that was good. she is returned
                    to England &#8211; but we do not lose her acquaintance. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> has never written to me; where no

                    is hot enough to give me a true Portugueze &amp;
                    irresistible indolence. for the last ten days we have been
                    most unusually hot &#8211; the cursed Sirocs of the East reach us

                    naked, in a wet room, dozing upon the bed, my right hand not
                    daring to touch my left. at night we look with as much hope
                    for a fog as you in England watch for a fine day. when the

                    freshened into comfort! a few nights since the fog came on

                    wanted my custom, &amp; answered no &#8211; after seeing the
                    garden &amp; admiring the taste which had decorated it with
                    statues &#8211; a soldier painted like life &#8211; a bear eating a dog,
                    a goat reading in a large folio, &amp; a woman whose marble
                    petticoats were blown up to shew no very well shaped leg, we
                    were led to a hut in the garden, round which all the
                    children in the neighbourhood &amp; the whole household had
                    assembled in expectation. The door was opened &amp; there
                    was the Shoemaker. it was a figure large as life, an old man
                    sewing at his trade &#8211; a hideous old woman by him spinning, a
                    boy hammering the sole, &amp; another behind beating a
                    tamborine, all moved by turning a wheel behind. &amp; this
                    is the admiration of the country &amp; the masterpiece of
                    Portugueze mechanism! the Marquis has bought anot[MS torn]se
                    in the neighbourhood, &amp; there he is about to remove this

                    &amp; this was probably the cause that he escaped so well. a
                    Portuegueze Officer passing by just after enquired what was

                    lately of great value, &amp; it was at first believed by
                    Portugueze. the remark was by a company of these people when
                    they heard the circumstance was that &#8220;the times were very
                        <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> hard.&#8221; you can have
                    no idea of a more total anarchy than exists here as to all
                    rational purposes of government. there is actually no
                    security whatever for person or property. if a rascal is
                    taken up for robbery or murder after a few days imprisonment
                    he is let out again without trial or punishment. A priest in
                    one of the new streets was stopped by the watch lately, who
                    robbed him of his purse, his watch &amp; his buckles. he
                    returned home which was very near put on his servants
                    clothes, took a pistol &amp; a knife under his cloak,
                    returned to the same street &amp; met the same watchmen.
                    they stopt him, questioned him, searched him, found the
                    knife &amp; pistol, &amp; carried him before a magistrate.
                    then he told his story, recovered all he had lost, &amp; had
                    the satisfaction of seeing the rascals sent to prison.</p>
