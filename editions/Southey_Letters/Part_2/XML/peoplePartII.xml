							Southey, who was flirting with a career in medicine, at the Anatomy School in Oxford in early 1794. They became firm
							friends, Southey later describing how in 1794 Allen had been his &#8216;bosom-companion&#8217; and had &#8216;rendered many hours delightful
							which would otherwise have passed in the destructive daydreams of solitude&#8217;. Allen wrote poetry and, in Oxford in June
							1794, introduced Southey to Coleridge. In 1794&#8211;1795, Allen was possibly a convert to Pantisocracy. In 1796, he enrolled at
							the Westminster Hospital and married a wealthy widow, Catherine, daughter of Nathaniel Forster (1726&#8211;1790;
								<title>DNB</title>). She died within a year. In 1797, with the encouragement of Anthony Carlisle, he became deputy
							surgeon with England&#8217;s Second Royals, then stationed in Portugal. He was back in Britain by 1802 and from 1803 until his

							Keswick. Godmother of Southey&#8217;s first child, Margaret (d. 1803). Southey had a high opinion of Mary Barker&#8217;s talents and
							proposed that she should illustrate <title>Madoc</title> (1805). She appears as the &#8216;Bhow Begum&#8217; in <title>The
								Doctor</title> (1834-1837). Mary Barker lived at Greta Lodge in Keswick, next to Greta Hall, between 1812 and 1817,
							becoming a close friend of the Coleridges and Wordsworths, as well as the Southeys, and teaching music to the girls of the
							families. Financial difficulties forced her to move to Boulogne in 1819 and she never returned to England. Southey met her
							for the last time on his trip to France in 1825. In 1830 she married a Mr Slade, who was much younger than her and thought
							to be a &#8216;mere adventurer&#8217; by her Keswick friends.</gloss>

            <gloss target="#BeddoesThomas"> chemist and physician. Born at Shifnal, Shropshire, son of Richard Beddoes and Ann Whitehall.
							Educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School, by private tutor, and at Pembroke College, Oxford (matric. 1776, BA 1779, MB and MD
							1786), and Edinburgh. Reader in Chemistry at Oxford from 1788. In the early 1790s, a growing reputation as a radical led
							to his surveillance by Home Office spies and failure to gain the Regius Chair in Chemistry. He left Oxford for Bristol in
							1793 and married Anna Edgeworth (1772-1824), sister of the novelist Maria (1768-1849; <title>DNB</title>), in the
							following year. Beddoes was involved in the political protest movements of the mid-1790s and possibly first met Southey in
							1795, during the latter&#8217;s immersion in Bristol politics. In 1799, Beddoes opened the Pneumatic Institute (from 1802 the
							Preventive Medical Institution for the Sick and Drooping Poor) in Hotwells, Bristol. Southey participated in the
							experiments with gases carried out by Beddoes and Humphry Davy, and recorded in <title>Notice of Some Observations Made at
								the Medical Pneumatic Institution</title> (1799). Beddoes was a prolific writer on medical, political and educational
							reform. He was also a poet: author of <title>Alexander&#8217;s Expedition</title> (1792) and a contributor to Southey&#8217;s
								<title>Annual Anthology</title> (1799). Southey respected Beddoes&#8217;s medical judgment, consulting him on more than one
							occasion. In 1809 he recorded that &#8216;From Beddoes I hoped for more good to the human race than from any other individual&#8217;.
							However, disagreements about poetry ensured that their personal relationship was not warm. Southey dismissed Beddoes as a
							&#8216;hypercritic of the Darwin school&#8217; and was furious when his &#8216;Domiciliary Verses&#8217; (a parody of Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
							William Wordsworth and Southey) found its way into the first volume of the <title>Annual Anthology</title>. Joseph Cottle,
							who was responsible for the poem&#8217;s inclusion, was ordered by Southey not to solicit any further contributions from
							Beddoes.</gloss>

							pastor to a Unitarian congregation in Great Yarmouth, medical student at the University of Edinburgh, assistant to John
							Rickman, domestic tutor to the sons of Lord Stanhope, assistant surgeon to a militia regiment and (in Poland) tutor to the

							Fricker, who turned him down. In 1795, he shared lodgings with Southey and Coleridge in Bristol. From 1797&#8211;1798, he was
							minister to a Unitarian congregation in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he also tutored Henry Herbert Southey. Burnett
							moved in metropolitan literary circles and was friendly with Charles Lamb and John Rickman. His relationship with Southey
							and Samuel Taylor Coleridge became deeply ambivalent &#8211; by 1803 he was accusing both of treating him badly. Burnett was an
							opium addict and his last years were probably spent in poverty. He died in the Marylebone Infirmary.</gloss>

							opened a shop as a printseller, stationer, binder and bookseller in Bristol. Cottle abandoned bookselling in 1798 but
							continued publishing. Between 1791 and 1800 he sold, printed or published 114 works, in congeries with Joseph Johnson,
							Benjamin Flower, H. D. Symons and others. In 1800 he began to sell his copyrights to the London firm of Longman. A poet
							and prose writer, his works included: <title>Poems</title> (1795), <title>Malvern Hills</title> (1798; with a prefatory
							poem by Southey), <title>Alfred</title> (1800), <title>The Fall of Cambria</title> (1808), <title>Early Recollections,
								Chiefly Relating to the Late Samuel Taylor Coleridge, During his Long Residence in Bristol</title> (1837) and
								<title>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</title> (1847). Cottle and Southey were introduced
							by Robert Lovell in 1794. Although not wealthy, Cottle provided generous financial help to Southey throughout the 1790s,
							even lending him money for his wedding ring. He published <title>Joan of Arc</title> and the majority of Southey&#8217;s
							earliest works, including <title>Poems</title> (1797) and <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and

							contempt. The two men met less frequently after Southey&#8217;s move to Keswick in 1803, but maintained their correspondence.
							Southey&#8217;s final tour of the West Country in 1836-1837 included a visit to Cottle in Bristol. After Southey&#8217;s death, Cottle

							Croft changed direction and graduated from University College, Oxford in 1785 and was appointed Vicar of Prittlewell in
							Essex and chaplain of the British garrison in Quebec. Most of his time in the late 1780s and early 1790s was devoted to a
							new dictionary, but, despite amassing 11,000 entries, he could not find enough subscribers to publish the book and the
							project was abandoned in 1793. In 1795 Croft was arrested for debt and fled to Hamburg, only returning to England in
							1800-1802, after which he lived in France, dying in Paris. In 1780 Croft had published <title>Love and Madness</title>,

							from childhood. In 1797, their friendship flourished when Southey and his wife lodged in a house in Kingsdown, next door

							In 1796 he published <title>The Hurricane: a Theosophical and Western Eclogue</title>. He disappeared in 1798. It was

							terms with his older half-brother. Hill was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1772, MA 1774). From 1792&#8211;1807, he was
							chaplain to the British factory at Lisbon. On his return to England, Hill took up a living he owned at Staunton-Upon-Wye,
							remaining there until 1810 when the Duke of Bedford presented him to a living in Streatham. In 1808 Hill married a woman
							twenty-five years his junior, Catherine Bigg (b. c. 1775), a friend of Jane Austen (1775&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>). The
							marriage produced six surviving children, all of whom were on good terms with Southey and his family. Hill&#8217;s son and
							namesake, Herbert Hill Junior (1810&#8211;1892), married Southey&#8217;s daughter Bertha in 1839. Hill took a paternal interest in his
							nephews, and helped finance Southey&#8217;s education. Hill&#8217;s concern about Southey&#8217;s refusal to take the path mapped out for
							him (a path leading to ordination), his relationship with Edith Fricker, and his politics, led him to visit England in
							1795. He returned to Portugal with Southey in tow. Oblivious to the fact that his nephew had married Edith the day before
							their departure, Hill used every opportunity to introduce Southey to more suitable women. Nevertheless, the time Southey
							spent with his uncle in 1795&#8211;1796 greatly strengthened their relationship, which remained close until Hill&#8217;s death in

							&#163;2000&#8211;2500 per year. He sat as an M.P. for Rye from 1802&#8211;1806, though he seems never to have spoken in the House of

							unwelcome and in 1798 his tale-telling led to a major quarrel between Southey and Coleridge which was not healed until
							1799. After Southey moved to Keswick in 1803, Lloyd was on the fringes of his circle. In his edition of Cowper

							tried to persuade his family to provide for his widow and child. He was only partially successful. The Lovells gave Robert
							Lovell Junior the occasional gift (for example, &#163;20 in 1802) and made some contribution to the boy&#8217;s early education, but

            <gloss target="#LovellRobert"> poet. Born in Bristol, the son of a wealthy Quaker manufacturer (initially of cabinets and
							later of pins), and his first wife Edith Bourne, a Quaker minister. Lovell possibly entered the manufacturing business (on
							his death he was described as a pin manufacturer) but was ill at ease in the commercial world. In 1794 he married Mary
							Fricker. His family disapproved of the match because she was not a Quaker and had worked as an actress. Their son, also
							named Robert, was born in 1795. Lovell died at Bristol on 3 May 1796 of a fever contracted on a trip to Salisbury and
							exacerbated by refusing to take medical advice before returning home. One of his final letters to his wife is in the
							Huntington Library, San Marino, another in Bristol Reference Library. Lovell&#8217;s father was reluctant to provide regular
							financial support for Mary Lovell and her child and both became part of Southey&#8217;s extended household. Lovell and Southey
							were introduced by Sarah Fricker in Bristol in late 1793. Lovell was also a poet, his <title>Bristol: A Satire</title>
							appeared in 1794, and he and Southey embarked on a period of collaboration: planning two co-authored collections, only one
							of which was published under the pseudonyms &#8216;Bion&#8217; [Southey] and &#8216;Moschus&#8217; [Lovell] in late 1794. Lovell was also involved
							in the 1794 revisions to Southey&#8217;s <title>Joan of Arc</title>. The advent of Coleridge in summer&#8211;autumn 1794 seems to have
							led (at least temporarily) to a reorientation of literary relationships. Lovell was pushed to the margins. His
							contribution to <title>The Fall of Robespierre</title> was dropped and Coleridge was openly critical of his poetry. Lovell
							was, however, involved in Pantisocracy and it was through him that Southey and Coleridge were introduced to Joseph Cottle.
							After Lovell&#8217;s death, Southey tried &#8211; and failed &#8211; to produce a subscription edition of his poems, to raise money for his
							widow and child. However, Lovell&#8217;s writings were included in the <title>Annual Anthology</title> (1799 and 1800) and
								<title>Specimens of the Later English poets</title> (1807). In a notice published in <title>Literary Memoirs of Living
								Authors of Great Britain</title> (1798), David Rivers described Lovell&#8217;s poetry as being &#8216;entitled to considerable
							distinction&#8217;. Southey described receiving the news of Lovell&#8217;s death as &#8216;the most sudden check I ever experienced&#8217;. The
							full extent of their relationship is difficult to gauge because of the survival of only two letters from what must have
							been an extensive correspondence.</gloss>
