                    expectation that they will ever be written; but if you were to write, the scheme
                    projected upon the old poets would be a better scheme, because more certain of
                    sale, and in the execution nothing invidious. Besides, your sentence would fall
                    with greater weight upon the dead: however impartial you may be, those who do
                        <hi rend="ital">not</hi> read your books will think your opinion the result
                    of your personal attachments, and that very belief will prevent numbers from
                    reading it. Again, there are some of these living poets to whom you could not

                    Does he not associate more feeling with particular phrases, and you also with
                    him, than those phrases can convey to any one else? This I suspect. Who would

                        Drawing on experiments conducted by Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), Perkins
                        theorized that redirecting the body&#8217;s natural electricity could draw out
                        pain and disease. He developed brass and iron rods of about 4 inches in
                        length, with one flat side and one round side with one blunt end and one
                        pointed end. The practitioner held the rods in his hand and rested the point
                        of the rods on the skin. Then he stroked or drew the tractors over the
                        unhealthy area of the body to attract and draw out affliction. See Benjamin
