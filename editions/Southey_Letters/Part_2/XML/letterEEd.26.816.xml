<p rend="indent1"> I meant to have written sooner; but those little units of
                    interruption and preventions, which sum up to as ugly an aggregate as the items
                    in a lawyer’s bill, have come in the way.

                               .
                               Your plan<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Coleridge’s scheme for the
                        ‘Bibliotheca Britannica’; see Coleridge to Southey [July 1803],
                        E.L. Griggs (ed.), <title>Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor
                            Coleridge</title>, 6 vols (Oxford, 1956-1971), II, pp. 955-956.</note>
                    is too good, too gigantic, quite beyond my powers. If you had my tolerable state
                    of health, and that love of steady and productive employment which is now grown
                    into a necessary habit with me, if you were to execute and would execute it, it
                    would be, beyond all doubt, the most valuable work of any age or any country;
                    but I cannot fill up such an outline. No man can better feel where he fails than
                    I do; and to rely upon you for whole quartos! Dear Coleridge, the smile that
                    comes with that thought is a very melancholy one; and if <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> saw me now, she would think my
                    eyes were weak again, when, in truth, the humour that covers them springs from
                    another cause. </p>
<p rend="indent1"> For my own comfort, and credit, and peace of mind, I must have a
                    plan which I know myself strong enough to execute. I can take author by author
                    as they come in their series, and give his life and an account of his works
                    quite as well as ever it has yet been done. I can write connecting paragraphs
                    and chapters shortly and pertinently, in my way; and in this way the labour of
                    all my associates can be more easily arranged.
                               .
                               .
                               .
                               .
                               .
                               .
                               And, after all,
                    this is really nearer the actual design of what I purport by a bibliotheca than
                    yours would be, – a book of reference, a work in which it may be seen what has
                    been written upon every subject in the British language: this has elsewhere been
                    done in the dictionary form; whatever we get better than that form – <hi rend="ital">ponemus lucro</hi>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65-8 BC), <title>Odes</title>, Book 1, no. 9,
                        line 14: ‘let’s count it as a gain’.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The Welsh part, however, should be kept completely distinct, and
                    form a volume, or half a volume, by itself; and this must be delayed till the
                    last in publication, whatever it be in order, because it cannot be done till the
                    whole of the Archaeology<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>The
                            Myvyrian Archaiology</title> (1801-1807). The first two volumes had been
                        published in 1801, but the third did not appear until 1807.</note> is
                    printed, and by that time I will learn the language, and so, perhaps, will you.

<p rend="indent1"> The first part, then, to be published is the Saxon; this <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> will execute, and to this you
                    and <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref> may probably
                    both be able to add something from your stores of northern knowledge. The Saxon
                    books all come in sequence chronologically; then the mode of arrangement should
                    be by centuries, and the writers classed as poets, historians, &amp;c, by <hi rend="ital">centuries</hi>, or by <hi rend="ital">reigns</hi>, which is
                    better.            .

                    allowed him the privilege of writing, most likely because his stark madness
                    amused them. This fellow (who turned rogue at last, wore a sword, and persecuted
                    the Quakers in America to make them swear) made a schism in the society against
