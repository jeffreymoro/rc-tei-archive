                        Inn and a King’s Counsel. He was married to one of the
                        daughters of Mrs Dolignon, in whose house at Theobalds
                        in Hertfordshire Southey had spent much time as a boy.
                        The visit that caused Southey such offence must have
                        taken place in 1797, when he was lodging in Stoke

                    from calling on me. his visit I had neither expected nor
                    wished – but the apology somewhat hurt me. I had been in
                    that very house – almost a child of the family. – the next
