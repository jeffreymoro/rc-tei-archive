        <p rend="indent1"> Weather delayed our departure from <ref target="places.html#Wynnstay">Wynnstay</ref> till the
                    afternoon of Sunday last. the richness of the library in
                    such books as were most useful to me, &amp; the goodness of
                    the claret made the delay very endurable. in the intervals
                    of sunshine we saw the surrounding scenery &#8211; the Dee flowing
                    thro high banks of wood &#8211; &amp; the pillars of a prodigious
                    bridge which is to support the canal, a work of wonderful
                    magnitude, so large indeed as almost to deserve forgiveness
                    for its intrusion. Llangollen is seven miles from <ref target="places.html#Wynnstay">Wynnstay</ref> &#8211; the
                    village itself is ugly &#8211; deformed by some smoky works, &#8211; one

                        aristocratic women who had lived together at Plas Newydd
                        in Llangollen since 1780, much to the disapproval of
                        their families.</note> there I did not think worth
                    visiting &#8211; &amp; we proceeded to Valle Crucis Abbey &#8211; thence
                    along the Dee banks to Corwen: but this ground must not be
                    hurried over. The Abbey is not a large ruin; the building
                    never was extensive, but it was in a good stile, what
                    remains is beautifully shaped, &amp; its situation in a
                    narrow valley between high hills &#8211; a brook singing along the
                    bottom, &amp; fine ashes on the hill side, &amp; by the

                    with a square hedge of thickset, squared most trimly by the
                    sheers of the garden-barber. it is far worse than any of
                    Pocklingtons wilful murders upon innocent stone. &#8211; the
                    course of the Dee now became most beautiful. like the Usk

                    &#8211; but the river itself, is lovelier than any which I
                    remember to have seen. it is broad &amp; shallow, &amp; its
                    dark waters shiver over great stones into white &amp; silver
                    &amp; hues of amber brown. no mud upon the shore &#8211; no bushes

                        you</del> stand dryfooted &amp; dip his hand into the
                    water. there are trees enough upon the hills &#8211; abundance of
                    the bending birch that tree so light hanging &amp; so
                    lovely! &#8211; there are houses enough scattered, &amp; such
                    houses as show that the richness of the land is not ill

        <p rend="indent1"> Two miles from Corwen is a waterfall &#8211;
                    Rhaiadr Cynwid. the best I have ever yet found. the body of
                    water is enough to make a constant shower of its dust, &amp;
                    a most cold wind, &amp; I stood in that cold wind &amp; that
                    shower, &amp; saw rainbows where the shadow of the rock
                    ended &amp; met the sunshine. Pontyglindifis &#8211; a bridge over
                    a glen down which a mountain brooks roars &#8211; was the next
                    fine object &#8211; &amp; the only in our way to Cernioge. all
                    else was raw &amp; bleak. black boggy looking streams, &amp;
                    cold boggy hills. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> said it was Irish looking &#8211; I thought of the
                    worst parts of Alentejo. thence to Llanwrst &#8211; but not along
                    the common road. we struck to the left by way of Bettws.
                    &amp; this led us to a glorious pass among the mountains.
                    the mountain side was stony, &amp; a few trees grew among
                    its stones, the other side was more <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> wooded &amp; had grass
                    on the top &#8211; &amp; a huge waterfall thundered into the
                    bottom &amp; thundered down the bottom. when it had nearly
                    past these rocky straits it met another stream. the width of
                    water then became considerable &amp; twice it formed a large
                    &#8211; black pool &#8211; to the eye absolutely stagnant &#8211; the froth of
                    the waters that entered then sleeping upon the surface &#8211; it
                    had the deadness of enchantment &#8211; yet was not the pool wider
                    than the river above it &amp; below it where it foamed over
                    a broken bed. Last night we slept at Llanwrst. a little town
                    upon the Conway, remarkable for a bridge which we were told
                    was built by one Inigo Jones<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Inigo Jones (1573-1652;

                    &amp; for a church worth entering, more particularly because
                    it contains the coffin of Llewelyn the Great.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Llewelyn &#8216;the Great&#8217; (c.

                        effective ruler of Wales in his later years.</note> a
                    huge stone chest, once well ornamented. On the way to Conway
                    we lingerd an hour &amp; half in climbing up to a waterfall
                    which is visible from the road. Conway is walled round &amp;
                    I could have fancied myself in Portugal, only sunshine &amp;
                    a stink were wanting. the castle &amp; the ruined wall are
                    very very fine. It falls <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del>
                    lamentably short of Obidos, but in England I have seen no
                    fortifications remaining so entire. thence to Bangor along
                    the side of Penmaenmawr, a road now walled in &amp; safe,
                    but once terribly dangerous &#8211; for the wall runs along a
                    giddy precipice, &amp; the sea is at the bottom. the old
                    Penman is a grand fellow. Zounds had he given himself one
                    shake to shake the dust from his coat &#8211; a hail storm of
                    rocks would have buried us. the mountain is almost all stone
                    &#8211; lying loose, or jutting out like crystals in shape. I want
                    some good Welshman to give me the names of the mountains in
                    their order along this coast. we are now at Bangor &#8211; rather
                    an Inn a mile from Bangor. tomorrow we go to Capel Cerrig,
                    &amp; from thence see the one side of Snowdon, &amp; I shall
                    look out a situation for Cadwallons<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The cousin of the eponymous hero in

        <p rend="indent1"> What I have seen is so entirely different
                    from the Lake Scenery that it would be ridiculous to attempt
                    comparison. these mountains look to me the highest &#8211; but
                    that is probably because they are more insulated. Wales has
                    wood, &amp; the interest of ruins &amp; many recollections,
                    any thing so simple &amp; severely sublime as your view to
                    Borrodale &amp; Newlands or so quietly beautiful as Grasmere
                    &amp; Rydale I have not seen. We are mounted &#8211; &amp; the
                    servant drives the gig &#8211; or rides as we like. I have
                    learn[MS torn] to drive &#8211; so I may say, &amp; that without
                    breaking the carriage or killing a Welshman. It is cold
                    weather, &amp; today is cloudy &#8211; I am hoping &#8211; but not
                    expecting a clear day to attempt Snowdon. if old Snowdon
                    knew what a reverence I have for him he would doff his
                    nightcap in decency. Twas a bad business that one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mordred, whose magic song, &#8216;Made huge
