                    179&#8211;180.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is a favourite article of belief with me
                    Grosvenor, that friendship &amp; affections will continue in
                    the next world; yet there are some awkward objections to it,
                    it is not analogous to what passes here, nothing lasts, &#8211;
                    Nature seems to delight in disorganizing to reproduce. not
                    only does every thing change around us but we change
                    ourselves &#8211; the oak indeed was contained in the acorn, but
                    it is not to the human eye that the resemblance is
                    visible.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is a great difference between love
                    &amp; friendship; absence &amp; cohabitation increase the
                    one &amp; slowly destroy the other. if I wishd to preserve a
                    friend I would rather perhaps have him in the East Indies
                    than in the house with me. but even absence weakens this
                    kind of attachment, for the apartments of friendship in the
                    heart are never long vacant. however Grosvenor there is a
                    kind of cabinet or closet in mine belonging to you, &amp; I
                    am sorry that you so long keep it shut up, &amp; only leave
                    in it a parcel of old letters &amp; old recollections by way
                    of keeping possession. I often feel a wish to write to you
                    when some imperious business employs me otherwise, &#8211; for by
                    the Lord tho you were Commander in Chief of the Light Horse,
                    Chancellor of the Exchequer, or even a Mamaluck Bey,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A ruler of one of the
                        twenty-four divisions of Marmeluk Egypt. The beys formed
                        a governing council, or divan, presided over by a
                        Turkish pasha or governor. By the time of the French
                        invasion of Egypt in 1798, the Beys had become warlords,
                        each ruling over their own separate kingdom.</note> I
                    should &amp; would call you &amp; think of you Grosvenor
                    Bedford. I never offended any body by my opinions yet except
                    one old woman &#8211; &amp; as you are not an old woman I am
                    determined not to offend you &#8211; no &#8211; tho I were in the
                    punchinello dress of the grand costume of the Great Nation,
                    you should recognize my original nose. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have not been well Grosvenor, &amp; my
                    indisposition has given me some acquaintance with the
                    nervous system. I walk &amp; take ether. the fact is I have
                    hurt myself by sitting at the desk; &amp; this is as
                    convenient for me as it would be for a running footman to
                    strain his ancle, or an Alderman to have the Mumps. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is of late
                    much mended in her health &#8211; for me I look on the spring
                    &amp; the effect of bathing. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall have a book to send you soon. the
                    frost has been freezing the printers ink &amp; paper, &amp;
                    the Devil himself was almost starved. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What is become of you? &amp; what are you
                    thinking of &amp; what interests you now? &#8211; four years ago
                    you &amp; I were interested in every thing that concerned
                    the other, &#8211; I sometimes tremble for my favourite article of
                    belief. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Certainly Grosvenor if we both go to heaven
                    we shall only see one another there occasionally as
                    visitors, for I shall be among a whole herd of Frenchmen &#8211;
                    Revolutionists, &amp; a sort of Quaker Christians who have a
                    mortal antipathy to regimentals. however I will come to your
                    star sometimes, if the gulph between be passable, &amp; you
                    shall laugh at my tricolor cockade, &amp; I will laugh at
                    your court suit.</p>
