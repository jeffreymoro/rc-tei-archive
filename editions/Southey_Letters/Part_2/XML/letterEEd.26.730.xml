        <p rend="indent1"> So long a time has elapsed that I know not
                    when I wrote last to you, or whether I am about to tell you
                    what has been before communicated.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My design of residing at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> has proved
                    abortive. the quantity of room required could not be spared,
                    tho I had reason to expect otherwise. I had then to look
                    about again &#8211; for some residence to suit me &#8211; &amp; hope I
                    am in a fair way of finding one, being in treaty at present
                    for a house in Glamorganshire, eight miles from Neath &#8211; in a
                    good climate, &amp; most beautiful country, where food is
                    cheap, fuel at a very low price, &amp; a canal near the
                    house for regular conveyance &#8211; even from Bristol if I need
                    it. the house is furnished &#8211; a great convenience as it
                    leaves me more at liberty. in a fortnight I am to hear
                    farther about it &#8211; our negociation is about certain
                    alterations &#8211; there is a kitchen to be added &amp; I want a
                    room above it &#8211; somewhat larger than the others, to be my
                    study.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This I know has not been communicated to you
                    before &#8211; but am not quite so sure that what follows will not
                    be a twice told tale. I went to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southey</ref> &#8211;
                    that Uncle whom for 26 years I had not seen. he received me
                    with great civility. the wig that is only powdered for
                    Sunday, was powdered in the middle of the week &#8211; the Sunday
                    coat put on &#8211; a barrel of strong beer broached, &amp; a fire
                    lit in the best parlour. good symptoms you will say but I
                    have opened an intercourse which I know not how to keep up.
                    his talents were by nature of no common stamp &#8211; they have
                    been exclusively directed to the law, which he has now for
                    years abandoned. his books are such books as a man buys who
                    thinks he must fill a bookcase, because a bookcase is a
                    common piece of furniture. Smollets History<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Tobias Smollett (1721-1771;

                    still he starves them. Nature too had given him his share of
                    feelings but they also have been blasted. one only passion
                    has actuated him thro life. that of accumulating money &#8211; he
                    learnt to dislike his relations because he was afraid their
                    poverty would make claims upon his riches &#8211; &amp; now at the
                    age of something more than sixty he is without one friend in
                    the world. his manners have grown boorish in solitude he

                    man who has never heard conversation above that of his
                    hinds. when I left him he shook me by the hand &amp; wished
                    me a pleasant <hi rend="ital">tower</hi>, for I was going
                    into Glamorganshire in quest of this house. before he saw me
                    he had said I was &#8220;a damnd shrewd fellow&#8221; &#8211; &amp; now this
                    precious commendation is exchanged for pity &#8211; my voice, he
                    says, is gone already &#8211; &amp; doubtless he thinks that I had
                    better be thinking of my own death, than gaping for his.
                    poor miserable man. I sate smoking with him till midnight
                    &amp; thinking how miserable he was, &amp; what he must
                    think of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>
                    &amp; myself, then in the room with him &#8211; who had grown up
                    with no feeling of family love &#8211; &amp; who could only be
                    regarded by him as vultures following an army. I talked with
                    an effort &#8211; not of my own concerns &#8211; not of my family &#8211;
                    those were subjects not to be touched upon &#8211; we had no
                    common feelings, no common interests &#8211; no common
                    recollections. time hung heavy &#8211; the mouldering of a wood
                    fire became a perceptible sound &#8211; &amp; I never ceased to
                    hear the click of the house &lt;clock.&gt; there was no
                    after invitation at parting &#8211; nothing like &#8211; I shall be glad

                    hand &#8211; &amp; I know as little as ever how to act with him.
                    pride &amp; resentment for the neglect of a common duty
                    would have justified me in never noticing him &#8211; but what
                    intercourse can I keep up &#8211; or how? &#8211; I can only call at his
                    house if ever my road lies near it &#8211; or if any thing of
                    importance befalls me let him know by letter &#8211; that is of
                    important good &#8211; for other news would only provoke a curse
                    at impertinence. his occupation now is farming &#8211; he has no
                    longer strength for it &amp; means to give it up &#8211; what will
                    become of him in utter illness &#8211; without any resource,
                    without any companion &#8211; for already he has quarrelled with
                    all his old companions from a trick of thinking over words
                    by himself till he extracts from them some uncivil sense as
                    food for resentment.</p>
