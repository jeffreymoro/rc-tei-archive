                        been written was when Southey heard of James Mackintosh&#8217;s knighthood, which
                        was announced on 21 December 1803; Southey sent a section of the next book
                        of <title>Madoc</title> to Tom Southey on 17 February 1804 and had completed
                        revisions to the first part of the poem by this date, so this letter is
                        unlikely to have been sent after mid-February 1804.</note>
