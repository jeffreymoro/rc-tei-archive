        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am very sorry that your Letter should have
                    remained so long unacknowledged. the fact is I have been
                    visiting in Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire, &amp; amid
                    company, journeying &amp; some employments that follow me
                    every where, I recollected not my unanswered letters at
                    home.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your proposals are hanging in <ref target="places.html#Cottles">Cottles</ref> shop.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">George Dyer was at
                        this time seeking to publish a three-volume edition of
                        his &#8216;Poetical Works&#8217;, if he could gather enough
                        subscribers. He was not successful.</note> it is unlucky
                    that most of my friends here are yours also; however I
                    mentioned your proposed volumes to some of them who might
                    not perhaps have otherwise known your intention. We will do
                    what we can, if not what we wish. your list has some 8 or 10
                    names &#8211; &amp; it will be some advantage to have a country
                    bookseller in <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</ref> who will feel a friendly interest in
                    assisting the work.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry, in considering only my own
                    gratif&lt;ic&gt;ation that your essays are to be
                        delayed.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Dyer&#8217;s
                        proposed &#8216;Poetical Works&#8217; would have included &#8216;Critical
                        Essays, on different Branches of Poetry and Criticism,
                        illustrated from ancient and modern Authors&#8217;.</note>
                    whenever you take the subject of metre into consideration I
                    shall beg you to weigh the merits of some regular blank
                    stanzas in which I think I have been succesful, &amp; which
                    you perhaps may have seen in the Morning Post without
                    suspecting their author. four lines seem to me the best
                    length for a lyric stanza. I have disposed them thus
                    differently in different odes. you know the Ode to
                        evening<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William
                        Collins (1721&#8211;1759; <title>DNB</title>), &#8216;Ode to
                        Evening&#8217; (1746).</note>
          <del rend="strikethrough">is</del> consist of 10.10.6.6.
                    10.6.6.10. &#8212;. 8.6.6.10. &#8212;. 8.8.10.6. &#8212; 6.6.10.6. &#8212;
                    6.10.10.6. &#8212; 8.6.10.6. &#8212;.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In such metres neither the lines or stanzas
                    must run into each other, &amp; the regular harmony must be
                    as perceptible to the ear as to the eye. I have yet other
                    arrangements to try. these odes<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s recent contributions to the
