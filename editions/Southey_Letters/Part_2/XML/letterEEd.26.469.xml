        <p rend="indent1"> Geese were made to grow feathers, and
                    farmers&#8217; wives to pluck them. I suspect booksellers and
                    authors were made with something of the like first cause.
                    With Thalaba<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> was completed
                        during, not before, Southey&#8217;s second visit to Portugal
                        in 1800&#8211;1801, and published in 1801.</note> I must make
                    sure work and speedy, for abroad I <hi rend="ital">must</hi>
                    go. Complaints of immediate danger I have none, but
                    increased and increasing nervous affections threaten much
                    remote. I have rushes of feeling nightly, like fainting or
                    death, and induced, I believe, wholly by the dread of them.
                    Even by day they menace me, and an effort of mind is
                    required to dispel them. . . . . So I <hi rend="ital">must</hi> go, and I <hi rend="ital">will</hi> go. Now,
                    then, the sooner the better. Some progress is made in the
                    sixth book of Thalaba; my notes are ready for the whole, at
                    least there is only the trouble of arranging and seasoning
                    them. If the bargain were made, it would be time to think of
                    beginning to print, for the preliminaries are usually full
                    of delays, and time with me is of importance. I must have
                    the summer to travel in, and ought to be in Germany by the
                    beginning of June. Treat, therefore, with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, or any

                    excursions &#8211; now into Hungary, now into Poland, and see the
                    Turks. Zounds! who knows but, like Sir John Maundeville, we
                    might have gone where the Devil&#8217;s head is always above
