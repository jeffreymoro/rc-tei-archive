<p>I bought eight volumes of old French Poetry at Lisbon,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title>Poetes Anciens Francais</title> (1723-1762), no. 2269
                        in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> published about 1720 by
                    Contellier. perhaps this is the same – or part of the same collection which you
                    mention as Cretin<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Guillaume Cretin (c.
                        1465-1525), French poet and chronicler.</note> is among them – &amp; that
                    fellow whom Gibbon<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Gibbon

                            <title>Miscellaneous Works</title>, 7 vols (London, 1796-1797), VI, p.

                    metrical chronicle is not Cretins. Les Vigilles de Charles 7.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Martial d’Auvergne (c. 1430/1435-1508)
                            <title>Les Vigilles de la Mort de Charles VII</title>

                    retains a French sound. that poem is very curious – I have many extracts from
                    it. the most curious piece in the collection is I believe by Cretin – about 200
                    stanzas each of some remarkable thing of his time. I am more desirous to see the
                    poems by Froissart<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean Froissart (c.
                        1337-c. 1405), best known for his chronicle, but also composer of narrative
                        and lyrical poetry.</note> than any thing else in the language – you will
                    find a better view of old French poetry in Pasquier<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Etienne Pasquier (1529-1615), <title>Recherches de la
                            France</title> (1560).</note> than in any other author.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Your censure of the Cid<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had transcribed for Wynn material relating to Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar
                        (c. 1040-1099), a Castilian aristocrat and military commander, whose
                        exploits were the subject of numerous poems and tales. Southey’s English
                        translation and compilation of three of these was published in 1808 as
                            <title>The Chronicle of the Cid</title>.</note> has rather pleased me
                    because what you as well as I myself have felt to be in the <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> spirit of poetry is nothing more than the
                    genuine language of the chronicles whence I have compiled. I am very sure that
                    the passages you would point out as most striking are literal translation. the
                    phrase denaturalize so exactly conveys its meaning that I have not now to alter
                    it – where it first occurs in the book I must explain that it was a form whereby
                    vassals legally threw off their allegiance, becoming enemies instead of vassals.
                    now to <hi rend="ital">naturalize</hi> being an English word &amp; precisely in
                    the converse meaning. it appears to me that <del rend="strikethrough">the</del>
                    to compound it with a privative was the shortest &amp; most obvious of rendering
                    the meaning desired. the Cid is not so fair a specimen of my stile, as it is of
                    the manner in which I weave costume <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del>
                    &lt;with&gt; the main thread. the oldest Spanish chronicle – that is <hi rend="ital">in Spanish</hi> – the one compiled by order of Alonso the
                        Wise<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The early to mid 14th-century
                            <title>Cronica de Alfonso X</title> (1221-1284), King of Castile and
                        Leon 1252-1284.</note> is made up in great part of tradition preserved as is
                    usual chiefly in ballads. many of the facts are evidently the invention of these
                    poets, &amp; tho the metre be lost the character of poetry generally appears.
                    this is the case with all their heroic period – from Bernardo del Carpio<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Legendary Spanish hero.</note> down to
                    the Cid. you must believe a little more than you do of Theseus &amp;
                        Hercules.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Heroes in Greek
                        legend.</note> in the notes I shall distinguish what is certain truth but
                    they enter my preliminaries as <del rend="strikethrough">the history</del> &lt;a
                    picture&gt; of manners necessary to be understood than as history. <del rend="strikethrough">xx xxx</del> daylight begins only <del rend="strikethrough">with</del> in the Cids time.</p>
<p rend="indent1">I still suffer from weak eyes, an inflammation of the lower lids,
                    so painful at night that I am usually obliged to sit in a dark room. this has
                    sadly impeded my progress. I get on as well as I can but the loss of the candle
                    light hours destroys half of the best half of my time.</p>
