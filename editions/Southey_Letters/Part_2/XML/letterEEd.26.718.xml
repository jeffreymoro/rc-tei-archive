        <p rend="indent1"> I have been to Taunton &amp; slept two nights
                    in <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">my Uncles</ref>
                    house. he was very civil &#8211; powdered his wig which is only
                    done on Sundays &#8211; changed his vest &amp; moved into the best
                    parlour. I found a strange man living a comfortless life.
                    his dress shabby &#8211; his manners boorish. a strong
                    understanding wasted &#8211; &amp; good feelings habitually
                    suppressed till they have been almost destroyed. he keeps no
                    company &amp; his establishment is almost miserly. there is
                    plenty &#8211; but every where a meanness &#8211; the pride of wealth,
                    &amp; the passion of accumulation eternally counteracting
                    each other. before I went down his phrase respecting me was
                    that I was a damned shrewd fellow &#8211; he now thinks me not
                    long for this world &#8211; &amp; says &#8211; my voice is gone already.
                    he himself I think is nearer the end of his lease. He never
                    said he was glad to see me &#8211; never uttered a hint respecting
                    my views in life nor those of any of his family &#8211; never said
                    he should be glad to see me again &#8211; but when <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> &amp; I left
                    him followed us to the door &#8211; shook us heartily by the hand,
                    &amp; wished us a pleasant <hi rend="ital">tower</hi>. he is
                    proud of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>,
                    wants him to make an appearance in the world &#8211; knows he has
                    only a Lieutenants half pay &#8211; &amp; yet has not the heart to
                    give him a single guinea. I talked with him &#8211; laughd with
                    him &amp; made him laugh &#8211; he pushd the bottle &#8211; loaded my
                    plate with fruit &#8211; broached his best beer for me &#8211;, still it
                    was not comfortable &#8211; I heard the click of the clock &#8211; &amp;
                    the hum of the gnats at evening, &amp; the crumbling of a
                    wood fire &#8211; &amp; a man never hears those sounds if he is
                    enjoying himself. the ice however is broke. if his property

                        was Southey&#8217;s third cousin and died unmarried. Southey
                        did not inherit any of his property.</note> had been
                    long looking out for that inheritance &#8211; but now he has
                    foolishly quarrelled with the old man &#8211; &amp; so the only
                    rival is removed. the chance of the reversion from that
                    quarter is greater than you allow &#8211; for he is not a hale
                    man. I heard at Lisbon that the seeds of consumption were in
                    him. he is a good man &amp; a useful man &#8211; &amp; his death
                    would be a loss to the community. I only wish it may be his
                    humour to continue single.</p>
