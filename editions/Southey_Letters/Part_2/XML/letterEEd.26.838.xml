                    which way I was drifted. I wished to leave <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lovell</ref> behind. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> begged me not &#8211; at that time I
                    did not press the point &#8211; for we come with no plan of settling &#8211; merely as to
                    the first haven. I knew you would house us awhile &#8211; &amp; that if her presence
                    was an objection to our remaining with you while we are thus unsettled that
                    lodgings are to be had in the neighbourhood. moreover as soon as a situation can
                    be found for her, I shall with great pleasure see her into the stage. I hardly
                    look forward, my hopes have been so often prolonged &amp; are now so blasted &#8211;

                    the M Post for 15,000&#163;. seven eighths of which was paid down, the rest remains
                    in a share for the Editor M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Byrne,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Nicholas Byrne (d. 1833), editor and part-owner of the

                    Herald for 10 years, &amp; who is now engaged for the Post. He is a man in every
                    way as well qualified as myself, except that I think he will not dash so much in
                    politics. To him I have coupled in a share M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fleming<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly Dr John Fleming (d. 1815), who

                    that the Paper cannot fail to thrive at least as well as any other. I shall
                    write more in it at least for the next two years, while I am receiving Byrnes
                    money, than I have hitherto done. I will have more time to write, &amp; I will
                    have as you see an actual interest in the paper; but I will be exempted from the
                    editorial drudgery. I am sure you will say I have given a proof of my
                    moderation, when I tell you I have sold a Property at present producing at least
                    8000 per annum for 13,000 down; a Property too which I have every reason to
                    suppose I can keep up. It stands up just now beyond all example; so much so,
                    that I two or three times refused to sell, changing my mind almost daily. But
                    the conduct of my Reporters &amp; other Writers so irritates me I was disgusted
                    &amp; resolved to sell. they are in general a bad set, but I could give reasons
                    for it. I have realized in all about 25,000&#163; &#8211; besides 2000 to come from Byrne,

        <p rend="indent1"> As far as I can conjecture your gout is willing to become gout if
                    it could &#8211; the Gout medicine may help it on to this. I suppose you should try it
                    in two ways. first by drinking 4 5 or 6 glasses at the interval of 1 2 or 3
                    hours each day. I suppose if in 4 5 or 6 days your stomach do not feel a
                    different creature, it will be hardly worth while holding on.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But shd you not be careful that there be no vinegar brewed all
                    this time? suppose the medicine by changing the stomach, changes all the
                    sensations, a stomach-full of wind &amp; sourness will change them all back
                    again. I do not know if I can propose any means of prevention you have not
                    already practised. But food not acescent in general, with super carbonated In
                    ale (or calcined magnesia in case of costiveness) with ginger to check any
                    commencement of acid fermentation seem to me to promise.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The second method must be confined to the time of appearance of
                    gouty inflammation about the feet. Then I would urge the medicine, taking a
                    glass (2oz) every 4 5 or 6 minutes till I glowed red hot. I have more
                    expectation from this cutting &amp; spurring than the other gentle lashing. Most
                    medical men would recommend the Bath waters, supposing them to connect the
                    letters g o u t with the other sufferings</p>

                    that by writing even in that manner I could save many human beings much of the
                    direct pain which human beings can suffer. And thus were they begun &amp; ended
