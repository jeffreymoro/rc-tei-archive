          <salute>My dear Danvers</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I write to you from <ref target="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</ref> &amp; at the
                    same table with <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>. this will surprize you &#8211; I know not
                    whether you will be equally surprized to hear that Lloyd
                    reported as many unfavourable accounts of me to <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &#8211; as he did of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> to me &#8211; &amp; manufactured
                    conversations &amp; speeches wholly out of his brain. for
                    this I have the authority of <ref target="people.html#PooleThomas">Poole</ref> &#8211; &amp; his
                    own Letters. they believe him mad &#8211; I wonder &amp; learn to
                    be sceptical.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> However here I am, &amp; have been some days
                    wholly immersed in conversation. in one point of view <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; I are bad companions for each
                    other, without being talkative I am conversational, the
                    hours slip away &amp; the ink dries upon the pen in my
                    hand.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is very
                    much better. I have seen Ilfracombe &amp; find its beauty
                    consists wholly in the shore scenery &#8211; the country is wild
                    open &amp; naked, so we shall go to the South of Devon at
                    once &#8211; &amp; set out on Monday or Tuesday next to Sidmouth.
                    the <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref> are going to Ottery, which is only
                    five miles from Sidmouth so we travel together.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have seen the Valley of Stones. imagine a
                    vale, almost narrow enough to be called a coombe running
                    between two ranges of hills. on the left the hills are
                    covered with turf. the vale is sprinkled with stones among
                    fern, only in one place piled grotesquely or at any height &#8211;
                    yet presenting a singular appearance. the magnificence lies
                    on the Northern side &#8211; the hills here are without turf or
                    soil, stript of their vegetable earth &#8211; compleatly naked &#8211;
                    the very bones of the earth. here the bare stones assume a
                    thousand strange shapes of ruins. I ascended the highest
                    point. at the summit two huge stones inclining against each
                    other formed a portal. in this I lay down. a little platform
                    of level turf &#8211; the only piece I saw spread before me. about
                    two yards long, &amp; then the eye fell immediately upon the
                    sea, a giddy depth. you cannot conceive a spot more strange,
                    more impressive. I never before felt the whole sublimity of
                    solitude.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What could have been the origin of this
                    valley? the valley itself is very high above the sea &#8211; but
                    if it be the effect of water, &amp; I can conceive no other
                    possible agent, the same inundation which bared the summit
                    of these heights must necessarily have flooded all the lower
                    lands in the kingdom. but even the opposite hills to which I
                    could have shot an arrow are clothed with soil &amp;
                    vegetation. possibly a water spout might have produced this
                    effect. As a poet I could form hypotheses in plenty, but to
                    my shame I am no naturalist. I could learn no tradition &#8211;
                    the people do not even suspect the Devil of having had any
                    hand in it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At the alehouse in the adjoining village I
                    met with the father of Lean &#8211; your reading-society man.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note>
                    he claimed acquaintance with me, on the score of his sons
                    knowing me! I found him a plain unaffected intelligent old
                    man, he gave me a good deal of local information, showed me
                    several of the best points of view, &amp; invited me to his
                    home at Wivelscombe &#8211; he is a seller of all things &#8211; &amp;
                    travels twice or thrice a year round Exmoor with a cart full
                    of goods. these villages which are shut out from all the
                    world &amp; inaccessible by carriages have no shops to
                    supply themselves from &amp; when Lean enters one of them
                    his arrival is proclaimed in form at the church door.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Lymouth a village about a mile from the
                    Valley of Stones is a place of unequalled beauty. excepting
                    the Arrabida &amp; Cintra I have seen nothing superiour to
                    it. two rivers &#8211; you know the down-hill rivers of Devonshire
                    &#8211; that make one long water-fall all the way &#8211; two rivers
                    from two coombes join at Lymouth, &amp; where they join
                    enter the sea, &amp; the sea makes but one <del rend="strikethrough">murmur</del> roar with the rivers.
                    the one coombe is richly wooded &#8211; the other naked &amp;
                    stoney. from the eminence which juts out between them is one
                    of the noblest views I ever saw &#8211; the two coombes &amp;
                    their rivers &#8211; their junction &#8211; the little village of
                    Lymouth &amp; the sea &#8211; here boundless &amp; with the
                    variety of sea colours. the road down to Lymouth is dreadful
                    a narrow path more than a mile in descent on the brink of a
                    precipice with the sea below. a mound of earth about two
                    feet high secure the foot traveller but it is gloriously
                    terrific.</p>
