                        been a draper, in partnership with Robert and Tom Southey’s father.</note>

                        Mills Coates (d. 1819) of the law firm Morgan and Coates, Small St, Bristol.
                        Both brothers were radicals and may have been related to John Prior Estlin’s

                        assistant lecturer in 1801. His circle included Southey, Wordsworth and
                        Coleridge (who nicknamed him ‘Subligno’). In 1803 Underwood accompanied
                        Thomas Wedgwood on a European tour. After hostilities resumed on 16 May
                        1803, Wedgwood managed to make his way home, but Underwood was arrested at
                        Calais. His detention in France lasted until 1814.</note> to be interested

                    expect, &amp; if you stay six weeks &lt;more&gt; which good fortune forbid!
                    perhaps you may expect on as much longer. the whole of the two first Volumes is
