        <p rend="indent1"> I have thought much, and talked much, and
                    advised much about Thalaba,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Islamic romance <title>Thalaba the
                            Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> and will endeavour
                    to travel without publishing it: because I am in no mood for
                    running races, and because I like what is done to be done so
                    well, that I am not willing to let it go raggedly into the
                    world. Six books are written, and the two first have
                    undergone their first correction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have the whim of making a Darwinish<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Erasmus Darwin
                        (1731&#8211;1802; <title>DNB</title>). His two-part <title>The
                            Botanic Garden</title> (1791) was famous for its
                        lengthy notation. Southey did not include this note in
                            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), but his
                        thoughts on it are recorded in <title>Common-Place
                            Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series
                        (London, 1849&#8211;1850), IV, pp. 212&#8211;213.</note> note at the
                    close of the poem, upon the effects produced in our globe by
                    the destruction of the Dom Daniel. <hi rend="ital">Imprimis</hi>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;In the first place&#8217;.</note> the sudden falling in of
                    the sea&#8217;s roots necessarily made the maelstrom; then the
                    cold of the north is accounted for by the water that rushed
                    into the caverns, putting out a great part of the central
                    fire; the sudden generation of steam shattered the southern
                    and south-east continents into archipelagos of islands; also
                    the boiling spring of Geyser has its source here, &#8211; who
                    knows what it did not occasion!</p>

                    I shall attempt to do the same, but am not very anxious for
                    success, as Italy seems certainly accessible, or at least
                    Trieste is. Is it <hi rend="ital">quite impossible</hi> that
                    you can go? Surely a life of Lessing<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Coleridge had proposed writing a life of
                        the German poet, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing
                        (1729&#8211;1781).</note> may be as well written in Germany as
                    in England, and little time lost. I shall be ready to go as
                    soon as you please: we should just make a carriage-full, and
                    you and I would often make plenty of room by walking. You
                    cannot begin Lessing before May, and you allow yourself ten
                    months for the work. Well, we will be in Germany before
                    June; at the towns where we make a halt of any time,
                    something may be done, and the actual travelling will not
                    consume more than two months; thus three months only will be
                    lost, and it is worth this price: we can return through
                    France, and, in the interim, Italy offers a society almost
                    as interesting. <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> will fortify me with all necessary

                    will be a very mock-bird as to languages; he shall talk
                    German with you and me, Italian with the servants, and
                    English with <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">his

                    he says it must be true of some Christian saint, and so
                    stolen by the Turks. After this he gives, by way of
                    contrast, a specimen of Christian miracles, and chooses out
