        <p rend="indent1"> A Preacher here at <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> asserted the

                    doubts the truth of this assertion &#8211; to be sure they have
                    confessed it to him! for you know the secrets of confession
                    are sacred. Benito our man here, told me this &#8211; Sir said

                    the Inquisition, this country &amp; Spain too would be
                    over-run with Witches &amp; Jews! &#8211; The great mischief
                    ascribed to Witches here, is the trick they have of killing
                    infants. this happens very often, &amp; <hi rend="ital">always</hi> by night, the children are known to have
                    thus died by the blackness of their faces. Now this must be
                    a lie, not a superstition, &#8211; an invention of some nurse who
                    had over laid her infant &#8211; singularly useful as an excuse
                    among this sleepy people.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of the wise Ferrol expedition we know nothing
                    more than that it has failed.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The British government was increasingly
                        convinced that Spain would ally with France and declare
                        war on Britain. As a pre-emptive strike, a fleet under
                        the command of Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren
                        (1753&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>) unsuccessfully attempted
                        to capture the Spanish port of Ferrol on 25&#8211;27 August

                    absurdities! Vigo can only have been visited for the sake of
                    making a Gazette &amp; varnishing over their failure. the
                    consequence will probably be that Spain will at last
                    commence hostilities here, to draw our attention &amp; keep
                    her own coasts clear. We have no serious apprehensions. it
                    is a mere matter of talk &amp; speculation. But the
                    Pestilence which rages at Cadiz is a nearer &amp; more
                    alarming evil. it is now over the whole Province of
                    Andalusia &#8211; within 250 miles of us, &amp; no precautions are
                    taken whatever. A man has just arrived at Lisbon from Cadiz
                    who has had the disease &#8211; he has performed no quarantine &#8211;
                    &amp; his baggage entered unmolested. What the disorder is I
                    cannot learn, other than it is called the Black Vomit, &amp;
                    that the same kind of plague has formerly ravaged Europe,
                    particularly this peninsula. They say it is <hi rend="ital">Epidemic</hi>, not <hi rend="ital">contagious.</hi> if
                    so we are safe. the Siroc blew for nine weeks at Cadiz. &#8211; if
                    this was the cause the rains will remove it &#8211; or the winter
                    &#8211; if it contagious Lisbon is in hourly &amp; imminent
                    danger. an immense contraband trade is carried on thro the
                    bye passes of the mountains. guard the frontier towns
                    however vigilantly it is impossible to guard the whole line
                    of frontier where Nature has made no boundary. the disease
                    will be smuggled in. indeed my chief reason for believing it
                    not to be contagious, is that it has not reached us. If it
                    comes we fly &#8211; perhaps to England &#8211; perhaps to Porto &amp;
                    the mountains. the last plan will be sufficiently safe &amp;
