        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter directed to Llangedwin doubtless
                    has been lost &#8211; nor indeed would that direction be known at
                    the post offices. the two sheets of commendation reached me
                    on my reaching Wynnstay &#8211; I call it commendation &amp; not
                    criticism. you are right censuring the effect produced by
                    success on Thalaba.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The rest of this letter contains Southey&#8217;s response to
                        Grosvenor Bedford&#8217;s criticism of <title>Thalaba the
                            Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> his character is
                    sunk too low in that part &#8211; there is too much of the
                    undisguised impatience of appetite than ought to appear,
                    &amp; than is consistent. the sixth &amp; seventh book have
                    a greater common-placeness of subject than any of the
                    others. you are right too in wanting more struggle at this
                    last &#8211; some idea I have for amending this &#8211; some Demon
                    effort of defence &#8211; perhaps Eblis<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The principal evil spirit in

                    shedding upon Thalaba its poisonous substance. the first
                    book is faulty &#8211; that long episode is too loosely tacked on
                    &#8211; in fact the poem grew from that story.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">One of the origins of
                            <title>Thalaba the Destoyer</title> (1801) was
                        Southey&#8217;s idea for a poem on the Garden of Irem, a
                        hidden paradise, see <title>Common-Place Book</title>,
                        ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1850), IV,
                        pp. 97-98.</note> one great, grievous &amp; irremediable
                    defect pervades the poem. there is no necessary connection
                    of its parts &#8211; one event does not produce another &#8211; the
                    sequence is accidental &#8211; &amp; adventures so hitched
                    together might have been extended to the folio volumes of

                    continued, Thalaba is not enough an agent &#8211; he is too much
                    the slave of Destiny. yet against this I took some pains to
                    guard &#8211; I made him ever act humanly &#8211; &amp; they who would
