                    but something like it. He never could learn to read &#8211; tho he could write &#8211; that

                    holds it. to the wicked it is the draught of eternal anguish. the wrath-eye of
                    Seeva falls upon him &amp; heats him red-hot &#8211; &amp; so he remains for ever. the
                    cup is then given to Kalyal &#8211; &amp; she now immortal becomes the wife of an
