        <p rend="indent1"> The long intermission of my letters must not
                    make you think I have forgotten you. Since we came to <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> I have been
                    employd in finishing, correcting, &amp; copying Thalaba &#8211;
                    which now wants only an opportunity to be sent to England.
                    there is a copy written out for you also,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey&#8217;s copy of

        <p rend="indent1"> You have probably heard enough of the
                    infection at Cadiz to be anxious for information. our
                    accounts agree on nothing but in the extent of the calamity.
                    one day we are assured it is the Black Vomit &#8211; another day
                    the yellow Fever, &amp; now it is ripened into the Plague.
                    this only is certain that for the last ten or twelve days of
                    our accounts, from 240 to 260 persons have died daily in
                    Cadiz. whether it has extended beyond that city is also
                    uncertain &#8211; some reports say it has spread to the South &#8211; to
                    Malaga &amp; Alicant &#8211; others bring it to the frontier town
                    &#8211; within 200 miles of us. We all think &amp; talk seriously
                    of our danger &#8211; &amp; forget it the moment the conversation
                    is changed &#8211; Whenever it actually enters Portugal &#8211; we shall
                    probably fly &amp; probably to England. I hope the rains
                    which we may soon expect will stop the contagion.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So much have I to tell you that it actually
                    puzzles me where to begin. &#8211; My <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> memorandums
                    must be made; <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> more than
                    once have I delayed the task of describing this place from a
                    feeling of its difficulty. There is no scenery in England
                    which can help me to give you an idea of this. the town is
                    small &#8211; like all the country towns of Portugal containing
                    one Plaza or square, &amp; a number of narrow &amp; crooked
                    streets that wind <del rend="strikethrough">up</del>
                    &lt;down&gt; the hill. the Palace<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The medieval royal palace at Cintra
                        served as a summer residence for the royal
                        family.</note> is old &#8211; remarkably irregular &#8211; a large
                    rambling shapeless pile &#8211; not unlike the prints I have seen
                    in old Romances of a castle or palace whose infinite corners
                    overlook the sea &#8211; two white towers &#8211; like glass-houses
                    exactly &#8211; form a prominent feature in the distance, &amp;
                    with a square tower mark it for an old &amp; public edifice.
                    from the valley the Town appears to stand very high, &amp;
                    the ways up are long &amp; winding &amp; weary. but the Town
                    itself is far below the summit of the mountain. You have
                    seen the Rock of Lisbon from the sea &#8211; that Rock is the <hi rend="ital">Sierra</hi>, or mountain &#8211; of <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref>. above us it is
                    broken into a number of pyramidal summits, of rock piled
                    upon rock &#8211; two of them are wooded completely &#8211; the rest
                    bare. Upon one stands the Penha Convent &#8211; a place where if
                    the Chapel of Loretto had stood one might have half credited
                    the lying legend &#8211; that the Angels &#8211; or the Devil &#8211; had
                    dropt it there &#8211; so unascendable the height appears on which
                    it stands. yet is the way up easy. on another point the
                    ruins of a Moorish Castle crest the hill. to look down from
                    here upon the Palace &amp; Town my head grew giddy, yet is
                    it further from the town to the valley, than from the summit
                    to the town. the road up is as a terrace, now with the open
                    heath on the left all purple with heath flowers &amp; here
                    &amp; there the stoney summits, &#8211; &amp; coombs winding to
                    the vale, luxuriously wooded, chiefly with cork trees.
                    descending as you advance towards Colares, the summits are
                    covered with firs, &amp; the valley appears in all the
                    richness of a fertile soil under this blessed climate. The
                    Cork is perhaps the most beautiful of trees, its leaves are
                    small &amp; have the dusky colour of evergreens, but its
                    boughs branch out in the fantastic twistings of the oak,
                    &amp; its bark is of all others the most picturesque. you
                    have seen deal curl under the carpenters plane &#8211; it grows in
                    such curls &#8211; the wrinkles are of course deep &#8211; one might
                    fancy the cavities the cells of hermit-fairies. There is one
                    Tree in particular here which a painter might well come from
                    England to see. large &amp; old &#8211; its trunk &amp; branches
                    are covered with fern &#8211; the yellow-sun-burnt-fern &#8211; forming
                    so sunny a contrast to the dark foliage &#8211;! a wild vine winds
                    up &amp; hangs in festoons from the boughs &#8211; its leaves of a
                    bright green &#8211; like youth &#8211; &amp; now the purple clusters
                    are ripe. &#8211; These vines form a delightful feature in the
                    scenery. the vineyard is chearful to the eyes &#8211; but it is
                    the wild vine that I love, matting over the hedges, or
                    climbing the cork, or the tall poplars, or twisting over the
                    grey olive, in all its unpruned wantonness. The Chesnut also
                    is beautiful. its blossoms shot out in <hi rend="ital">rays</hi> like stars, &amp; now its hedge-hog fruit
                    stars the dark leaves. We have yet another Tree of exquisite
                    effect in the landscape &#8211; the fir &#8211; not such as you have
                    seen, but one that shoots out no branches, grows very high
                    &amp; then spreads broad in a mushroom shape exactly &#8211; the
                    bottom of its head of the brown &amp; withered colour that
                    the yew or the fir always have, &amp; the surface of the
                    brightest green. If a mushrooms serve as the Pantheon dome
                    for a faery ball &#8211; you might conceive a giant picking one of
                    these pines for a parasol. they have somewhat the appearance
                    in distance that the Palm or the Cocoa has in a print.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The English are numerous here, enough to
                    render it a tolerable market, for sellers will not be
                    wanting where purchasers are to be found. yet last year the
                    Magistrate of the place was idiot enough to order than no
                    English man should be served till all the Portugeuze were
                    satisfied, one of those laws that carries its antidote in
                    its own absurdity. among the people the English are in high
                    favour. they are liberal &#8211; or if you will extravagant, &amp;
                    submit to imposition, &#8211; now a Portugueze fights hard for a
                    farthing. servants love to be in an English family. <del rend="strikethrough">The mistress when they go</del> If
                    a Portugueze mistress goes out she locks up her maids for
                    fear of the men: the relations of the servants often insist
                    that this shall be done. Oftentimes the men &amp; women
                    servants in a family do not know each other. all kitchen
                    work is done by men who sleep &amp; live below, the females
                    are kept above, &#8211; a precious symptom of national morals!
                    calculated to extend the evil it is designed to prevent &#8211;
                    but I wander from <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref>. the fire flies were abundant when we
                    first came here &#8211; it was like faery land to see them
                    sparkling under the trees at night. the glow-worms were also
                    numerous. their lights went out at the end of July &#8211; but we
                    have an insect which almost supplies their place &#8211; a winged
                    grasshopper. in shape like our own, in colour a grey-ground
                    hue, undistinguishable from the soil on which they live &#8211;
                    till they leap up &amp; their expanded wings then appear &#8211;
                    blue, or purple. <del rend="strikethrough">at night</del> we
                    hear at evening the grillo &#8211; it is called the cricket
                    because its song <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> is like
                    that animal but louder &#8211; it is however wholly different &#8211;
                    shaped like a beetle, with wings like a bee, &amp; black.
                    they sell them in cages at Lisbon by way of singing
                    birds.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We ride asses about the country &#8211; you would
                    laugh to see a party thus mounted, &amp; yet soon learn to
                    like the easy pace &amp; sure step of the John <hi rend="ital">burros</hi>. At the S. Western extremity of
                    the Rock is a singular building which we have twice visited
                    &#8211; a chapel to the Virgin &#8211; (who is omnipresent in Portugal)
                    &#8211; on one of the stoney summits &#8211; far from any house. it is
                    the strangest mixture you can imagine of art &amp; nature &#8211;
                    you scarcely at approaching know what is rock &amp; what is
                    building. &amp; from the shape &amp; position of the chapel
                    itself it looks like the Ark left by the waters upon Mount
                    Ararat. <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> long flights of
                    steps lead up &amp; among the rocks are many rooms designed
                    to house the Pilgrims who frequent the place. a poor family
                    live below with the keys. From this spot the coast lies like
                    a map below you &#8211; to Cape Espichel, with the Tagus. Tis a
                    strange place &#8211; that catches every cloud &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> I have felt a tempest
                    there when there has been no wind below. in case of plague
                    it would be an excellent asylum. At the N. Western extremity
                    is a rock which we have not yet visited where people go to
                    see Fishermen run the risque of breaking their necks by
                    walking down a precipice. &#8211; I have said nothing to you of
                    the wild flowers so many &amp; so beautiful &#8211; purple
                    crocuses now cover the ground. nor of the flocks of goats
                    that morning &amp; evening pass our door. nor of the lemon
                    gardens of these hereafter. Our Lady of the Incarnation will
                    about fill the sheet. Every Church has a fraternity attached
                    to its patron Saint for the anniversary festival they beg
                    money, what is deficient the chief of the brotherhood
                    supplies. for 3 or four more days preceding the holy day,
                    these people parade the country with the church banner,
                    taking a longer or shorter circuit according to the
                    celebrity of the Saint, attacking the Sun with sky rockets,
                    &amp; merry-making all the way. Those of whom I now speak
                    travelled for five days. I saw their nature &#8211; they had among
                    them four <hi rend="ital">Angels on horseback</hi>, who as
                    they took leave of the Virgin at her church door, each
                    alternately addressed her, &amp; reminded her of all they
                    had been doing to her honour &amp; glory, &amp; requested to
                    continue the same devout spirit in <hi rend="ital">her</hi>
                    Portugueze which must infallibly render them <hi rend="ital">still</hi> invincible: this done the Angels went into
                    the Plaza &#8211; to see the fireworks. I regret much that I was
                    not present last year when the fireworks were singularly
                    ingenious as there were then &#8211; <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> saw
                    them two Lions who spit fire at each other, &amp; then they

                    employed in water-works &#8211; &amp; then they tacked about,
                    &amp; <hi rend="ital">bum</hi>barded each other with fire &#8211;
