        <p rend="indent1"> I think it would be well if I could get a play upon the stage.
                    this is mentioned not as a serious thought yet &#8211; but what would be one if you
                    encouraged it. you know with what rapidity I write &#8211; after chusing a subject it
                    would not employ me more than a month. this is the only profitable mode of
                    writing &#8211; here the profits are more than they ought to be, for every thing else
                    less. the profits of a play are from 2 to 700 pounds. do you think it a lottery
                    worth adventuring in? my name would forward it with a manager, &amp; might be
                    kept secret not to injure it with the Anti Jacobines &amp; English Orange men. I
                    think <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> a good play would succeed if
