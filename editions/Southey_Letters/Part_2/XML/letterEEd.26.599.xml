        <p rend="indent1"> The tone &amp; temper of your letter left me
                    in an uncomfortable mood. certainly I deserved it &#8211; but as
                    far as negligence deserves reproof so harsh &#8211; but indeed
                    Grosvenor you have been somewhat like the Scotch judge who
                    included all rape robbery <del rend="strikethrough">x</del>
                    murder &amp; horsestealing under the head of sedition<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly Robert
                        Macqueen, Lord Braxfield (1722-1799;
                        <title>DNB</title>), who in 1793-1794 presided over the
                        trials and sentencing, in Edinburgh, of radical
                        activists, including Thomas Muir (1765-1799;
                            <title>DNB</title>), Maurice Margarot (1745-1815;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and Joseph Gerrald (1763-1796;
                            <title>DNB</title>). Southey may have misunderstood
                        the fine details of Scottish law, under which rape,
                        robbery, murder and arson were all crimes that had to be
                        tried in the highest court.</note> &#8211; so have you
                    suspected negligence of cloaking a cold &amp; fickle &amp;
                    insincere heart. dear dear Grosvenor if by any magic of ear
                    you could hear how often your name passes my lips &#8211; or could
                    you see how often I see your figure in my walks &#8211; the
                    recollections &#8211; &amp; the wishes &#8211; but what are these? &#8211; an
                    hundred times should I have begun a letter if these had been
                    enough to fill it &#8211; if I could have sent you the exquisite
                    laugh when I again saw S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Augustine
                    &amp; his load<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably an in-joke dating back to Southey&#8217;s and
                        Bedford&#8217;s schooldays. &#8216;St Augustine&#8217; could refer to a
                        fellow ex-pupil at Westminster School (whose nickname
                        drew on either St Augustine of Hippo (354-430) or St
                        Augustine of Canterbury (d. 604)) or to an object
                        (possibly a painting) Southey and Bedford both
                        knew.</note> &#8211; or the smile when I read Leanders<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Leander&#8217;s&#8217; identity
                        is uncertain. He could be the musician Thomas Leander
                        (d. 1801), whose death at the age of 99 was reported in
                        the London newspapers; see, for example, the
                            <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 20 May 1801.
                        Alternatively, he may have been someone Southey and
                        Bedford had known at Westminster School. If so, the
                        nickname suggests he was a keen swimmer, like the
                        Leander of Greek legend who nightly swam the Hellespont
                        in order to visit his lover. The joke would have had
                        extra resonance as Bedford&#8217;s translation of Mus&#230;us (fl.
                        c. early 6th century), <title>The Loves of Hero and
                            Leander</title>, had appeared in 1797.</note> death
                    in the newspaper &#8211; but these are unwriteable things &#8211; the
                    gossip &amp; the playfulness &amp; the boyness &amp; the
                    happiness &#8211; I was about to write however &#8211; in conscience
                    &amp; truth I was &#8211; &amp; for an odd reason. I heard a
                    gentleman imitate Henderson<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly John Henderson (c. 1747-1785;
                            <title>DNB</title>), a famous actor who had spent
                        his early career in Bath.</note> &#8211; &amp; there was in
                    that imitation a decisiveness of pronunciation &#8211; a rolling
                    every syllable over the tongue, a force &amp; pressure of
                    lip &amp; of palate &#8211; that had my eyes been shut I could
                    have half believed you had been reading Shakespeare to me &#8211;
