</p>
<p>Dear Cottle,</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Well done good and faithful editor. I suspect that it is
                    fortunate for the edition of Chatterton, that its care has devolved upon
                    you.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The note with which you preface ‘Burgum’s Pedigree’<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and Joseph Cottle, <title>The Works of
                            Thomas Chatterton</title>, 3 vols (London, 1803), II, pp. 455-462. The
                        manuscript of this fake pedigree drawn up by Chatterton belonged to Cottle.
                        His initials, ‘J.C.’, were added to the end of his prefatory note on the
                        work. Southey made it clear in the unpaginated ‘Preface’ to vol. 1 that he
                        and Cottle were joint editors of the edition.</note> need not come to me, as
                    the M.S. is yours, whatever inferences may be drawn from it, will be by you. Add
                    your name at the end to give it the proper authority. I shall know how to say
                    enough, in the preface, about all other aiders and abetters, but it will not be
                    easy to mention such a ringleader as yourself in words of adequate
                    acknowledgment.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> What you have detected in the ‘Tournament’<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey and Joseph Cottle, <title>The Works of
                            Thomas Chatterton</title>, 3 vols (London, 1803), II, pp. [57]-82. Pages
                        [59]-[60] reprint the passage about the medieval foundation of St Mary
                        Redcliff, Bristol, that are omitted from the main text of ‘The
                        Tournament’. Cottle stated of this passage, ‘The following account is
                        transcribed from one of the parchment manuscripts produced by Chatterton’
                        (I, p. [59]).</note> I have also observed in Barrett,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Barrett (c. 1727-1789;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>History and Antiquities of the City
                            Bristol</title> (Bristol, 1789), p. 568.</note> in the omission of a
                    passage of bombast connected with one of the accounts of the Bristol churches.
                    Your copy of the ‘Tournament’ being in Chatterton’s own hand-writing is surely
                    the best authority. We are now of one opinion, that Chatterton and Rowley are
                    one.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I am glad to hear that you have discovered anything worth
                    printing in the British Museum. Doubtless, if you think it worth printing,
                    others will do the same, and it is not our fault, if it be dull or an imperfect
                    work. I transcribed page after page of what would have been worth little if
                    genuine, and not being genuine, is worth nothing. This refers only to the local
                    antiquities, and false deeds of gift, &amp;c. I made a catalogue, and left it
                    with you. Why say, ‘I hope you will not take it amiss.’ I am as ready to thank
                    you for supplying any negligence of mine, as any one else can be. I should have
                    wished for more engravings, but we have gone to the bounds of expense and
                    trouble, in this gratuitous, but pleasant effort to benefit the family of
                    Bristol’s most illustrious bard. Why did you not sign your notes? I can now only
                    say, that much, indeed most of the trouble has devolved on you. J. C. at the end
                    of each note, would have showed how much.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Most of Cottle’s editorial notes were not signed. For the exception, see
                        Southey and Joseph Cottle, <title>The Works of Thomas Chatterton</title>, 3
                        vols (London, 1803), II, pp. 455-462.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have seen Catcott.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">George Symes Catcott (1729-1802), pewterer and patron of Chatterton.</note>
                    Chatterton had written to Clayfield<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Michael Clayfield (dates unknown), a Bristol distiller and friend of
                        Chatterton.</note> that he meant to destroy himself. Clayfield called on
                    Barrett to communicate his uneasiness about the young lad. ‘Stay,’ said Barrett,
                    ‘and hear what he will say to me.’ Chatterton was sent for. Barrett talked to
                    him on the guilt and folly of suicide. Chatterton denied any intention of the
                    kind, or any conversation to that import. Clayfield came from the closet with
                    the letter in his hand, and asked, ‘Is not this your hand-writing?’ Chatterton
                    then, in a state of confusion, fell upon his knees, and heard in sullen silence,
                    the suitable remarks on his conduct.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">William Barrett (c. 1727-1789; <title>DNB</title>), <title>History and
                            Antiquities of the City Bristol</title> (Bristol, 1789), p. 646 also
                        relates this story.</note> God bless you.</p>
