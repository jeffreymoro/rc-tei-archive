        <p rend="indent1"> I have delayed writing to you far overlong. &amp; somewhat
                    ungratefully after all the trouble you have taken, the services you have
                    rendered &amp; the kindnesses you have bestowed upon <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>. I was vexed at his

                        enrolled at the University of Edinburgh in November 1803.</note> &#8211; sadly
                    vexed that his own conduct should have rendered inevitable a step which I knew
                    would produce considerable uneasiness &amp; embarrasment to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> as well as myself.
                    There is a want of feeling in his conduct which I cannot easily pardon, for he
                    knew how difficultly I live, &amp; how <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">his Uncle</ref> has always been
                    beggared by his family. but it was always in his nature &#8211; &amp; I fear will
                    never get out of it. he writes now as if he felt his situation &amp; of course I
                    say nothing to him of the past &#8211; nor shall I think of it except only as it does
                    make me fearful for the future. &#8211; Meantime a far worse business has taken place
                    with respect to my younger brother. I placed him in the navy, by his own choice
                    &amp; against my opinion &amp; advice. <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his mad Aunt</ref> has persuaded him to leave <del rend="strikethrough">him</del> it, &amp; he after most inexcusably taking this step has

                    of twenty pounds have been sent down to me here &#8211; which I have of course

                    accompany you there. It is a long way truly &#8211; but the place deserves a second
                    visit, &amp; would reclaim you from some of your Netherlandish heresies.</p>

                    interesting paper, but is now the only interesting one. Your ballad of the Old

                    in it. the conception has far more power of fancy than mine, mine<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;A Ballad, Shewing How An Old Woman Rode Double,

                        pp. [143]-160.</note> indeed is the mere narration of the &#8216;true story.&#8217; but
                    your language wants ease &amp; perspicuity, &amp; there is a mixture of the
                    ludicrous &amp; the shocking, which instead of amalgamating into the grotesque
                    has curdled &#8211; each remaining seperate &amp; yet polluted. Still it is a fine
                    poem, &amp; most evidently the work of an extraordinary man. I regret that the
                    poor Anthology<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Annual
                            Anthology</title> (1799) and (1800).</note> is discontinued, for it
                    would have given me great pleasure to have seen it in those types &amp; on that
