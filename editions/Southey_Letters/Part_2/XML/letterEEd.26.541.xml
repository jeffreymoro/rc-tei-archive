                    elapsed since I wrote to you &#8211; (or rather four!) &#8211; you will
                    expect that I have done much. in truth I have not been idle.

                    have hitherto only collected the knowledge of <hi rend="ital">what</hi> documents to search, &amp; <hi rend="ital">where</hi> to seek them. the public
                    library-books are not removeable, &amp; I, like all the

                    general facts clearly in my memory. I think a fair &amp;
                    accurate opinion of the chief personages, differing very
                    considerably from their received characters, &amp; a map of
                    the method to be pursued. the ground is well manured, &amp;
                    the seed is in. I speak the language, not indeed
                    grammatically, but fluently &amp; Portugueze from a familiar
                    voice, is almost as intelligible to me as English. I know
                    the progress of their language, step by step, &amp; have
                    written materials towards the literary history.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s proposed &#8216;literary

                    not sell &#8211; because I expect the poem will become popular,
                    &amp; of course productive. as the fat man said when his
                    starved shipmates were eating <hi rend="ital">his</hi> rump
                    stakes, I have a right to my share.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our house here stands in a lemon garden of
                    somewhat less than half an acre. its fruit usually sells for
                    twenty moidores. this year <del rend="strikethrough">only</del> &lt;owing&gt; to its failure it produced
                    only ten. these orchards you see are wonderfully productive,
                    but they require more attention than any English crops. they
                    are watered regularly: here there is a large tank in every
                    garden, whence the water is conveyed by little channels,
                    which the man conducts round the roots of every tree,
                    loosening the soil with a hoe. by this the leaves as they
                    fall are sooner mingled with the soil, &amp; afford a
                    constant manure. wages are as high as eighteen-pence a day,
                        <hi rend="ital">with</hi> wine. the price of bread of
                    course can differ little from its price in England, all
                    other provisions are rather dearer, in some respect owing to
                    actual scarcity, still more to the paper money, as every
                    tradesman will have his profit upon the discount. The Wine
                    owes its advance to the enormous taxes in England. As the
                    English tax it so highly, said the Government here, we will
                    tax it too, &amp; they laid on the very moderate duty of a
                    six-&amp;-thirty per pipe. if people will give 75 &#163; a pipe,
                    said the Porto Merchants, no doubt they will give 80, &amp;
                    we will have our profit. they therefore laid on the five,
                    &amp; are making fortunes. <hi rend="ital">More</hi> wine is
                    exported than before the new duties, because the excise to
                    which it is subject so materially checks the home-brewed.
                    still much is so manufactured &#8211; by an accident I happened to
                        <hi rend="ital">know</hi> that one merchant, made his
                    own Lisbon. the Law you allude to was made by Pombal,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sebastiao Jose de
                        Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal (1699&#8211;1782), Prime

                    recollection of it is not distinct enough to explain it now.
                    it certainly had some view to his own interest &#8211; but he had
                    always the welfare of Portugal at heart. Of all these things
                    I am promising accurate information. &#8211; No debtor is
                    imprisoned here. shame &#8211; shame to our laws! There is a Board
                    of Bankruptcy, an institution perhaps of unequalled
                    absurdity, so is it managed. any debtor who will surrender
                    all his effects to the board receives ten per cent. it has
                    been established about 30 years, <hi rend="ital">&amp; they

                    the money? there is a fund for lighting &amp; cleaning the

        <p rend="indent1"> Every officer, every soldier, after the

                    &#8211; The servant of an English Lady here was pressed for a
                    soldier, confined in the gaol with twenty others for a week
                    with no food but what their relations, if they had any,
                    brought them; &amp; what they could beg thro the grate. then
                    marched with their hands tied behind them to join the
                    regiment. Their discipline? five men last month robbed <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> of
                    his hat. some of them were soldiers. an officer past by just

                    coolly remarked, &#8220;people must live,&#8221; &amp; walked on. Is

                    getting their own trade which till lately was exclusively
                    managed by foreigners. their soldiers &amp; sailors have
                    washed off one coating of dirt since they have seen so many
                    English. But &#8211; the great colony must be seperated &#8211; it is
                    too vigorous a branch to hang on a rotten trunk &#8211; &amp; I

        <p rend="indent1"> The number of Monastics decreases. not from
                    any dearth of laziness or fanaticism, but because the
                    revenues are now not equal to the support of the original
                    number. Sometimes the Monks desert. in that case the

                    poor fellow at work in a Garden where for three months he
                    had been usefully employed, &amp; enjoying freedom. In an
                    evening ride lately, we passed a Portugueze party, as
                    riotously loud as a company of drunken Oxonians, they had a
