                        evidence in the previous letter to Tom Southey, 7
                        October 1800 (Letter 550), and the endorsement
                            &#8216;8th&#8217; suggests that
                        this second letter was not finished and sent until &#8216;Nov.
                        6&#8217;, the date given at the end. The editors have
                        therefore placed it after his letter to Tom Southey of 7
                        October 1800.</p>

                        Mafra by Sebastiao Jose de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of
                        Pombal (1699&#8211;1782; Prime Minister of Portugal

                        and the Princess had a child&#8217; (p. 543). These
                        &#8216;anecdotes&#8217; did not appear in the second edition of the

                    miles). A quinta of the Marquis Pombal on the way forms a
                    pleasing object from the olives which are planted to screen
                    the vines &#8211; the grey foliage &amp; the lively sunshine as it
                    were &#8211; of the vines contrasting very well, the quarries are
                    near whence the fine stones is dug for the Lisbon buildings.
                    two columns are now lying by the road which in the great
                    Pombals time were hewn for the Square at Lisbon, each of a
                    single stone. a foolish waste of labour only becoming
                    Barbarian pride for columns whose parts are put together
                    upon the spot look as well &amp; are in reality as firm.
                    there they lie &#8211; like the Square itself, &amp; the
                    half-finished streets, &amp; the missing kingdom &#8211; monuments
                    to the memory of Pombal. Two leagues on the way lies a place
                    called Cheleiras, &#8211; it may contain 50 scattered houses. &#8211; I
                    assuredly speak on the outside its number &#8211; but the place is
                    a <hi rend="ital">town</hi>, &amp; its inhabitants strangely
                    jealous of its title. Some lads lately passing thro enquired
                    the name of the <hi rend="ital">village</hi>; the man
                    replied angrily it was a town &#8211; &amp; as they, not believing
                    it, laughed at him &#8211; he raised an uproar &#8211; &amp; they were
                    actually in danger of being stoned by the offended townsmen.

                    valley in which Cheleiras stands would not be noticed for
                    beauty in a cultivated country, but here it appears
                    beautiful from the contrast of vine &amp; olive yards with
                    naked &amp; sun burnt hills. the people are in fault not the
                    climate. trees will grow where ever they will plant them &#8211;
                    but planting <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> indicates
                    fore-sight, &amp; beasts, &amp; savages &amp; Portugueze
                    never think of the future. a stream runs thro it, which in
                    the rainy season must be wide &amp; rapid, &#8211; this sweeps
                    down the soil from the mountains &amp; fertilizes the
                    bottom. a circuitous road round the hill top to avoid a
                    steep descent leads to Mafra. there is a bye path nearer by
                    two miles, which I advise none but a pedestrian to take. &#8211;
                    Mafra itself is a small place, the estalagem<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">An estalagem was a

                    rather better than is usual, &amp; not worse than a dirty
                    English alehouse. Saturday had been the day of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Francisco<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">St Francis of Assisi (1181&#8211;1226), founder

                    Franciscan communities &#8211; more especially here because the
                    Prince conceives himself under great obligation to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Francisco &amp; regularly attends his
                    festival at Mafra. of course the country was assembled there
                    &#8211; food &amp; fruit exposed for sale in the Plaza, &amp; all
                    the women equipped in all their finery. we went to mass &#8211;
                    the Prince followed the Host as it was carried round the
                    church &#8211; in the evening there was a procession &#8211; &amp; the
                    Prince paraded with it. &amp; thus the Regent of Portugal
                    passes his time &#8211; dangling after saints &amp; assisting at
                    puppet-shows &#8211; &amp; no doubt he laid down last night
                    thoroughly satisfied that he had done his duty!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The church &amp; convent &amp; Palace are one
                    vast building &#8211; whose front exhibits a strong &amp; trusty
                    Portugueze mixture of magnificence &amp; meanness. in part
                    it has never been faced with stone &#8211; a mud plaister is in
                    its place. the windows are not half glazed, red boards
                    filling up the work-house looking casements. the church is
                    beautiful &#8211; the library the finest book-room I ever saw,
                    &amp; well-stored &#8211; tho poor in English books. the friar who
                    accompanied us said it would be an excellent room to eat
                    &amp; drink in &amp; go to play afterwards &#8211; &#8220;&amp; if we
                    liked better to play in the dark &#8211; we might shut the
                    windows!&#8221; He heard the servant remark to me that there
                    &lt;were&gt; books enough for me to read there &#8211; &amp; asked
                    if I loved reading &#8211; &amp; I said he &#8211; love eating &amp;
                    drinking. honest Franciscan. he told us also that the dress
                    of their order was a barbarous dress. &amp; that dress did
                    not change the feelings. I suspect this man wishes he had
                    professed in France. A Portugueze of some family was a nun
                    in France: after the dissolution of the monasteries her
                    brother immediately engaged with <del rend="strikethrough">some</del> &lt;a&gt; Portugueze abbess to receive her,
                    &amp; wrote in all haste for the distressed nun &#8211; she wrote
                    in answer that she was &lt;much&gt; obliged to him &#8211; but she
                        <del rend="strikethrough">had</del> was married.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have a superb convent here &#8211; said I. yes
                    said the Monk, but it is a wretched place in winter. we
                    suffer so from the cold &#8211; the rheumatism kills many. we have
                    no fire in our cells &#8211; only in the kitchen. &#8211; such is Mafra
                    &#8211; a library whose books are never used, a palace with a mud
                    wall front &#8211; &amp; a royal convent inhabited by wretches who
                    loathe their situation! The Monks often desert, in that case
                    they are hunted like Deserters, &amp; punished if caught
                    with confinement &amp; flogging. I heard of one poor fellow
                    who was apprehended in a garden, where he had for three
                    months earned his living honestly &amp; usefully as a
                    labourer. They take the vows young &#8211; at fourteen. those who
                    are most stupidly devout may be satisfied with their life &#8211;
                    those who most abandoned in all vice may do well also. but a
                    man with any feeling, any conscience, any brains must be
                    miserable. The old men, whose necks are broken to their
                    yoke, whose feelings are all blunted, &amp; who are by their
                    rank or age exempt from some services, &amp; indulged with
                    some privileges &#8211; these men are happy enough. A literary man
                    would be well off &#8211; only that literature would open his
                    eyes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The library was not originally a part of the
                    foundation. the Franciscan order excludes all arts, all
                    science. no picture ought to profane their churches. but
                    when Pombal turned these beggarly vermin out of this Palace,
                    he removed to it the regular Canons of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Vincent.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Congregations of priests living according to the

                    well-educated. wealthy enough to support themselves, &amp;

                    Mafra a sort of college for the education of the young
                    Portugueze. the library was formed with this intention &#8211; in
                    what manner this plan was subverted by the present Prince
                    you may see in the old Letters<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    incredibly absurd as the story may appear it is undoubtedly
                    &amp; strictly true. &#8211; The Franciscan is by far the most
                    numerous monastic family. A Convent that subsists upon its
                    revenues must necessarily be limited in its numbers &#8211; but
                    every consecrated beggar gets more than enough for his own
                    support &#8211; so of course the more the merrier. Besides in an
                    order of gentlemen, &amp; such are the landed orders, the
                    recruits are taken from the higher ranks of society. but the
                    blackguard who would live without working, or escape serving

                        while the Dominicans were mainly opposed to the
                        idea.</note> &#8211; this subject reminds me of an affair
                    which makes some noise. the vicinity of a French emigrant
                    regiment to a nunnery has produced some natural
                    consequences. fourteen nuns are about to lie in &#8211; &amp; the
                    secret has not been kept. I am anxious to hear how it will
                    end but fear a dark catastrophe.</p>
