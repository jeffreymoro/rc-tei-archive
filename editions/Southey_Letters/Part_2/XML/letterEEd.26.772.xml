        <p rend="indent1"> Have you heard of the Duke of Kents<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Prince Edward, Duke
                        of Kent and Strathearn (1767-1820), fourth son of George
                        III. He was appointed Governor of Gibraltar in May 1802
                        with orders to restore military discipline. But his
                        measures provoked a mutiny by the Royal Fusiliers and
                        25th Regiment on 24 December 1802. The Duke was recalled
                        from his post in May 1803. Accounts of these events soon
                        appeared in British newspapers, e.g. <title>Derby

                    absolutely necessary to recall him. he was as offensive to
                    the officers as to the men. the man actually drilled old

        <p rend="indent1"> I begin to think there will be no war,
                    because there is so much preparation, they are as long about
                    it as if they were making peace. now war is usually made in
                    a hurry. if the business be settled what you say of the want
                    of hands makes it likely that you will be paid off again,
                    tis an even chance that you are back in time for the first
