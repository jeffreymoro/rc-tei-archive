                        1803.</note>

                        by Matthew Gregory Lewis (1775-1818;
                        <title>DNB</title>). The Battle of Flodden (1513), in
                        which an English army defeated the Scots, is mentioned
                        on pp. 345-346.</note> is flat, foolish, Matthewish,
                    Gregoryish, Lewisish. I have been obliged to coin
                    vituperative adjectives on purpose, the language not having
                    terms enough of adequate abuse. I suppose the word
                    Flodden-field entitled it to a place here. but the scene
                    might as well have been laid in El-dorado or Tothill Fields,
                    or the country of Prester John<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">El-dorado was a mythical kingdom, rich in
                        gold, in South America; Tothill Fields was an area of
                        Westminster, London, with a famous beargarden; Prester
                        John ruled over a legendary Kingdom in Africa.</note>
                    for any thing like costume which it possesses. It is odd
                    enough that almost every passage which <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> has quoted
                    from Froissart<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean
                        Froissart (c. 1337-c. 1405), <title>Chronicles</title>
                        (1369-1400). John Bourchier, 2nd Lord Berners (c.
                        1467-1533; <title>DNB</title>), produced a translation
                        in 1523-1525, and extensive quotations from a later
                        edition of this appeared in <title>Minstrelsy of the
                            Scottish Border</title> (London, 1803), II, pp.
                        382-388 and III, pp. 26, 29-40. Southey noted some
                        overlap between the extracts and the notes to

        <p rend="indent1"> In all these modern ballads there is a
                    modernism of thoughts &amp; language-turns, to me very
                    perceptible &amp; very unpleasant &#8211; the more so for its
                    mixture with modern words &#8211; polished steel &amp; rusty iron!
                    this is the case in all <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> Ballads.
