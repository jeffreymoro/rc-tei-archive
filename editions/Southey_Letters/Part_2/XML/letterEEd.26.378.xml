                    made magnificent bonfires. but it is possible that you may
                    essentially serve the relations I may leave, by editing what
                    you may find. it is my hope this summer to finish Madoc &#8211;

                    be that. however I should rather live to print it myself &#8211;
                    &amp; you see I take care to avoid the slightest danger of
                    injuring myself. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When I come to town in May it will be to keep
                    the two terms &#8211; &amp; for part of that time I can gladly be
                    your guest. I look on with little pleasure to a journey &#8211; my
                    time passes pleasurably in uniform employments, to-day like
                    yesterday, tomorrow like to-day. indisposition affects my
                    spirits but little, &amp; that only at night when it keeps
                    me waking &#8211; from the advance of spring, tonic medicines
                    &amp; the cold bath, I expect assistance, &amp; still more
                    from the sea &amp; the exercise to which the shore will
                    tempt me.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> This has been for some days delayed &#8211; I have
                    nothing to add except that I continue to be unwell &amp;
                    hope benefit from this thaw, which soaks thro every part of
                    our old house. I will write with the Poems which will be
                    finished tomorrow &#8211; so that by the end of the week I may
                    safely promise them. God bless you.</p>
