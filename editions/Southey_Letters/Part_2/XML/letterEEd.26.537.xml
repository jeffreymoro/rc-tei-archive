<p rend="indent1"> I write at a five minutes’ notice. The
                    unforeseen and unlucky departure of my only friend gives me
                    occasion for this letter, and opportunity to send it. It is

                        Congreve.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Congreve, the village in Staffordshire where Mary
                        Barker was living.</note> She is a woman of uncommon
                    talents, with whom we have been wandering over these
                    magnificent mountains, till she made the greatest enjoyment
                    of the place. I feel a heavier depression of spirits at
                    losing her than I have known since <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>. left me at

                    than I have long known, and till to-day, in uninterrupted

                    the labour of arrangement and translation, on my return. I
                    shall have the knowledge for the great work; and my
                    miscellaneous notes will certainly swell into a volume of
                    much odd and curious matter. Pray write to me. You know not
                    how I hunger and thirst for Bristol news. I long to be among
                    you. If I could bring this climate to Bristol, it would make
                    me a new being: but I am in utter solitude of all rational
                    society; in a state of mental famine, save that I feed on
                    rocks and woods, and the richest banquet nature can possibly
                    offer to her worshippers. God bless you.</p>

<label>P. S.</label>– * * * The zeal of the Methodists
                        and their itinerant preachers, has reprieved for half a
                        century the system; but you must be aware, that sooner
                        or later, the Church of England will absorb all those
                        sects that differ only in discipline. The comfortable
                        latitude that takes in the Calvinist and the Arminian,
                        must triumph. The Catholic system will perhaps, last the
                        longest; and bids fair to continue as a political
                        establishment, when all its professors shall laugh at
                        its absurdity. Destroy its monastic orders, and marry
                        the priests, and the rest is a pretty puppet-show, with
                        the idols, and the incense, and the polytheism, and the
                        pomp of paganism. God bless you.</p>
