        <p rend="indent1"> The plague, or the yellow fever, or the black vomit, has not yet

                    hundred miles from us, and kills five hundred a day at Seville! Contagious by
                    clothes or paper it cannot be, or certainly it would have been here. A man was
                    at <ref target="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</ref> who had recovered from the
                    disease, and escaped from Cadiz only seventeen days before he told the story in
                    a pot-house here. In Cadiz it might have been confined, because that city is
                    connected by a bridge with the main land; but once beyond that limit, and it
                    must take its course, &#8211; precautions are impossible; the only one in their power
                    they do not take, &#8211; that of suffering no boat to come from the opposite shore.

        <p rend="indent1"> Our weather is most delightful, &#8211; not a cloud, cool enough to
                    walk, and warm enough to sit still; purple evenings, and moonlight more distinct
                    than a November noon in London. We think of mounting jackasses and rambling some
                    two hundred miles in the country. I shall laugh to see <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> among the dirt and fleas, who
                    I suspect will be more amused with her than she will with them. She is going in
                    a few days to visit the nuns: they wanted to borrow some books of an English
                    woman, &#8211; &#8216;What book would you like?&#8217; said Miss Petre,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Miss Petre (or Petrie; first name and dates unknown) and her
                        sister became friends of the Southeys in Portugal. It is possible they were

                    interesting! and it leaves off in such an interesting part! We used to hate to
                    hear the bell for prayers while we were reading it.&#8217; And after a little pause
                    she went on: &#8216;and then it is such a <hi rend="ital">good</hi> book; we liked it,
                    because the characters are so <hi rend="ital">moral and virtuous</hi>.&#8217; By the

                        expedition to Holland in 1799. In 1801 he commanded a British expedition to

                    they will starve us if they come. What folly, to keep five-and-twenty thousand
                    men floating about so many months! horses and soldiers both dying for want of
