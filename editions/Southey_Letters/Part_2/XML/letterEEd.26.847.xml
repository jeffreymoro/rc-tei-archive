                    eight days after its date. so that tho this be the earliest
                    possible reply perhaps it may not arrive at Cork till after
                    your departure. This place is better suited for me than you
                    imagine &#8211; it tempts me to take far more exercise than I ever
                    took elsewhere, for we have the loveliest scenes possible
                    close at hand &#8211; &amp; I have therefore seldom or never felt
                    myself in stronger health. &amp; as for good &lt;spirits&gt;
                    be sure I have the outward &amp; visible sign, however it
