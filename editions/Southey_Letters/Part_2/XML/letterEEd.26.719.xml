        <p rend="indent1"> For sundry reasons my letter must be brief. because I am tired
                    &amp; my ink stand is dry &#8211; so that the pen is made dirty all the way up in
                    striving to wet it. if we see any thing better you shall speedily hear of it,
                    &amp; if not you shall hear of our goings on tho there be nothing better to send
                    you than what a mere book of the roads could give. We shall not I think exceed
                    the fortnight. I hope not &amp; believe not for I already wish myself at home,
                    &amp; am not quite easy about you &amp; the young one &#8211;</p>
