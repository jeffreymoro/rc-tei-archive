          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</ref> has caught fresh cold, &amp; the plunge has been a severe one. I was with her last week, &amp; left her some little better, &amp; her letters tell me she still gets better, but slowly &#8211; &amp; is very weak. I wrote to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> desiring she might go to Lisbon, where I <del rend="strikethrough">was</del> am confident the climate &amp; the quiet will restore her. In this case I must see her into the packet &#8211; &amp; <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> take her out of it. You know what an effect society produces upon her. I shall therefore as soon as possible remove to Bath &#8211; but unluckily <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is so unwell that I know not how to manage this. I know not how to remove her from Maurice<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly Joseph Maurice (fl. 1790s), a Bristol apothecary.</note> &amp; from this air.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> is in London &#8211; I have taken some steps between him &amp; <ref target="people.html#PembertonSophia">Sophia</ref> which will I believe make all things well again.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">	I shall want you Tom to work out six dozen of cyder now on the way to me. I wish now you were at <ref target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref> &#8211; there you would have friends &#8211; &amp; I might stand a chance of seeing you in May.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	It is probable that I shall manufacture another volume of poems for this winter: &amp; in that case it will be adviseable to have as many ballads as possible. if you hear any seamans superstition fit for such a purpose do communicate it. On finishing the corrections of Joan of Arc, which one evenings work will now conclude, the next job is to make the old 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book into a volume.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">This became Southey&#8217;s <title>Poems</title>, 2 vols (1799), which included a revised version of the ninth book of <title>Joan of Arc</title> (1796).</note> You shall have the Magazine volume.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a volume of the <title>Monthly Magazine</title>, or a selection of cuttings or transcripts of Southey&#8217;s prose and verse contributions to the periodical.</note>

Soon afterwards he returned to command the sloop <hi rend="ital">The Fly</hi>.</note> when I saw him had the temporary command of the Magicienne. the Fly sloop was his own vessel. has he lost this? he is a good natured man &#8211; &amp; farther this deponent saieth not.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	As for the invasion it must certainly be intended against Ireland<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">There were widespread rumours in the spring of 1798 that France was preparing to invade Britain. Ireland was on the verge of a rebellion led by the United Irishmen and the French fleet had attempted to land in support of the rebels in December 1796.</note> &#8211; a country which will I expect soon be seperated from England. Time will explain all &#8211; &amp; I am prepared to be a calm spectator of many changes. as for this country I think its liberties are destroyed, &amp; hope one day to chuse a better. to take away the liberty of the press was the last stroke.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The British government had been restricting the publication of radical opinions since 1792, particularly through the Treasonable Practices Act of 1795.</note>
