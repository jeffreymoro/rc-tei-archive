        <p rend="indent1"> Thanks to the Zephyrs Captain Yescombe<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Bayntun Yescombe (1765&#8211;1803), Captain of the Falmouth
                        Packet, <hi rend="ital">King George</hi>.</note> is still in the harbour,
                    &amp; we are in time to trust ourselves, &amp; live or die with King George.
                    this anxiety is over &amp; I have now only to watch the weathercock &amp; pray
                    for North Easters. &#8211; I left you in no enviable spirits. At Bristol, the
                    expectation of seeing you was an object of pleasurable hope &#8211; but to take leave
                    of the last friend before a voyage &#8211;! Falmouth too does not exhilirate me. I am
                    in the room where I met poor <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</ref>
                    &#8211; the last man with whom I shook hands before I left England &#8211; as I was stepping
                    into the boat to embark. Well! Well! you &amp; I tis to be hoped shall meet
                    again &#8211; &amp; if not &#8211; why we shall all meet in a better world. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But our journey. it was not quite adventureless after we left
                    Liskard. you witnessed our second battle of the four horses. rascals! the road
                    was good &#8211; very good &#8211; &amp; we did not walk up one hill, so slight were the
                    ascents. At Lostwithiel after breakfast we embarked &amp; got safely &#8211; half a
                    mile out of the town. then the horses stopt. not from fatigue, for they were
                    fresh. it was pure restiveness &#8211; a more vicious spirit never filled a
                    four-legged animal than was in the head &amp; the heels of our shaft horse. the
                    Postilion was as obstinate as the beast. &amp; while we below the hill, fought
                    him a full hour. at last <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    returned with Rundell<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Rundell (first name
                        and dates unknown) travelled to Portugal with Southey. He was possibly a
                        member of a prominent Bath family of silversmiths, jewellers and
                        surgeons.</note> to the inn &#8211; &amp; I remained by the chaise witnessing
                    another half hours battle. the horse conquered &#8211; another arrived &amp; we then
                    proceeded fair &amp; smoothly the rest of the way. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have passed the custom house &#8211; been on board &amp; chosen our
                    births, &amp; have now only to make poor Time as easy as he can be upon the rack
                    of expectation. We dine with our Captain tomorrow, if the wind continues. he is
                    very civil, &amp; I should judge of some talents. I wish he was rather less
                    civil &#8211; a little of the bear breed pleases me better. the packet carries ten
                    guns, twenty eight men. 180 tons. as you said we make the Cape. the Spanish
                    privateers are too small, the French too large &#8211; &amp; I go with little fear of
                    a bullet.</p>
