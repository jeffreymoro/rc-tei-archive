                    never suffered to play with his school-fellows &#8211; therefore
                    whenever he has been playing he comes home with a falshood
                    to excuse himself. he has been so much her companion that he
                    has all the forward tittle-tattle of an old superannuated
                    Master-of-the-Ceremonies. he has no diffidence, no sincerity

                    seem to have &lt;any&gt; effect in curing him of falshood.
                    Nothing can be so ruinous as living with a person whom he
                    does not love &amp; does not respect. I shall be in town the
