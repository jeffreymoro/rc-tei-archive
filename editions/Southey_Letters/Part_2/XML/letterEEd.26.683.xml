                    the Easter week in our channel. from one of these she received 30 &#163; a year, of
                    which his death deprives her &amp; she has nothing. the subscription is set on
                    foot to purchase her an annuity to that amount. 160 guineas have been raised
                    here &#8211; I collected twelve in London &#8211; you mention eight more. She is 62 &amp; it
                    is expected from the nature of the case that 14 per cent may be procured.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Mrs James (first name and dates unknown)
                        had lost her four sons in a shipwreck earlier in 1802. Southey and his
                        friends were attempting to raise money to invest in an annuity for
                        her.</note>
