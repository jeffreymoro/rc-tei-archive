                        (London, 1849&#8211;1850), IV, pp. 9-10, contains Southey&#8217;s
                        sketch for a novel with a hero called &#8216;Oliver Elton&#8217;. In

                        Oct. 10, 1801&#8217;, Southey described the story as
                        concerning &#8216;a man who, by practical wisdom and useful
                        knowledge, preserves himself from misery in difficult
                        circumstances, and makes and deserves his own
                        happiness.&#8217;</note> &#8211; the opposite moral to that stupid

                        stories in <title>Moral Tales for Young People</title>
                        (1801). It dealt with a young man of high principles but
                        no tact.</note> a plain tale how a young man by acting
                    consistently upon philosophical principles preserved himself
                    in difficult circumstances from what would else have been
                    utter misery &#8211; so much for my embryos &#8211; the play I suppose
                    must come to something &#8211; according to all laws of
                    motive.</p>

                    present is agreable &#8211; nor the prospect chearing. I wish my
