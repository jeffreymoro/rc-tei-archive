                    be killed. there is a poem called Gebir, of which I know not
                    whether my review be yet printed.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Savage Landor,
                            <title>Gebir</title> (1798), although the poem was
                        published anonymously. Southey&#8217;s review appeared in
                            <title>Critical Review</title>, 27 (September 1799),
                        29&#8211;39.</note> but in that review you will find some of
                    the most exquisite poetry in the language. the poem is such
                    as <ref target="people.html#GilbertWilliam">Gilbert</ref> if
                    he were only half as mad as he is, could write. I would go
                    an hundred miles to see the author. My other hard work now
                    is gutting the circulating libraries here, &amp; laying in a
                    good stock of notes &amp; materials, arranged in a way so
                    methodical that it would do honour to any old Batchelor.
                    Thalaba will be very rich in notes, &amp; rich in a <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> kind of beauty which I
                    had heretofore little used.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are some Johnobines in Exeter with whom
                    I have past some pleasant days. but the place is miserably
                    bigotted. would you believe that there are persons here who
                    &lt;shall&gt; always call the Americans the Rebels? &#8211; it is
                    the filthiest town in England. a gutter running down the
                    middle of every street &amp; lane &#8211; with a stream, <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> I assure you not <hi rend="ital">un</hi>necessary. We leave it on Monday
                    week, &amp; I shall rejoice to taste fresh air &amp; feel
                    settled. Exeter has however the very best collection of
                    books for sale of any place out of London. &amp; that made
                    by a man who some few years back was worth nothing.
