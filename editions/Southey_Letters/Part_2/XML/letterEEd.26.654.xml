                    &amp; I am in a comfortless state of health myself. partly
                    it is the climate &#8211; &amp; something I attribute to the
                    place, &amp; still more to the perpetual uneasiness on <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> account.
                    There came two letters from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> this week. one

                        Mother</ref> make herself unhappy on that account. I
                    have mastered my own mind so much that nothing ever
                    violently agitates or affects me &#8211; <del rend="strikethrough">but</del> &lt;&amp; yet&gt; every unpleasant
                    circumstance produces very mischievous effects. it comes
                    upon me at night &#8211; or whenever I am unemployed &#8211; exactly
                    like the story of Cortes &amp; the physic.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Hernan Cortes (1485-1547),

                        his symptoms. Before the medicine took effect, his camp
                        was attacked and Cortes fought alongside his men to
                        repel the attackers. Cortes&#8217;s activity delayed the
                        working of the medicine, which only took effect the
