        <p rend="indent1"> I suspect that my two letters directed to you
                    on the Chester Circuit as you desired, had not reached you
                    when you last wrote or there would have been no charge of
                    idleness in yours. &amp; now having acquitted myself of that
                    charge I proceed to the indictment of my ears. If the charge
                    had come from <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Dapple</ref> it would not have surprized me. one may
                    fancy him possessed of more than ordinary susceptibility of
                    ear; but for the irritability of yours I cannot so
                    satisfactorily account. I could heap authority upon
                    authority for using two very short syllables in blank verse
                    instead of one. they take up only the time of one. <hi rend="ital">Spirit</hi> in particular is repeatedly
                    placed as a monosyllable in Milton, &#8722; &amp; some of his ass
                    editors have attempted <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> to
                    print it as one &#8722; not feeling that the rapid pronunciation
                    of the two syllables does not lengthen the verse more than
                    the dilated sound of one. The other line you quote is still
                    less objectionable, because the old Ballad style requires
                    ruggedness &#8722; <del rend="strikethrough">&amp; because</del>
                    were this line rugged &#8722; &amp; secondly because the line
                    itself rattles over the tongue as smoothly as a curricle
                    upon <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> down turf. I have
                    made candles of infants fat &#8722; &amp; this kind of cadence is
                    repeatedly used in the Old Woman &amp; in the Parody.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;A Ballad Shewing How
