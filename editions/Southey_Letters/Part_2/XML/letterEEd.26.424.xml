        <p rend="indent1"> I write to you from Minehead. we arrived here
                    on Thursday night, I wish I could add after a pleasant
                    journey, but <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> state of health embittered it &amp; every
                    hour since. Maurice,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly Joseph Maurice (dates unknown), an apothecary,
                        based at St Michael&#8217;s Hill in Bristol.</note> under
                    whose medical care she is, thought the journey might benefit
                    her, but it has proved otherwise, &amp; unless a speedy
                    amendment take place, we must measure back our way to
                    Bristol, that she may have daily &amp; hourly advice if
                    needful. extreme debility, pains in the back &amp; bowels,
                    &amp; a wasting away, with sleeplessness, &amp; total want
                    of appetite, these are her complaints. I am little able to
                    attend to my usual employments. restless &amp; uneasy I turn
                    from one thing to another &amp; find myself unfitted for
                    all. Danger in her complaint there is not &#8211; there is no
                    organic affection no part diseased &#8211; but this debility &#8211;
                    this atrophy is alarming &#8211; I fall into gloomy day dreams;
                    &amp; dread the future while I wish the present were past.
                    her sister is with us. this is fortunate. I get out a
                    little, but the weather is cold &amp; stormy, &amp; I carry
                    with me no chearful thoughts.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is long since I have heard from you. I saw
                    the marriage of, I suppose, one of your sisters announced in
                    the papers.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">May&#8217;s
                        eldest sister, Maria-Emelia (dates unknown) had married
                        the Revd Jeremiah Awdry (1774-1859), Vicar of Felsted,
                        Essex, on 7 June 1799; see <title>The Oracle</title>, 19
                        June 1799.</note> at the time I wishd it had been your
                    own. but if the single man be never quite happy, neither can
                    he be ever quite otherwise. in sickness in poverty in death
                    the evil extends not beyond himself, he is prepared for all
                    the contingencies of life, &amp; its close is not embittered
                    by the grief of the survivors whose happiness or welfare
                    depends upon him. it has always been &lt;my wish&gt; to die
                    far from my friends. to crawl like a dog into some corner
                    &amp; expire unseen. I would neither give nor receive
                    unavailing pain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of the few books with me I am most engaged by
                    the Koran. it is dull &amp; full of repetitions. but there
                    is an interesting simplicity in the tenets it inculcates.
                    What was Mohammed?<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Muhammad (570&#8211;632), Prophet of Islam.</note>
                    self-deceived, or knowingly a deceiver? if an enthusiast,
                    the question again occurs wherein does real inspiration
                    differ from mistaken? this is a question that puzzles me &#8211;
                    because to the individual they are the same, &amp; both
                    effects equally proceed from the first impeller of all
                    motions, who must have ordained whatever he permits. in this
                    train of reasoning I suspect a fallacy, but cannot discover
                    it. but of Mohammed, &#8211; there is one fact which in my
                    judgement stamps the imposter &#8211; he made too free with the
                    wife of Zeid &#8211; &amp; very speedily had a verse of the Koran
                    revealed to allow him to marry her.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Muhammad&#8217;s adopted son, Zayd ibn Harithah
                        (588&#8211;629), was briefly married to Zaynab bint Jahsh.
                        After their divorce in 627, the Prophet married her,
                        contrary to tribal custom, which treated such a union as
                        incest. But Muhammad received a revelation
                            (<title>Qu&#8217;ran</title> 33: 37) that his marriage had
                        divine sanction.</note> the vice may be attributed to
                    his country &amp; constitution &#8211; but the dispensation was
                    the work of a scoundrel imposing upon fools. the huge &amp;
                    monstrous fables of Mohammedanism, his extravagant miracles
                    &amp; the Rabbinical tenets of his followers appear no where
                    in the written book. admit the inspiration of the writer,
                    &amp; there is nothing to shock belief. There is but one God
                    &#8211; this is the foundation &#8211; Mohammed is his prophet &#8211; this is
                    the superstructure. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> his followers must have been miserably
                    credulous. they gained a victory over the Koreish with very
                    inferiour numbers &amp; fought lustily for it. yet Mohammed
                    says, &amp; appeals to them for the truth of what he says,
                    that not they beat the Koreish but three thousand Angels won
                    the victory for them.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Battle of Badr in 624 was a key victory for
