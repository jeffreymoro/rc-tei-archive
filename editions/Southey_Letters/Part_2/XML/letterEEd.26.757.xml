                    specific objection. It is stated as an inconsistency that Thalaba should be
                    saved when his family was destroyed, because the stars appointed that hour for
                    his danger: &#8211; Okba began at the wrong end, he knew not which was the Destroyer,

                    main spring of Mohammeds religion &amp; therefore the principle always referred
                    to in the poem. the same objection is made to the declaration of Azrael, that
                    one must die Laila or Thalaba.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> I was more pleased than praise usually can please me, when you
                    told me that you liked Thalaba. because it is of approbation like yours that I
                    am most desirous. do not misunderstand this as a flattering compliment &#8211; it was
                    not as a critical reader to whose critical opinion I could defer that I looked
                    for your approbation. but as a man who would read with no nine-&amp;-thirty

                    if the poem itself pleased &lt;him&gt; would say so without caring whether it

                    Reviewer represents it, could it possibly have pleased you? &#8211; If gross

                    now I will avow myself confident enough to ask you if you know any other poem of
                    equal originality except the Faery Queen,<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Edmund Spenser (1552-1599; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The

        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to that part of the Review which relates to <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>, it has obviously no
                    relation whatever to Thalaba. nor can there be a stronger proof of want of
                    discernment, or want of candour, than in grouping together three men so
                    different in style as <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; myself under one head. the fault of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> has been <del rend="strikethrough">a</del> too-swelling diction. you who know his poems
                    know <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> whether they ought to be abused for
                    mean language. Of Thalaba the language rises &amp; falls with the subject, &amp;
                    is always in a high key. I wish you would read the Lyrical Ballads of <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>. some of them are
                    very faulty, but indeed I would risk my whole future fame on the assertion that
                    they will one &lt;day&gt; be regarded as the finest poems in our language. I
                    refer you particularly to The Brothers, a poem on Tintern Abbey, &amp; Michael.

                    &amp; indeed it is no light or easy study &#8211; in the same school &#8211; in the works of
