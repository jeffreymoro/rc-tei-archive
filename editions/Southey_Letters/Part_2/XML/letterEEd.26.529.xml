                    650000; altogether 2,225,000 inhabitants. The Portuguese
                    settlements in Asia contain 50,000 souls; those in Africa
                    80,000; Brazil 430,000: Madeira and Porto Santo 130,000; the
                    Azore Islands, 80,000; Cape Verde Islands, 16,000; the
                    Islands in the Sea of Guinea, 3000. The number of
                    inhabitants in all these colonies and foreign possessions
                    then is 799,000; and consequently, the sum total of all the
                    subjects of the king of Portugal 3,024,000.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This kingdom, according to the statements of
                    the Portuguese, is 150 Portuguese miles in length, and 40 in
                    breadth. According to <hi rend="ital">B&#252;sching</hi> its
                    length is no more than 75, and the breadth 35 common German
                        miles.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Anton
                        Friedrich Busching (1724&#8211;1793), <title>A New System of
                            Geography</title>, 6 vols (London, 1762), II, pp.
                        176, 214.</note> The whole superficial contents amount,
                    according to the best maps of the country, to 1875
                    geographical miles: so that there are only on an average
                    1190 inhabitants to every square mile. This low degree of
                    population is partly owing to the licentious manners of the
                    people, partly to the disproportionate number of the clergy
                    and religious of both sexes, of whom there are said to be
                    200,000. The population of Lisbon is by B&#252;sching estimated
                    at 150,000. Our author makes it only 100,000. The number of
                    inhabitants of the other cities of the kingdom he gives as
                    follows: Coimbra 12,000; Oporto 50,000; Setubal from 11 to
                    12,000; the district of Setubal including the city,
                    20,000.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> All the provinces of Portugal are not equally
                    fruitful. Oranges, which Estremadura, Alentejo and Algarve
                    produce in great abundance, and of an excellent quality, are
                    wholly wanting in the other provinces. On the other hand,
                    Entre Duero e Minho distinguishes itself by its
                    well-conducted agriculture. Traz los Montes is almost wholly
                    barren, and cultivated only on the banks of the rivers.
                    Beira produces all the necessaries of life: the sea that
                    washes its shores abounds with fish: its pastures feed
                    numerous herds of cattle; and it likewise furnishes honey
                    and salt. Estremadura is not less favoured by nature: its
                    wines are excellent. In Alentejo rice is produced. Algarve,
                    too, is well cultivated. Portugal would be more productive,
                    and the state of agriculture more flourishing, if the
                    English had not got possession of the corn-trade.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The land-forces of Portugal consist of 29
                    regiments of infantry, and 10 regiments of cavalry;
                    constituting altogether a military establishment of 30,000
                    men, under the command of 104 colonels, 150 majors, 42
                    generals, a field-marshall, a general of cavalry, a general
                    of artillery, 3 inspectors-general, 8 lieutenant-generals,
                    and 28 major-generals. Of the wretched state into which the
                    army has here sunken, many striking proofs occur; the truth
                    of which cannot well be doubted, as these facts are every
                    where asserted, and no where contradicted. The Portuguese
                    navy consists of 13 ships of the line, and 15 frigates. The
                    trading vessels amount to scarcely 100.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The public revenue of Portugal is, according
                    to some, 76, according to others 80, millions of French
                    livres: and the debts of the state had, in the time of our
                    traveller, already risen to the sum of 15 millions of
                    cruzados. The chief branch of the king&#8217;s revenue is that
                    drawn from the American mines; the yearly produce of which
                    is estimated at from 50 to 60 millions, of which however a
                    small proportion only comes into the royal exchequer. The
                    trade of Portugal is, it is well known, entirely in the
                    hands of the English.</p>
