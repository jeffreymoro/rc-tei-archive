                        4819E<lb />Unpublished.<lb />Dating note: Coleridge left for Devon on 20
                        December 1803 (he got only as far as Grasmere, where he was detained by
                        ill-health and bad weather until 14 January 1804); the new cargo of
                        reviewing Southey anticipates at the end of this letter arrived on 24
                        December 1803. Southey&#8217;s confirmation of Edith&#8217;s pregnancy in a letter to
                        Charles Danvers, 23 December 1803 (Letter 872), suggests that this letter to
                        Wynn was written at about the same time. The fragments of
                            <title>Madoc</title> are, therefore, a Christmas gift to Wynn, Southey&#8217;s
                        patron and dedicatee of the poem.</note>
        </head>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hoped to have sent you off the fair copy of Madoc as far as it
                    is corrected by this Xmas but my poor eyes have not had strength for that kind
                    of writing &#8211; &amp; indeed I begin to fear that they are seriously weakened &#8211; for
                    after any reading or writing, objects at the other end of the room become quite
                    indistinct. I must therefore send you such parts as will bear detaching. The
                    following will require pruning &amp; retouching in its minor parts &#8211; but on the
                    whole I think it will please you.</p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rend="indent3"> To Bardsey was the Lord of Ocean bound,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Bardsey the Holy Island, in whose soil</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> His great progenitors. He mounts the skiff,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her canvas swells before the breeze, the sea</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sings round her sparkling keel, &amp; soon the Lord</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> In unapproachable divinity</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Careerd, rejoicing in his fields of light,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> How beautiful beneath the bright blue sky</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The billows heave! one glowing green expanse,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Save where along the bending line of shore</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Such hue is thrown as when the peacocks neck</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Assumes its proudest tint of amethyst </l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Imbathd in emerald glory. All the flocks</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> It was a day that sent into the heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A summer feeling. Even the insect swarms,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> From their dark nooks &amp; coverts issued forth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For one day of existence more &amp; joy,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The solitary primrose on the bank</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Seemd now as tho it had no cause to mourn</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Its bleak autumnal birth, &#8211; the Rocks &amp; Shores</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And everlasting Mountains had put on</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The smile of that glad sunshine, they partook</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The universal blessing.</l>
          <l rend="indent6"> To this Isle</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Where his forefathers were consigned to dust</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Did Madoc come in natural piety,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And therefore had he made his coming known,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Ordering a solemn service for their souls.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Therefore for this the church that day was drest;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For this the Abbot in his alb arrayd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> At the high altar stood; for this infused</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sweet incense from the waving thuribule</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Chanted the solemn mass. And now on high</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Their mighty Mystery had been elevate,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And now around the graves the bretheren</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In long array proceed; each in his hand,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Tall as the staff of some wayfaring man</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Bears the brown taper, with their day-light flame</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> In shape &amp; size &amp; ghastly colouring</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The aweful Image hangs &#8211; his face like death,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The side-wound streaming, his extended palms</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Transpierced &amp; lacerate with the bodys weight</l>
