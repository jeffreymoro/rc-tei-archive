<p rend="indent1"> Thank God my dear Tom we did not know you
                    were wounded till your letter this evening informed us. As
                    you may suppose we were very uneasy at the first account of

                    yesterday removed our apprehension – we saw you honourably
                    mentioned, &amp; as no notice was taken of your being hurt
                    we concluded you were sound as well as safe.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>London

                        his bravery. Tom was not listed amongst the wounded
                        until 1 May; see the <title>London Gazette</title> for
                        that date. By 5 May the <title>Whitehall Evening
                            Post</title> was reporting that his wounds were not

<p rend="indent1"> I cannot tell you all I think &amp; feel on
                    this occasion. we hear of these things coldly – &amp; it is
                    not till they come home to us that we are sensible what they
                    are. I have never contemplated them with indifference –
