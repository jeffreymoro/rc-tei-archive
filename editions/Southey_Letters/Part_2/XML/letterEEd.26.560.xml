                    have been stopt for the good of the nation &amp; eaten at Falmouth by act of

                    but well-meaning to recommend him &#8211; &amp; as he seems to have discarded decency,
                    one may be allowed to avoid vulgar ignorance. &#8211; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>

                    finances miserably cripples me. I cannot afford to buy two or three very costly
                    works &#8211; which I must buy before any one page is in a state for publication. thus
                    will I at last lose much time &amp; labour in going over the old ground, when

                    prudence &#8211; , whether like your old wine it will increase in value by keeping &#8211;
                    or whether I shall publish as soon as possible not to lose the yearly profits
                    that may be expected. it would greatly delight me to give <ref target="people.html#DanversMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Danvers</ref> her

                    impudent that they astonish everybody. our vacant house has been opened &amp;
                    searched but there was nothing left portable enough to steal. last Monday two
                    boatmen stabbed a poor fellow by mistake &#8211; begged his pardon &amp; left him
                    dying. the robbers are usually soldiers &amp; in several instances Cadets &#8211;
