        <p>MS untraced; text is taken from Mac
                        Coll, who notes that in 1931 the MS was in the possession of the daughter of
                        Reverend Henry John Ferrall. He, in turn, had been given the MS by Miss
                        Warter, Southey&#8217;s granddaughter.  Previously  published: D. S. Mac Coll,

                        547.</p>

                    a Coffee house. Certainly I shall see you in town as I shall be there on May Day
                    and your business cannot be dispatchd before that. My dwelling place there is
                    not at all certain, but probably it will be with <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>. Unless I pass

                    walk thro Kent, or walk with you to Portsmouth and return by Chichester &amp;

                    more than it does me) will go to Press on Monday week. Contributions I have but

        <p rend="indent1"> It is not yet known here whether the war has certainly
                    recommenced in Germany or not.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The French
                        Army had advanced into Germany, but was decisively defeated by Austrian
                        forces at the Battle of Stockach on 25 March 1799.</note> If it has it can
                    only end in the utter subversion of the French or Imperial power. The new system
                    or the old one must fall. Europe must be devastated by the Revolutionary
                    whirlwind or poisoned by the plague-vapours of despotism and superstition and
                    persecution. We must either suffer under the Inquisition or the Revolutionary
                    Tribunal. This is the alternative to which our ministry are driving us &#8211; and
                    which only a change here and Peace can preserve us from. The Income bill<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The December 1798 budget had announced an
                        income tax for 1799 of 10% on incomes over &#163;200.</note> produces not a fifth
                    part of the years expences. The high aristocrats wince at it. What will they do
                    next year when perhaps the capital not the income will be tythed?</p>
