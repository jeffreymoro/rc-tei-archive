        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Amid the bustle &amp; everlasting motion in which of late I have
                    been engaged, I have neglected to apprize you of my goings on. partly indeed
                    trusting that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref> would
                    learn every thing worth knowing from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">his Mother</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Soon after my letter to him I joined my friends in Wales. we made
                    what was designed to be our first journey, which terminated at Llangedwin, <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref> abode. there I found a letter
                    inviting me to Ireland to become <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corrys</ref> private Secretary for one year. the term prudently limited
                    lest we should not suit each other. the proffered salary 400&#163; Irish. about 350
                    English, of which the half was specified as travelling expences. my
                    circumstances neither required nor allowed hesitation. So after touching at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> twice, on my road to &amp; from
                        <ref target="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</ref>, here I am in my scribe
                    capacity. My friend <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref>
                    acquaintance with <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Corry</ref> brought this
                    about. he is Secretary to Abbot.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles
                        Abbot, Lord Colchester (1757-1829; <title>DNB</title>), Chief Secretary for
                        Ireland 1801-1802, The Speaker 1802-1817.</note> &amp; his residence in <ref target="places.html#Dublin">Dublin</ref> will render my Irish half year very
                    endurable, as he is one of the <del rend="strikethrough">most</del> men whom I
                    most esteem for his whole moral &amp; intellectual character</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been a week in town, &amp; in that time have learnt
                    something. the civilities which already have been shown me discover how much I
                    have been abhorred for all that is valuable in my nature. such civilities excite
                    more contempt than anger &#8211; but they make me think more despicably of the world
                    than I would wish to do. As if this were a baptism that purified me of all
                    Jacobinical sins &#8211; a regeneration &#8211; &amp; the one congratulates me, &amp; the
                    other visits me, as if the author of Joan of Arc &amp; of Thalaba<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Joan of Arc</title> (1796) and (1798);
                            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> were made a great
                    man by scribing for the <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Irish Chancellor of
                        the Exchequer</ref>! &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I suppose my situation by all these symptoms to be a good one.
                    for a more ambitious man doubtless very desirable, tho the ladder is longer than
                    I design to climb. my principles &amp; habits are happily enough settled. My
                    objects in life are leisure to do nothing but write, &amp; competence to write
                    at leisure, &amp; my notions of competence do not exceed 300 a year. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Corry</ref> is a man
                    of gentle &amp; reconciling manners. fitter men for his purpose he doubtless
                    might have found in some respects &#8211; none more so in regularity &amp; dispatch.
                    the newspapers I hear are at me &#8211; I am used to flea bites, &amp; never scratch a
                    pimple to a sore.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Doubtless you have seen the British Critics Review of
                        Thalaba.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                            Critic</title>, 18 (September 1801), pp. 309-310. The review was
                        anonymous and a sustained attack on &#8216;this complete monument of vile and
                        depraved taste&#8217;.</note> it is so perfect in its kind that I have no doubt in
                    ascribing it to <ref target="people.html#CroftHerbert">Sir Herbert Croft</ref>.
                    the personality in the Monthly Review<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        240-251. The <title>Monthly</title> had already published a number of
                        unfriendly reviews of Southey&#8217;s other work, e.g. of <title>Poems</title>

                    the whisper. for never having seen the man I cannot have offended him. &#8211; I
                    recollect not whether or no I thanked you for your judgement of Thalaba, &amp;
                    acceded to its censure in great part. as far as I can judge by what reaches my
                    own ears the poem has been succesful to its fair deserts; that is in the
                    character it is gaining &#8211; of the sale I yet know nothing.</p>
