                    single person amounting to as much as his expences in a

                    travellers &#8211; the inferiour tradesman, those who now travel
                    on mules or horses. &#8211; Paper money also is introduced here &#8211;
                    a bad &amp; clumsy business which I do not understand enough
                    as yet to explain. all I know is this &#8211; that the government
                    set the example of discounting it &#8211; &amp; that about a
                    fortnight since they paid their sailors in it <hi rend="ital">at par</hi>. these men on exchanging the
                    paper found themselves twenty per cent losers, &amp; in
                    consequence a slight riot ensued &amp; they cried out
                    Liberty &amp; Bonaparte! this was soon quelled &amp; the
                    ringleaders secured. they have not however been punished.
                    This paper currency has brought forth its usual child &#8211;
                    forgery. a German of some respectability &amp; talents, has
