        <p rend="indent1"> In the vexation occasioned by one brother I have forgotten the
                    other, &amp; never replied to what you said concerning <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harrys</ref> support at Edinburgh.
                    To <del rend="strikethrough">say</del> what you say of continuing to remit him
                    his quarterly ten pounds I have only to thank you &amp; feel thankful that there
                    are such men as you in the world. you say you think it reasonable that <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> should pay his
                    necessary lecture expences &amp;c &amp; no farther, these however are
                    comparatively nothing &#8211; his board &amp; lodging make the main cost. You know how
                    I am circumstanced &#8211; I have no debt but to you &amp; that contracted wholly, or
                    almost wholly, on his account. My history<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s uncompleted &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217;.</note> will probably place me
                    in comparative affluence &#8211; but alas I must say of that with poor Cave,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Cave (1637-1713:

                    been beforehand &amp; left only fourteen pounds in the executors hands. Of
                    course I had only to send the statement to Lisbon &amp; there it ended. You may
                    remember that at that time I told you that <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> had directed <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref> to pay <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> fifty pounds yearly &#8211;
                    his income has been increased since that by the settlement of his Chancellors

                        Hereford Cathedral. This gave him the right to appoint the incumbent of the

                        lease of a church estate valued at between &#163;400-500 per annum. The lease
                        referred to is probably that which had been in dispute between Herbert Hill
                        and William Downes (dates unknown), a gentleman resident in Hereford. See

                    point &#8211; now that he knows where <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> is I am sure he will provide in part for his support. meantime
                    we must not let <del rend="strikethrough">him</del> &lt;<ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the boy</ref>&gt; suffer over-much,
                    a little sense of suffering will do him good &#8211; for his conduct has been very
                    thoughtless &amp; unfeeling. I have a letter from him written with a sufficient
                    conviction of his own folly &amp; its consequences. he had borrowed ten guineas
                    to pay the lecture fees, on a promise to repay them at Xmas &#8211; &amp; by Xmas the
                    six pounds remaining from his journey &#8211; &amp; the five he was to receive from
                    Norwich would be gone I conclude &#8211; so that your last supply was inevitably
                    mortgaged, &amp; he will be pennyless. <del rend="strikethrough">will a you
                        had</del> will you therefore remit him ten pounds more. As soon as the
                    Lectures are over I will send for him here &amp; keep him the summer months &#8211;
                    this will be some saving &#8211; &amp; in the winter, if I find him capable of it as
                    he ought to be, will turn over some reviewing to him that he may begin to live
                    by the sweat of his brow. Before the next quarter I think <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> will make some
                    arrangement for him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall be glad my dear friend when our correspondence can resume
                    its former pleasanter character &#8211; when I can tell you of my own goings on &amp;
                    give you my speculations, unmolested by these family cares which it is somewhat
                    hard to have inherited. parental responsibility requires parental love to
                    counterbalance it &#8211; but every duty rewards itself in the performance. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> is set off for

                    translations from Camoens are just come down for my censure. do you know any
                    thing of this Lord, or how he came to meddle with Portugueze? I should like his
                    book much if there were not discoverable in it a sort of moral which might be
                    called the Irish looseness. there is no passage to object to, but every where
                    this debauchery of feeling is implied. I have written to <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> for my own Camoens,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Luis Vaz de Camoens (1524-1580),
