        <p rend="indent1"> You ask me why the Devil rides on horseback &#8211;
                    &#8220;The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman. &amp; that would be
                    reason enough. but moreover the history doth aver that he
                    came on horseback for the Old Woman,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;A Ballad Shewing how an Old Woman
                        Rode Double and Who Rode Before Her&#8217; and an
                        accompanying engraving published in
                        <title>Poems</title>, 2 vols (Bristol, 1799), II, pp.
                        [143]-160.</note> &amp; rode before her, &amp; that the
                    colour of the horse was black. should I falsify the history
                    &amp; make Apollyon a pedestrian? besides Grosvenor,
                    Apollyon is cloven footed, &amp; I humbly conceive that a
                    biped &#8211; &amp; I never <del rend="strikethrough">I</del>
                    understood his damnable majesty to be otherwise &#8211; that a
                    biped I say would walk clumsily upon cloven feet. neither
                    hath Apollyon wings according to the best representations
                    &amp; indeed how should he? for were they of feathers like
                    the Angels &#8211; they would be burnt in the everlasting fire.
                    &amp; were they of leather like a bats they would be
                    shrivelled. I conclude therefore that wings he hath not. yet
                    do we find from sundry reputable authors &amp; divers
                    histories that he transporteth himself from place to place
                    with exceeding rapidity. now as he cannot walk fast or fly,
                    he must have some conveyance stage coaches to hell there are
                    none tho the road be much frequented. balloons would burst
                    at setting out, the air would be so <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> rarified by the heat. but
                    horses <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> he may have &amp;
                    of a particular breed. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am learned in D&#230;monology &amp; could say
                    more but this sufficeth. I should advise you not to copy the
                    ballad because the volume will soon be finished. I expect to
