                    I daily expect to know. It is a scheme of <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn&#8217;s</ref> to

                    My salary will be small &#8211; a very trifle; but after a few
                    years I look on to something better, and have fixed my mind
                    on a consulship. Now, if we go, you must join us as soon as
                    we are housed, and it will be marvellous if we regret
                    England. I shall have so little to do, that my time may be
                    considered as wholly my own: our joint amusements will
                    easily supply us with all expenses. So no more of the
                    Azores; for we will see the Great Turk, and visit Greece,
                    and walk up the Pyramids, and ride camels in Arabia. I have
                    dreamt of nothing else these five weeks. As yet every thing
                    is so uncertain, for I have received no letter since we
                    landed, that nothing can be said of our intermediate
                    movements. If we are not embarked too soon, we will set off
                    as early as possible for Cumberland, unless you should
                    think, as we do, that Mahomet had better come to the
