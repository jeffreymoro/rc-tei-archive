                        property in Richmond, Surrey, that Southey had been hoping to rent.</note> I
                    understood that if the fixtures were taken by appraisement the house was to
                    &lt;be&gt; let much lower, &amp; this he dwelt upon, but the &#163;40 was to be the
                    rent &#8211; including the fixtures. I am so sure of this that I expect you have used
                    the word by mistake instead of furniture.</p>

                    hope this is the outside. Xmas is the better time to commence from &#8211; &amp;
                    indeed the short time between that &amp; the end of November will be little more
                    than necessary to get out his furniture, get in mine, &amp; clean the house. the
                    number of rooms is enough &amp; to spare &#8211; but I suppose they are small &amp;
