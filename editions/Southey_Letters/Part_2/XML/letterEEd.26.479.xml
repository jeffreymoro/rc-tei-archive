                        eldest surviving child (also called Anna) was born in

                    have in England something like Beguinages<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In the middle ages,
                        communities of lay women, particularly popular in the
                        Low Countries. In the 14th century they were often
                        accused of heresy.</note> among the Moravians.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Moravian Church,
                        or Unity of the Brethren, derived from followers of the
                        religious reformer Jan Hus (1372&#8211;1415) in central Europe
                        in the 14th century. In the 1720s they experienced a
                        huge revival, spreading out from their new settlement at
                        Herrnhut in Germany, which emphasised communal living
                        and missionary work. A group settled in Bristol in 1755.
                        Southey was not quite correct in describing their
                        traditions. Moravians sometimes took decisions &#8216;by lot&#8217;,
                        but they did not determine marriages in this way. Nor
                        did they hold all property in common. Single men and
                        women did, however, live in separate communities, called
                        Choirs for Single Brethren and Sisters.</note> there is
                    an establishment of these sectaries at Bristol, of which it
                    will not be difficult to obtain an accurate account. they do
                    not marry by lot as in Germany, nor is the property of the
                    whole community common, but the young women live together
                    &amp; work as in the Beguinages. formerly I have been among
                    them, when I was quite a child, <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> worked muslins were fashionable, my father who
                    was a linen draper was often employed to get <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</del> &lt;them&gt; worked,

                    connections, who would effectually assist the first
                    foundation. will not the chief difficulty be in making
                    respectable an institution like a public charity? in the
                    pride of that class of female whom it would immediately
                    benefit? hence an objection perhaps insuperable, to any
                    common form of dress, &#8211; &amp; if they once dress ad libitum
                    &#8211; I am afraid but few of their earnings will go to the
                    booksellers. a library will form a very useful part of each
                    establishment, &amp; might perhaps be almost made from
                    donations.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The influence of women in society would make
                    an interesting chapter. among savages, as far as my reading
                    reaches, they are universally despised. hence, nothing to
                    humanize &amp; soften. the Spartan females &#8211; like the men of
                    Sparta, seem out of the limits of calculation, &#8211; with all
                    their Helot-enormity<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sparta depended on the agricultural produce of the
                        Helots, a group of unfree workers on the land. Southey
                        had once planned, but did not execute, a story on the
                        &#8216;oppressions exercised&#8217; upon them; see Robert Southey to
                        John May, 14 December 1798, Letter 360.</note> I
                    reverence the Spartans. the Athenians are not unlike the
                    modern French &#8211; save that we see no Aristotle &#8211; no Zeno, no
                        Aristides<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Zeno of
                        Citium (334&#8211;262 BC), founder of the Stoic school of
                        philosophy, which he taught at Athens from c. 300 BC;
                        Aristides &#8216;the Just&#8217; (530&#8211;468 BC), Athenian general and
                        statesman.</note> in France. French women seem to have
                    something of Aspasia<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Aspasia (470&#8211;400 BC) was the partner of the Athenian
                        statesman Pericles (495&#8211;429 BC). In the 19th century it
                        was assumed she was a courtesan; recent scholars are
                        less sure of her status.</note> about them, certainly
                    more sensual than our country women, they are withal more
                    intellectual. Jardine<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Jardine (d. 1799; <title>DNB</title>), author
                        of <title>Letters from Barbary, France, Spain, Portugal
                            &amp;c</title>. (1788). Southey met Jardine in
                        1795&#8211;1796 when he was consul in Galicia.</note> whom I
                    knew (the author of letters from Barbary Spain &amp;c.)
                    among his other whims had a quaint one for making cross
                    breeds to improve the human species; so he married a
                    Spaniard. but upon his theory I should think the best breed
                    would be from a French mother &amp; an English father. the
                    state of women in the East, is to my judgement, the main
                    cause why those countries are enslaved &amp; stationary or
                    rather retrogressive.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Polygamy enslaves necessarily &amp;
                    voluptualizes the women. so, except in perpetuating the
                    race, they do no good in society &#8211; &amp; one might doubt
                    whether they do any good by that &#8211; for better is a
                    wilderness than a Turkish province. in a harem vanity &amp;
                    envy will predominate, &amp; each seeks the caresses of the
                    husband to mortify the rest, &amp; the whole of female
                    education there is limited to instructions how to stimulate
                    desire. the perpetual excitements of polygamy probably
                    occasion at least half the libidinous habits attributed to
                    climate. early debility is the consequence, &amp; such men
                    must be slaves.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In Arabia the women are not ashamed to shew
                    their faces to a stranger &#8211; because they are not unchaste.
                    polygamy is not common, &amp; I believe the usual vice of
                    the East, almost unknown. voluptuousness is not the
                    characteristic of the Arabs &#8211; yet their climate is at least
                    as hot as any part of Persia.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Popular superstitions cannot have occasioned
                    the despotisms of the East. perhaps no religion is hostile
                    to improvement (except the Hindoo &#8211;) but every religious
                    establishment. a Mufti is no worse than an Archbishop &#8211;
                    &amp; certainly not so bad as the Pope. <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</del> Besides the religion
                    of Mohammed<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Muhammad
                        (570&#8211;632), Prophet of Islam. Baghdad in Mesoptomia and
                        Cordoba in Spain were centres of Muslim civilization,
                        especially in 9th&#8211;12th centuries. Zoroaster (11th/10th
                        century BC), Prophet and founder of Zoroastrianism, the
                        dominant religion in Persia until the Muslim conquest in
                        the 7th century.</note> is not in itself a barrier to
                    science &amp; civilization. look at Bagdat &amp; at Cordova.
                    In the system of Zoroaster I find much that is favourable to
                    imagination, &amp; little that is hostile to [six lines of
                    MS missing] inculcated morality. Am I then right in
                    referring the inferiority of the Orientals to polygamy as
                    the chief cause? China is a paradox in every thing &#8211; one
                    might as well draw an inference <del rend="strikethrough">from the</del> or an objection from the Man in the
                    Moon, who by the by looks of the Chinese breed by his broad
                    face &amp; his no eyebrows.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am materially better &#8211; yet I think a long
                    journey &amp; another climate will be materially beneficial
                    to my health. I have ever been a temperate man, &amp; since
                    I first perceived my usual state of health declining,
                    watchful of what affected me either well or otherwise. a
                    visit to the Western island would involve many voyages &#8211; now
                    at sea I am always emptying my bowels at the fore-door &#8211;,
                    &amp; loathe ship food too much to replenish them. I am I
                    believe secure of an English passport to France &#8211; if I like

                    of our halting places. I have a way open to procure the
                    French passport, &amp; what is more difficult, can settle my
