        <p>My dear Friend,</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do not from my long silence suspect me of
                    negligence. I have been ill&#8211;so reduced by a nervous fever as
                    neither to read nor write. On recovery I repaired to
                    Bristol, to seek relief for a worse complaint. My heart is
                    affected, nervously I <hi rend="ital">hope</hi>; but pain
                    there, and frequent irregularity in pulsation, convinced me
                    that I ought not to delay obtaining able advice.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My hexameters come to you in a ragged state.
                    I meant to have corrected them with care; but as they are,
                    they may serve as a specimen of what I can do in this way,
                    and it would be foolish to wait till I have leisure for
                    correcting. These liberties I have allowed myself&#8211; sometimes
                    a superfluous short syllable at the beginning&#8211;sometimes the
                    pyrrhic&#8211;sometimes the amphimacer. These licences must of
                    course be sparing; and what you will meet with would
                    probably have been altered in correction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> [Here follow 109 hexameter lines from the
                    intended poem on Mohammed,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Coleridge and Southey&#8217;s plan for a
                        jointly-written poem in hexameters on Muhammad
                        (570&#8211;632), the Prophet of Islam, did not make much
                        progress; see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John
                        Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1850), IV, pp.
                        18&#8211;20. A fragment by Southey was published posthumously
                        in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale</title>
                        (London, 1845), pp. 113&#8211;116; and 14 lines by Coleridge

                    the letter of the 1st September.] </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Remember, these are apprenticeship lines; but
                    I think that now I can wield the metre, and that it makes a
                    magnificent mouthful of sound.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your offer to house <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>; we
                    however wish once more to see him, and not quite to abandon
                    him in a land of strangers. I wish he were old enough to be
                    placed as pupil at the wonder-working Pneumatic

                    Bristol too soon, before our luminary had arisen. <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> is a

                    from perpetual experiments and the noisome fumes of the
                    laboratory.</p>

                    going through it; it looked to me like a Norwich-printed
                    book, but that you would have known. Your townsman&#8217;s &#8216;Cupid
                    and Psyche&#8217; is well done.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Hudson Gurney (1775&#8211;1864;

                    sketch of the idolatry of the Poles? I want to make an ode

                        Poland. According to different legends, she committed
                        suicide to save Poland from invasion, was a pagan
                        sacrifice, or lived a long and happy life. Southey did
                        not write an ode on this subject.</note>
