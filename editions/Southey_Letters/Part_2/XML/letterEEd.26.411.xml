                    me, but not till yesterday, not till after much expectation
                    &amp; frequent disappointment. so much the more welcome was
                    its arrival. I must not ask you to write again. I must not
                    expect it &#8211; but Edith can I help feeling something like
                    disappointment if no tidings of you should arrive before
                    Saturday next?</p>

                    confinement in London. On Monday night I shall be at home.

                    should not proceed with me, (&amp; I shall try to arrange it

                    in London. I will have a Library there, two or three boxes
                    of books, poems, romances, french &amp;c, such as will not
                    be most wanted in town, which would be heavy in carriage,

                    me, &amp; will endeavour to arrange it so, because it will
                    be more convenient, &amp; because I should so much rather be

                    marriage is for two persons to render each other happy.
                    Edith it often occurs to me what widely different beings we
                    are from what a single life would have rendered us. a single
                    man has no one to know him, thoroughly to understand him, at

                    known affection you would scarcely have understood your own

                    part of our identity. &#8211; never did I think of you more
                    frequently or more fondly than during this absence from
