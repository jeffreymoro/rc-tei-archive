                    again &#8211; but in fact I am not well enough to venture upon the
                    journey, &amp; it is better to err on the prudent side than
                    to venture too much. the season is against me &#8211; I want the
                    cold bath &#8211; I am relaxed &amp; incapable of much exertion.
                    if you were the physicians wig instead of the judges, you
                    should have a detail of all my physical feelings. </p>

                        famous for her prophecies, uttered under the influence
                        of vapours rising from the earth. Southey planned &#8211; but
                        did not execute &#8211; a drama based on an episode from

                        abduction of the Pythia by Echecrates the Thessalian;
