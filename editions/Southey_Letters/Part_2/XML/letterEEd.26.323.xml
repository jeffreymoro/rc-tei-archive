                    without regret that I shall leave this place. the pleasure I

                        Taylors</ref> society is such as we rarely meet with. I
                    find in him great genius &amp; still more uncommon
                    acquirements unsullied with one tincture of vanity. &amp;
                    his attentions to a blind mother are such as immediately
                    &amp; irresistibly to compel every one to love him. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> He has made me acquainted with the odes of
                        Klopstock<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Friedrich Klopstock (1724&#8211;1803), whose odes Taylor had
                        translated. Taylor later observed that &#8216;the odes of
                        Klopstock &#8230; constitute his strongest claims on fame&#8217;,

                    holy enthusiasm of Isaiah. I will show you the finest when
                    we meet in a literal version. it is the poem alluded to in
                    Werter when Charlotte during the thunder storm pronounces
                    the name of Klopstock.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Johann von Goethe (1749&#8211;1832), <title>Die

                        Charlotte thinks of Klopstock during a thunder storm

                        Sprowston Hall, the home of Sir Lambert Blackwell, Bt
                        (1732&#8211;1801), but there is no legend connected to the
                        early Christian martyr, St Cecilia, which is similar to
                        the scene depicted in the painting.</note> it is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cecilia when the heads of her parents
                    are presented to her. I am no judge of paintings &amp; speak
                    only as to the effect they produce upon me &#8211; but I never saw
                    any picture that so fettered the attention. her countenance
                    is raised towards heaven &#8211; &amp; expresses every thing that
                    is resigned &amp; holy, mingled with the anguish of human
