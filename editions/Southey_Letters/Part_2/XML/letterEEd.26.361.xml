                    many days, but my daily walk takes up so inconvenient a

                    calls. you do not know the comfort of slipping eight miles
                    thro the mire for the mere purpose of exercise with no other

                    as much as two threshers. Martin Luther saw one, a boy of
                    twelve years old, &amp; so confident was the Old Reformer
                    that he was a Killcrop, that he wrote to the Prince of
                    Anhalt whose subject the boy was, to say that if he was
                    Prince in that country, he would have the Killcrop thrown
                    into the river. but as the Prince did not take the hint,
                    Martin Luther desired the ostensible parents to pray to God
