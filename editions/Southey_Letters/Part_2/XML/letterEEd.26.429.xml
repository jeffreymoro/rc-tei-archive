                    recovering by degrees so slow as scarcely to be perceptible.
                    I know not whether her sister <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> was with us when I wrote.
                    as her recovery became more secure, when our time in the
                    lodgings was expired, we adopted this plan. she returned to
                        <ref target="places.html#Stowey">Stowey</ref> with her
                    sister. I walked to Ilfracombe to see if the place would
                    suit us, if on returning to <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> after the
                    few days absence I found her materially better we might
                    proceed, if not &#8211; we were on our way to Bristol. I found her
                    very much amended, &amp; her amendment daily continues. &#8211; I
                    now write from <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref>. he is going next week to visit his
                    friends at Ottery &#8211; we shall travel together, &amp; leaving
                    him &amp; his wife at Ottery proceed to Sidmouth. the
                    reconciliation between <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; myself which has taken place has
                    restored me one source of enjoyment. it was chiefly brought

                            Arabian Tale from an Unpublished Manuscript
                            [Vathek]</title> (London, 1786), pp. 196, 205, had
                        popularised the notion and used the specific phrase
                        &#8216;Pre-Adamite Kings&#8217;.</note> &#8211; a city of the Anakim<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Anakim were
                        descendents of Anak and aboriginal inhabitants of
                        Canaan, when the Israelites arrived there; see
                            <title>Numbers</title> 13: 32&#8211;33. The Bible can be
                        construed as suggesting the Anakim were giants.</note>
                    must have appeared so shapeless &amp; yet so like the ruins
                    of what had been shaped, after the waters of the flood <del rend="strikethrough">had</del> subsided. I ascended with
                    some toil the highest point. two large stones inclining on
                    each other formed a rude portal on the summit. here I laid
                    down &#8211; a little level platform &#8211; about two yards long &#8211; lay
                    before me &#8211; &amp; then the eye immediately fell upon the sea
                    &#8211; far very far below. I never felt the sublimity of solitude
                    before.</p>
