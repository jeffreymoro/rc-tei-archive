<p rend="indent1"> I am wearied of waiting for <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisles</ref> papers, of which I,
                    &amp; I suppose you have been in daily expectation. they will however when they
                    reach you, be more full than you expected, as I hear Saxon<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly Samuel Saxon (1757–1831), a London
                        architect who had designed a number of hospitals, including those at
                        Canterbury and Northampton. He may have produced designs for the
                        convalescent hospital that Southey, May and Carlisle were planning.</note>
                    is returned to town, with the plans, drawings &amp; estimates. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has been in Sussex &amp; is
                    now in Wales, so that we can get no sign post by his assistance till he
                    returns.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> On Tuesday I summoned up resolution, took leave of <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, &amp; set off on an
                    expedition to Wapping. in my way I discovered the Royalty Theatre.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royalty Theatre, Well Street, London; built
                        1786, it burned down in 1826.</note> I found the road so well as to venture
                    when returning to explore <del rend="strikethrough">the</del> new ways, in the
                    course of which I travelled thro the Minories, made Hounsditch point, &amp; bore

                        Southey’s uncle Herbert Hill. In 1795–1796, Southey had met her during his

                    she had heard of her fathers arrival, &amp; that the voyage had wonderfully
                    restored his health. Did I not tell you that a friend of <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref> was gone to Lisbon in a
                    hopeless state?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> he
                    went with Tonkin, &amp; died on board. his wife was with him, &amp; what made it
                    somewhat more distressing was that they were at sea nine days after his death,
                    &amp; threw the body overboard. I learnt this at Wapping. She seemed desirous of
                    preserving her knowledge of Portugueze &amp; regretted that she had no books in
                    that language. on which I promised to bring her Camoens.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Luis Vaz de Camoëns (c. 1524–1580), whose works included

<p rend="indent1"> You see by my date that we have removed. the apartments in which
                    we now are, are not such as we could wish to settle in, but they were the best
                    we could discover in our haste to remove, &amp; you know the old proverb ‘any
                    port in a storm.’</p>

                    kindnesses during my residence there, desired me to write an epitaph for an old
                    gentleman, whose life had been irreproachable &amp; happy.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘old gentleman’ was Biddlecombe’s
                        father-in-law, Richard White Lacy (dates unknown), of Yeovilton, Hampshire. Biddlecombe
                        married his daughter, Catherine (d. 1799), on 4 June 1798; see Robert
                        Southey to Thomas Southey, 15 January 1798, Letter 284.</note> I sent him
                    two that he might chuse. of course they will do for any good man of quiet life,
                    &amp; therefore not characteristic of one in particular. but they are short
