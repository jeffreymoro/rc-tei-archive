<salute>My dear friend</salute>

<p rend="indent1"> I have this instant received a letter from
                        <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Charles
                    Lamb</ref>. after mentioning your friendly offer to <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> of serving
                    him in the India house<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
<ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Charles Lamb</ref> was a clerk at the British East
                        India Company’s headquarters, East India House, in
                        Leadenhall Street. John May had offered to help <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles
                            Lloyd</ref> gain a similar post, as he was
                        acquainted with Sir Francis Baring (1740–1810;
                            <title>DNB</title>), a leading Director of the
                        Company, 1779–1810.</note> he proceeds thus. “It is not
                    likely that I shall ever put his goodness to the test on my
                    own account, for my prospects are very comfortable. But I
                    know a man, a young man<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> whom he could serve
                    thro the same channel, &amp; I think would be disposed to
                    serve, were he acquainted with his case. This poor fellow
                    (whom I know just enough of to vouch for his strict
                    integrity &amp; worth) has lost two or three employments
                    from illness which he cannot regain: he was once insane,
                    &amp; from the distressful uncertainty of his livelihood,
                    has reason to apprehend a return of that malady. he has been
                    for some time dependant on a woman, whose lodger he formerly
                    was, but who can ill afford to maintain him, &amp; I know
                    that on Xmas night last he actually walked about the streets
                    all night rather than accept of her bed which she offered
                    him, &amp; offerd herself to sleep in the kitchen; &amp;
                    that in consequence of that severe cold he is labouring
                    under a bilious disorder, besides a depression of spirits
                    which incapacitates him from exertion when he most needs it.
                    For Gods sake Southey if it does not go against you to ask
                    favours, do it now, ask it as for me – but do not do a
                    violence to your feelings, because he does not know of this
                    application, &amp; will suffer no disappointment.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> What I meant to say was this – there are in
                    the India house what are called Extra Clerks, not on the
                    establishment like me, but employed in Extra-businesses,
                    by-jobs. these get about £50 a year or rather more but never
                    rise. a Director can put in at any time a young man in this
                    office, &amp; it is by no means considered so great a favour
                    as making as establishd Clerk. he would think himself as
                    rich as an Emperor, if he could get such a certain
                    situation, &amp; be relieved from those disquietudes which I
                    do fear may one day bring back his distemper.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> You know <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del>
                        M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> May better than I do, but I know
                    enough to believe that he is a good man. he did make me that
                    offer I have mentioned, but you will perceive that such an
                    offer cannot authorize me in applying for another person.
                    But I cannot help writing to you on the subject, for the
                    young man is perpetually before my eyes, &amp; I should feel
                    it a crime not to strain all my petty interest to do him
                    service.”</p>
<p rend="indent6"> –––––</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have just time my dear friend to copy this
                    for to days post. these miserable tales make<del rend="strikethrough">s</del> one sick when without the
                    power of doing good. I should add if you wish to communicate
                    immediately with Lamb upon the subject a letter to the India
                    house will find him.</p>
