                        around the Cape of Good Hope, 1497-1498.</note> of which I shall give an
                    account somewhat different from what has hitherto been given, besides
                    discovering some curious corollaries in <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> way. Madoc is in the fifth book &#8211; I am about a new part &#8211; a

                    &amp; Saints, to which place I transfer the visit of Llewelyn.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Llewelyn &#8216;the Great&#8217; (c. 1173-1240;

                    poem is so far advanced &amp; I am in such a humour about it that the sooner I
                    look for subscribers the better &#8211; but this should be done without any public
                    advertisement till the very last. The price will be a guinea, for if it cannot
                    be printed in quarto for that (as probably it can) it shall in a smaller size,
                    that being the better price than 25 Shillings. so you may mention this where you
                    like it &#8211; &amp; the names you get will be so many motives for my good speed. If
                    I can dispose of three hundred copies thus my profits will be of some importance
                    &#8211; something more than the from-hand-to-mouth work at which I have so long
                    laboured.</p>

                    so infinite. a few days ago we had a very grand appearance which is not very
                    uncommon. between five &amp; six before the sun light was gone or the moon was
                    bright, the whole circle of the mountains became of one dead even blue. their
                    distances, their crags &amp; promontories, their dells &amp; hollows were all
                    utterly obliterated &#8211; you saw nothing but one smooth surface of blue, so smooth
                    that tho not transparent it seemed transvious &#8211; as tho it were a cloudy
                    substance &amp; you could have past thro it.</p>
