        <p rend="indent1"> I should not so immediately have answered
                    your letter but for what you have heard of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref> seperation.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Coleridge had arrived in London on 15
                        November 1801, leaving his family in <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. He
                        returned home in March 1802.</note> On this subject I
                    have been silent even towards you, nor did Edith ever
                    mention it to <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">her
                        sister Lovell</ref> &#8211; till he had made it the talk of
                    all his acquaintance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Something I saw myself. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> saw a
                    great deal. in no one instance was <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> ever to blame. sometimes he
                    has succeeded in provoking her by saying how <ref target="people.html#WordsworthDorothy">Dorothy
                        Wordsworth</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#WordsworthMary">Mary
                        Hutchinson</ref> would have acted towards him &#8211; by
                    eternally &amp; falsely praising them. &amp; he has
                    repeatedly before me failed. I never saw two tempers so
                    altered.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> He complains that she irritates him &amp;
                    makes him so ill that he can do nothing. this is a wretched
                    excuse for idleness. ill he assuredly is &amp; that illness
                    has perhaps so changed his temper. he is in debt to the
                    booksellers &#8211; to Johnson.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Johnson (1738&#8211;1809;

                    preys upon him &#8211; he has not resolution enough to clear it
                    off by exertion &#8211; letters come to him which he often will
                    not open &#8211; still they vex him &#8211; &amp; he can vent the
                    vexation only upon his wife. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has heard
                    him talk to her seriously of seperating &#8211; <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> never knows whether he

                    is about his wifes ill temper &#8211; in order that it may reach

            <ref target="people.html#WedgwoodThomas">Thomas
                            Wedgwood</ref> and his brother Josiah (1769-1843)
                        had paid Coleridge an annuity of &#163;150 since 1798.</note>
                    thro those channels. the worst trait is he has charged her
                    with extravagance in keeping two servants. she did keep two
                    servants for three months &#8211; that is from the time that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</ref> grew
                    so heavy that she could not nurse him all day, till he was
                    able to crawl about. &amp; during that time <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> himself was half his time in bed &amp;
                    had always a room &amp; fire to himself &#8211; &amp; you know
                    that in health he takes up the time of a servant in waiting
                    upon him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall write to him to say that as for
                    seperating that will be a good thing certainly for both. but
                    that he is very foolish &amp; very criminal in making his
                    domestic disputes the talk of all his acquaintance &#8211; men
                    whose system it is to <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del>
                    disallow all matrimonial connections. On this subject if he
                    will make it so publick I cannot be silent, because I know
                    from what I have seen &amp; heard that the fault is his. she
                        <del rend="strikethrough">did</del> told him once in

                    hearing that he had been a bad son, a bad brother, a bad
                    friend, &amp; a bad husband. it stung him &#8211; because it was
                    true.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the first years of their marriage she
                    often put him out of temper by urging him to write. this was
                    natural enough but very unwise, &amp; she at last left it
                    off as useless &amp; only productive of dissention. the fact
                    is no wife could suit <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &#8211; he is of all human beings the most

                    can state more clearly the situation of his things. this has
                    been a very troublesome business to you &amp; I am heartily
