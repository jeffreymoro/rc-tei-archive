                    from one job to another. you know I expect a parcel of books
                    when you went away they came &amp; I had immediately to kill
                    off one detachment.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">To review for the <title>Critical

                    came a bundle of French books, to be returned with all
                    possible speed. this was not only unexpected work, but
                    double work because all extracts were to be translated. well
                    &#8211; that I did &#8211; &amp; by that time the end of the month came
                    round &#8211; &amp; I am now busy upon English books again. what

                    voluntary employment. in a few days I hope to breathe a
                    little in leisure.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry it is low water with you &#8211; &amp;
                    that we cannot set you afloat. we are heavily laden &amp;
                    can with hard work barely keep above water. I have been
                    obliged to borrow. by &amp; by we shall do better but we are
                    just now at the worst &#8211; &amp; these cursed taxes<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The new income tax announced

        <p rend="indent1"> We had an odd circumstance happened to us on
                    Wednesday. just as we were beginning breakfast a well dressd
                    woman, in a silk gown, &amp; muff, entered the room. I am
                    come to take a little breakfast said she &#8211; down she laid her
                    muff, took a chair <del rend="strikethrough">&amp;
                        come</del> &amp; sat down by the fire. We thought she
                    was mad &#8211; but she lookd so stupid that we soon found that
                    was not the case. sure enough breakfast she did &#8211; I was
                    obliged then to go down &amp; laugh. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref>
                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    behaved very well, but <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margery</ref> could
                    not come into the room. When the good Lady had done she rose
                    &amp; askd what she had to pay? &#8211; nothing Maam said <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref>.
                    nothing? why how is this? &#8211; I don&#8217;t know how it is said <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref>
                    &amp; smiled, but so it is. What &#8211; do&#8217;nt you keep a public?
                    no indeed Maam &#8211; so we had half a hundred apologies, <del rend="strikethrough">&amp;</del> the servant had a
                    shilling, we had a good morning laugh for ourselves &amp; a
                    good story for our friends &amp; she had a very good
                    breakfast. I wish you had been here. </p>
