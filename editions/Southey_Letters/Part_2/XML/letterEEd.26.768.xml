                    Funds, &amp; must be sold out. He desires me to ask your
                    opinion how they are likely to be affected by the present
                    politics &#8211; for it is of some importance to him now to be
                    helped out in his judgement, &amp; we are all in the dark. I
                    look for war, but not for a consequent depression of the
                    Funds, because a good cause, &amp; the unanimity of all good
                    men will make us fall to in good spirits. But if you can
                    lend him a little light upon this subject he will be very
                    much obliged to you.</p>
