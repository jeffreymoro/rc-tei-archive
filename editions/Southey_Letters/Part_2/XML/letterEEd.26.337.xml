        <p rend="indent1"> I agree with you in what you remark of the
                    readiness of the wealthy to relieve distress, when they are
                    called upon for that purpose. what was meant to be expressed
                    in that little piece<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s &#8216;The Complaints of the Poor&#8217;, published
                        anonymously in the <title>Morning Post</title>, 29 June
                        1798. The title could be a deliberate echo of George
                        Dyer&#8217;s <title>The Complaints of the Poor People of
                            England</title> (1793).</note> was their inattention
                    to the state of the poor, even their ignorance of the
                    wretchedness so common in the lower classes. Laws may do
                    much &#8211; &amp; nothing I think would be more beneficial than
                    enforcing that part of the statute of Elizabeth<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The 1601 Act for the Relief
                        of the Poor. Theoretically, each parish was to have a
                        House of Industry, where the able-bodied poor could find
                        work, but few of these were built.</note> which makes it
                    the duty of the overseers to find employment for those who
                    want it: but Laws will not do every thing, &amp; their
                    operation to be effectual must be assisted by an active
                    benevolence on the part of the affluent, in which I think
                    they are generally deficient. Clergymen might do much &#8211;
                    &amp; medical men. &amp; it would be well if the parish
                    offices were accepted by persons more respectable &#8211; for I
                    believe they generally fall into the hands of the least
                    humane part of society. <del rend="strikethrough">xx people

                    attribute greatly to the variety of matter which it
