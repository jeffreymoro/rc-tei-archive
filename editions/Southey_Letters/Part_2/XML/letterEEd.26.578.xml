                        fallen because of the unwillingness of George III to

        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot argue against toleration. yet is
                    Popery in its nature so very damnable &amp; destructive a
                    system that I could not give a vote for its sufferance in
                    England. I could no more permit the existence of a monastic
                    establishment, than the human sacrifices of Mexican
                    idolatry. you say forbid their endowment &#8211; but the great
                    pillars of monkery are those orders that cannot be endowed &#8211;
                    the whole family of Franciscans. you say they are bound by
                    no law &amp; may come out of their convents. but they are
                    bound by their own law &#8211; by vows blasphemous to Almighty
                    God, &amp; treasonable to human nature &amp; civil society.
                    Of all Catholics the Irish are the most bigotted &amp;
                    bloody. <hi rend="ital">here</hi> we know them. there is
                    danger from the increase of Popery &#8211; your higher classes &#8211;
                    your middle class are turning infidels &#8211; true. but look at
                    the great body of the poor &#8211; with what a hunger &amp; thirst
                    for the marvellous they swallow every new dose of
                    superstition. observe the growth of methodism &#8211; perhaps more
                    nearly connected with popery than is generally imagined. I
                    have reason to believe they have arrived at <hi rend="ital">confession</hi> already. All I would prohibit should be
                    the monastic institutions. educate their priests in England.
                    tolerate the counter-poisons of Deism &amp; Atheism &#8211; the
                    great antidotes. these caustics are rooting out the cancer
                    here &amp; in Spain. they will indeed make a sore wound &#8211;
                    but not a deadly one.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have now travelled about a thousand miles
                    in Portugal, &amp; acquired a tolerably accurate knowledge

                    are yet unvisited. I wish much to remain another year &#8211; it

                    weeks longer. sooner I cannot well depart &#8211; nor for the

                    subtracted from the greater employment would render it a bad
                    speculation. for the same reason it will be more
                    advantageous to wait for the slow profits of the great work
                    than again to engage in reviewing &#8211; or write rhymes for the
                    Morning Post. these are things for after consideration. a
                    years labour will certainly fit a first quarto for the

                    far worse than even I myself imagined. No person can
                    possibly travel it without longing ardently to see a
                    revolution. the very soil is ruined. any man who wants to
                    turns another out of a farm has only to offer its needy Lord
                    a years rent in advance, for they are all at rack-rent. of
                    course no man can venture to improve land for a second years

                    almost exhausted them. I was lately at Faro &#8211; one of the
                    most flourishing cities in Portugal &amp; containing 20,000
                    inhabitants. the usual quantity of meat killed is one cow a
                    week. rarely two. the week I was there an unprecedented
                    circumstance occurred &#8211; one cow &amp; two heifers of which
                    &lt;one&gt; was killed lest it should die. nor must you
                    think of English beef &#8211; these are lean cattle &#8211; gristle
                    &amp; bones. mutton they will not eat but sometimes buy it
                    as goats flesh. beans &#8211; lupins &#8211; fish &#8211; these are the food
                    of the people. I have never seen 300 head of cattle in the
