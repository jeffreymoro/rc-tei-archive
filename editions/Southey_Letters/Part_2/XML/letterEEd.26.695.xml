        <p rend="indent1"> My last letter was travelling after you when

                    that the connection has ended<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was no longer in the employ of
                        the politician <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Isaac Corry</ref>.</note> I have at last discovered
                    why it began. I have found it out &#8211; as Vincent says.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Presumably a
                        catch-phrase of Southey&#8217;s old headmaster <ref target="people.html#VincentWilliam">William

                        to devastating effect when he discovered Southey&#8217;s
                        authorship in the fifth issue of the schoolboy magazine,
                            <title>The Flagellant</title>, 29 March 1792, of an
                        essay which claimed flogging was an invention of the
                        devil and parodied the Athanasian creed. The incident
                        had led to Southey&#8217;s expulsion from school.</note> I was
                    to be tutor to the son. but to be called Secretary to the
                    Father in order that the tutor might be paid by the
                    Treasury. a good specimen of ways &amp; means.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Committee of Ways and
                        Means was the House of Commons committee responsible for

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am curious to know what effect this will
                    produce upon many persons who have been officious in
                    civility wholly &amp; solely with reference to that
                    situation &amp; the prospects they thought it opened, &#8211;
                    &amp; who by that civility made me understand their former
                    neglect. the strangest mixture of feelings I perhaps ever
                    experienced was when Daunceys wife<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Mrs Dauncey was the daughter of Southey&#8217;s

                    to me &amp; gave me her hand &amp; burst into tears while
                    the neglect existed I thought nothing of it. my temper does
                    not lead me to unpleasant thoughts &#8211; like a fellow with a
                    stinking breath I did not know why my &lt;old&gt;
                    acquaintance kept at a distance. Is the secretarian

                        commander, whose exploits were the subject of numerous
                        poems and tales. Southey&#8217;s English translation and
                        compilation of three of these was published in 1808 as
