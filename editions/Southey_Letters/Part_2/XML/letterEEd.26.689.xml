                    annoyed by its dust. These are easily found at a greater distance from London,
                    &amp; with a difference of expence that has half staggered me &#8211; but the
                    advantages of being so near town I think upon a fair &amp; scrupulous

                        &#8216;Miss Burke&#8217; is identified as an Irishwoman called &#8216;Louisa Bourke&#8217;. While
                        the narrative refers to many real people and places, the story cannot be

                    friends to get her out &#8211; I believe by the regular way of dispensation. this

                    her death spread. She had contrived to get down a flight of steps from her
                    prison-room when Miss Power heard her. the night of her death Jane Power sate
                    with her very late seeing how dispirited she was &#8211; so late that the lamp went
                    out in the cloisters &amp; she lay down on a stone bench lest by mistake she
                    should enter a wrong cell in the dark. she went back at day light to tell her
                    friend how she had past the night &amp; found her with her throat cut. At that
                    sight she dropt &amp; was found in a fit in the door way by those who came to
                    bring their prisoner food. this is the story &#8211; <del rend="strikethrough">the

                    It should be remembered that there is no reason to suspect this as the invention
                    &amp; calumny of a renegade. Jane Power continues a Catholic &#8211; &amp; her friends
                    are procuring her a dispensation from Rome to quiet her conscience &amp; their
