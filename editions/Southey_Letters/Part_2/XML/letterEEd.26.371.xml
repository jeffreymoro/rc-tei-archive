        <p>The progress of Walters mind gives a fine opportunity for
                    dramatic effect. he is at first uneasy, made more
                    enthusiastic by Gilberts danger &amp; heroism, yet half
                    wishing he could be contented with ignorance. worked up by
                    Gilberts death to almost the desire of martyrdom. yielding
                    to affection &#8722; &amp; in the hour of danger <del rend="strikethrough">set</del> discovering the patient
                    courage of a Christian. I feel as tho I could develope this
                    character well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> For stage effect I see one fine place.
                    Gilbert is burnt opposite Marys house. she sees the
                    procession from her window &#8722; &amp; Walter attending his
                    friend. the Te Deum is heard. the light of the stake seen
                    thro the window &#8722; &amp; Mary &amp; the Confessor pray
                    together for the soul of the heretic. &#8722; Some effect may be
                    produced by Marys singing the evening hymn.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I expect a good dungeon scene between Gilbert
                    &amp; the Confessor. the Confessor intreating him not to
                    drive Walter to the stake &#8211; &amp; Gilbert inflexible in
                    braving death &amp; thinking it the duty of all who believe
                    in the reformation to profess it &amp; suffer, rather than
