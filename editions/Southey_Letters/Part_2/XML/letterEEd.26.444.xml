                    house. this is a business that suits me &#8211; &amp; I have not to pay for it.
                    nothing like a thorough reformation! radical improvements! the waters are
                    abating &amp; the country losing its dreariness &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> sublimity. the night of our arrival it was magnificent. I stood on
                    the bridge &#8211; you have heard me describe it. the water washes the walls of a
                    small but striking ruin. above stands the keep, with a huge rift in the side
                    thro which the sky is seen. behind, the church, one of the finest in the
                    Kingdom. to the right &amp; left the flats were inundated. the night was wild,
                    the moon rolling among driven clouds, &amp; the rush of the flood now mingled
                    with the <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> roar of the wind, &amp; now was
                    heard in its pauses. every object was distinct &amp; solemn &#8211; I cannot remember

                        Lane&#8217;s. Cosserat was a clergyman and scion of a prominent Exeter family of
                        merchants and lawyers. His father, Nathaniel Elias Cosserat, an ex-Mayor of
                        Exeter, had died in 1795, leaving a widow, Elizabeth, with whom Southey
                        dined.</note> at whose mothers I dined. you know the man &#8211; shallow,
                    good-natured, apparently a man who left off debauchery when he took orders. he
                    talked of Jackson, &amp; of his son<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">William Jackson, Exeter-based composer, musician and painter. He had nine
                        children. The identity of his son who committed suicide is unknown.</note>

                    with exultation &#8211; because Jackson is an Atheist! I do not like Jackson &#8211; he is
                    an aristocrat &amp; an old debauchee &#8211; but he has had some severe blows lately,

                    picture of a woman leaning on a harpsichord. the face was not beautiful &#8211; but in
                    the eyes there was an expression which spoke more than I had ever yet seen
                    picture speak &#8211; I should have expected quick feeling &amp; good sense from the
                    original &#8211; &amp; Keenan had painted her in a morning cap &amp; given such a home
                    appearance to her that I associated all domestic comforts with her. it was not
                    till the day or two before my departure that I learnt it was the portrait of

                        was later adopted by his much older half-brother, William Jackson
                        (1754&#8211;1842), who had made a fortune in the East India Company.</note> whom
                    Jackson had kept &#8211; &amp; not used kindly. she died in child-birth. it was said,
                    poisoned by herself, &amp; the report was countenanced by her previous state of
                    wretchedness. they tell me he suffered bitterly on this occasion. nobody likes
                    Jackson &#8211; but it is curious &#8211; I heard the reverend aristocrats object only to
                    his atheism &#8211; &amp; the democrats complained of his immorality.</p>
