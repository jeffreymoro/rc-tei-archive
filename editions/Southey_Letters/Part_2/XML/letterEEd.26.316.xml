                        (1775&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>) had enquired if Southey
                        would be willing to contribute his two gothic ballads to
                        an anthology. Although both &#8216;Lord William&#8217; and &#8216;Jasper&#8217;
                        had already appeared, unsigned, in the <title>Morning

                        wished to reserve them for his next collection, which
                        appeared in 1799. However, &#8216;Lord William&#8217; was eventually
                        included in Lewis&#8217;s <title>Tales of Wonder</title>, 2

                    as for un tres mauvais poem &#8211; I quoted the phrase of Millin,
                    because it was his condemnation for I had never read the

                        &#8216;regular Canon of St. Euverte&#8217;. The information was

                    extraordinary man, &amp; one to whom <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref> was
                    much attached. Out of his pay he <del rend="strikethrough">contr</del> sent his wife &amp; children 13 guineas a
                    year, &amp; all his hope was to be made Masters mate that he
                    might make it 20 &amp; then he said they should all be
                    happy. there are three children &#8211; all young. he thought his
                    family would be a protection for him &#8211; but he was prest into
                    the service. he had served in America, &amp; was one of
                    those men who volunteered once to carry dispatches in a boat
                    thro the French fleet. his understanding was strong tho
                    wholly uncultivated. he read with difficulty &amp;
                    comprehended what he read slowly &#8211; but when once he had
                    comprehended it, it was fixed for ever in his memory. I had
                    almost forgotten the <hi rend="ital">more</hi> striking
                    features of his life. he had seduced the woman whom he <del rend="strikethrough">aft</del> afterwards married &amp;
                    as he told <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>,
                    he could not bear his own reflections till he had married
                    her. they were very happy, &amp; he never spoke of her but
                    with the warmest affection. <del rend="strikethrough">th</del> what remains had better perhaps not be
                    mentioned. he was a Delegate in the <hi rend="ital">first</hi> mutiny, &amp; it <del rend="strikethrough">was</del> &lt;is&gt; said in the ship, that when a
                    paper was brought there which was the death warrant of the
                    officers he tore it to pieces. in the second he had nothing
                    to do &#8211; &amp; it is evident that his conduct must have
                    unexceptionable or he would not afterwards have been a
                        Midshipman.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">During the first naval mutiny at Spithead, 16&#8211;23 April
