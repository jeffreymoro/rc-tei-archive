                    their account of the story they make some blunders of negligence. they ask how

                    accusd me of plagiarism where they could have remembered the original hint; but

                    subtracted what quantity of capital remains. this is dishonest. for – for the
                    best parts of the poem &amp; the most striking incident of story no hint is to

<p rend="indent1"> The general question concerning my system &amp; taste is <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> &lt;one&gt; point at issue. the metre another.
                    these Gentlemen who say the metre of the Greek choruses is difficult to

                    last. else I should plead these choruses as precedent – &amp; the odes of
                        Stolberg<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Friedrich Leopold zu
                        Stolberg-Stolberg (1750-1819), prolific translator of Greek and Roman
                        poetry.</note> in German, &amp; the Ossian of Cesarotti<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Melchiore Cesarotti (1730-1808), <title>Poesie

                        581-584.</note> for the question of taste I shall enter into it when I

                        this intention in the preface to <title>Madoc</title> (1805).</note> I
                    believe we are both classical in our taste – but mine is of the Greek theirs of
                    the Latin school. I am for the plainness of Hesiod<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Hesiod (8th century BC), early Greek poet and author of
                            <title>Works and Days</title> and <title>Theogony</title>.</note> &amp;
                    of Homer, they for the richness &amp; ornaments of Virgil. they want periwigs
                    placed upon bald ideas. a narrative poem must have its connecting parts – it
                    cannot be all interest &amp; incident – no more than a picture all light – a
                    tragedy all pathos.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> It is ridiculous enough to be thus coupled with <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> a man who probably
                    despises my talents as much <del rend="strikethrough">xxxx</del> as the
                    Reviewers despise his, &amp; with whom perhaps I should hardly agree on any
                    possible subject. for what they say of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>, I only wish it
                    were prudent for <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>
                    to speak of them in return. ill as he employs his powers I am mistaken if his
                    character for talents is not every day rising. talents must find their level.
                    the moral world has its laws of gravitation.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The Review altogether is a good one &amp; will be better than any
                    London one because London Reviewers always know something of the Authors who
                    appear before them. &amp; this inevitably affects their judgement. I myself get
                    the worthless poems of some good natured person whom I know. I am aware of what
                    Review phrases go for &amp; contrive to give that person no pain – &amp; deal
                    out such milk &amp; water praise as will do no harm. to speak of smooth
                    versification – &amp; moral tendency &amp;c &amp;c – will take in some to buy
                    the book – which it serves as an emollient mixture for the patient. I have
                    rarely scratched without giving a plaister for it. except indeed where a fellow
                    puts a string of titles by his name – or such a heinous offender as Pybus<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Small Pybus (1766-1810), MP for
                        Dover 1790-1802. Author of <title>The Sovereign: Addressed to His Imperial
                            Highness, Paul, Emperour of All the Russias</title> (1800). There is no
                        evidence that Southey reviewed Pybus.</note> appears &amp; then my
                    Inquisitorship instead of <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxx</del> actually
                    burning him – only ties a few crackers to his tail.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did, when the occasion, merited, tie more than a ‘few
                        crackers’ to the ‘tail’ of an author. See, for example, his ferocious
                        appraisal of Peter Bayley Jr (c. 1778-1823; <title>DNB</title>),

<p rend="indent1"> But when any Scotchmans book shall come to be reviewed – then see
                    what the Edinburgh Critics will say. the first number smells already of
