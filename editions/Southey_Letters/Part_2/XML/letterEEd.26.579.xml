                    in case of famine &#8211; &amp; at Monchique there were fowls. we
                    did not steal them Grosvenor &#8211; they were bought &amp;
                    picked, &amp; spitted upon the small cane &#8211; spits Grosvenor

                    name common to both &#8211; that sight &#8211; the recollected hunger

                    turning by hand the cane &#8211; &amp; the savour of the roast
                    offering arose, &amp; the nose having the first fruits,
                    tantalized the mouth by its imperfect enjoyment. He also
                    smelt it, &amp; he came, perhaps led by curiosity &#8211; for a
                    roast fowl was a thing unheard of in the town &#8211; perhaps led
                    by the nose. not in the dancing bear way, but by the silken
                    threads which Nature has given Instinct to rein us. </p>

                    stood. In a Catholic &lt;country&gt; it may be doubted

                    &amp; I had reason for imagining that he was no Catholic,

                    there he stood &#8211; in a posture of attentive supplication &#8211;

                    gave him &#8211; no matter what. it was enough &#8211; it what became us
                    to bestow &amp; him to receive. there was no stipulation, it
                    was on our part a free gift &#8211; not a price. no return was
                    expected &#8211; indeed none was deserved. but he went home &amp;
                    his dreams were of the fowl, &amp; what a happiness it were
                    to live with an Englishman. &amp; the next morning he arose,
                    &amp; forsook all &amp; followed us.</p>

                    no one to whom I could communicate the discovery till I had
                    reached Lisbon, &amp; that was a laborious journey of nine
                    &lt;days&gt; going by Lagos, &amp; Sagres &amp; the Cape.
                    yet it occurred to me often with emotions of solitary
                    triumph, &amp; if my pleasure was increased by looking on to
                    your consequent mortification, impute it to the constitution
                    of our nature, not to the selfishness of the individual.
                    what one gains another must lose. certainly I am proud that
                    he is &#8211; for certainly he is &#8211; indeed, he is. &amp; on my

                    assents to it as the mind to a mathematical axiom, not from
