                            <title>Essay on the Military Policy and Institutions of the British Empire</title> (1810). It was sent to Southey for
                        review and Rickman provided him with information and briefing notes. His article was deemed by <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> to be ‘perfectly incorrect and dangerous’ with the result that the
                        version published in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 5 (May 1811), 403–457, was much altered by <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>, in consultation with Gifford and <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>; see <ref type="l" target="/reference/qr/index/10.html">Jonathan Cutmore, <title>The Quarterly Review Archive</title></ref>.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I know not who reviewed my History, tho I guess it was <ref target="people.html#HeberReginald">Reginald
                        Heber</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was correct, Heber was the reviewer of the first volume of the
                            <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810). The remainder of this paragraph is a response to the appraisal published in the
                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (November 1810), 454–474 (esp. 472; 474). Southey’s unusual words occurred in
                            <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810–1819), I, p. 187 ‘coronal’ instead of ‘coronet’; p. 122 ‘poitrals’;
                        pp. 89, 121 ‘tambour’; p. 381 ‘napery’; p. 133 ‘broads’.</note> He is wrong in complaining of the want of retrospective &amp;
                    generalizing views. The place for the former is at the close of the Dutch war, – for the latter at the conclusion of the work. All
                    the summary that this volume required or admitted exists in the latter half of the tenth chapter. He is wrong also in his
                    objection to the words which he specifies as unusual. A savage head-dress of feathers is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> a coronet, a
                    horses poitral is not a breast-plate, that word being appropriate to human armour. A tambour is not a drum, any more than a lute
                    is a fiddle. Napery is used for napkins &amp; table cloths, because it implies either or both. <hi rend="ital">Broad<del>s</del></hi> is a Norfolk word for the spread of a river into a sheet of water, – which spread being neither lake
                    nor lagoon requires a specific word to express it; &amp; for the vocabulary of natural scenery we must necessarily go to the
                    provinces, the metropolitan dialect being always deficient on such subjects.</p><p rend="indent1"> The D of York has been a great nuisance to me, but thank God I have done with him.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763–1827; <title>DNB</title>), had been forced to resign
                        as commander-in-chief of the British army in the wake of allegations that he had profited from office trafficking. After a
                        lengthy investigation, the charges were found to be unproven. It had, however, become apparent that his former mistress Mary
                        Anne Clarke (c. 1776–1852; <title>DNB</title>) had received money from individuals keen for her to use her influence with the
                        Duke, and that the Duke himself had known of her actions. For Southey’s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 109–301.</note> Can you send me the Reports upon the E. India Patronage?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809 a Select Committee of the House of Commons had enquired into how the East India Company appointed its
                        officers.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> The rhymes in Kehama whether visible or invisible cost nothing, – &amp; as for any expenditure of brain upon the
                    whole poem, – you must apply to that your own simily of the Fakeer.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In a letter of 31
                        December 1810, Rickman had criticised the ‘unseen … <hi rend="ital">unfelt</hi> Rhymes’ of <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>.
                        He had in addition advised Southey to ‘husband his resources’ like ‘a Faquir Penitent …. who cultivates the Muscles … &amp;
                        who holds his arms over his head, or elsewhere, till he cannot move the wasted Limb at all’ (Huntington Library MS).</note> It
                    is only so much cultivation of brain, &amp; at no loss of time, for, as I believe you know, every line of &lt;it&gt; that has been
                    written within the last seven years was written before breakfast, in hours &amp; half-hours created for the purpose. By writing
                    poetry I have got very little money directly, almost none, – but indirectly I have got by it every thing; – it has made for me
                    what reputation I possess, it has given me a command &amp; faculty of language unattainable by any other discipline, – &amp; you
                    may look upon my poetry as the John the Baptist<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Prophet who foretold the coming of

                        Sinclair’s (1754–1835; <title>DNB</title>) <title>Observations on the Report of the Bullion Committee</title> (1810), in
                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (November 1810), 534–535. The review had noted the Berkshire custom that a widow of a
                        customary tenant would forfeit her lifetime rights to her husband’s copyhold land if she remarried or was discovered to be
                        ‘unchaste’. She could reclaim her rights by riding into court seated backwards ‘upon a black ram, with his tail in her hand’
                        and reciting a doggerel verse. The review suggested that Sinclair atone for his errors on the bullion question by entering the
                        lobby at Whitehall in the same fashion. Sinclair was an opponent of restoring the link between the currency and gold
                        bullion.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> How unlucky this illness of the King<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> George III (1738–1820; King of the
