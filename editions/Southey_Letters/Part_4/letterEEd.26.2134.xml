                    if it prove succesful will essentially enrich my store of historical documents. I have just learnt by accident that there is in
                    High Holborn a set of Muratori’s great collection of the Italian Historians which <del>being</del> wanting one volume, is on that
                    account offered for sale at a very low price, – some five or six pounds for a collection which I should joyfully purchase at the
                    price of five &amp; twenty were it entire.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lodovico Antonio Muratori (1672–1750). Southey
                        hoped that May could buy <title>Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, Ab. Anno 500 Ad Annum 1500</title>, 36 vols (1723–70). In fact,
                        May purchased Muratori’s <title>Annali d’Italia dal Principio dell’era Volgare sino all’anno 1750</title> (1786); no. 1894 in
                        the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, though this lacked the first volume; see Southey to John May, 16 September 1812,
                        Letter 2145. Southey later did manage to obtain a copy of <title>Rerum Italicarum Scriptores</title>, no. 1922 in the sale
                        catalogue of his library.</note> The booksellers name is said to be Laycock.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably
                        connected to the London booksellers William (fl. 1805) and J. (fl. 1822) Laycock.</note> I do not remember any such name, –
                    but if you do not spy the name, it will not be the work of many minutes to find the shop which contains this treasure, &amp; I
                    shall be greatly obliged if you will purchase it for me &amp; give the bookseller directions to send it me by waggon. The three
                    great works which I want are the Acta Sanctorum,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Acta Sanctorum</title>
                        (1643–1940) is a 68-volume life of all the Christian saints, arranged in order of their feast-days. Southey acquired a
                        53-volume set (up to 1794) in 1818, no. 207 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> the Byzantine Historians,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Corpus Byzantiae Historiae</title> (1645–1711), a 42-volume edition of Byzantine historians, published by a team of
                        French scholars. Southey later acquired a new 40-volume edition of these works, from 1828, no. 740 in the sale catalogue of
                        his library.</note> &amp; Muratori, &amp; it would be folly not to purchase this set, notwithstanding it is imperfect, when
                        <del>that</del> the loss of one volume so materially diminishes the price without in any degree lessening the utility of the
                    other volumes. I should think &lt;it at&gt; half a guinea a volume a cheap purchase.</p><p rend="indent1"> My article upon the French Revolutionists in the last Quarterly is a good deal the worse for the mutilations which
                    as usual it has undergone, but which I regard less than I do the alteration of one single word.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> A review of <title>Biographie Moderne: Lives of Remarkable Characters who have Distinguished themselves from

                        complain.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Quarterly Review</title>, 7 (June 1812), 413. The ‘pilot’ was the late Prime Minister William Pitt, the Younger
                        (1759–1806; Prime Minister 1783–1801, 1804–1806; <title>DNB</title>).</note> – The most ill judged omission is of the

                        (1760–1797).</note> for corrupting the soldiers, – <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> no doubt has
                    imagined that it would be dangerous to publish this, but he is grievously mistaken if he supposes that those persons from whom he
                    would wish to conceal it are ignorant of such obvious means, – &amp; if they were, the Quarterly Review is the last work which
                    would fall into their hands. Had the article been printed <del>as it was</del> entire it would have done me credit; the hint with
                    which it concludes relates to an essay upon the state of the lower classes which I have undertaken for the next number. <note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Quarterly Review</title>, 7 (June 1812), 438: ‘We may hereafter take occasion to shew
                        in what manner the state of society in this country is favourable to their [British radicals’] nefarious prospects, and what
                        are the means by which they may be best counteracted’. The article in question, on the poor, appeared in <title>Quarterly
                            Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319–356. </note></p><p rend="indent1"> I had yesterday the pleasure of cutting open the third volume of the Register,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title> (1812).</note> – a greater delight to me than it will be to any other
                    person, I dare be sworn. This is the last &amp; greatest of an authors pleasure. The London proprietors urge an alteration in the
                    plan &amp; want it to be brought into a single volume like the London Registers: the <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn ">Edinburgh proprietors</ref> very wisely negative this proposal &amp; determine to carry it on upon the present plan, even if
                    they are left to themselves. The change I think would have been fatal to the work. Whether perseverance many preserve &lt;it&gt;
                    is very doubtful. I go to work however upon the year 1811 with unabated good will. – You will find in the second part of this new
                    volume a life of Lope de Aguirre, written as a chapter of the History of Brazil, but cut out as an excrescence for which room
                    could not be afforded.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The conquistador Lope de Aguirre (c. 1510–1561), notorious for his
                        final expedition down the Amazon in search of El Dorado. Southey’s account of these events appeared in <title>Edinburgh Annual
                            Register, for 1810</title>, 3.2 (1812), [i]–l. It was republished as <title>The Expedition of Orsua; and the Crimes of
                            Aguirre</title> (1821).</note> The narrative is an extraordinary piece of history, whole &amp; entire in itself, &amp; so
                    little connected with that of any other country, that it would appear equally as an excrescence in the history of Peru or of
                    Venezuela, as in that of Brazil. So it is as well where it is as it could be any where else, – &amp; I am about thirty guineas
                    richer than if it had appeared in its intended place. – The ballad of the Inch-cape Rock<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title>, 3.2 (1812), lxxxiv–lxxxvi.</note> in the same volume is mine also, –
                    written many years ago, when I was Poet to the Morning Post.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> It had been published in the

                    do I know who has been tinkering it. It lay uncorrected among my papers because I had no use for it, unless I should ever publish
                    a miscellaneous volume of verse.</p><p rend="indent1"> The life of Nelson<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Life of Nelson</title>, published by Murray in 1813.</note> is sent to the press, I expect the first proof every
