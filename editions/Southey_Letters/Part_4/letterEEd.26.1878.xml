                        Gregres were idols of wood and clay in West Africa.</note> – &amp; as far as it goes it is clear &amp; convincing. It gives

                    events resulting from it. – Yet Grosvenor (between ourselves) it has not impressed me with any respect for the talents of the

                    feeling that no two books could better exemplify the difference between a politician &amp; a statesman, – the politician

                    the statesman drawing his inferences from the whole history of the world, &amp; reasoning from maxims which are of eternal
                    application. A man may write as a politician, &amp; yet prove himself a statesman at the same time. – Burke<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The politician and polemicist Edmund Burke (1729/30–1797; <title>DNB</title>).</note> did so, but
                    precisely in proportion as he sacrificed the higher character to the inferior one, did he diminish the permanent value of his

                        blame it too much;/ Who, born for the universe, narrow’d his mind,/ And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.’</note>
