                    which was the decisive struggle between the Red &amp; White races in

                        Metacom’s Rebellion, 1675–1676. An armed conflict between English colonists
                        and the native American inhabitants of New England. Southey’s poem was
                        ‘Oliver Newman’, left incomplete at his death.</note> Nothing can
                        <del>xxxx</del> be more anti-heroic than <del>the</del> stiff puritan
                    manners, but these may be kept sufficiently out of sight, &amp; <del>the</del>
                    high puritan principles are fine elements to work with: One of my main
                    characters is a Quaker, – an (ideal) son of Goffe the Regicide.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Goffe (c. 1605–c. 1679;
                            <title>DNB</title>), soldier and one of the signatories of the death
                        warrant of Charles I (1600–1649; King of Great Britain 1625–1649;
                            <title>DNB</title>). Condemned to death at the Restoration in 1660, he
                        fled to New England and died there under an assumed name. In Southey’s poem,
                        he was the father of Oliver Newman.</note> A good deal of original
                    conception is floating in my mind, &amp; there is no subject in which my own
                    favourite feelings &amp; opinions could be so fully displayed. It has taken
                    strong hold on me, &amp; if my mind were but made up as to the fittest form of
                    metre I should probably begin it forth with, &amp; continue it &amp; Pelayo<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The early incarnation of what became

                    – having the one to turn to when the way was not plain before me in the other.
                    Hexameters would not be more difficult than any other metre, but they will not
                    allow of the necessary transition from the narrative to the dramatic style,
                    without too great a discrepance. The manner of Kehama<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), which made
                        use of unrhymed, irregular stanzas.</note> would not do, – the narrative is
                    pitched too high, – the dialogue too low, for a poem in which the
                        <del>action</del> &lt;circumstances&gt; will be less elevated than the
                    passion. For this very reason rhyme I fear is required.</p><p rend="indent4"> ____</p><p rend="indent1"> You have done wonder with C Julian.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Count Julian: A Tragedy</title> (1812).</note>
                    1200 lines in a week was the <del>largest run</del> quickest run (in sailors

                    impatient to see this tragedy. As for the line of which I asked an explanation,
                    – the meaning flashd upon me, as I thought it would, ten <del>x</del> minutes
                    after the letter was gone, &amp; I be-blockheaded myself according to my
                    deserts. Of managers I have as great an abhorrence as you have – but if your
                    play be fitted for representation, – which is supposing it to have certain vices
                    that it is not likely to have, &amp; to be without certain merits which are sure
                    to be found there, – means <del>b</del> may be devised of putting it into their
                    hands, in that sort of cavalier manner which is likely to have more effect with
