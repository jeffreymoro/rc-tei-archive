                        27 August 1810, Letter 1803.</note> Published it must be, – because it is sinful to keep such actions in oblivion. Examples of

                    times the greater is their efficacy. – But I hesitate about its present publication, lest it should possibly prove injurious to

                        After his resignation it was suggested that undue pressure had been put on him by ministers. For Southey’s account see

                        Southey was highly critical of Moore’s conduct, accusing him, for example, of forming ‘unjust and self-paralysing prejudices
                        against the Spanish people’, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 479.</note> But if you get into

                    That article upon Methodism would have been better if I could have written freely concerning the remedies. This the temper of the
                    Review prevented. I did hint at restoring the old order of Catechists<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the Catholic
