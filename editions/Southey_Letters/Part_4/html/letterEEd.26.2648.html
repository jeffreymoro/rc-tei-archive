               <p>On Monday the 21<sup>st</sup> of August, a bonfire was kindled on the summit of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> in honour of the Battle of Waterloo, the capture of Paris, &amp; the surrender of Buonaparte.
                  It is the first time that any public rejoicings had ever been held on so elevated
                  a spot; &amp; the effect was sublime to a degree which none can imagine but those who
                  witnessed it. A great concourse of people were assembled; inhabitants of the country
                  who had never performed the ascent before, going up on this occasion. &lt;Large&gt; Balls
                  of tow &amp; turpentine were set on fire &amp; rolled down the steep &lt;side of the&gt; mountain.
                  Rule Britannia, &amp; God Save the King were sung in full chorus round the bonfire, accompanied
                  by various wind instruments. The healths of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent</a>, the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke of Wellington</a>, &amp; Prince Blucher

               will send it there. Oh that you had been with us! The night was very fine, &amp; the track
               of fire which we left behind us from our streaming flambeaux, had a strange appearance
               at the town. The scene on the summit itself was one of the wildest imaginable, <span class="strikethrough">the xxxxxxxx</span> we formed a wide circle round the finest bonfire I ever saw, or probably ever shall
               see, &amp; round us was a circle of utter darkness; – for our light fairly put out the

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There was a wicked accident occurred. Water you know is by no means a plentiful article

               <p>Now that you may laugh at me if not with me, I will tell you two of my jokes on the

                  </div> which the over-godly would be shocked at. The other was a pun which comprehended in
                  itself all that is execrable in punning. The battle I saw had been fought at a Waterloo
                  (lieu) – or a place of water, &amp; in honour of it <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> should be converted into a Punchloo – that is to say a place of Punch.</p>
