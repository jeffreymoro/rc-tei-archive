               <p>Will this find you in the vale of Ewias, or have you taken wing for Bath, which in
                  spite of thirty years labour toward spoiling it, still remains the pleasantest city
                  in the kingdom? I remember it when it ended at the crescent, &amp; there was not a house
                  on Bath-wick side of the river. The longest walk in which I was ever indulged was
                  to a cottage – <span class="ital">the</span> cottage we called it, in a little orchard, a sweet sequesterd spot at that time, –
                  my ne plus ultra

                  </div> No doubt it is now overgrown with streets, <span class="strikethrough">on ei</span> But the only alteration which I cannot forgive is the abominable one of converting
                  the South Parade into one side of a square, &amp; thus destroying the finest thing of
                  its kind, – perhaps the only thing in the world. I have often walked upon that terrace
                  by moonlight, after the play, my head full of the heroics which I had been imbibing,
                  – &amp; perhaps I am at this day the better for those moonlight walks.</p>

                  be full of fine things. The Spaniards will never forgive me for making their Virgin
