            <p class="indent1">The books which you announced in your note of December 8<sup>th</sup>. have not arrived, &amp; as the parcels have come to hand which were sent off from London
               one about a week later, the other on the 4<sup>th</sup> of January, – it is advisable that enquiry should be made concerning it. I on my
               part, have made all the enquiry which can be made here, – at the wrong end.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Among the many impositions which are practised by the carriers there is one which
                  may perhaps account for the delay in this case. Goods which are sent to <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;a&gt; waggon office, if there happen to be no direct communication from that office
                  to the place in question, are sent as far as that concern reaches, &amp; forwarded by
                  the slow &amp; circuitous course of canals, – thus doubling the length of time upon the
                  way, without affecting any reduction in the price of conveyance. A parcel sent from
                  the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BullandMouth">Bull &amp; Mouth</a> reaches <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> in ten days; – others have often been from three to five weeks. Very probably this
                  which I have so long been looking for is lying in some canal-warehouse, – waiting
                  for a thaw. It is rather unfortunate, as I suppose the copy-right pamphletts
