                           not survive) and Dusautoy in turn wrote back. Southey’s letter of 12 February 1813

                  </div> The best road to the bar is through the university, where honours of every kind will
                  be within your reach. With proper conduct you would obtain a fellowship by the time
                  you were one or two and twenty, and this would enable you to establish yourself in
                  one profession or another, at your own choice.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This course is as desirable for your intellectual as for your worldly advancement.
                  Your mind would then have time and opportunity to ripen, and bring forth its fruits
                  in due season. God forbid that they should either be forced or blighted! A young man
                  cannot support himself by literary exertions, however great his talents and his industry.
                  Woe be to the youthful poet who sets out upon his pilgrimage to the temple of fame
                  with nothing but hope for his viaticum! There is the Slough of Despond, and the Hill
                  of Difficulty, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death upon the way.

               <p>To be called to the bar you must be five years a member of one of the inns of court;
                  but if you have a university degree, three will suffice. Men who during this course
                  look to their talents for support usually write for newspapers or reviews: the former
                  is destructively laborious, and sends many poor fellows prematurely to the grave;
                  for the latter branch of employment there are always too many applicants. I began
                  it at the age of four and twenty, which was long before I was fit for it.

            <p class="indent1">The stage, indeed, is a lottery where there is more chance of a prize; but there is
               an evil attending success in that direction which I can distinctly see, though you
               perhaps may not be persuaded of it. The young man who produces a successful play is
               usually the dupe of his own success; and being satisfied with producing an immediate
               and ephemeral effect, looks for nothing beyond it. You must aim at something more.
               I think your path is plain. Success at the university is not exclusively a thing of
               chance or favour; you are certain of it if you deserve it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When you have considered this with your friends, tell me the result, and rest assured
                  that my endeavours to forward your wishes in this, or in any other course which you
                  may think proper to pursue, shall be given with as much sincerity as this advice;
                  meantime read Greek, and write as many verses as you please.
