                  </div> I believe you care as little about poetry as I do about metaphysics, tho perhaps you
                  may not think it quite so mischievous; nevertheless as you have thought it worth while
                  to read a criticism upon this poem, written by a man who is equally incapable of understanding
                  either its merits or defects, you may possibly think it worth while to read the work
                  itself. The criticism in question I have not yet seen, but in speaking thus of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</a> (who is the writer) I speak from a full knowledge of his incapacity, acquired in conversation
                  with him, and proved to be well founded by every criticism which he has ever ventured
                  to write upon a volume of verses.

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>With regard to the metre of the poem, to which your remark applies, it may as well
                  be tried by algebra as by music. There is no connection between an ear for music and
                  an ear for metre. I have heard musicians of established character for eminence in
                  their own science, mis-read and mis-repeat verses, so as to show that they are not
                  only utterly ignorant of metre, but utterly insensible of it, – a thing which I should
                  not have believed, had it not fallen under my own observation. Do not fancy I am dealing
                  in paradoxes if I add that the power of versification is distinct from a genius for
                  poetry. The best versifier of our age was poor Mrs. Robinson,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> who wrote nonsense. I have known many men whose fluency in versifying was marvellous,
                  and who were yet vile writers, and on the other hand I could show you works full of
                  thought and feeling and poetical power, which have all been wasted because the authors
                  were incapable of writing verse.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Now whatever may be the merits or demerits of the matter of my poems, the subject
                  of metre is one which I most assuredly understand. No Druid had ever from his earliest
                  youth a greater aptitude for versifying, few have ever practised it more, and still
                  fewer have ever studied it so much.

                  </div> Men who are not poets, will criticise the metre of a single line, which in most cases
                  is just as absurd as it would be to pass sentence upon its meaning, apart from the
                  context.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The whole paragraph in which it is placed ought to be taken into view, before the
               relation of (perhaps) a single syllable can be understood.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Kehama is written in a measure which unites the freedom of blank verse with rhyme.
               You will probably hear it talked of as an innovation, for which (were that true) it
               would neither be better nor worse. But the fact is that (with one trifling exception)
               there is no novelty, and the practises at which I doubt not <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray’s</a> jog-trot criticism has stumbled, are established usages in the poetry of other countries,
               not differing from our own in the character of their verses, that is to say whose
               verses are formed by accent and not by quantity. The exception to which I have alluded
               is that of making the first and last syllables of the same line rhyme to each other.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>For the poem itself you will no doubt be ready to ask me the same question as the

                  that there were not above a dozen persons who would thoroughly enjoy it at present.
