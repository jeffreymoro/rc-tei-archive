                  downfall of the Establishment which so many causes are at this time operating to bring
                  about. You know I am neither a bigot, nor a hypocrite – I never conceal my dissent

               fund, or raised it by a hearth tax, or a graduated poll-tax I would applaud him. But
               the tythes offer a <span class="strikethrough">recourse xxx</span> readier resource, – because there would <span class="strikethrough">be only the party who are to</span> be none to stand up in their defence except the party to be plundered. Whenever that
