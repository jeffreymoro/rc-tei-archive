                  will perceive in a moment, &amp; no doubt will rectify it by giving you a second volume

                  may possibly recall me to their recollection. Having promised one of my cousins at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a> to bring him home Jack the Giant Killer

                  </div> I went into that shop to ask for a collection in four volumes, including the history

                  &amp; was the worse for wear, but rather than disappoint the little boy I took that set
                  upon some trifling abatement in the price. – While this point was settling I looked
                  about the shop &amp; bought these Persian Tales for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a>. The mistake of course was not discovered till he came to read the books, – &amp; this
