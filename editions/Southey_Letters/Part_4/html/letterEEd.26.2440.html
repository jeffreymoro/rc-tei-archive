               <p>To one who is employed as you are all preambles of apology &amp;c are better dispensed
                  with. I have written, partly from an apprehension that I might be considered as in
                  duty bound so to do, – but still more from inclination, odes to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent</a>, the Emperor Alexander, &amp; the King of Prussia.

                           King of Prussia 1797–1840) and the Prince Regent. The poems were published in book
                           form as Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, His Imperial
                           Majesty The Emperor of Russia, and His Majesty the King of Prussia (1814).</span></div>
                  </div> – You will think me under a perverse planet, – for having written like an orator in
                  rhyme on a former occasion,

                  </div> &amp; now writting <span class="ital">odaically</span> as you would <span class="strikethrough">xxx it</span> &lt;say&gt;, without it. But so it is, – the ore was in fusion &amp; ran into this form. Had
                  there been time I should have requested you to see them before they got into irrevocable
                  ink: but at this distance from town I am doubtful whether they are not already a day
                  after the fair, &amp; so too late to be published. – If however they should make their
                  appearance I have one favour to solicit of you. It may be a proper mark of respect
                  to send copies to the Personages to whom these Odes are addrest, – &amp; it may be an
                  improprer intrusion. Of this I am so little able to judge, that I intreat you to judge
                  for me. The bookseller will send copies to you, &amp; if it be proper to present them
                  I rely upon your kindness to have them presented.</p>
