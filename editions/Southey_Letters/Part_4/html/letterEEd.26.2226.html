            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">With sword &amp; breastplate under rustic weeds</div>
               <div class="l">Concealed, at dusk Pelayo past the gate,</div>
               <div class="l">Florinda following near, disguised alike;</div>
               <div class="l">Two peasants on their mules they seemd, at eve</div>
               <div class="l">Returning from the town. Not distant far</div>
               <div class="l">Alphonso by the appointed orange grove,</div>
               <div class="l">With anxious eye &amp; agitated heart</div>
               <div class="l">Watch’d for the Princes coming. Eagerly</div>
               <div class="l">At every footfall thro the gloom he strain’d</div>
               <div class="l">His sight, nor did he recognize him when</div>
               <div class="l">The Chieftain thus accompanied drew nigh,</div>
               <div class="l">And when the expected signal calld him on,</div>
               <div class="l">Doubting this female presence, half in fear</div>
               <div class="l">Obeyd the call. Pelayo too perceived</div>
               <div class="l">The boy was not alone; he not for that</div>
               <div class="l">Delayed the summons, but lest need should be</div>
               <div class="l">Laying hand upon his sword, toward him bent</div>
               <div class="l">In act soliciting speech, &amp; low of voice,</div>
               <div class="l">Enquired if friend or foe. Forgive me, cried</div>
               <div class="l">Alphonso, that I did not tell thee this,</div>
               <div class="l">Full as I was of happiness before</div>
               <div class="l">Tis Hoya, servant of my fathers house,</div>
               <div class="l">Unto whose dutiful care &amp; love when sent</div>
               <div class="l">To this vile bondage, I was given in charge.</div>
               <div class="l">How could I look upon my fathers face,</div>
               <div class="l">If I had in my joy deserted him</div>
               <div class="l">Who was to me found faithful? – Excellent boy!</div>
               <div class="l">Exclaimd Pelayo, as he wrung his hand</div>
               <div class="l">While tears of sudden &amp; intense delight</div>
               <div class="l">Started: brave boy! good boy! &amp; in his heart</div>
               <div class="l">He said, supprest in silence, blessed be</div>
               <div class="l">The womb that bore thee, but of womankind</div>
               <div class="l">Most blessed she whose hand her happy stars</div>
               <div class="l">Shall link with thine. And at that happy thought the form</div>
               <div class="l">Of Ermesind his daughter, in his soul</div>
               <div class="l">Rose in her beauty.</div>
               <div class="l">Soon by devious tracts</div>
               <div class="l">They turnd aside. The favouring Moon arose</div>
               <div class="l">To guide them on their flight thro upland paths</div>
               <div class="l">Remote from frequency, &amp; dales retired,</div>
               <div class="l">Forest &amp; mountain glen. Before their feet</div>
               <div class="l">The fire-flies, swarming in the woodland shade</div>
               <div class="l">Sprung up like living sparks, &amp; round their way</div>
               <div class="l">Twinkled; the blackbird starting at their step</div>
               <div class="l">Fled from her thicket with shrill note of fear</div>
               <div class="l">Melodious, far below them in the dell,</div>
               <div class="l">When all the soothing sounds of eve had ceased,</div>
               <div class="l">The distant watch-dogs voice at times was heard</div>
               <div class="l">Answering the nearer wolf. All thro the night</div>
               <div class="l">Among the hills they travelled silently,</div>
               <div class="l">Till when the stars were setting, at what hour</div>
               <div class="l">The breath of heaven is coldest, they beheld</div>
               <div class="l">Within a lonely grove the expected fire</div>
               <div class="l">Where Roderick &amp; his comrade anxiously</div>
               <div class="l">Lookd for the Prince’s coming. Halting there</div>
               <div class="l">They from the burthen &amp; the bit relieved</div>
               <div class="l">Their patient bearers, &amp; around the fire</div>
               <div class="l">Partook of needful food &amp; grateful rest.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Bright rose the flame replenished; it illumed</div>
               <div class="l">The cork-trees furrowed rind, its rifts &amp; swells</div>
               <div class="l">And redder scars, &amp; where its aged boughs</div>
               <div class="l">Oerbowered the travellers, cast upon the leaves</div>
               <div class="l">A floating, grey, unrealizing gleam.</div>
               <div class="l">Alphonso, light of heart, upon the heath</div>
               <div class="l">Lay carelessly dispread, in happy dreams</div>
               <div class="l">Of home; his faithful Hoya slept beside.</div>
               <div class="l">Years &amp; fatigue to old Siverian brought</div>
               <div class="l">Easy oblivion, &amp; the Prince himself,</div>
               <div class="l">Yielding to wearied Nature’s gentle will</div>
               <div class="l">Forgot his cares awhile. Florinda sate</div>
               <div class="l">Beholding Roderick with fixt eyes intent,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet unregardant of the countenance</div>
               <div class="l">Whereon she dwelt, in other thoughts absorbed,</div>
               <div class="l">Collecting fortitude for what she yearnd</div>
               <div class="l">Yet trembled to perform. Her steady look</div>
               <div class="l">Disturbd the Goth, albeit he little weend</div>
               <div class="l">What agony awaited him that hour;</div>
               <div class="l">The face, well-nigh as changed as his, was now</div>
               <div class="l">Half-hidden, &amp; the lustre of her eye</div>
               <div class="l">Extinct; nor did her voice awaken in him</div>
               <div class="l">One startling recollection when she spoke,</div>
               <div class="l">So altered were its tones.</div>
               <div class="l">Father, she said,</div>
               <div class="l">All thankful as I am to leave behind</div>
               <div class="l">The unhappy walls of Cordoba, not less</div>
               <div class="l">Of consolation doth my heart receive</div>
               <div class="l">At sight of one to whom I may disclose</div>
               <div class="l">The sins which trouble me, &amp; at his feet</div>
               <div class="l">Lay down repentantly in Jesu’s name</div>
               <div class="l">The burthen of my spirit. In his name</div>
               <div class="l">Hear me, &amp; pour into my wounded soul</div>
               <div class="l">The balm of righteous counsel. – Saying thus</div>
               <div class="l">She drew toward the minister ordained,</div>
               <div class="l">And kneeling by him, Father, dost thou know</div>
               <div class="l">The wretch who kneels beside thee? she enquird;</div>
               <div class="l">He answered, Surely we are each to each</div>
               <div class="l">Equally unknown.</div>
               <div class="l">Then said she, here thou seest</div>
               <div class="l">One who is known too fatally for all,</div>
               <div class="l">The daughter of Count Julian, – Well it was</div>
               <div class="l">For Roderick that no eye beheld him now;</div>
               <div class="l">From head to foot a keener pang than death</div>
               <div class="l">Thrilld him; his heart as at a mortal stroke</div>
               <div class="l">Ceas’d from its functions; his breath faild, &amp; when</div>
               <div class="l">The power of life recovering set its springs</div>
               <div class="l">Again in action, cold &amp; clammy sweats</div>
               <div class="l">Starting at every pore, suffused his frame.</div>
               <div class="l">Their presence helped him to subdue himself</div>
               <div class="l">For else had none been nigh, he would have fallen</div>
               <div class="l">Before Florinda, prostrate on the earth,</div>
               <div class="l">Beseeching her forgiveness ere he died;</div>
               <div class="l">And in that mortal agony belike</div>
               <div class="l">Both souls had taken flight. She markd him not,</div>
               <div class="l">For having told her name she bowd her head</div>
               <div class="l">Breathing a short &amp; silent prayer to heaven,</div>
               <div class="l">Which as the penitent she wrought herself</div>
               <div class="l">To open to his eyes her hidden wounds.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Father! at length she said, all tongues amid</div>
               <div class="l">This general ruin pour their bitterness</div>
               <div class="l">On Roderick, load his memory with reproach;</div>
               <div class="l">And with their curses persecute his soul.</div>
               <div class="l">– Why shouldst thou tell me this? exclaimd the Goth,</div>
               <div class="l">Wiping from his cold forehead, as he spake</div>
               <div class="l">The death-like moisture – Why of Rodericks guilt</div>
               <div class="l">Tellest thou me! thinkest thou I know it not?</div>
               <div class="l">Alas who hath not heard of Rodericks fall,</div>
               <div class="l">Rodericks reproach! – Babes learn it from their nurses,</div>
               <div class="l">And children by their mothers unreproved,</div>
               <div class="l">Link their first execrations to his name.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh it hath caught a taint of infamy,</div>
               <div class="l">That like Iscariots thro all time shall last</div>
               <div class="l">Reeking &amp; fresh for ever!</div>
               <div class="l">There – she cried,</div>
               <div class="l">Drawing her body backward as she knelt,</div>
               <div class="l">And stretching forth her arms, with head upraised, –</div>
               <div class="l">There – it pursues me still! I came to thee</div>
               <div class="l">Father for comfort, &amp; thou heapest fire</div>
               <div class="l">Upon my head! But hear me patiently</div>
               <div class="l">And let me undeceive thee! self-abased,</div>
               <div class="l">Not to arraign another do I come;</div>
               <div class="l">I come a self-accuser, self-condemnd,</div>
               <div class="l">To take upon myself the pain deserved;</div>
               <div class="l">For I have drank the cup of bitterness</div>
               <div class="l">And having drank therein of heavenly grace,</div>
               <div class="l">I must not put away the cup of shame.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Thus as she spake she faltered at the close,</div>
               <div class="l">And in that dying fall her voice sent forth</div>
               <div class="l">Somewhat of its original sweetness. There!</div>
               <div class="l">Thou self-abased, exclaimed the astonished King,</div>
               <div class="l">Thou self condemnd! the cup of shame for thee,</div>
               <div class="l">For thee Florinda! – But the very excess</div>
               <div class="l">Of passion checkd his speech, restraining him</div>
               <div class="l">From farther transport which perchance had else</div>
               <div class="l">Masterd him, &amp; he stood as one entranced</div>
               <div class="l">Gazing upon that countenance so fallen,</div>
               <div class="l">So changed. Her face raised from its mufflers now</div>
               <div class="l">Was turnd towards him, &amp; the fore-light shone</div>
               <div class="l">Full on its mortal paleness; but the shade</div>
               <div class="l">Concealed the King.</div>
               <div class="l">She rousd him from the spell</div>
               <div class="l">Which held him like a statue motionless.</div>
               <div class="l">Thou too, quoth she, dost join the general curse,</div>
               <div class="l">Like one who when he sees a felons grave</div>
               <div class="l">Casting a stone there as he passes by</div>
               <div class="l">Adds to the heap of shame. Oh what are we,</div>
               <div class="l">Frail creatures as we are, that we should sit</div>
               <div class="l">In judgement man on man! &amp; what were we</div>
               <div class="l">If the all-merciful should mete to us</div>
               <div class="l">With the same rigorous measure wherewithal</div>
               <div class="l">Sinner to sinner metes! But God beholds</div>
               <div class="l">The secrets of the heart; therefore his name</div>
               <div class="l">Is merciful. Servant of God see thou</div>
               <div class="l">The hidden things of mine, &amp; judge thou then</div>
               <div class="l">In charity thy brother who hath fallen.</div>
               <div class="l">– Nay hear me to the end! I loved the King</div>
               <div class="l">Tenderly, passionately, madly loved him!</div>
               <div class="l">Sinful it was to love a child of earth</div>
               <div class="l">With such entire devotion as I loved</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick, the heroic Prince, the glorious Goth.</div>
               <div class="l">And yet methought this was its only crime,</div>
               <div class="l">The imaginative passion seemed so pure:</div>
               <div class="l">Quiet &amp; calm like duty, hope nor fear</div>
               <div class="l">Disturb’d the deep contentment of that love;</div>
               <div class="l">He was the sunshine of my soul, &amp; like</div>
               <div class="l">A flower I lived &amp; flourished in his light.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh bear not with me thus impatiently!</div>
               <div class="l">No tale of weakness this, that in the act</div>
               <div class="l">Of penitence, indulgent to itself,</div>
               <div class="l">With garrulous palliation half repeats</div>
               <div class="l">The sin it ill repents. I will be brief,</div>
               <div class="l">And shrink not from confessing how the love</div>
               <div class="l">Which thus began in innocence, betrayed</div>
               <div class="l">My unsuspecting heart; nor me alone,</div>
               <div class="l">But him, before whom, shining as she shone</div>
               <div class="l">With whatsoeer is noble, whatsoeer</div>
               <div class="l">Is lovely, whatsoever good &amp; great,</div>
               <div class="l">I was as dust &amp; ashes, – him alas!</div>
               <div class="l">The glorious being, this exalted Prince,</div>
               <div class="l">Even him with all his royalty of soul</div>
               <div class="l">Did this ill-omened, this accursed love</div>
               <div class="l">To his most lamentable fall betray</div>
               <div class="l">And utter ruin. Thus it was, the King</div>
               <div class="l">By council of cold statesmen ill-advised</div>
               <div class="l"><span class="strikethrough">Had given &amp;</span> &lt;With&gt; an unworthy mate had <span class="strikethrough">hand</span> &lt;bound himself&gt;</div>
               <div class="l">In politic wedlock. Wherefore should I tell</div>

               <div class="l">A virgin dedicate to pass my life</div>
               <div class="l">Immured, &amp; like redeemed Magdaline</div>

               <div class="l">See Father! what a snare had Satan laid!</div>
               <div class="l">For Roderick came to tell me that the Church</div>
               <div class="l">From his unfruitful bed would set him free</div>
               <div class="l">And I should be his Queen.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh let me close</div>
               <div class="l">The dreadful tale. I told him of my vow,</div>

               <div class="l">No guilt he purported, but rather meant</div>
               <div class="l">An <span class="strikethrough">life-long</span> &lt;amplest&gt; recompense of life-long love</div>
               <div class="l">For transitory wrong, which fate perverse,</div>

               <div class="l">And therefore stern necessity excused.</div>
               <div class="l">Here then O father, at thy feet I own</div>
               <div class="l">Myself the guiltier; for full well I knew</div>
