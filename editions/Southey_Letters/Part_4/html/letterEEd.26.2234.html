               <p>I have a favour to ask you – <span class="strikethrough">It is</span>, which you will think at first rather an odd one. It is, that if you have no urgent

                  </div> – N<sup>o</sup> 2, New Burlington Street, – &amp; say that I recommended you there: <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> a very old friend of mine to whom I am under great obligations, has just entered into
                  this concern (– an old &amp; well known one) – &amp; has asked me to promote his interest.
                  You will be sure of good wine, – &amp; however trifling your consumption may be, – in
                  going there for it you will gratify me more than I can express. – This application
                  I shall make to all those with whom I am upon any terms of intimacy, – except perhaps
                  one; who that is you will easily guess.</p>
