                           in the Edinburgh Annual Register was in breach of Parliamentary privilege and hinted
                           that action against the author and publishers might be taken. In the event, the Edinburgh
                           Review’s suggestion was not acted on.</span></div>
                  </div> My intention was to have written &amp; read what, with all due respect to the House of
                  Commons, would have been a justificaiton of the freedom which as an Englishman &amp; an
                  Historian I had lawfully, as I conceived, – fearlessly &amp; conscienciously used. A very
                  few sentences would have sufficed: I should not have wanted friends in the House,
                  &amp; the discussion would have given to the Register a greater sale <span class="strikethrough">than</span> &lt;at&gt; once than it will make by its own merits in ten years. The party knew this, &amp;
                  they knew likewise that it would not be very creditable to make an attack upon what
                  &lt;may&gt; truly be called the freedom of the press, in the person of a man whose principles
                  were so clearly declared, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; who xxxxx xxxx</span> whose name would have exercised the attention of the public &amp; who would have been
                  so well able to have vindicated himself. So they wisely gave up their intention but
                  that the thing should have been intended is a fine proof of their regard for the liberty
                  of the press. I think it very likely that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxHenryRichard">Lord Holland</a> prevented them from exposing themselves to the certain shame which must have recoiled
                  upon them. Many reasons would induce him to this; he feels as I do respecting Spain
                  &amp; if his hopes are not as strong as mine, it is, if I may be allowed to say so, because
                  he is more of a professional politician, &amp; less of a philosopher – because he confines <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> his views to the tangible resources of a country, &amp; does not take national character
                  into the account.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Of the various administrations which we have seen in Spain, &amp; of the majority of the
                  higher orders I think precisely as you do, but I cannot think that the sacrifices
                  which the people have made are unavailing. Four years have now elapsed, &amp; in spite
                  of all this gross misconduct, of all these hopes, of all this treachery, – the country
                  is unsubdued &amp; the spirit of the people unbroken. No human foresight can see any termination
                  to the struggle – but while <span class="strikethrough">it</span> it is prolonged whatever cause the chapter of incidents may produce, must be in favour
                  of Spain. A war in the North <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> may operate as a diversion, the French Peninsular may at last be unable longer to
                  bear this dreadful &amp; continual waste of men in a contest not merely inglorious, but
                  infamous; – &amp; the hand of God or of man may at any moment rid the world of Buonaparte.
                  For we must never forget that the enormous military power of France is held by the
                  tenure of his single life. Look too at the relative reputation of the British &amp; French
                  troops compared to what <span class="strikethrough">things were</span> &lt;it was&gt; before the struggle. – The new regency has two men in it from whom I expect
