               had recognised their organisation there in 1801, clearly indicating the Order would
               be restored elsewhere. Inspired by this decision, the two Irish Jesuits who had survived
               since the suppression of the Order in 1773, recruited five new members, who studied
               at Stonyhurst School (founded 1794) and then in Palermo (1808–1811), before returning
               to Ireland. The land at Clongowes was bought for £16,000 in March 1814 and the school
               admitted its first pupils on 18 May 1814.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
