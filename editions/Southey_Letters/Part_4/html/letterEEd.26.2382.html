                           (1814), published under the pseudonym ‘Calvus’. Landor’s pamphlet demanded that Napoleon
                           be deprived of all his power, preferably his life, and that France at least be stripped
                           of all territory acquired since the French Revolution. The Letters were modelled on
                           Junius’s. Landor had originally sent 3 of the letters to the Courier. He then prepared
                           them for separate publication, adding a fourth letter. The Courier eventually published
                           part of this fourth letter on 12 January 1814.</span></div>
