                  probably is that in this murderous conflict French Generalship <span class="strikethrough">could not prevail over</span> &lt;was baffled by&gt; Russian courage, but that &lt;the&gt; Russians <span class="strikethrough">courage</span> could not take advantage of the enemys repulse, for want of equal skill.
