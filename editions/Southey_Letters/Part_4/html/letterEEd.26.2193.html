               inasmuch as the wind was fair, the room ample, and three ships had led the way. The
               Russell, following the Bellona, grounded in like manner: both were within reach of
               shot; but their absence from their intended stations was severely felt’. Only Nelson’s
               prompt action stopped his own and other ships running aground and the battle being
               lost. See <em>Life of Nelson</em>, 2 vols (London, 1813), II, pp. 118–119. Southey’s account ignored that fact that

               of some new information sent to him by Domett via Croker. This described how on Domett’s
               urging the fleet had entered the Baltic directly through the Sound rather than through
               the Great Belt, as Parker had originally decided. As a result the fleet was more effectively
               positioned for the battle. See, <em>The Life of Nelson</em>, 2nd edn, 2 vols (London, 1814), II, pp. 101–102; and Robert Southey to John May,
