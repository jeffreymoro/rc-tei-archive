               <div class="l">Of slaughter, with the morning dew didst draw</div>
               <div class="l">Corruption thro the tainted atmosphere.</div><br><div class="l">Then fell the kingdom of the Goths; their hour</div>
               <div class="l">Was come, &amp; Vengeance, long witheld let loose.</div>
               <div class="l">Famine &amp; Pestilence had wasted them,</div>
               <div class="l">And Treason like an old &amp; eating sore</div>
               <div class="l">Cankered the bones &amp; sinews of their strength,</div>
               <div class="l">And worst of enemies, their sins were armd</div>
               <div class="l">Against them. Yet the sceptre from their lands</div>
               <div class="l">Past not away inglorious, nor was shame</div>
               <div class="l">Left for their childrens lasting heritage.</div>
               <div class="l">Eight summer days from morn till latest eve</div>
               <div class="l">The fatal fight endurd, till perfidy</div>
               <div class="l">Prevailing to their overthrow they sunk</div>
               <div class="l">Defeated, not dishonoured. On the banks</div>
               <div class="l">Of Chrysus Rodericks royal car was found,</div>
               <div class="l">His battle-horse Orelio, &amp; that helm</div>
               <div class="l">Whose horns amid the thickest of the fray</div>
               <div class="l">Eminent, had marked his presence. Had the stream</div>
               <div class="l">Received him with the undistinguished dead</div>
               <div class="l">Christian &amp; Moor, who cloggd its course that day?</div>
               <div class="l">So thought the Conqueror, &amp; from that day forth</div>
               <div class="l">Memorial of his perfect victory</div>
               <div class="l">He bade the River bear the name of joy.</div>
               <div class="l">So thought the Goths; they said no prayer for him</div>
               <div class="l">For him no service sung, nor mourning made</div>
               <div class="l">But charged their armies upon his head &amp; curst</div>
               <div class="l">His memory.</div>
               <div class="l">Bravely in that eight days fight</div>
               <div class="l">The King had fought, for victory, first while hope</div>
               <div class="l">Remaind, then desperately in search of death.</div>
               <div class="l">The arrows past him by to right &amp; left</div>
               <div class="l">The spear-point pierced not him, the scymitar</div>
               <div class="l">Glanced from his helmet. Is the shield of Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Wretch that I am, extended over me?</div>
               <div class="l">Quoth Roderick &amp; he dropt Orelios reins</div>
               <div class="l">And threw his hands aloft in frantic prayer;</div>
               <div class="l">Death is the only mercy that I crave</div>
               <div class="l">Death soon &amp; short, death &amp; forgetfulness!</div>
               <div class="l">Aloud he cried; but in his inmost heart</div>
               <div class="l">There answered him a secret voice that spake</div>
               <div class="l">Of righteousness &amp; judgement after death,</div>
               <div class="l">And Gods redeeming love which fain would save</div>
               <div class="l">The guilty soul alive. Twas agony</div>
               <div class="l">And yet ‘twas joy; a momentary light</div>
               <div class="l">That flash’d thro utter darkness on the Cross</div>
               <div class="l">To point salvation there, then left his soul</div>
               <div class="l">Dark as before. Fear, never felt till now;</div>
               <div class="l">Sudden &amp; irresistible as stroke</div>
               <div class="l">Of lightning smote him. Off his horse he dropt</div>
               <div class="l">Whether with human impulse, or by Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Struck down, he knew not; loosend from his wrist</div>
               <div class="l">The sword chain, &amp; let fall the sword, whose hilt</div>
               <div class="l">Clung to his palm a moment ere it fell</div>
               <div class="l">Glued there with Moorish gore. His royal-robe</div>
               <div class="l">His horned helmet &amp; enamelld mail</div>
               <div class="l">He cast aside, &amp; taking from the dead</div>
               <div class="l">A peasants garment, in those weeds involvd</div>
               <div class="l">Stole, like a thief in darkness from the field.</div><br><div class="l">Evening closd round to favour him; all night</div>
               <div class="l">He fled, the sound of battle in his ears</div>
               <div class="l">Ringing, &amp; sights of death before his eyes,</div>
               <div class="l">With dreams more horrible of eager fiends</div>
               <div class="l">That seemd to hover round, &amp; gulphs of fire</div>
               <div class="l">Opening before his feet. At times the groan</div>
               <div class="l">Of some poor fugitive, who bearing with him</div>
               <div class="l">His mortal hurt, had fallen beside the way</div>
               <div class="l">Rousd him from &lt;these&gt; dread visions, &amp; he calld</div>
               <div class="l">In answering groans on his Redeemers name.</div>
               <div class="l">That word the only prayer that past his lips</div>
               <div class="l">Or rose within his heart. Then would he see</div>
               <div class="l">The Cross whereon a bleeding Saviour hung,</div>
               <div class="l">And calld on him to come &amp; cleanse his soul</div>
               <div class="l">In those all-healing streams which from his wounds</div>
               <div class="l">As from perpetual springs for ever flowd.</div>
               <div class="l">No heart eer panted for <span class="strikethrough">his</span> &lt;the&gt; water brooks</div>
               <div class="l">As Roderick thirsted there to drink &amp; live;</div>
               <div class="l">But Hell was interposed; &amp; worse than Hell</div>
               <div class="l">Yea to his eyes more dreadful than the Fiends</div>
               <div class="l">Who flockd &amp; like hungry ravens round his head,</div>
               <div class="l">Florinda stood between, &amp; warnd him off</div>
               <div class="l">With her abhorrent hands,.. that agony</div>
               <div class="l">Still in her face which, when the deed was done,</div>
               <div class="l">Inflicted on her ravisher the curse</div>
               <div class="l">That is invoked from heaven. Oh what a night</div>
               <div class="l">Of waking horrors! nor when morning came</div>
               <div class="l">Did the realities of light &amp; day</div>
               <div class="l">Bring aught of comfort; wheresoeer he went</div>
               <div class="l">The tidings of defeat had gone before,</div>
               <div class="l">And leaving their defenceless homes to seek</div>
               <div class="l">What shelter walls &amp; battlements might yield,</div>
               <div class="l">Old men with feeble feet, &amp; tottering babes</div>
               <div class="l">And widows with their infants in their arms,</div>
               <div class="l">Hurried along. Nor solemn festival,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor rarest pageant, with like multitudes</div>
               <div class="l">Eer filld the public way; all whom the sword</div>
               <div class="l">Had spared were here; bed-rid infirmity</div>
               <div class="l">Alone was left behind; the cripple plied</div>
               <div class="l">His crutches, with her child of yesterday</div>
               <div class="l">The mother fled, &amp; she whose hour was come</div>
               <div class="l">Fell by the road.</div>
               <div class="l">Less dreadful then this scene</div>
               <div class="l">Of outward suffering that the day disclosd,</div>
               <div class="l">Had night &amp; darkness seemd to Rodericks heart</div>
               <div class="l">With all their dread creations. From the throng</div>
               <div class="l">He turnd aside unable to endure</div>
               <div class="l">This burthen of the general woe; nor walls</div>
               <div class="l">Nor towers, nor mountain fastnesses he sought</div>
               <div class="l">A firmer hold his spirit yearned to find</div>
               <div class="l">A rock of surer strength. Unknowing where,</div>
               <div class="l">Straight thro the wild he hastend on all day,</div>
               <div class="l">And with unslackend speed was travelling still</div>
               <div class="l">When Evening gatherd round. Seven days from morn</div>
               <div class="l">Till night he travell’d thus; the forest oaks</div>
               <div class="l">The fig grove by the fearful husbandman</div>
               <div class="l">Forsaken to the spoiler, &amp; the vines</div>
               <div class="l">Where fox &amp; household dog together now</div>
               <div class="l">Fed on the vintage, gave him food; the hand</div>
               <div class="l">Of Heaven was on him, &amp; the agony</div>
               <div class="l">That wrought within, &amp; supplied a strength beyond</div>
               <div class="l">All natural force of man –</div>
               <div class="l">When the eighth eve</div>
               <div class="l">Was come, he found himself on Ana’s banks</div>
               <div class="l">Fast by the Caulian schools. It was the hour</div>
               <div class="l">Of vespers, but no vesper bell was heard;</div>
               <div class="l">Nor other sound than of the passing stream</div>
               <div class="l">Or stork, who flapping with wide wing the air</div>
               <div class="l">Sought her broad nest upon the silent tower.</div>
               <div class="l">The schools &amp; convent calls were desolate;</div>
               <div class="l">One aged Monk &lt;alone&gt; remaind behind,</div>
               <div class="l">When all his brethren with their scholars fled</div>
               <div class="l">Within the gates of ancient Merida.</div>
               <div class="l">Romano would not fly, for having servd</div>
               <div class="l">Even from his childhood up to ripe old age</div>
               <div class="l">Gods holy altar, it became him now,</div>
               <div class="l">He thought, before that altar to await</div>
               <div class="l">The merciless misbelievers, &amp; lay down</div>
               <div class="l">His life, a willing martyr. So he staid</div>
               <div class="l">Alone when all were gone, &amp; duly fed</div>
               <div class="l">The sacred lamps, &amp; kept the altar drest</div>
               <div class="l">And duly offerd up the sacrifice.</div>
               <div class="l">Four days &amp; nights he thus had passed alone</div>
               <div class="l">In such high mood of saintly fortitude</div>
               <div class="l">That hope of Heaven itself was heavenly joy</div>
               <div class="l">And now at evening to the gate he went</div>
               <div class="l">If he might spy the Moors, for it seem’d long</div>
               <div class="l">To tarry for his crown.</div>
               <div class="l">Before the Cross</div>

               of men and manners, should never be founded totally on fiction … I have followed no
               man closely; nor have I turned from my road because another stood in it: tho’ perhaps
               I have momentarily … caught the object that attracted him. I have written in blank
               verse, because there never was a poem in rhyme that grew not tedious in a thousand
               lines … If there are, now, Englishmen of taste and genius who will applaud my Poem,
               I declare myself fully content.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
