                  died, &amp; his relations entertained such a respect for her that they settled upon her
                  an annuity of 100£. I cannot tell whether this settlement was for life or if it were
                  merely at pleasure, &amp; therefore likely to cease now – But I rather guess that she
                  has this, – &amp; that she can<span class="strikethrough">not</span> have &lt;little if&gt; any thing else – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &lt;however&gt; is to tell me his plans when we meet, – &amp; I have sufficient confidence in
                  his good sense to hope with some reason, that they are not so imprudent as they appear.
                  – She is a very interesting woman – about 30 – or verging toward it, – what little
                  I saw of her pleased me very much indeed.</p>
