                  </div> I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> saying that the time was past when I could write verses upon demand, but that if it
                  were understood that instead of the old formalities I might be at liberty to write
                  upon great public events, or to be silent, as the spirit moved, in that case the office
                  would become a mark of honourable distinction &amp; I should be proud of accepting it.

                  requires some reform to rescue it from the contempt into which it had fallen. – I

                  dreaming of what the business could be, &amp; wondering at it. He told me that the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HertfordLord">Marquis of Hertford</a> was his brother-in-law, &amp; had written to him as being my neighbour in the country,
                  – placing in fact the appointment at his (Lord W<sup>ms</sup>) disposal, – wherefore he wished to see me to know if I wished to have it. The meaning
                  of all this was easily seen, I was very willing to thank one person more, &amp; especially
                  a good natured man to whom I am indebted for many neighbourly civilities, he assured
                  me that I should now soon hear from the Chamberlains Office &amp; I departed accordingly
                  in full expectation that two or three days more would settle the affair. But neither
                  days nor weeks brought any farther intelligence, &amp; if plenty of employments &amp; avocations
                  had not <span class="strikethrough">very much</span> filled up my mind as &lt;well as&gt; my time, I should perhaps have taken dudgeon, &amp; returned

                  me of the old proverb about shearing pigs.
