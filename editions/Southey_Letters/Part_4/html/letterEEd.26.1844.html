               superficial, output. One of Carr’s friends responded with <em>Old Nick’s Pocket-Book</em> (1808) and Carr himself brought legal action against the publishers of Dubois’ book.
               Carr lost the case and the third edition of <em>My Pocket-Book</em> included an account of events.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               a campaign of attrition and indirection. It applied to Wellington’s methods: ‘He held
