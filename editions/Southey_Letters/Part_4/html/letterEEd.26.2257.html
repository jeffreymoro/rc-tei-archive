            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Three weeks ago I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</a> for £50.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s letter to Ballantyne does not appear to have survived.</span></div>
                  </div> To day he writes me from London that he is <span class="strikethrough">in</span> already in advance, – which is false, – for upon the completion of this volume now
                  in the press about 175 £ will be due to me, – exclusive of the fifty which he has
                  thus refused.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Of course this brings things to a crisis. I have written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">his brother</a>, who has the character of a man of honour, – shown him in what manner <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John B.</a> shuffles, desired him to take back my share in the work, &amp; likewise to look out for
               a writer who may succeed me in my department. – I have some little dependence upon
               the printers character, &amp; rather more upon his connection with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a>; but lay my account with much plague &amp; perhaps the loss of all that I have embarked
               in the concern.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Immediate embarrasment is the first consequence. If the money which I sent should
                  by good luck still remain in your desk, send me half of it, &amp; buy in one hundred instead
                  of two. If it is gone, let me have upon the score of my pension

                  </div> what you can spare me towards that amount. – The present inconvenience I shall get
                  over, – tho trouble will fall upon one who is not easily <span class="strikethrough">troubled</span> vexed, – &amp; I hope ultimately to be no loser by disposing of so much time &amp; so much
                  labour in another channel: but this time must show.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am hard at work for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>, &amp; hope he will be able to wait for me, – for this article now becomes essential
                  to my ways &amp; means. – Have you received Nelson?

                  is perfectly unaccountable. The Peacock was a <span class="ital">crack</span> ship, her Captain as fine a fellow as any in the navy, – &amp; the enemys superiority
                  in guns a mere nothing.
