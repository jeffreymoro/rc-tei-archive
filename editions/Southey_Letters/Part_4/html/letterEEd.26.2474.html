         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">16.. </span><span class="noteBody">Junius was the pseudonym used by the author – or authors – of a series of letters
               published in the <em>Public Advertiser</em> between 21 January 1769 and 21 January 1772. The letters took a high Whig line. They
               opposed the policies of the government and the king and were generally supportive
               of those of the ex-Prime Minister George Grenville (1712–1770; <em>DNB</em>) and of the radical politician John Wilkes (1725–1797; <em>DNB</em>). There was, from the outset, much debate as to the identity of their author or authors.
               In 1813 Duppa’s <em>Memoirs by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</em> (i.e. the poet and politician Richard Glover (1712–1785; <em>DNB</em>)) had attempted to prove the latter was the author of Junius’s letters. Duppa defended
               himself against his critics in an anonymous pamphlet, <em>An Inquiry Concerning the Author of the Letters of Junius, with Reference to the Memoirs
                  by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</em> (1814). Southey was asking Murray to send him a copy of the latter.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
