                           He had read a MS version of The Curse of Kehama (1810), presumably the version sent

                  fixing its character with the public, as far as it is to be fixed by public criticism.

                  </div> He is wrong in complaining of the want of general &amp; retrospective views, – or rather
                  this is an imputation to which the work is subjected only because it has been published

A tambour is an <span class="ital">outlandish</span> drum, not such as the soldiers use. <span class="ital">Napery</span> implies napkins &amp; tablecloths, either or both. Therefore properly used when a comprehensive
                  term was required. Harry will tell you that a <span class="ital">Broad</span> is the spread of a river into a sheet of water, – <span class="strikethrough">someth</span> which is certainly neither lake nor lagoon. – The mistake about Lutheranism the Reviewer
                  has well accounted for by the constant <span class="strikethrough">presence</span> &lt;use&gt; of the word Luteranos in the Portugueze writers. Araboutan he might have seen

               future friend and literary executor Sir Henry Taylor and acquaintance of Tom Southey.
               He had read a MS version of <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (1810), presumably the version sent to Tom Southey, which is now British Library,
               Add. MS 36485.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody">Scott had been commissioned by Gifford to review <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (1810). Bedford had also applied to review the poem and had been shown a pre-publication
               version of Scott’s article. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> was concerned at its emphasis upon narrative, rather than morality, and was allowed
               to make additions to it along the lines suggested in this letter. Bedford remained,
               however, unhappy with the overall tone. For the review as published see <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 5 (February 1811), 40–61 (esp. 55–56, probably Bedford’s interpolation); see Southey
               to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 1 January 1811, Letter 1848.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               pp. 89, 121; ‘napery’, p. 381; ‘broads’, p. 133; Southey inadvertently referred to

The review had noted the Berkshire custom that a widow
               of a customary tenant would forfeit her lifetime rights to her husband’s copyhold
               land if she remarried or was discovered to be ‘unchaste’. She could reclaim her rights
               by riding into court seated backwards ‘upon a black ram, with his tail in her hand’
               and reciting a doggerel verse. The review suggested that Sinclair atone for his errors
               on the bullion question by entering the lobby at Whitehall in the same fashion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
