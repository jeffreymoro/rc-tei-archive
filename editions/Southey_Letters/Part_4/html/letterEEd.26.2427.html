                  curious one. George Lukins who was famous in the year 1788 for having had seven Devils
                  cast out of him by as many ministers, in Temple Church, Bristol, declared that the
                  said Devils entered into him eighteen years before, as he was, with other young people
                  going about &amp; acting Christmas plays or mummeries. – This Lukins lived at Yatton in
