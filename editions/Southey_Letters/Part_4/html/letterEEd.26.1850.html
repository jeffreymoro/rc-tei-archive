                  </div> He is wrong in complaining of the want of retrospective &amp; generalizing views. The
                  place for the former is at the close of the Dutch war, – for the latter at the conclusion
                  of the work. All the summary that this volume required or admitted exists in the latter
                  half of the tenth chapter. He is wrong also in his objection to the words which he
                  specifies as unusual. A savage head-dress of feathers is <span class="ital">not</span> a coronet, a horses poitral is not a breast-plate, that word being appropriate to
                  human armour. A tambour is not a drum, any more than a lute is a fiddle. Napery is
                  used for napkins &amp; table cloths, because it implies either or both. <span class="ital">Broad<span class="strikethrough">s</span></span> is a Norfolk word for the spread of a river into a sheet of water, – which spread
                  being neither lake nor lagoon requires a specific word to express it; &amp; for the vocabulary
                  of natural scenery we must necessarily go to the provinces, the metropolitan dialect
                  being always deficient on such subjects.</p>
