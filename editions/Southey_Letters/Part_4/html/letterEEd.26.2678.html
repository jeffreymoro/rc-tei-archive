               <p>This is the Age of Collectors, – &amp; on my way down having plenty of leisure for idle
                  thought, I determined to form a Collection in which I think you will take an interest
                  in assisting me. It will be an interesting thing <span class="strikethrough">for</span> to <span class="strikethrough">form a collection of</span> &lt;get together&gt; all the reviews which have been written upon my operas, – to arrange
                  them chronologically, &amp; preface a blank leaf before each wherein <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> the name &amp; date of the journal in which it appeared &lt;may be written&gt;, &amp; when I can
                  learn it the name of the author. The collection will make a curious harmony of criticisms,
                  – &amp; will supply good &amp; appropriate matter for the prolegomena to my collected works,
                  – if it should ever be your office to edite them, as in case of survivorship I trust
                  it will.
