            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Twelve months they sojournd in their solitude,</div>
               <div class="l">And then beneath the burthen of old age</div>
               <div class="l">Romano sunk. No brethren were there here</div>
               <div class="l">To spread the sackcloth, &amp; with ashes strew</div>
               <div class="l">That penitential bed, &amp; stand around</div>
               <div class="l">To sing his requiem, &amp; with prayer &amp; psalm</div>
               <div class="l">Assist him in his hour of agony.</div>
               <div class="l">On the bare earth he lay, which long had been</div>
               <div class="l">His only couch, beside him Roderick knelt,</div>
               <div class="l">Moistend from time to time his feverish lips,</div>
               <div class="l">Receivd a blessing in his latest breath.</div>
               <div class="l">Then closd his eyes, &amp; by the nameless grave</div>
               <div class="l">Of the fore tenant of that holy place,</div>
               <div class="l">Consignd him earth to earth.</div>
               <div class="l">Two graves are here</div>
               <div class="l">And Roderick transverse at their feet begins</div>
               <div class="l">To break the third. In all his intervals</div>
               <div class="l">Of prayer, save only when he searchd the woods</div>
               <div class="l">And filld the watercruise, he labourd there,</div>
               <div class="l">And when the work was done, &amp; he had laid</div>
               <div class="l">Himself at length within its narrow sides,</div>
               <div class="l">And measured it, he shook his head to think</div>
               <div class="l">There was no other business for him;</div>
               <div class="l">Poor wretch! thy bed is ready, he exclaim’d</div>
               <div class="l">And would that night would come! . It was a task</div>
               <div class="l">All gloomy as it was, which had beguild</div>
               <div class="l">The sense of solitude; but now he felt</div>
               <div class="l">The burthen of the solitary hours;</div>
               <div class="l">The silence of that lonely hermitage</div>
               <div class="l">Lay on him like a spell, &amp; at the voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of his own prayers, he started half-aghast.</div>
               <div class="l">Then too as on Romano’s grave he sate</div>
               <div class="l">And pored upon his own, a painful thought</div>
               <div class="l">Arose within him, – well might he have spard</div>
               <div class="l">That useless toil! the sepulchre would be</div>
               <div class="l">No hiding place for him; no christian hands</div>
               <div class="l">Were here who should compose his decent corps,</div>
               <div class="l">And cover it with earth; – there he might drag</div>
               <div class="l">His wretched body its passing hour</div>
               <div class="l">And there the sea birds of her heritage</div>
               <div class="l">Would rob the worm, – or peradventure seize</div>
               <div class="l">Ere death had done its work, their helpless prey</div>
               <div class="l">Even now they did not fear him; if he walked</div>
               <div class="l">Beside them on the beach, regardlessly</div>
               <div class="l">They saw his coming, &amp; their whirring wings</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the height had sometimes fannd his cheek,</div>
               <div class="l">As if, being thus alone, humanity</div>
               <div class="l">Had lost its rank, &amp; the prerogative</div>
               <div class="l">Of man was done away.</div>
               <div class="l">For his last crown</div>
               <div class="l">And sceptre, never had he felt a thought</div>
               <div class="l">Of pain, – repentance had no pangs to spare</div>
               <div class="l">For trifles such as these, – the loss of these</div>
               <div class="l">Was a cheap penalty, that he had fallen</div>
               <div class="l">Down to the lowest depth of wretchedness,</div>
               <div class="l">His hope &amp; consolation. But to lose</div>
               <div class="l">His human station in the scale of things, –</div>
               <div class="l">To see brute nature scorn him &amp; renounce</div>
               <div class="l">Its homage to the human form divine, –</div>
               <div class="l">Had then Almighty vengeance thus reveald</div>
               <div class="l">His punishment, &amp; was he fallen indeed</div>
               <div class="l">Below fallen man, below redemptions reach,</div>
               <div class="l">Made lower than the beasts, &amp; like the beasts</div>
               <div class="l">To perish? – Such temptations troubled him</div>
               <div class="l">By day &amp; in the visions of the night;</div>
               <div class="l"><span class="strikethrough">And</span> Tho even in sleep he struggled with the thought,</div>
               <div class="l">And waking with the effort of his prayers</div>
               <div class="l">The dream assaild him still.</div>
               <div class="l">O for a voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of comfort! for a word to bid him hope!</div>
               <div class="l">A hand from these billows of despair,</div>
               <div class="l">While yet he strives against the breaking sea</div>
               <div class="l">May reach &amp; snatch him ere he sink engulphed!</div>
               <div class="l">At length, as life when it hath lain long time</div>
               <div class="l">Opprest beneath some grievous malady,</div>
               <div class="l">Seems to rouse up with re-collected strength</div>
               <div class="l">And the sick man doth feel within himself</div>
               <div class="l">A second spring, – so Rodericks better mind</div>
               <div class="l">Arose to save him. Lo, the western sun</div>
               <div class="l">Flames oer the broad Atlantic, on the verge</div>
               <div class="l">Of glowing ocean rests, entering then</div>
               <div class="l">Draws with it all its rage, &amp; sudden night</div>
               <div class="l">Fills the whole cope of heaven. The penitent</div>
               <div class="l">Knelt by Romano’s grave, &amp; falling prone</div>
               <div class="l">Claspt with extended arms the funeral mould</div>
               <div class="l">Father, he cried, companion, only friend</div>
               <div class="l">When all beside was lost, thou too art gone</div>
               <div class="l">And the poor sinner whom from utter death</div>
               <div class="l">Thy providential hand preserved, once more</div>
               <div class="l">Totters upon the gulph. I am too weak</div>
               <div class="l">For solitude, too vile a wretch to bear</div>
               <div class="l">This everlasting commune with myself.</div>
               <div class="l">The Tempter hath assaild me; mine own heart</div>
               <div class="l">Is leagued with him, Despair hath laid his nets</div>
               <div class="l">To take my soul, &amp; memory like a ghost</div>
               <div class="l">Haunts me &amp; drives me to the toils. O Saint</div>
               <div class="l">While I was blest with thee, the hermitage</div>
               <div class="l">Was my sure haven. Look upon me still,</div>
               <div class="l">For from thy heavenly mansion thou canst see</div>
               <div class="l">The suppliant. Look upon thy child in Christ.</div>
               <div class="l">Is there no other way for penitence?</div>
               <div class="l">I ask not martyrdom, – for what am I</div>
               <div class="l">That I should pray for triumphs the fit meed</div>
               <div class="l">Of thy long life of merits, &amp; aspire</div>
               <div class="l">To wear the heavenly crown resignd by thee,</div>
               <div class="l">How nobly, for my sake. O point me thou</div>
               <div class="l">Some humblest, painfullest, severest life,</div>
               <div class="l">Some new austerity unheard of yet</div>
               <div class="l">In Syrian fields of glory, or the sands</div>
               <div class="l">Of holiest Egypt. Let me bind my brow</div>
               <div class="l">With thorns, &amp; barefoot seek Jerusalem</div>
               <div class="l">Tracking the way with blood, – there day by day</div>
               <div class="l">Inflict upon this sinful flesh the scourge,</div>
               <div class="l">Drink vinegar &amp; gall, &amp; for my bed</div>
               <div class="l">Hang with extended arms upon the cross</div>
               <div class="l">A mighty crucifixion; – any thing</div>
               <div class="l">Of action, difficulty, bodily pain,</div>
               <div class="l">Labour, &amp; outward suffering, – any thing</div>
               <div class="l">But stillness &amp; this dreadful solitude!</div>
               <div class="l">Romano! father! let me hear thy voice</div>
               <div class="l">In dreams, O Saint in heaven; – or from the grave</div>
               <div class="l">Speak to thy penitent, – even from the grave</div>
               <div class="l">Thine were a voice of comfort.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Thus he cried</div>
               <div class="l">Easing the pressure of his burthened soul</div>
               <div class="l">With passionate prayer, thus poured his spirit forth</div>
               <div class="l">Till the long effort had exhausted him,</div>
               <div class="l">His spirit faild, &amp; laying on the grave</div>
               <div class="l">His weary head, as on a pillow, sleep</div>
               <div class="l">Fell on him. He had prayd to hear the voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of consolation, &amp; in dreams a voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of consolation came – Roderick, it said,</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick, my poor unhappy sinful child, –</div>
               <div class="l">Jesus have mercy on thee! Not if Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Had opened &amp; Romano, visible</div>
               <div class="l">In his beatitude, had breathd that prayer.</div>
               <div class="l">Not if the grave had spoken, had it pierced</div>
               <div class="l">So deeply in his soul, nor thrilld his heart</div>
               <div class="l">With such compunctious visitings, nor given</div>
               <div class="l">Withal so keen a joy. It was the voice</div>
               <div class="l">Which sung his fretful infancy to sleep</div>
               <div class="l">So patiently, had soothd his childish griefs,</div>
               <div class="l">Counselld with anguish &amp; prophetic tears</div>
               <div class="l">His head strong youth. And lo his Mother stood</div>
               <div class="l">Before him in the vision, in those weeds</div>
               <div class="l">Which never from the hour when to the grave</div>
               <div class="l">She followed her dear Lord, Theodofred</div>
               <div class="l">Rusilla laid aside, but in her face</div>
               <div class="l">A sorrow that bespake a heavier load</div>
               <div class="l">At heart, &amp; more unmitigated woe.</div>
               <div class="l">Yea a more poignant agony, than when</div>
               <div class="l">Witiza’s ministers &amp; the red-hot brass</div>
               <div class="l">Had done their work, &amp; in her arms she held</div>
               <div class="l">Her eyeless husband, wiped away the sweat</div>
               <div class="l">Which still his tortures forced from every pore</div>
               <div class="l">Coold his scorchd lids with medicinable herbs</div>
               <div class="l">And prayd the while for patience for herself</div>
               <div class="l">And him, &amp; prayd for vengeance too, &amp; found</div>
               <div class="l">Best comfort in her curses.</div>
               <div class="l">In his dream</div>
               <div class="l">Groaning he knelt before her to receive</div>
               <div class="l">Her blessing, &amp; she raisd her hands to lay</div>
               <div class="l">The benediction on him: but those hands</div>
               <div class="l">Were chaind, &amp; casting a wild look around</div>
               <div class="l">With a wild voice she cried, will no one break</div>
               <div class="l">These shameful fetters? Pedro, Theudemuir</div>
               <div class="l">Athanagild, where are ye? – Roderick’s arm</div>
               <div class="l">Is withered, – Chiefs of Spain but where are ye</div>
               <div class="l">And thou Pelayo, thou our surest hope,</div>
               <div class="l">Dost thou too sleep. – up – up – Pelayo up</div>
               <div class="l">Why tarriest thou, deliverer! But with that</div>
               <div class="l">She broke her bonds, &amp; lo her form was</div>
               <div class="l">Radiant in arms she stood; a bloody cross</div>
               <div class="l">Gleamd on her breast-plate, in her shield displayed</div>
               <div class="l">A Lion seemd to ramp; her helmed head</div>
               <div class="l">Rose like the Berecynthian Goddess, crownd</div>
               <div class="l">With towers, &amp; in her dreadful hand the sword</div>
               <div class="l">Red as a fire brand blazed. Anon the tramp</div>
               <div class="l">Of horsemen &amp; the din of multitudes</div>
               <div class="l">Moving to mortal conflict rung around,</div>
               <div class="l">The battle song, the clang of sword &amp; shield</div>
               <div class="l">War-cries &amp; tumult, strife &amp; hate &amp; rage</div>
               <div class="l">Blasphemous prayers, confusion, agony,</div>
               <div class="l">Rout &amp; pursuit &amp; death, &amp; over all</div>
               <div class="l">The shout of victory, Spain &amp; Victory</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick, for the strong vision mastered him</div>
               <div class="l">Rushd to the fight rejoicing; starting then</div>
               <div class="l">As his own effort burst the charm of sleep</div>
               <div class="l">He found himself upon that lonely grave</div>
               <div class="l">In moonlight &amp; in silence.</div>
               <div class="l">But the dream</div>
               <div class="l">Worked in him still, for still he felt his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Pant, &amp; his withered arm was trembling still</div>
               <div class="l">And still that voice was in his ears which called</div>
               <div class="l">Jesus for his sake. Oh might he hear</div>
               <div class="l">That actual voice!. &amp; if Rusilla lived</div>
               <div class="l">If shame &amp; anguish for his crimes, not yet</div>
               <div class="l">Had brought her to the grave, sure she would bless</div>
               <div class="l">Her penitent child, &amp; pour with his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Prayers &amp; forgiveness which like precious balm</div>
               <div class="l">Would heal the wounded soul. Nor to herself</div>
               <div class="l">Less precious or less feeling, would the voice</div>
               <div class="l">That spake forgiveness flow; she wept her son</div>
               <div class="l">For ever lost, cut off with all the weight</div>
               <div class="l">Of unrepented sin upon his head,</div>
