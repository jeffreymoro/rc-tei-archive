               favour of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, I might more frequently be favoured with a Bulletin.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">

                           True Causes of the General Scarcity and Consequent High Price on that Precious Metal:
                           Also Demonstrating that the Notes of the Bank of England are Not Depreciated (1810).
                           It went into a second edition in 1811, and Koster followed this with Further Observations
                           on Bullion and Bank Notes (1811).</span></div>
                  </div> An utter inability to feel the slightest interest in such subjects has made me contentedly
                  suppose in myself a natural incapacity for understanding them – that is, – that just
                  as I have no ear for music, so I have no head for finance, statistics &amp;c &amp;c – This
                  being premised, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</a> will not suppose that I place much confidence in any opinion which I may have happened
                  to form upon the bullion question. – It does however appear to me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Koster</a> has made a discovery in political oeconomy. He argues that as the value of gold depends,
                  like that of all other things, upon the supply &amp; the consumption, there is an absurdity
                  in fixing a standard price for it, &amp; that the whole evil has been occasioned by this
                  blunder. It has not produced that evil sooner because the supply &amp; the consumption
                  formerly balanced each other, – of late years the supply from Brazil has totally ceased,
                  – &amp; the consumption has been yearly increasing in a prodigious proportion. – The result
                  is that a maximum ought no more to be fixed for gold than for any other commodity.
                  – The pamphlett may be read in an hour, &amp; I should be very glad to know what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</a> thinks of <span class="strikethrough">this</span> it. If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Koster</a> be right, all the other disputants are in the wrong &amp; the remedy is easy, &amp; the sooner
                  the principle is known when it could be made effective the better. If he is wrong,
                  I wish to know where his error lies, lest I should blunder about in when the subject
                  comes in my way, as it will do in the next years Annals.
