                  some vexation from abroad. I thought all was going on swimmingly with my Odes, for
                  on <span class="strikethrough">Friday</span> &lt;Saturday&gt; <span class="strikethrough">Bedford</span> came a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> saying that on the Wednesday evening <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</a> had been with him to receive directions about the printing. Sunday there comes another
                  informing me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Bedfordfamily">his father</a> had had a paralytic stroke which left little or no hope of recovery. Of course I lookd
                  for nothing about my Odes in such a letter – there was however a postscript implying
                  a blunder which can only be explained by the state of his mind. I had desired him
                  to correct the proofs because there was not time to send them here, – he had sent
                  me some criticisms upon the two first odes, &amp; as my reply to the first of these critical
                  letters could not arrive before Monday “to enable him to correct the press; – he concluded
                  that therefore the publication could not take place.” – At another time I should have
                  breathed for him one of those pious prayers which are sometimes heard from a Lieutenants
                  mouth when the ropes are not handled properly. As the matter stood I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> to hurry the publication if it were possible to get it out before the Raree-men left
