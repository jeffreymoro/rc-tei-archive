               published in the <em>Courier</em>, 8 January 1814, had attacked the personalities and politics of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. The review of the ‘Carmen’ in <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, 22 (January 1814), 447–454, retorted: ‘For our own parts, when we are seriously
               occupied with the destinies of Europe, or of mankind, we should think very contemptibly
               of ourselves, if we could permit the recollection of our differences with Mr Southey
               to intrude either into our writings or our thoughts’ (452), before going on to criticise
               his support of the Spanish and acceptance of the Laureateship. <em>The Times</em>, 7 April 1814 had printed an attack on the <em>Edinburgh</em>’s criticisms of Southey; and <em>The Times,</em> 21 April 1814 reprinted the ‘Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte’,
               in a corrected version and retitled ‘Ode; Written in January, 1814’. A short headnote
               again defended Southey against the criticism levelled against him in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
