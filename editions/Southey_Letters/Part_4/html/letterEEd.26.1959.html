            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It was no little mortification to me on my arrival in town to learn that you had left
               it, though indeed, from the long delay of my journey, it was reasonable to expect
               that this would be the case. Had I however been certain of this, and received your
               friendly invitation before my departure from home, it would have been easy for us
               to have seen you at Coleorton, – a pleasure which on our return was not within our
               reach. On the way up we were so near as Nottingham, where we passed two or three days.
               Our way home was by <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Llanthony">Llanthony Abbey</a>, Ludlow, Llangedwyn, and Llangollen, where we passed a day very pleasantly with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LlangollenLadies">the ladies</a>.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> was the last person whom I saw in the neighbourhood of London. He told me at parting
               that he should be at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> before me. Here, however, I am, and there are no tidings of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>. I found him in better health than usual, and, better still, in better habits; and
               while I see him so well employed as he has lately been in the <em>Courier</em>, I shall not urge him to leave town. Well employed must be said rather in reference
               to his no-employment than to the manner in which such talents ought to be directed.
               The way in which they would be most beneficial would be if he held a confidential
               situation with some man in power, either at home or abroad. I do not know that man
               in the world whose wisdom would then appear so practical.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been fortunate enough at last to obtain <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother’s</a> promotion to the rank of commander.

                  </div> It was done for me in a very flattering manner by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Mr. Percival</a>, through the intervention of his late secretary, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Mr. Herries</a>, at present Commissary-General, a very able as well as excellent man, with whom I

                  pleasure to have obtained, I mention because I feel assured, from the kindness with
                  which you formerly endeavoured to obtain it for me, that you will rejoice to hear
                  we have now been more successful.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My literary concerns, though upon the whole more prosperous than they have heretofore
                  been, afford a curious proof of the humour of the times, I am best paid for what is
                  worth least; and if I consulted merely my own interest, should leave nothing for posterity,
                  but employ myself wholly in writing such desultory essays as come within the limits
                  of a review, and therefore do not trespass too much upon the leisure of a modern reader.
                  For the last two years my chief and indeed favourite employment has been writing the
                  annals of these most interesting times for the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                           (1811).</span></div>
                  </div> Those of 1809 happen to exceed those of the preceding year considerably in bulk, because
                  the events are far more numerous. Nevertheless the public, who were well pleased with
                  the length of the first volume, complain grievously because the second is longer,
                  and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">the booksellers</a> represent this to me as a serious evil.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)

                           Register, for 1809, 2.1 (1811), [v]–vi.</span></div>
                  </div> It is needless to say that, should the work continue, these representations will have
                  no effect whatever upon me. In a history of this kind it is the business of the annalist
                  not so much to regard the amusement of his own age as the information of those who
                  are to come after him.</p>
