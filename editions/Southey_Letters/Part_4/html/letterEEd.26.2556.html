                  we feel this. The hour-glass runs always at the same rate; but when the sands are
                  more than half spent, it is then only that we perceive how rapidly they are running
                  out. I have been close at the desk this winter. The Quarterly takes up a heavy portion
                  of my time. You would see in the last number two articles of mine – one upon the History
