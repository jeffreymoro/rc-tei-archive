                  me so much, that I will not sleep another night without writing to you upon the subject.
                  You are not perhaps aware that in this age of medical improvement no branch whatever
                  of the healing art has been so materially improved as that which relates to diseases
                  of the eyes, – for which there is an especial institution established in London.

                  himself under their care. <span class="strikethrough">Xx</span> If there be no organic disease, the probability of cure is very great, &amp; even if there
                  be, there is still a probability. Do this I beseech you &amp; do it without delay.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I cannot express to you my dear Cottle how much it has affected me to hear <span class="strikethrough">that</span> of your affliction: for tho I am sure there is no man who would bear any <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxx</span> sufferings with which it should please God to visit him more patiently &amp; serenely
               than yourself, – this nevertheless is an affliction of the heaviest kind. It is very
               far from being the habit of my mind to indulge in visionary hopes, – but from what
               I recollect of the nature of your complaint, it is an inveterate inflammation, – &amp;
               this I believe to be compleatly within the reach of art.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It is a sad thought to me that you cannot <span class="strikethrough">read</span> &lt;see&gt; my history, – I trust however to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Cottlefamily">your sisters</a> for your hearing it. It will be published before the month is out, &amp; I shall direct
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> to send you a copy.</p>

I would &lt;not&gt; send you so short a letter upon any other occasion,
               – but I could not feel easy till I had written. I beseech you follow this advice,
               the difference between these London oculists of the first reputation &amp; any person
               at Bristol is far greater than you perhaps imagine. Send up your statement without
