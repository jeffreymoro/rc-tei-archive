            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your box has not made its appearance, – nevertheless I write, not waiting another
               day, because a letter may perhaps be longer in reaching S<sup>t</sup> Helens, than in travelling to London. My reason for writing is to protest against
               the horse, because as we have no stable establishment the keep of that four-footed
               fellow would be reckoned at <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> so much a day paid while you staid, &amp; thereby become a reason for your &lt;not&gt; staying
               so long as otherwise you might.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am not surprized at your feeling about <span class="strikethrough">the Spanish</span> sending troops to S America, – considering the character of the struggle in that country
                  when <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> both parties are so much in the right &amp; so much in the wong, – the natural feeling
                  is sorrow, contemplate it how you will. But the Regency (however wrong they as well
                  as their predecessors may have been in not preventing the troubles) have done wisely
                  in sending out troops, &amp; in fact could not act otherwise.

                           Spanish rule in its American colonies were causing some outrage at this time, e.g.
                           The Times, 16 January 1812. They referred in particular to the despatch of 4,000 men
                           to fight revolutionaries in Mexico in November 1811.</span></div>

                  no money but what the colonies supply, except what little may be raised in Cadiz.
                  If it be considered only in this direct political point of view you will not I think
                  condemn them, – but there is another &amp; higher <span class="strikethrough">point of view</span> consideration. My first feeling was sorrow, &amp; yet in that first feeling I could not
                  but feel that there was more of the old Roman spirit in this than in any act of modern
                  times. The enemy is at the gates, – &amp; yet they send out troops to secure their remotest
                  dependencies.</p>
