               <p>… Whenever I may be travelling westward (or rather southward), it will give me great
                  pleasure to halt awhile with you: – but my ties with that part of England are much
                  loosened. Death has cut up the dearest of them by the roots, &amp; my heart fails me when
                  I look that way. – According to the ordinary course of things I ought to have been
                  settled at this time in the west of England upon a fair fortune, but it has been my
                  lot to be twice disinherited by near relations to whom I never gave cause or shadow
                  of offence.

                  in this beautiful country I am too far from libraries, &amp; too far from my friends:
                  and going but seldom to London, I am old enough whenever I leave them to feel very
                  strongly the uncertainty of seeing them again. These things make one sometimes think
                  of moving, &amp; Bath generally presents itself as that place where a man of limited means
                  may enjoy most comforts.</p>

            <p class="indent1">And now my dear Sir, farewell. I am indebted to you for many hours of deep enjoyment,
               &amp; for great improvement in our common art, for your poems came into my hands when
               I was nineteen and I <span class="ital">fed</span> upon them. Our booby critics talk of <span class="ital">schools</span>, &amp; if they had had common discernment that might have perceived that I was of your
               school. But they are as deficient in judgement as they are in candour and in common
