            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It is somewhat late to speak of Christmas &amp; the New Year, – nevertheless I will wish
               you as many as you may be capable of enjoying, &amp; the more the better. Winter is passing
               on mildly with us, &amp; if &lt;it were not for&gt; our miry soil &amp; bad ways <span class="strikethrough">did not</span> I should not wish for pleasanter weather than January has brought with it. Ailments
               rather than inclination have led me of late to take regular exercise, which I was
               wont to think I could do without as well as a Turk: so I take two or three of the
               children with me, &amp; giving them leave to call upon me for their daily walk, their
               eagerness overcomes my propensities to the chair &amp; the desk. We now go before breakfast,
               for the sake of getting the first sunshine on the mountains, – which when the snow
               is on them is more glorious than at any other season. Yesterday I think I heard the
               Wild Swan; &amp; this morning had the finest sight of wild fowl I ever beheld. There was
               a cloud of them above the lake, <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> at such a height that frequently they became invisible; then twinkled into sight
               again, sometimes spreading like smoke <span class="strikethrough">when</span> &lt;as&gt; it ascends, then contracting as if performing some military evolution, once
               they formed a perfect bow; &amp; thus wheeling &amp; changing &amp; rising &amp; falling they continued
               to sport as long as I could watch them. They were probably wild ducks.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Your godson</a> is determined to be a Poet he says; &amp; I was not a little amused by his telling me

               him ask me sundry questions about it, – that the first poem which he should make should
               be about that hollow tree, – I have made some progress in rhyming the Greek accidents
               for him, – an easier thing than you would perhaps suppose it to be, <span class="strikethrough">Xxxxxxxxx</span> it tickles his humour, &amp; lays hold of his memory.</p>
