                  </div> The knowledge that this attempt was made in time, has saved me from the little sort
                  of repining which I might else have felt, in fancying that my application had failed
                  because it was preferred too late. – I wished for the office, not merely because it
                  would have secured to me a moderate competence, but because I should have made it
                  my pride to discharge the duties which ought to attach to it. The opportunity is lost,
                  – but I am not the less beholden to you for your friendly intentions &amp; endeavour.</p>
