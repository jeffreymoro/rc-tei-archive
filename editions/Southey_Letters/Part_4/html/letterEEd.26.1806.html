               <p>In the Courier of the 15<sup>th</sup> (which has this evening reached us) is an article pretending to exhibit imitations
                  from your poems &amp; signed S.T.C.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The Courier (15 September 1810) had published an article entitled ‘Some Imitations
                           of Scott’. This compared extracts from The Lay of the Last Minstrel and Marmion with
                           ones from Dryden, Baillie, Home, Ossian, Pope, Spenser, and Southey (Madoc) in an
                           attempt to prove that Scott had been ‘more particularly … guilty of imitation’.</span></div>
                  </div> At the first sight of this I was certain that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">S.T. Coleridge</a> had nothing to do with it, &amp; upon putting the paper into his hands, his astonishment
                  was equal to mine. What may be &lt;the&gt; motive of this dirty trick Heaven knows, – I
                  can only conjecture that the fellow who has practised it, designs in some other paper
                  or magazine to build up a charge of jealousy &amp; envy in Coleridge, – founded upon his
                  own forgery. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> declares he will write to the Courier, disavowing the signature, – I know he means
                  to do it, but his actions so little correspond to his intentions that I fear he will
                  delay doing it, – very probably till it is too late.
