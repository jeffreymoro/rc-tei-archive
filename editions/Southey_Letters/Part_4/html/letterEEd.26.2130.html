                  propriety of altering its form &amp; making but one volume, – an alteration, if it be
                  made, likely enough to prove fatal to the work, – certain at any rate to destroy all
                  the advantage gained by length &amp; uniformity of sets, which it is now beginning to
                  obtain, &amp; which is the only advantage the other Registers have over it. However this
                  may be I apprehend that the work is in some danger of not continuing beyond a fourth
                  volume, – an evil of considerable magnitude in its present respect to its poor historiographer,
                  but which I dare say he will think as little of as he has done of all such evils,
                  when it comes to the point. My time becomes of more marketable value every year; &amp;
