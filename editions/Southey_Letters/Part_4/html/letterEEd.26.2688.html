                           would form part of his work in progress, The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo (1816);
                           see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 19 December 1815, Letter 2685. The fullest
                           version of these verses, ‘Glory to Thee in Thine Omnipotence’, which survives is in
                           Southey’s notebook, Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733, ff. 44r-46r. They were

                  will bring me to the Field of Battle; thus far all is well, &amp; could not be otherwise;
                  it remains to be seen how I shall succeed when description is to be exchanged for <span class="strikethrough">reflection</span> a moral &amp; severe strain. As for making a poem <span class="ital">upon</span> the Battle as you advise, it would be just as possible to make a plum pudding of it,
                  – for battles as are unfit for poetry as they are for puddings; &amp; if you can find
                  a more dissimilar simily, you may substitute it as more to the purpose.</p>

                  duties had been paid upon these books, &amp; so petition that the money might be returned;
                  – I take it for granted the prayer is inadmissible, – but of two inadmissible things
