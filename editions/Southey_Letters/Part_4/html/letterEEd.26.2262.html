                  </div> Among the reasons which have induced me to give up my engagement with that work, one
                  has been the thought that it rather becomes me to erect a finished building myself
                  than to content myself with preparing materials for others.</p>

               <p>I should like to write the history of the war in the peninsular, &amp; deal with that
                  portion of the Register which relates to it, as I have done in the Life of Nelson
                  with the reviewal, out of which it grew.

                  </div> There are some parts which I could not alter without making them worse; – but the
                  general form &amp; arrangement would necessarily be new, – so much is there to correct,
                  to alter, &amp; to add from later documents. I have good channels of information open,
                  both in Spain &amp; Portugal, &amp; it will not be difficult to obtain access to the best
                  in this country. We are probably in the fifth act of the drama; – but should our operation
                  in Spain be continued even another year after the present I think two quartos would
                  comprize the history upon its proper scale.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I cannot execute the plan, till after a lapse of years, without the consent of the
               publisher of the Register. But if it appears to them <span class="strikethrough">that the book if properly executed must command a good sale, &amp; that</span> as it does to me, they will think that the subject must ensure a respectable sale
               to the book, &amp; that no man can undertake it with greater advantages. – I have written
               to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Mess<sup>r</sup> Longman</a> upon the subject , &amp; shall make the like communication to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">M<sup>r</sup> &lt;James&gt; Ballantyne</a>.</p>
