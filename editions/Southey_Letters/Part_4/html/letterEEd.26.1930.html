            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter has just reached me, having first travelled to Dublin by some post office
                  blunder. – It has put my plans most cruelly out of joint, for I had calculated upon
                  seeing you at Bath &amp; now I am perplexed how to shape my route so as to see you at
                  all. <span class="ital">Going</span> it cannot be, – for I have promised to stay a day or two with the mother &amp; sisters

                           Frances Moriah White (1791–1854); Catherine Bailey White (1795–1889).</span></div>
                  </div> of poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">H. Kirke White</a> at Nottingham, – as an engagement which I should not have made, had I known that you
                  would be at Teddesley. Then for coming back, I have promised to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</a> either at Bath, or at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Llanthony">Llanthony</a>, – from the latter place my road would be to Ludlow to visit the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BrowneWade">Brownes</a> (some <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> friends of later date than your laking year) – &amp; from thence we were engaged to halt
                  with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> at Llangedwin. Now just look at the map Senhora &amp; see how provokingly Abergavenny,
                  Ludlow, Oswestry &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</a> lie for any person who wants to go to all four places. Ludlow however may be struck
                  out. [Three lines crossed out].</p>

            <p class="indent1">Out of this scrape we must trust time to bring us – see you we will if you are at
               Teddesley on our return – but if I had known your motions only a fortnight sooner,
               we would have gone straight to Staffordshire &amp; not have included Nottingham in our
               journey.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We set out on Monday next, – &amp; I shall be closely employed till the very day in finishing
               this almost endless work. Being only two we shall for the sake of expence travel by
               stage as far as we can, &amp; we expect to be at Leeds on Tuesday night, – then I am afraid
               we must either lose a day or proceed in chaises, – which will be the least evil of
               the two.</p>
