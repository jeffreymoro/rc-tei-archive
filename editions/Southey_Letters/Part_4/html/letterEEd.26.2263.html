               &amp; twenty years, &amp; after that term make them over to the Carpenters Company, would
               not be more unjust than that which takes from me &amp; my heirs the property of my literary

               a restitution of the Authors rights than simply to make their complaint when you speak

                           unconditional 28 years or the life of the author if longer (rather than 14 years,
                           plus as much of another 14 years that the author might live). This was applied to
                           new publications and those already published by living authors. Posthumous works were
                           also given a copyright period of 28 years.</span></div>
                  </div> If the authors right of sale were limited to 14 years, would it not be practicable
                  to prevent the mode of destroying his interest which you foresee, by enacting that
                  after the expiration of the term from which the copyright was sold, he should be entitled
                  to a certain portion of the profits of the edition upon sale, – a moiety, which would
                  just put him upon the footing that booksellers are readiest to offer.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">An Author advanced in years can have no copyright to sell except of the works of his
               old age – the lease of all his others will be pretty far run out. I believe that very
               little more would be given <span class="strikethrough">for</span> by the bookseller for the double, than for the single term. <span class="strikethrough">– &amp; that to the author the latter part of the term</span> In reality the latter part of the term is <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> either worth nothing, – or more than the first. The gourd has produced its fruit
               &amp; is withered &amp; gone for ever, – <span class="strikethrough">The xxx</span> long before the olive begins to be productive. To the great body of authors it is
               the same thing whether their right of property <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxxx</span> expires at the end of fourteen years or <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> last till the day of judgement; – for even of the books which obtain reputation,
               not one in ten passes thro a second edition. But to those who <span class="strikethrough">acquire</span> really acquire a permanent rank in the literature of their country the injury <span class="strikethrough">becomes heavier year after the</span> is heavy indeed.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I should rather the right of sale were limited, – it would give the author some share
                  of those prizes in the lottery which now fall, almost wholly, to the bookseller. –
                  The second term would have enriched Cowper.
