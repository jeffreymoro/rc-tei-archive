            <p class="indent1">I reached home this morning, having travelled in the mail from Liverpool to Kendal,
               all night. We found every thing well, the children had not experienced the slightest
               ailment during our absence, – <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> we ourselves during twelve weeks had only had two days &lt;of&gt; wet weather, &amp; in the
               course of 800 miles which we travelled together, with another hundred which I travelled
               alone we never met with either accident delay, or any disagreable incident. Here then
               I am once more, God be thanked, in my own library &amp; by the fire side, more thoroughly
               weary of long indolence &amp; dissipation of mind than I ever was of the closest application.</p>

                           copyhold property. Thomas Southey was also trustee of some of the property at Fitzhead
                           of Cannon Southey (d. 1768), a distant cousin, whose complex will led to much litigation.</span></div>

                  any villainy, tho many circumstances seem to render it very probable that some has
                  been practised. About my own immediate concerns, I learn that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Mr. T.S.</a> sold ten acres of land recovered under Canon Southeys will, which it is believed he
                  could have no right to sell, my claim to it being prior to his: – this I shall write
