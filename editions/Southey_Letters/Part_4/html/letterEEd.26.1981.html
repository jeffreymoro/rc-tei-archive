               pretium est singulare artificium explanare. Plumas naturales radicitus evellunt. Locum
               unde avulsæ fuerunt plumæ, manu perfricant, donee rubescat, sanguisque inde scaturiat.
               Plumarum veterum poris, seu alveolis, succum ejus coloris quem volunt, instillant,
               imprimuntque. Si alis, si caudæ, flavum, si cæruleum, si purpureum colorem infuderint,
               pennæ flavæ, cæruleæ, purpureie sensim subnascentur. Id apud Brasilios, Quaranios,
               et (teste P. J. Sanchez Labrador) apud Mbayas barbaros usu receptum. Sed, ut idem
               observavit, vere, vel autumno ineunte id præsturi ab Indes. Colorem viridem in flavum
               facillime mutari: plumis flavis si evellantur, non nisi flavas succrescere. Hæc illius
