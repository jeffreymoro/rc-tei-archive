                  their horses heels. I was very well inclined to put this thought out of my head, if
                  some of the very few persons whom I see here had not shown me by their enquiries that
                  it would come into other heads as well as mine. The subjects for their kind were the
                  best possible, – so I fell to in good earnest, &amp; have written three odes in Thalaban

               Gabriel Suchet, 1st Duc d’Albufera (1770–1826), Marshal of France, saw action at the
               first siege of Tarragona, 1811 and in the same year was captured by Eroles. Baudouin
               spent time in Britain as a prisoner of war, and at one point was held at Oswestry,
               in Shropshire. On his release, he visited the Wordsworths before returning to France.
               Baudouin had made contact with Wordsworth in 1812 via mutual acquaintances: his brother
               was engaged to Caroline (1792–1862), daughter of Wordsworth and Annette Vallon (1766–1841).
               Caroline and Jean Baptiste Baudouin (b. c. 1780) married in February 1816. Southey
               travelled to France and visited them and their infant daughter in 1817, when he also
               renewed his acquaintance with Eustace Baudouin; see Southey to Edith Southey, 17 May
