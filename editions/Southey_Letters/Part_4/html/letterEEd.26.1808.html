               rapes Julian’s daughter, Florinda, thus provoking the Count’s actions. Southey had
               already dealt with the same subject matter in his ‘Monodrama. Florinda’, later retitled
               ‘La Caba’, first published in <em>The Iris</em>, 21 July 1804.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
