            <p class="indent1">Your letter, M<sup>r</sup> Evans, <span class="strikethrough">has</span> did not reach me till this afternoon, not having been put into the Manchester post
               office till the 17<sup>th</sup> as I perceive by the post-mark. You will easily imagine that I have received letters
               from many persons telling me of their love for literature, &amp; their attempts in verse.
               I have always answered such letters according to the best of my judgement, &amp; have
               but too frequently been <span class="strikethrough">thus</span> obliged to discourage the ardour of good feelings &amp; generous desires. This has been
               a mournful task, – but I reply to you with the sincerest &amp; deepest pleasure. <span class="strikethrough">because</span> With the goodness &amp; the true wisdom which you appear to possess, your intellectual
               endowments &amp; acquirements instead of leading you astray, can only encrease your happiness
               by giving you new sources of enjoyment. Believe me, you can never have derived greater
               pleasure from any works of mine than I feel at hearing that they have been read with
               pleasure by a man like you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I will most willingly peruse any papers that you may entrust to me, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> give you an honest opinion upon the probable utility of committing them to the press,
               &amp; if that measure should appear advisable, render you most gladly every assistance
               in my power. Any letter may be sent to me under cover to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">C W Williams Wynn Esq<sup>r</sup>.</a> M. P. Llangedwin near Oswestry, but letter &amp; inclosure must not exceed an ounce weight.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Tell me more of yourself, – your age, – &amp; if you are married or single &amp;c. Tell me
               also the name of the gentleman whose indulgence you mention, – that I may know who
               it is that has thus entitled himself to the respect of all good men.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I hope this letter will not be too late to find your acquaintance at Manchester.
