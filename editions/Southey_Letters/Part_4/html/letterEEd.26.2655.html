                  But I have a dolorous void within me. I had no dinner yesterday, &amp; no supper – &amp; the
                  breakfast which I had was lost upon the way. True it is that after a mournful parting
                  with my breakfast (you know the pain of such partings) I ate bread &amp; cheese, &amp; drank
                  porter, &amp; added to my meat a slice of German sausage civilly offered <span class="strikethrough">b</span> me by a fellow passenger, but I accepted it only as receiver for the fishes, &amp; in

                  that I was below in my berth when I wished to have seen the entrance of the port.
                  Little was lost in this. The Ramsgate captain cheated me, – a la Ramsgate. The agent
                  for the packet, seeing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</a> size, demanded 16 shillings for her, – the captain when he saw her asked for one pound.
                  We offered to pay, &amp; he desired to be paid at Ostend, – then he demanded full price
                  for her, – alledging that she had occupied a whole berth. This he knew she must of
                  necessity do when he saw her. Of course I paid the money without dispute, &amp; now write
                  down <span class="strikethrough">X</span> Capt Aylesbury of the Lord Liverpool for a picaroon.

                  due to the <span class="strikethrough">peo</span> natives. So we left our luggage for the present. I fear the rain will continue. The
                  boat for Bruges starts at three in the afternoon, – perhaps we shall not find apartments
