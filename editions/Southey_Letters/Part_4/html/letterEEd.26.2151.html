                  answered at the time (our letters having crossed each other upon the road), was jostled
                  out of remembrance, by the dissipation in which summer guests and summer visitors
                  involve me, when I am not occupied by my too numerous and pressing engagements. Let
                  me now endeavour to make amends. The best grammar of any language is the shortest.
