               <p>It was but yesterday that I enquired of Murray whether I might avail myself of your
                  name to frank up copy for the printer. Your friendly letter encourages me to do so
                  now – without waiting for permission.

               <p>You would certainly have seen <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> me had I been in London; but here I am, &amp; here I shall be quill-driving till the end
                  of April,

                  </div> when I hope to gain leisure for a five weeks run to the South. Twenty years ago I
                  also could write one or two hundred lines a day, – &amp; even at a later time (1799) 1200
                  of the best lines which I ever wrote were produced in one week.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> I am now comparatively a slow writer, – rejecting more of what occurs, less easily
                  satisfied with what is not rejected, &amp; less ardent in what was once my passionate
                  pursuit. You need not be told that there is no intellectual exertion so delightful
                  as that of composing a great poem: – but my mind has attained a sort of quietism from
                  which it does not willingly permit itself to be roused, patient historical research
                  is of all employments that which is &lt;now&gt; most <span class="strikethrough">delightful</span> &lt;congenial&gt; to me, &amp; if my own inclinations alone were to be consulted I should lay
                  aside all other avocations &amp; devote myself exclusively to the completion of my Portugueze
                  histories.

                  </div> Yonder they lie unfinished upon the shelf, – half-a yards length of manuscripts, the
                  work of many years. Time passes on, grey hairs begin to show themselves, every year
                  brings with it less leisure than the last: I am of a short-lived race, &amp; sometimes
                  regret that any thing should compel me thus to leave undone that which, in all human
                  probability, no other person will ever undertake with half the advantages that I have
                  possessed.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The sole temptation which I have for proceeding with the poems which I am perpetually
               building in the air, is to gratify a few persons who love me, &amp; a few (they are very
               few) of whose approbation I am ambitious. As for reputation hereafter, if what I have
               done will not secure me that, it were idle to hope it from any thing which I shall
               ever do. In other points, I hope, by Gods blessing to continue to learn as long as
               I live: but as a poet I <span class="strikethrough">be</span> am full-grown <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> the quantity of my poems may be increased – doubled – quintupled – decupled, if there
               were a demand for the article, – but their value must be determined by assay – not
               by weight, &amp; nothing that I can now produce will alter that.</p>

                  affecting any distrust of myself, or any remarkable facility of <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> &lt;submitting&gt; my own opinions in such matters, I am yet very sincerely desirous of
                  hearing criticism while it is possible to profit by it, &amp; if you will do me the favour
                  to look over these papers when you feel inclination &amp; have leisure, with a fault-finding
                  eye, – the poem will probably be the better for it. They are in the hands of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHenry">M<sup>r</sup> Bedford’s brother</a>, &amp; he will convey them to you at any time that you may signify such a wish.</p>
