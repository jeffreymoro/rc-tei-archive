                  alarmed me more deeply, because I have long distinctly seen the causes which were
                  at work to produce it. The counteracting causes on which my hopes were founded have
                  not kept pace with them. At this moment nothing but the army preserves us from the
                  most dreadful of all imaginable calamities, – an insurrection of the poor against
                  the rich, – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">whether</span> how long the army may be depended upon is a question which I scarcely dare ask myself.

                  is uniformly &amp; inevitably punished by the loss of liberty. – The danger, I will show
                  in the Quarterly, – but I believe the best means of stirring up the public mind is
                  thro the newspapers, &amp; there I shall not fear to recommend measures, which would <span class="strikethrough">bring an</span> raise an outcry against the review.</p>
