                  </div> My own books are published upon no better terms than <span class="strikethrough">that</span> those of sharing the profits with the publisher, &amp; I have never yet been successful
                  enough in the sale way to feel <span class="strikethrough">just</span> authorized in demanding more. But there has been another cause for this, – my hands
                  have been tied, – more perhaps from a point of feeling on my own part than from any
                  actual necessity, – I have been connected with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> as a publisher for many years, – he has always answered my drafts, as much to my convenience
                  at all times, as to his own eventual profit, – &amp; this <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> has kept me hitherto on the wrong side of his books, tho my share of the property
                  in his hands has always been far more than would turn the balance in my favour. But
                  things being thus a sense of delicacy rather than obligation makes me go on with him
                  upon the old terms. – You see I am rambling from your concerns to <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> my own: but this statement may serve to show that an arrangement for sharing the eventual
                  profits is not an unfavourable one, – &amp; that any bargain which secures to you half
                  eventually, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> puts you in immediate posession of any part in advance may be considered a good one.</p>
