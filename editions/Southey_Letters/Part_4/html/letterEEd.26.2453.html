               <p>The fault which has been committed about the slave trade arose from the principle

                           and committed France to abolish the slave trade within five years.</span></div>
                  </div> Unquestionably it was a great point to re-establish the Bourbons, and it was good
                  policy to separate the cause of Bonaparte from that of France; this latter point you
                  know I have often endeavoured to enforce. But the French had no merit to plead in
                  deserting their tyrant; their suppleness and their fear made them stand by him to
                  the last, and their capital was in consequence conquered. Blucher

                  and flattered the crowned heads into an ostentatious display of what is magnanimity

                  the cessions which we have made were to purchase certain equivalent arrangements on
                  the continent. To this it may be replied that for any arrangements in which we were
                  directly or indirectly concerned, we made an ample equivalent by restoring Gascony,
                  then subject to the British arms.

                  have not fully understood their own strength, nor adequately supported the pride and
                  power of their country. “Whatever we may restore,” they should have said, “ is on
                  our part a mere gift. You have no equivalent to offer, and no possibility of recovering

                  the time appointed will be fulfilled, even if it be not affected sooner. There are

                  virtuous, – you will perceive what difficulties are to be encountered in countries

                  so far sunk into a savage state, that upon the great scale of things, they might be
                  considered as barren fig-trees – to be hewn down:

                  I feel the weight of the objection; but am, at the same time, satisfied that it resolves
                  itself into the great question of the origin of evil: that, comparing it with the
                  good which there is in the world, the evil seems to me as much lost as the filth and
                  impurity of our navigated rivers is in the sea; that what evil there is is temporary
                  as to individuals, and evanescent as to the species, and that a future state sets
                  all to rights. I thought to have said something respecting Norway, and upon the state
