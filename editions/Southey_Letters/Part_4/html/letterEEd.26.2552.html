                  left him at the first inhabited place, with assurances to the inhabitants of ample
                  payment if they delivered him at the coast. But for a medical man to drag them along

                  </div> Should you cast your eye upon it you will see how important it is that I should correct

                  of those little alterations which improving either the perspicuity of a sentence,
                  or its mere sound, <span class="strikethrough">make xx xx xx</span> &lt;are felt in&gt; the general effect of the style.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">And now let me solicit a favour of you. I never complain of alterations in my articles,
               or remonstrate against them, – tho it is not possible that any mans writings can suffer

               out part of a paragraph destroys this, – &amp; the parts which are then joined together
               look as a hand would do if it could be fixed to the elbow after the arm were taken
               away. I say this in confidence, – &amp; what I have to ask <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> is, that as the articles are always set up as they are printed, I should be greatly
               obliged to you if in future you would have a second set of proofs struck off which
               I might preserve for my own satisfaction &amp; use: much being lost in this way, of which
