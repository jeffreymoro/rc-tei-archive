               Although they achieved some success, the British fleet failed to destroy the French
               navy completely. Captain Thomas Cochrane, later 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775–1860;
               <em>DNB</em>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of the battle, accused
               his commanding officer, the evangelical Admiral James Gambier, Baron Gambier (1756–1833;
               <em>DNB</em>), of being reluctant to pursue the attack and thus achieve a complete victory. Cochrane
               was also an MP with a reputation for exposing abuses of office, and, in the weeks
               after the battle, he pursued his campaign against Gambier via parliamentary speeches.
               Gambier demanded a court-martial at which he was exonerated and, by implication, Cochrane
               was convicted of libelling a superior officer. Whilst Gambier received public thanks
               from parliament for his actions in the battle, Cochrane was not permitted to rejoin
               his ship for a few months. When he received new orders to serve in the Meditteranean,
               Cochrane refused and went on half-pay, devoting his time to exposing abuses in the
               Admiralty. For Southey’s account, <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</em>, 2.1 (1811), 364–379. Southey had requested that the proofs of his discussion of
               the Battle of the Basque Roads be sent to Tom Southey; see Southey to John Rickman,
