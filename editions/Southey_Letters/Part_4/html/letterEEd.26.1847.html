            <p class="indent1">I fancied that I had written to you at no very distant date, – but I believe the circumstances
               of having said something to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontaguAnna">Mrs Montagu</a> which I meant also to have said to you, has been running in my head as if you had
               received it. – This circumstance is, that the presence of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontaguAnna">Mrs M</a>. disturbed me during her whole stay at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, – first by the very striking resemblance which she bears to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> , – &amp; that when that feeling was abated, by a perpetual apprehension that she was
               in a far worse state of health than any other person supposed her to be, – in fact
               that she [was] wasting away by some species of atrophy. This of course I have not
               told her. But being exceedingly struck, as you may well conceive, by her whole mind
               &amp; manner, – it constantly hung upon me.</p>
