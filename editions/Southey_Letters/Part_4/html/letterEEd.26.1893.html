               <p>Upon receiving advice from my bookseller of the contents of a parcel sent per waggon,
                  I was at a loss to guess who could have presented me with a treatise upon Bullion.

                  </div> I had made up my mind to the satisfactory conclusion that it was one of those things
                  for which I had no capacity, a conclusion to me perfectly satisfactory, for I have
                  long perceived the necessity of being ignorant on many points, and am neither more
                  sorry nor more ashamed of an inaptitude for finance, than for the want of a musical
                  ear, or a hand for painting. It is true I had a sort of saving opinion that when any
                  thing was clearly understood, it could not be very difficult to make a man of fair
                  intellect understand, and therefore when there any wide difference upon principles,
                  and both parties appeared perplexed, I thought it exceedingly probable that both were
                  still in the dark.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have proved this to the case upon the Bullion question, and of all the discoveries
                  which have been talked of in our days (setting the chemists aside) unless I am grievously
                  mistaken, yours is the only one which will stand the test of time and sound criticism.

                  (to my knowledge) been advanced before, and when once advanced, like the discovery
                  of gravitation, it makes that the subject of science which before was only hypothesis
