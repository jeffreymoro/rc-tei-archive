            <p>Address: To/ Walter Savage Esq<sup>re</sup>/ Swansea./ Single Sheet<br>Stamped: KESWICK/ 298<br>MS: National Art Library, London, MS Forster 48 G.31 2/26–27<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: Southey’s letter to Landor of 21 March 1814, Letter 2393, contained the
               fourteenth book of <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814) and promised ‘more tomorrow’. As this letter contains the fifteenth book of
               <em>Roderick</em>, it was probably the ‘more’ that was promised for 22 March 1814.</p>

               <div class="l">Thro thinly scattered leaves &amp; boughs grotesque,</div>

               <div class="l">Ripples &amp; glances on the confluent streams</div>

               <div class="l">The watchman on the battlements partakes</div>
               <div class="l">The stillness of the solemn hour: he feels</div>

               <div class="l">Hears all around the deep &amp; long drawn breath</div>
               <div class="l">Of sleep; for gentle night hath brought to these</div>
               <div class="l">Perfect &amp; undisturbed repose, alike</div>
               <div class="l">Of corporal powers &amp; inward faculty.</div>
               <div class="l">Wakeful the while he lay, yet more by hope</div>
               <div class="l">Than grief or anxious thoughts possessd, – tho grief</div>
               <div class="l">For Guisla’s guilt, which freshened in his heart</div>
               <div class="l">The memory of their wretched mothers crime,</div>
               <div class="l">Still made its presence felt, like the dull sense</div>
               <div class="l">Of some perpetual inward malady;</div>
               <div class="l">And the whole peril of the future lay</div>
               <div class="l">Before him clearly seen. He had heard all, –</div>
               <div class="l">How that unworthy sister, obstinate</div>
               <div class="l">In wrong &amp; shameless, rather seemd to woo</div>
               <div class="l">The upstart renegado, than to wait</div>
               <div class="l">His wooing; how as guilt to guilt led on,</div>
               <div class="l">Spurning at gentle admonition first,</div>
               <div class="l">When Gaudiosa hopelessly forbore</div>
               <div class="l">From farther counsel, then in sullen mood</div>
               <div class="l">Resentful, Guisla soon began to hate</div>
               <div class="l">The virtuous presence before which she felt</div>
               <div class="l">Her nature how inferior, &amp; her fault</div>
               <div class="l">How foul. Despiteful thus she grew, because</div>
               <div class="l">Humbled yet unrepentant. Who could say</div>
               <div class="l">To what excess bad passions might impel</div>
               <div class="l">A woman thus possessd? She could not fail</div>
               <div class="l">To mark Siverians absence, – for what end</div>
               <div class="l">Her conscience but too surely had divined,</div>
               <div class="l">And Gaudiosa well aware that all</div>
               <div class="l">Thus was to her vile paramour made known</div>
               <div class="l">Had to safe hiding-place with timely fear</div>
               <div class="l">Removed her children. Well the event had proved</div>
               <div class="l">How needful was the caution; for at night</div>
               <div class="l">She sought the mountain solitudes, &amp; morn</div>
               <div class="l">Beheld Numacians soldiers at the gates.</div>
               <div class="l">Yet did not sorrow in Pelayo’s heart</div>
               <div class="l">For this domestic shame prevail that hour,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor gathering danger weigh his spirit down;</div>
               <div class="l">The anticipated meeting put to flight</div>
               <div class="l">These painful thoughts; tomorrow will restore</div>
               <div class="l">All whom his heart holds dear, his wife beloved</div>
               <div class="l">No longer now remembered for regret,</div>
               <div class="l">Is present to his soul with hope &amp; joy;</div>
               <div class="l">His inward eye beholds Favila’s form</div>
               <div class="l">In opening youth robust, &amp; Hermesind</div>
               <div class="l">His daughter, lovely as a budding rose:</div>
               <div class="l">Their images beguile the hours of night</div>
               <div class="l">Till with the earliest morning he may seek</div>
               <div class="l">Their secret hold.</div>
               <div class="l">The nightingale not yet</div>
               <div class="l">Had ceased her song, nor had the lark forsook</div>
               <div class="l">Her dewey nest, when he began his way</div>
               <div class="l">Toward Auseva. Heavily to him,</div>
               <div class="l">Impatient for the morrows happiness</div>
               <div class="l">Long night had lingered, but it seem d more long</div>
               <div class="l">To Rodericks aching heart. He too had watchd</div>
               <div class="l">For dawn, &amp; seen the earliest break of day</div>
               <div class="l">And heard its earliest sounds; &amp; when the Prince</div>
               <div class="l">Went forth, the melancholy man was seen</div>
               <div class="l">With pensive face upon Pionias side</div>
               <div class="l">Wandering alone &amp; slow. For he had left</div>
               <div class="l">The wearying place of his unrest, that morn</div>
               <div class="l">With its cold dews might bathe his throbbing brow</div>
               <div class="l">And with its breath allay the feverish heat</div>
               <div class="l">That burnt within. Alas the gales of morn</div>
               <div class="l">Reach not the fever of a wounded heart!</div>
               <div class="l">How shall he meet his mothers eye, – how make</div>
               <div class="l">His secret known, &amp; from that voice revered</div>
               <div class="l">Obtain forgiveness, all that he has now</div>
               <div class="l">To ask, ere on the lap of earth in peace</div>
               <div class="l">He lay his head resignd. In silent prayer</div>
               <div class="l">He supplicated Heaven to strengthen him</div>
               <div class="l">Against that trying hour, there seeking aid</div>
               <div class="l">Where all who seek shall find; &amp; thus his soul</div>
               <div class="l">Received support, &amp; gathered fortitude</div>
               <div class="l">Never than now more needful, for the hour</div>
               <div class="l">Was nigh. He saw Siverian drawing near</div>
               <div class="l">And with a dim but quick foreboding met</div>
               <div class="l">The good old man: yet when he heard him say</div>
               <div class="l">My Lady sends to seek thee, like a knell</div>
               <div class="l">To one expecting &amp; prepared for death,</div>
               <div class="l">But fearing the dread point that hastens on,</div>
               <div class="l">It smote his heart. He followed silently</div>
               <div class="l">And knit his suffering spirit to the proof</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">He went resolved to tell his mother all,</div>
               <div class="l">Fall at her feet, &amp; drinking the last dregs</div>
               <div class="l">Of bitterness receive the only good</div>
               <div class="l">Earth had in store for him. Resolved for this</div>
               <div class="l">He went, yet was it a relief to find</div>
               <div class="l">That painful resolution must await</div>
               <div class="l">A fitter season, when no eye but Heavens</div>
               <div class="l">Might witness to their mutual agony.</div>
               <div class="l">Count Julians daughter with Rusilla sate,</div>
               <div class="l">Both had been weeping, both were pale, but calm.</div>
               <div class="l">With head as for humility abased</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick approach’d, &amp; bending, on his breast</div>
               <div class="l">He cross’d his humble arms. Rusilla rose</div>
               <div class="l">In reverence to the priestly character,</div>
               <div class="l">And with a mournful eye regarding him</div>
               <div class="l">Thus she began. Good Father, I have heard</div>
               <div class="l">From my old faithful servant &amp; true friend</div>
               <div class="l">Thou didst reprove the inconsiderate tongue</div>
               <div class="l">That in the anguish of its spirit pour’d</div>
               <div class="l">A curse upon my poor unhappy child,</div>
               <div class="l">O Father Maccabee this is a hard world</div>
               <div class="l">And hasty in its judgements! Time has been</div>
               <div class="l">When not a tongue in the Pyrenees</div>
               <div class="l">Dared whisper in dispraise of Rodericks name,</div>
               <div class="l">Lest if the conscious air had caught the sound</div>
               <div class="l">The vengeance of the honest multitude</div>
               <div class="l">Should fall upon the traitrous head, or brand</div>
               <div class="l">For life-long infamy the lying lips.</div>
               <div class="l">Now if a voice be raised in his behalf</div>
               <div class="l">Tis noted for a wonder, &amp; the man</div>
               <div class="l">Who utters the strange speech shall be admired</div>
               <div class="l">For such excess of Christian charity!</div>
               <div class="l">Thy Christian charity hath not been lost, –</div>
               <div class="l">Father, – I feel its virtues. It hath been</div>
               <div class="l">Balm to my heart, – with words &amp; grateful tears.</div>
               <div class="l">All that is left me now for gratitude – </div>
               <div class="l">I thank thee, &amp; beseech thee in thy prayers</div>
               <div class="l">That thou wouldst still remember Rodericks name.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Roderick so long had to this hour look d on</div>
               <div class="l">That when the central point of trial came</div>
               <div class="l">Torpid &amp; numbed it found him: cold he grew</div>
               <div class="l">And as the vital spirits to his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Retreated, oer his withered countenance</div>
               <div class="l">Deathly &amp; damp a whiter paleness spread.</div>
               <div class="l">Unmoved the while this inward feeling seemd,</div>
               <div class="l">Even in such dull insensibility</div>
               <div class="l">As gradual age brings on, or slow disease</div>
               <div class="l">Beneath whose progress lingering life survives</div>
               <div class="l">The power of suffering. Wondering at himself,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet gathering confidence, he raised his eyes,</div>
               <div class="l">Then slowly shaking as he bent his head,</div>
               <div class="l">O venerable Lady, he replied,</div>
               <div class="l">If aught may comfort that unhappy soul</div>
               <div class="l">It must be thy compassion &amp; thy prayers.</div>
               <div class="l">She whom he must have wronged, – she who alone</div>
               <div class="l">On earth can grant forgiveness for his crime,</div>
               <div class="l">She hath forgiven him; &amp; thy blessing now</div>
               <div class="l">Were all that he could ask, – all that could bring</div>
               <div class="l">Profit or consolation to his soul</div>
               <div class="l">If he hath been, – as sure we may believe –</div>
               <div class="l">A penitent sincere.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh had he lived,</div>
               <div class="l">Replied Rusillla, never penitence</div>
               <div class="l">Had equalled his! full well I know his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Vehement in all things. – He would on himself</div>
               <div class="l">Have wreakd such penance as had reachd the height</div>
               <div class="l">Of fleshly suffering; – yea, which being told</div>
               <div class="l">With its portentous rigour should have made</div>
               <div class="l">The memory of his fault, oerpowered &amp; lost</div>
               <div class="l">In shuddering pity &amp; astonishment,</div>
               <div class="l">Fade like a feebler horror. Otherwise</div>
               <div class="l">Seem’d good to Heaven. I murmur not, nor doubt</div>
               <div class="l">The boundless mercy of redeeming love.</div>
               <div class="l">For sure I trust that not in his offence</div>
               <div class="l">Hardened &amp; reprobate was my lost son,</div>
               <div class="l">A child of wrath, cut off MS obscured] that dreadful thought</div>

               <div class="l">Smiling benignant then amid her tears</div>
               <div class="l">She took Florinda by the hand, &amp; said,</div>

               <div class="l">The broken heart. O Lady thou mayest trust</div>
               <div class="l">In humble hope thro him who on the Cross</div>
               <div class="l">Gave his atoning blood for lost mankind,</div>
               <div class="l">To meet beyond the grave thy child forgiven,</div>
               <div class="l">I too with Roderick there may interchange</div>
               <div class="l">Forgiveness. But the grief which wastes away</div>
               <div class="l">This mortal <span class="strikethrough">part</span> &lt;frame&gt;, hastening the happy hour</div>
               <div class="l">Of my enlargement, is but a light part</div>
               <div class="l">Of what my soul endures; – that grief hath lost</div>
               <div class="l">Its sting: – I have a keener sorrow here</div>
               <div class="l">One which, – but God forefend that dire event</div>
               <div class="l">May pass with me the portals of the grave,</div>
               <div class="l">And with a thought, like sin which cannot die,</div>
               <div class="l">Embitter Heaven. My father hath renounced</div>
               <div class="l">His hope in Christ: – it was his love for me</div>
               <div class="l">Which drove him to perdition, – I was born</div>
               <div class="l">To ruin all who loved me, – all I loved.</div>
               <div class="l">Perhaps I sinn d in leaving him, – that fear</div>
               <div class="l">Rises within me to disturb the peace</div>
               <div class="l">Which I should else have found! –</div>
               <div class="l">To Roderick then</div>
               <div class="l">The pious mourner turnd her suppliant eyes,</div>
               <div class="l">O Father there is virtue in thy prayers, –</div>
               <div class="l">I do beseech thee offer them to Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">In his behalf! for Rodericks sake, for mine</div>
               <div class="l">Wrestle with Him whose name is merciful</div>
               <div class="l">That Julian may with penitence be touchd,</div>
               <div class="l">And clinging to the Cross implore that grace</div>
               <div class="l">Which neer was sought in vain. For Rodericks sake</div>
               <div class="l">And mine, pray for him! We have been the cause</div>
               <div class="l">Of his offence! What other miseries</div>
               <div class="l">May from that same unhappy source have risen,</div>
               <div class="l"><span class="strikethrough">X</span> Are earthly, temporal, reparable all; –</div>
               <div class="l">But if a soul be lost thro our misdeeds</div>
               <div class="l">That were eternal evil! Pray for him</div>
               <div class="l">Good Father Maccabee, &amp; be thy prayers</div>
               <div class="l">More fervent, as the deeper is the crime.</div>

               <div class="l">While thus Florinda spake, the Dog who lay</div>
               <div class="l">Before Rusillas feet, eyeing him long</div>
               <div class="l">And wistfully [MS obscured] recognized at length,</div>
               <div class="l">Changed as he was, &amp; in those sordid weeds</div>
               <div class="l">His royal master. And he rose &amp; licked</div>
               <div class="l">His withered hand, &amp; earnestly look’d up</div>
