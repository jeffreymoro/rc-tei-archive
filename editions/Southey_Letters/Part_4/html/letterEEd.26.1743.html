                  unhappily in these times renders it peculiar. My rule of writing, whether for prose
                  or verse is the same, &amp; may very shortly be stated – it is to express myself 1<sup>st</sup> as perspicuously as possible, 2<sup>d</sup> – as concisely as possible, 3<sup>d</sup> as impressively as possible. This is the way to be understood &amp; felt &amp; remembered.
                  But there is an obtuseness of heart &amp; of understanding which it is impossible to reach,
                  – &amp; if you have seen the reviewals of Madoc, after having read the poem, you will
                  perceive that almost in every part or passage which they have selected for censure,
                  they have mist the meaning. For instance – the Edinburgh sneers at the beginning of
                  the 3 section Part 2. &amp; the words My own dear Mothers child – as inane.

                  </div> Now as for the speech itself if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Mr Jeffray</a> had not good feeling enough in his nature to feel its dramatic truth &amp; fitness in

                  who reflected upon its meaning with a moments due attention, give it a peculiar force.
                  For in that state of society most of the Kings children were by different mothers,
                  – of course when Madoc addressed his sister as his mothers child, more affecting remembrances
                  &amp; more love were implied in that single expression, than a whole speech could convey
                  with equal expressiveness. – The Eclectic ridicules ‘Wilt thou come hither Prince

                  </div> – I am utterly ignorant of the nature &amp; essence of poetry, if that be not one of the
                  finest scenes that I have ever been able to produce.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The metre has been criticised with equal incapacity on the part of the critics. Milton
               &amp; Shakespere are the standards of blank verse, – in these writers every variety of
               it is to be found, &amp; by this standard I desire to be measured. The redundant verses,
               (when the redundant syllable <span class="strikethrough">be</span> &lt;is&gt; any where except at the end of the line) are formed upon the admitted principle
               that two short syllables are equal in time to one long one. The truth is that tho
               the knack of versifying is a gift, the art is an acquirement. I versified more rapidly
               at sixteen than now at six &amp; thirty. But it requires a knowledge of that art to criticise
               upon the structure of verse, nor is it sufficient &lt;merely&gt; to understand the regular
               tune of <span class="strikethrough">blank</span> &lt;the&gt; metre, – a parrot might be taught that. In the sweep of blank verse, the whole
               paragraph must be taken into consideration before the merit or demerit of a single
               line, or sometimes of a single word, can be understood. Yet <span class="strikethrough">one of</span> these critics are everlastingly picking out single lines &amp; condemning their cadence
               as bad. <span class="strikethrough">In xxx</span> This might be true if the line could possibly stand alone, – But were I to cut one
               of the critics fingers off &amp; tell him it was only fit for a tobacco stopper, – that
               would be true also, – because the act of amputation <span class="strikethrough">had</span> made it so.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You appreciate the story with true judgement, &amp; have laid your finger upon its faulty
               parts. This it is to have the inborn feeling of a poet. Of the language you are not
               so good a judge because you have not mastered the art, &amp; are not <span class="strikethrough">read</span> well read in the poets of Shakesperes age. You cannot read Shakespere, Spenser Milton
               &amp; the Elizabethan dramatists too much. <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> There is no danger of catching their faults.</p>
