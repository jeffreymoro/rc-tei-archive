                           Gabriel Suchet, 1st Duc d’Albufera (1770–1826), Marshal of France, and saw action
                           at the first siege of Tarragona, 1811. In the same year he was captured by the guerilla
                           army of Joaquin Cuevas Ibanez y de Valonga, Baron de Eroles (1784–1825). Baudouin
                           spent time in Britain as a prisoner of war, and at one point was held at Oswestry,
                           in Shropshire. On his release, he visited the Wordsworths before returning to France.
                           Baudouin had made contact with Wordsworth in 1812 via mutual acquaintances: his brother

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">4.. </span><span class="noteBody">The French officer was Eustace Baudouin (b. c. 1792). He served in the army of Louis
               Gabriel Suchet, 1st Duc d’Albufera (1770–1826), Marshal of France, and saw action
               at the first siege of Tarragona, 1811. In the same year he was captured by the guerilla
               army of Joaquin Cuevas Ibanez y de Valonga, Baron de Eroles (1784–1825). Baudouin
               spent time in Britain as a prisoner of war, and at one point was held at Oswestry,
               in Shropshire. On his release, he visited the Wordsworths before returning to France.
               Baudouin had made contact with Wordsworth in 1812 via mutual acquaintances: his brother
               was engaged to Caroline (1792–1862), daughter of Wordsworth and Annette Vallon (1766–1841).
               Caroline and Jean Baptiste Baudouin (b. c. 1780) married in February 1816. Southey
               travelled to France and visited them and their infant daughter in 1817, when he also
               renewed his acquaintance with Eustace Baudouin, who had retained his dislike for potatoes;
