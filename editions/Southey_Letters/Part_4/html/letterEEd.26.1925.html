            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My influence with the Quarterly Review is not what you seem to suppose it. I have
                  no personal knowledge either of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">publisher</a> or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">editor</a>,

                  </div> never having seen either of them. But were it otherwise, an article designed for that
                  work would not derive any advantage from passing thro my hands. If it be sent up to
                  the publisher, it will be delivered over to the editor, &amp; he will insert it, or not,
                  according to his own judgement. That the article in question should appear in the
                  next number is probably impossible, – for the arrangements for it must have been compleated
                  by this time. The best method which I can advise is, that the MS should be sent to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> thro <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">M<sup>r</sup> John Ballantyne</a>, who no doubt must have frequent opportunities of sending it, &amp; when I see him, as
                  I shall do soon after my arrival in London, I will repeat your statement, which will
                  certainly have the effect of making him wish to insert a reviewal written for such
                  motives.

                  to myself than that of the preceding year, because I have had ampler materials, especially
                  for the Spanish part &amp; the public must be very unreasonable if they do not perceive
                  that its great increase of length is attributable to the greater number of events
                  to be recorded, not to any prolixity in the writer.</p>
