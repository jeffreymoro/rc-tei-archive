                  </div> It was always my opinion that he would leave most of what he had to the Olivers, with
                  which &lt;family&gt; he has been on the closest terms of card-playing intimacy ever since
                  I can recollect. The person in question he knew much better than any of his nephews;
                  &amp; therefore I do not think him very unreasonable in preferring him to them. Of any
                  injustice I fully acquit him. Had it had been an old family property the case would
                  have &lt;been&gt; different, – it would then have been a wrong to those from whom he received
                  it, &amp; to those for whom he held it in trust, – but as it was the matter is very different.
                  “<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John</a>, says <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</a>, made himself a slave to get this trash, – he has made himself a fool to give it

                  account for – unfortunately it is not that sort of insanity of which the law takes
                  cognizance.</p>
