            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The more necessary it becomes for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> to exert himself in providing means for meeting the growing demands of his children,
               the more incapable, by some strange and fatal infirmity, does he become of exertion.
               Knowing his prodigious powers, and that there is no bodily disease which incapacitates
               him, so that the mere effort of his own will would at any moment render him all that
               his friends and family wish him to be, it is impossible not to feel a hope that that
               effort will one day be made; yet this is hoping for an intellectual and moral conversion,
               a new birth produced by an operation of grace, of which there is no example to encourage
               us to hope for it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> passed a few days with me lately. The enclosure of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> is likely to put him in possession of the eastern side of Applethwaite glen.

                  </div> We walked up it together in the character of surveyors, planning walks and plantations,
                  and wishing it were but as easy to build houses as castle. You must come to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> this summer if you ever wish to see <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> again in his majesty. The surface will soon be scored with enclosures, and stuck over
                  with larches. I cannot however but approve of the enclosure, and my consolation is
                  that if I live to go up the mountain twenty years hence, it will be a comfort to rest
                  in the shade upon the way.</p>

               <p>I expected to have been in London at this time, but business which admits of no delay
                  has grown under my hands, and it will be impossible for me to leave this place before
                  the first or second week in May, just when I should be wishing to come back to it.
                  My headquarters will not be in town, as usual, but at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a>, where <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my uncle</a> has lately settled as rector. My goings on here are something like those of a horse
                  in a mill for labour and regularity – I may add too, for quietness and content. I
                  have made some little progress in a blank verse poem, of which Pelayo, the restorer
                  of Spain, is the hero;

                  hear that the scene lies in New England, that the subject is that war which ensured
                  the superiority of the English settlers over the original inhabitants, and that the
                  chief personage is a primitive Quaker.

                  because I always looked upon her as one who bore about in her the seeds of a mortal
                  malady. Having lost her, this lake will never again be to me what it has been, and
                  yet I have felt more pain in beholding her in her most cheerful moments than when
