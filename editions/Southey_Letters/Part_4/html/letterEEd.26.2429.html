               <div class="l">Its glad accomplishment, – that Roderick lived</div>
               <div class="l">And might in glory take the field once more</div>
               <div class="l">For Spain. I see thou startest at the thought</div>

               <div class="l">Of possible contingency – I think</div>

               <div class="l">Should Roderick have been found: by this sure mark</div>

               <div class="l">That his whole body had been gored with wounds</div>
               <div class="l">And quilld with spears, as if the Moors had felt</div>
               <div class="l">That in his single life the victory lay</div>

               <div class="l">And heard him with unchanging countenance;</div>
               <div class="l">For he had taken his resolve, &amp; felt</div>

               <div class="l">Pursued in calmer tones. Thus much I dare</div>

               <div class="l">As on a mortal enemy inflicts</div>

               <div class="l">Oh that I knew but where to bend my way</div>
               <div class="l">In his dear search! My voice perhaps might reach</div>
               <div class="l">His heart, might reconcile him to himself</div>
               <div class="l">Restore him to his mother ere she dies,</div>
               <div class="l">His people &amp; his country, – with the Sword</div>
               <div class="l">Them &amp; his own good name should he redeem.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh might I but behold him once again,</div>
               <div class="l">Leading to battle those undaunted bands</div>
               <div class="l">Such as he was, – yea rising from his fall</div>

                  </div> Do not be hasty in disposing of your property. Even if you should pass the rest of
                  your life abroad, it would be wise to have your property vested in England. A few
                  years might pleasantly be passed on the on the continent but not if you went with
                  a purpose of not returning. My own intention is to take my family abroad at the expiration
                  of the first <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> term of my lease, if I can compass the means. The difference of living will probably
                  balance the expence of the journey, &amp; my young ones will pick up languages while I <span class="strikethrough">am</span> enjoy a genial climate. But a few years – a very few would suffice; – for the older
                  we grow the dearer those old ties become which time has spared. I grant there is vexation
                  enough in our laws, but take it for all in all, there is no country in which a man
                  lives with so little annoyance from the government. – This &amp; the following book

               fastidiousness of poetry rejects their names. Homer has given none to the dog of Ulysses
               – Ovid has signalized every cur that devoured Acteon.’ Landor is referring to the
               faithful dog, Argus, in Homer’s <em>Odyssey</em>, Book 17, lines 290–327. The elderly Argus recognises Odysseus on his return and
               then dies. In Southey’s poem (Book 15, lines 241–279) ‘Whitefoot’ sees through Roderick’s
               disguise. Southey later changed the dog’s name to Theron (after one of Actaeon’s hound’s
               in Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>) and reduced the dog’s role in the poem; for the significance of this see Diego Saglia,
