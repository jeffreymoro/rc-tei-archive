            <p class="indent1">The year 1810 being come, I write to remind my old friend that there is a covenant
               between him &amp; me, &amp; that, God willing, we expect this next midsummer to bid you &amp;
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Cottlefamily">your sister Mary</a> welcome to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>. Heartily – heartily glad shall we be to see you both. It is a long way to come,
               – but the place is worth the trouble of the journey, &amp; if you went to the worlds end,
               you would not find a more cordial reception upon the way, nor at the close of the
               journey.</p>

               <p>My goings on are as usua<span class="strikethrough">lly</span>, – as it was in the beginning, so it is now, &amp; so I trust it will be as long as it
                  please God to continue to me the gifts of health &amp; ability. The first volume of my
                  Hist of Brazil would have been publishd two months ago if the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PopleWilliam">Printer</a> had pleased, – but when it may please him to finish it, he knows better than I do

                  cogent motives to him in the shape of a little wholesome flogging at the carts tail.

                  it has been wholly written before breakfast, with the exception of the last 100 –
                  or 150 lines which were done at a heat, for the sake of coming in at the end of the
                  race. It <span class="strikethrough">x</span> is gone to press &amp; I have corrected the first proof. every body will stare at this
                  poem, &amp; very very few persons will like it, – I think you will be one of the number.
                  It will I doubt not procure for me much immediate abuse &amp; ridicule, &amp; some after reputation.
                  I have begun another poem, of which Pelayo the <span class="strikethrough">Spanish</span> founder of the Spanish throne is the hero.

                  </div> very little is done, – not quite the first section, – but it is to my satisfaction.
                  The metre is regular blank verse. wild measures suit wild subjects, but when the whole
                  interest which is to be excited arises out of human <span class="strikethrough">passions</span> &lt;interests&gt; &amp; human sympathies, our blank verse is in my judgement the most dignified
                  form of narration &amp; the best. Of course it is my hope to make this my best poem as
                  a whole, – tho there &lt;are&gt; parts in some of my others which it <span class="strikethrough">will</span> is not likely that I shall ever be able to exceed. My hand has not lost its cunning,
                  &amp; it is to be regarded as a proof of improvement rather than otherwise that I write
                  less rapidly than I did fifteen years ago, – being less easily satisfied with myself.</p>

                  expences make a larger income necessary than sufficed me in former years, – &amp; God
                  be praised my means have always hitherto increased with my wants. The Quarterly Review
                  is a great help to me, – they pay ten guineas per sheet, &amp; for the life of Nelson
