               <p>I have sent off this evening the greater part of a long, &amp;, I hope, a stirring article,
                  – the conclusion to which I am now working up. In the statistic part I have had some
                  assistance of great value from a quarter which I am not allowed to name.

                           him with information and briefing notes. His article was deemed by Gifford to be ‘perfectly
                           incorrect and dangerous’ with the result that the version published in the Quarterly
                           Review, 5 (May 1811), 403–457, was much altered by Croker, in consultation with Gifford
                           and Murray; see Jonathan Cutmore, The Quarterly Review Archive.</span></div>
