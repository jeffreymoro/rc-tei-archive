                  </div> I have more pleasure in thus transcribing it for you than I shall have in throwing
                  it before the world, for tho I cast my bread upon the waters in full assurance that
                  it will be found after many days, it is with a feeling something like what I should
                  have in setting acorns. In all these prospects the churchyard enters into the foreground.
                  There is another thought connected with publication which tends as much to humiliation
                  as it may seem to savour of pride – of the thousands who will read my poem, some for
                  the pleasure of finding fault with it, but far very far more undoubtedly for the pleasure
                  which it will give them, – how <span class="ital">very few</span> are there who will really be <span class="strikethrough">at</span> competent to appreciate it, – &amp; how frequently have I had occasion to remember the
                  point of Yriarte’s fable ‘Bad is the censure of the wise – The blockheads praise is
                  worse”.

                  delightful as it is in such combination, I would banish from you, if I knew of any

               <div class="l">Of pain. Repentance had no pangs to spare</div>
               <div class="l">For trifles such as these, – the loss of these</div>
               <div class="l">Was a cheap penalty, – that he had fallen</div>
               <div class="l">Down to the lowest depths of wretchedness,</div>
               <div class="l">His hope &amp; consolation. – But to lose</div>
               <div class="l">His human station in the scale of things, –</div>
               <div class="l">To see brute nature scorn him, &amp; renounce</div>
               <div class="l">Its homage to the human form divine, –</div>
               <div class="l">Had then almighty vengeance thus reveal’d</div>
               <div class="l">His punishment, &amp; was he fallen indeed</div>
               <div class="l">Below fallen man, – below redemptions reach,</div>
               <div class="l">Made lower than the beasts, &amp; like the beasts</div>
               <div class="l">To perish? – Such temptations troubled him</div>
               <div class="l">By day &amp; in the visions of the night;</div>
               <div class="l">But even in sleep he struggled with the thought,</div>
               <div class="l">And waking with the effort of his prayers</div>
               <div class="l">The dream assail’d him still.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh for a voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of comfort, – for a word to bid him hope, –</div>
               <div class="l">A hand that from these billows of despair,</div>
               <div class="l">While yet he strives against the threatening sea</div>
               <div class="l">May reach, &amp; snatch him ere he sink engulphd!</div>
               <div class="l">At length, as life when it hath lain long time</div>
               <div class="l">Opprest beneath some grievous malady,</div>
               <div class="l">Seems to rouse up with re-collected strength</div>
               <div class="l">And the sick man doth feel within himself</div>
               <div class="l">A second spring, so Rodericks better mind</div>
               <div class="l">Arose to save him. Lo! the western <span class="strikethrough">sky</span> sun</div>
               <div class="l">Flames oer the broad Atlantic, on the verge</div>
               <div class="l">Of glowing Ocean rests, retiring then</div>
               <div class="l">Draws with it all its rays, &amp; sudden night</div>
               <div class="l">Fills the whole cope of Heaven. The penitent </div>
               <div class="l">Knelt by Romano’s grave, &amp; falling prone</div>
               <div class="l">Claspt with extended arms the funeral mould.</div>
               <div class="l">Father! he cried; Companion! only Friend</div>
               <div class="l">When all beside was lost! – thou too art gone.</div>
               <div class="l">And the poor sinner whom from utter death</div>
               <div class="l">Thy providential hand preserved, once more</div>
               <div class="l">Totters upon the gulph. I am too weak</div>
               <div class="l">For solitude, too vile a wretch to bear</div>
               <div class="l">This everlasting commune with myself;</div>
               <div class="l">The Tempter hath assail’d me; my own heart</div>
               <div class="l">Is leagued with him; Despair hath spread his nets</div>
               <div class="l">To take my soul, &amp; memory like a Ghost</div>
               <div class="l">Haunts me &amp; drives me to the toils. O Saint</div>
               <div class="l">While I was blest with thee, the hermitage</div>
               <div class="l">Was my sure haven. Look upon me, still,</div>
               <div class="l">For from thy heavenly mansion thou canst see</div>
               <div class="l">The suppliant, – look upon thy child in Christ!</div>
               <div class="l">Is there no other way for penitence!</div>
               <div class="l">I ask not martyrdom, – for what am I </div>
               <div class="l">That I should pray for triumphs, the fit meed</div>
               <div class="l">Of a long life of holy works like thine, –</div>
               <div class="l">Or how should I presumptuously aspire</div>
               <div class="l">To wear the heavenly crown resigned by thee</div>
               <div class="l">How nobly, for my sake? – O point me thou</div>
               <div class="l">Some humblest, painfullest, severest way, –</div>
               <div class="l">Some new austerity, unheard of yet</div>
               <div class="l">In Syrian fields of glory, or the sands</div>
               <div class="l">Of holiest Egypt. Let me bind my brow</div>
               <div class="l">With thorns, &amp; barefoot seek Jerusalem.</div>
               <div class="l">Tracking the way with blood; there day by day</div>
               <div class="l">Inflict upon this sinful flesh the scourge,</div>
               <div class="l">Drink vinegar &amp; gall, &amp; for my bed</div>
               <div class="l">Hang with extended limbs upon the cross</div>
               <div class="l">A nightly crucifixion. Any thing</div>
               <div class="l">Of action, difficulty, bodily pain</div>
               <div class="l">Labour &amp; outward suffering, – any thing</div>
               <div class="l">But stillness &amp; this dreadful solitude.</div>
               <div class="l">Romano! Father! let me hear thy voice</div>
               <div class="l">In dreams. O sainted Soul! – or from the grave</div>
               <div class="l">Speak to thy penitent, – even from the grave</div>
               <div class="l">Thine were a voice of comfort.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus he cried,</div>
               <div class="l">Easing the pressure of his burthened heart</div>
               <div class="l">With passionate prayer, – thus pourd his spirit forth,</div>
               <div class="l">Till the long effort had exhausted him </div>
               <div class="l">His spirit fail’d, &amp; laying in the grave</div>
               <div class="l">His weary head, as on a pillow, sleep</div>
               <div class="l">Fell on him. He had pray’d to hear a voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of consolation, &amp; in dreams a voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of consolation came. Roderick! it said, –</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick, my poor unhappy sinful child,</div>
               <div class="l">Jesus have mercy on thee. – Not if Heaven </div>
               <div class="l">Had opened, &amp; Romano visible</div>
               <div class="l">In his beatitude had breath’d that prayer,</div>
               <div class="l">Not if the Grave had spoken, had it pierced</div>
               <div class="l">So deeply in his soul, nor thrilld his heart</div>
               <div class="l">With such compunctious visitings, nor given</div>
               <div class="l">Withal so keen a joy. It was the voice</div>
               <div class="l">Which sung his fretful infancy to sleep</div>
               <div class="l">So patiently, which sooth’d his childish griefs,</div>
               <div class="l">Counsell’d with anguish &amp; prophetic tears</div>
               <div class="l">His headstrong youth. And lo! his mother stood</div>
               <div class="l">Before him in the vision: in those weeds</div>
               <div class="l">Which never from the hour when to the grave</div>
               <div class="l">She followed her dear Lord Theodofred</div>
               <div class="l">Rusilla laid aside, but in her face</div>
               <div class="l">A sorrow that bespake a heavier load</div>
               <div class="l">At heart, &amp; more unmitigated woe:</div>
               <div class="l">Yea a more poignant agony, than when</div>
               <div class="l">Witizas ministers &amp; the red hot brass</div>
               <div class="l">Had done their work, &amp; in her arms she held</div>
               <div class="l">Her eyeless husband; wiped away the sweat</div>
               <div class="l">Which still his tortures forced from every pore,</div>
               <div class="l">Cool’d his scorch’d lids with medicinable herbs,</div>
               <div class="l">And prayed the while for patience for herself</div>
               <div class="l">And him, &amp; prayed for vengeance too, &amp; found</div>
               <div class="l">Best comfort in her curses. In his dream</div>
               <div class="l">Groaning he knelt before her to beseech</div>
               <div class="l">Her blessing, &amp; she rais’d her hands to lay</div>
               <div class="l">A benediction on him. But those hands</div>
               <div class="l">Were chain’d, &amp; casting a wild look around,</div>
               <div class="l">With a wild voice she cried, Will no one break</div>
               <div class="l">These shameful fetters? – Pedro! Theudemir!</div>
               <div class="l">Athanagild! where are ye? – Rodericks arm</div>
               <div class="l">Is withered; Chiefs of Spain, but where are ye?</div>
               <div class="l">And thou Pelayo, thou our surest hope</div>
               <div class="l">Dost thou too sleep? – up – up – Pelayo! up!</div>
               <div class="l">Why tarriest thou, Deliverer? – But with that</div>
               <div class="l">She broke her bonds; &amp; lo! her form was changed,</div>
               <div class="l">Radiant in arms she stood: a bloody Cross </div>
               <div class="l">Gleam’d on her breast-plate, in her shield display’d</div>
               <div class="l">A Lion seem’d to ramp, her helmed head</div>
               <div class="l">Rose like the Berecynthian Goddess crownd</div>
               <div class="l">With towers, &amp; in her dreadful hand the sword</div>
               <div class="l">Red as a fire-brand blazed. Anon the tramp</div>
               <div class="l">Of horsemen, &amp; the din of multitudes</div>
               <div class="l">Moving to mortal conflict, rung around,</div>
               <div class="l">The battle-song, the clang of swords &amp; shield,</div>
               <div class="l">War-cries &amp; tumult, strife &amp; hate &amp; rage,</div>
               <div class="l">Blasphemous prayers, confusion, agony,</div>
               <div class="l">Rout, &amp; pursuit &amp; death, &amp; over all</div>
               <div class="l">The shout of Victory, Spain &amp; Victory!</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick, as the strong vision mastered him,</div>
               <div class="l">Rush’d to the fight rejoicing; starting then</div>
               <div class="l">As his own effort burst the charm of sleep,</div>
               <div class="l">He found himself upon that lonely grave</div>
               <div class="l">In moonlight &amp; in silence. But the dream</div>
               <div class="l">Work’d in him still, for still he felt his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Pant, &amp; his withered arm was trembling still,</div>
               <div class="l">And still that voice was in his ears, which call’d</div>
               <div class="l">On Jesus for his sake.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh might he hear</div>
               <div class="l">That actual voice! &amp; if Rusilla lived,</div>
               <div class="l">If shame &amp; anguish for his crimes not yet</div>
               <div class="l">Had brought her to the grave, sure she would bless</div>
               <div class="l">Her penitent child, &amp; pour into his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Prayers &amp; forgiveness which like precious balm</div>
               <div class="l">Would heal the wounded soul. Nor to herself</div>
               <div class="l">Less precious or less healing, would the voice</div>
               <div class="l">That spake forgiveness flow: she wept her son</div>
               <div class="l">For ever lost, – cut off with all the weight </div>
               <div class="l">Of unrepented sin upon his head, –</div>
               <div class="l">Sin which had weigh’d a nation down: what joy</div>
               <div class="l">To know that righteous Heaven had in its wrath</div>
               <div class="l">Remembered mercy, &amp; she yet might meet</div>
               <div class="l">The child whom she had borne, redeemd, in bliss.</div>
               <div class="l">The sudden impulse of such thoughts confirmd</div>
               <div class="l">His unacknowledged purpose which till now</div>
               <div class="l">Vainly had sought its end. He girt his loins,</div>
               <div class="l">Laid blessed Mary’s image in a cleft</div>
               <div class="l">Of the rock, where sheltered from the elements</div>
               <div class="l">It might abide till happier days came on,</div>
               <div class="l">From all defilement safe; – pourd his last prayers</div>
               <div class="l">Upon Romano’s grave, &amp; kissd the earth</div>
               <div class="l">That covered his remains, &amp; wept as if</div>
               <div class="l">At long leave-taking; – then began his way.
