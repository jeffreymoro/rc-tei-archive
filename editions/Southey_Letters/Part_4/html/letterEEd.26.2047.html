                           to restrict the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty. For Southey’s account,
                           Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809, 2.1 (1811), 232–240. Romilly had proposed to
                           repeal three different laws which imposed the death penalty, including one for ‘privately
                           stealing’ goods worth 5 shillings from a shop. A motion to engross the bills (i.e.
                           put them in a final form after consideration in committee) was lost 33–31 in the Commons

                  </div> for altering the law respecting Privately Stealing appears to have been thrown out
                  by 33 to 31 voices. May 30. of the same year I find this same Bill before the Lords
                  &amp; thrown out there. At first I supposed there was a mistake in the Reporter &amp; that
                  it had been past in the Commons, – but a speech of Romilly’s May 4<sup>th</sup> shows that this is not the case. It must then have been a different Bill, originating
                  in the Lords, but when, or by whom, I cannot discover for in the Debates for the year
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbetts</a>) the debate of May 30 is the only <span class="strikethrough">occasion in which</span> &lt;time when&gt; the subject is mentioned in the Upper House.
