               <p>I have behaved very ill to you, – &amp; am very conscious of having done so. You wrote
                  me a letter twelve months ago which contained one of the most affecting stories I
                  ever read, &amp; which asked me about the fitness of Oxford as a professional station.
                  I began a reply, – something interrupted it; – it got into my desk, &amp; there shared
                  the fate of too many others, – being <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> buried under <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;a&gt; daily accumulation of correspondence. Its purport was that I could only give you
                  one introduction to Oxford, which is to the Chemical Professor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KiddJohn">D<sup>r</sup> Kidd</a>, an old school-fellow of mine, &amp; a good-natured man; – that I would do my best to
                  obtain others from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</a>, an all-sufficient person in this case, – but that I thought it a bad place for any
                  person of your profession, because of Grosvenors

                  not travel precisely in the beaten track, the society of an English University is
                  the very worst imaginable. The intellectual atmosphere of the place is a <span class="ital">malaria</span> which I would shun like the Pontine marshes.</p>

               <p>Now to your recent letter. You may be assured that if it were in my power to render
                  service to any person for whom you were interested I should be most happy to exert
                  myself.

In the first of these characters
                  there is, for one of my habits, no attraction; – in the second – a good deal to repel,
                  – &amp; my acquaintance with him <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxx</span> in the third is less than, I dare say, it otherwise would be, if he were not so deeply
                  engaged in official duties, &amp; if he were upon a level with me in worldly circumstances.
                  I am beholden to him for many civilities &amp; for some acts of unsolicited kindness.

                  absence, than to confess imprudence by adopting immediate measures of retrenchment.
                  I fear vanity rather than science leads him to France; it gratifies him a little,
