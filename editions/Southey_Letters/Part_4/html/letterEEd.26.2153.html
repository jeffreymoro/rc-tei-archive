               <div class="l">Twas not in vain that on her absent son</div>

               <div class="l">Call’d for forgiveness, &amp; in agony</div>
               <div class="l">Besought his prayers; all guilty as she was</div>
               <div class="l">He had not sure been human, if that cry</div>
               <div class="l">Had fail’d to pierce him. When he heard the tale</div>
               <div class="l">He blest the messenger, even while his speech</div>
               <div class="l">Was faltering, &amp; from head to foot he shook</div>
               <div class="l">With icy feelings from his inmost heart</div>
               <div class="l">Effused. It changed the nature of his woe,</div>
               <div class="l">Making the burthen more endurable.</div>
               <div class="l">The life-long sorrow that remaind, became</div>
               <div class="l">A healing &amp; a chastening grief, &amp; brought</div>
               <div class="l">His soul in close communion, nearer Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">For he had been first born, &amp; the love</div>
               <div class="l">Which at her breast he drew, &amp; from her smiles</div>
               <div class="l">And from her voice of tenderness imbibed,</div>
               <div class="l">As opening flowers in sunshine gather strength,</div>
               <div class="l">Gave such unnatural horror to her crimes</div>
               <div class="l">That when the thought came over him, it seemd</div>

               <div class="l">Then thro the long &amp; painful hours, before</div>

               <div class="l">Subdued Witiza, &amp; the land was free,</div>
               <div class="l">Duly before her grave he offered up</div>

               <div class="l">The old man, from fear</div>
               <div class="l">Recovering &amp; from wonder, knew him first.</div>
               <div class="l">It is the Prince! he cried, &amp; bending down</div>
               <div class="l">Embraced his knees. The action &amp; the word</div>
               <div class="l">Awakened Roderick; he shook off the load</div>
               <div class="l">Of struggling thoughts which pressing on his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Held him like one entranced; yet all untaught</div>
               <div class="l">To bend before the face of man, confusd</div>
               <div class="l">Awhile he stood, forgetful of his part,</div>
               <div class="l">But when Siverian cried, my Lord, my Lord,</div>
               <div class="l">Now God he prais’d that I have found thee thus,</div>
               <div class="l">My Lord &amp; Prince, Spains only hope &amp; mine!</div>
               <div class="l">Then Roderick echoing him exclaimd, my Lord</div>
               <div class="l">And Prince, Pelayo! &amp; approaching near</div>
               <div class="l">He bent his knee obeisant, but his head</div>
               <div class="l">Earthward inclin’d, while the old man looking up</div>
               <div class="l">From his low gesture to Pelayo’s face,</div>
               <div class="l">Wept at beholding him, for grief &amp; joy.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Siverian? cried the Chief, what brings thee here?</div>
               <div class="l">Some tale of ill! – my wife, – my children – speak!</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">They are as thou wouldst wish them, he replied,</div>
               <div class="l">Wert thou but Lord of thine own home again</div>
               <div class="l">And Spain were Spain once more. I bear a tale</div>
               <div class="l">Of ill, but one which touches not the heart</div>
               <div class="l">Like what thy fears forebode. The renegade</div>
               <div class="l">Numacian woos thy sister, &amp; she lends</div>
               <div class="l">To the vile slave unworthily her ear</div>
               <div class="l">The Lady Gaudiosa hath in vain</div>
               <div class="l">Warn’d her of all the evils which await</div>
               <div class="l">A union thus accurst; she sets at nought</div>
               <div class="l">Her faith, her lineage, &amp; thy certain wrath.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Pelayo hearing him remain’d awhile</div>
               <div class="l">Silent, then turning to his mothers grave,</div>
               <div class="l">O thou poor dust, hath then the infectious taint</div>
               <div class="l">Survived thy dread remorse, that it should run</div>
               <div class="l">In Guisla’s veins! he cried, I should have heard</div>
               <div class="l">This shameful sorrow any where but here!</div>
               <div class="l">Humble thyself proud heart! thou, gracious Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Be merciful, – it is the original flaw, –</div>
               <div class="l">And what are we, a weak unhappy race</div>
               <div class="l">Born to our sad inheritance of sin</div>
               <div class="l">And death. – He smote his forehead as he spake,</div>
               <div class="l">And from his head the ashes fell, like snow</div>
               <div class="l">Shaken from some dry beech leaves when a bird</div>
               <div class="l">Lights on the bending spray. A little while,</div>
               <div class="l">In silence rather than in thought he stood,</div>
               <div class="l">Passive beneath the sorrow. Turning then,</div>
               <div class="l">And what doth Gaudiosa counsel me,</div>
               <div class="l">He askd the old man, for she hath ever been</div>
               <div class="l">My wise &amp; faithful counsellor. – He replied,</div>
               <div class="l">The Lady Gaudiosa bade me say</div>
               <div class="l">She sees the danger that on every part</div>
               <div class="l">Besets her husband’s house: here she had ceas’d, –</div>
               <div class="l">But when my noble Mistress gave in charge</div>
               <div class="l">How I should tell thee that in evil times</div>
               <div class="l">The bravest counsel ever is the best,</div>
               <div class="l">Then that high-minded Lady thus rejoin’d,</div>
               <div class="l">Whatever to my Lords resolve, he knows</div>
               <div class="l">I bear a mind prepared.</div>
               <div class="l">Brave spirits, cried</div>
               <div class="l">Pelayo, – worthy to remove all stain</div>
               <div class="l">Of weakness from their sex. I should be less</div>
               <div class="l">Than man, if drawing strength where others find</div>
               <div class="l">Their hearts most open to assault of fear,</div>
               <div class="l">I quaild at danger. Never be it said</div>
               <div class="l">Of Spain, that in the hour of her distress</div>
               <div class="l">Her women were as heroes, but her men</div>
               <div class="l">Performd the womens part.</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick at that</div>
               <div class="l">Lookd up, &amp; taking up the word exclaim’d</div>
               <div class="l">O Prince, in better days the pride of Spain</div>
               <div class="l">And prostrate as she lies, her current hope</div>
               <div class="l">Hear now my tale. The fire which seemd extinct</div>
               <div class="l">Hath risen revigorate: a living spark</div>
               <div class="l">From Aurias ashes by a Womans hand</div>
               <div class="l">Preserved &amp; quickened, kindles far &amp; wide</div>
               <div class="l">The beacon-flame oer all the Asturian hills.</div>
               <div class="l">There hath a vow been offered up, which binds</div>
               <div class="l">Us &amp; our childrens children to the work</div>
               <div class="l">Of holy hatred; in the name of Spain</div>
               <div class="l">That vow hath been pronounced &amp; registered</div>
               <div class="l">Above, to be the bond whereby we stand</div>
               <div class="l">For condemnation or acceptance. Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Received the irrevocable vow, &amp; Earth </div>
               <div class="l">Must witness its fulfillment, Earth &amp; Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Call upon thee Pelayo! upon thee</div>
               <div class="l">The spirits of thy royal ancestors</div>
               <div class="l">Look down expectant; unto thee from fields</div>
               <div class="l">Laid waste, &amp; hamlets burnt &amp; cities sack’d</div>
               <div class="l">The blood of infancy &amp; helpless age</div>
               <div class="l">Cries out; – thy native mountains call for thee</div>
               <div class="l">Echoing from all their armed sons thy names:</div>
               <div class="l">And deem not thou that rash impatience goads</div>
               <div class="l">Thy countrymen to counsels immature,</div>
               <div class="l">Odoar &amp; Urban from Visonias banks</div>
               <div class="l">Send me their sworn &amp; trusted messenger</div>
               <div class="l">To summon thee, &amp; tell thee in their name</div>
               <div class="l">That now the hour is come. For sure it seems,</div>
               <div class="l">Thus saith the Primate, Heavens high will to rear</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the soil of Spain a Spanish throne,</div>
               <div class="l">Restoring in thy native line, O Prince</div>
               <div class="l">The sceptre to the Spaniard. Worthy son</div>
               <div class="l">Of that most ancient &amp; heroic race,</div>

               <div class="l">More often by superior arts beguild.</div>
               <div class="l">Yet amid all its sufferings, all the waste</div>
               <div class="l">Of sword &amp; fire remorselessly employ’d,</div>
               <div class="l">Unconquerd &amp; unconquerable still, –</div>

               <div class="l">Stand forward thou, draw forth the sword of Spain</div>
               <div class="l">Restore them to their rights, too long withheld,</div>

               <div class="l">While Roderick ceasd the princely Mountaineer</div>

               <div class="l">With eyes intently fixd, &amp; thoughtful brow.</div>
               <div class="l">Then turning to the altar, he let fall</div>
               <div class="l">The sackcloth robe which late with folded arms</div>
               <div class="l">Against his heart was prest, &amp; stretching forth</div>
