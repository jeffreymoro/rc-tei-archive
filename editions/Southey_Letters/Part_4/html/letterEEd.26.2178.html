                  </div> These volumes are the fruits of many hours of that laborious idleness which is to
                  me the most delightful of all dissipation. I who methodise upon so many subjects,
                  and upon so extensive a scale, may certainly be allowed to smile, if upon this occasion
                  I should be censured for throwing crude materials together without any method at all.
                  My only reply would be, that the person who can find nothing there but what he knew
                  before, is entitled to abuse the book. I have materials, or rather memoranda, marked
                  in the course of many years’ almost incessant reading, which are enough to fill half-a-dozen
                  more such volumes; and if these should sell, I shall certainly put two more to the
                  press. But the sale of books depends upon such adventitious circumstances, that I
                  can form a better guess about to-morrow’s weather, than upon so uncertain a chance.
                  The articles which are not my own, are <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge’s</a>: they would not have been there (being so few) if I had not hoped to obtain from
                  him enough to have doubled the extent of the collection; and for this I waited so
                  long, as not to leave me time for doing it myself.</p>

                  prejudices against the Russians are both ridiculous and mischievous; and an Englishman
                  travelling in Russia hereafter may feel their effects, as English travellers in Sicily
                  have heretofore felt the effects of Brydone’s rascally exposure of private intercourse.

                  </div> There is a species of falsehood which consists in telling nothing but truth, but,
                  by telling only a part of the truth, produces all the effects of falsehood, and this
                  is what Dr. Clarke has done. He tells you all the faults of the Russians, and keeps
                  out of sight the good qualities which co-exist with those faults. I know persons who
                  have lived in Russia; they uniformly speak of the nobles as a corrupted and vicious
                  class, but of the people as possessing those good qualities which in a certain stage
                  of civilisation are natural to humanity. In savage life they are like the seed which
                  fell upon stones, and cannot shoot forth: in such a state as that of the Russian nobles,
                  or the English journeymen manufacturers, they are stifled or poisoned; but neither
                  the beard of the common Russian, nor the dust of his house, nor his creepers and crawlers,
                  have any necessary effect upon the natural charities of life. One of his virtues has
                  now been sufficiently proved; he loves his country, and will fight for it.</p>
