                  </div> last Journal came down to me yesterday, – a dismal story of death after death. But
                  notwithstanding the apparently good evidence upon which it rests, I do not believe
                  the account which is given of his own death. That he is dead there can be little doubt,
                  – the manner in which he is said to have died has every mark of a fable. It is in
                  the highest degree improbable that such a river should flow <span class="ital">thro’</span> a rock, &amp; be navigable during its passage. Little as we know of the Niger, we certainly
                  should have heard of this wonder of the world if it had existed. But setting this
                  aside, which alone would induce me to reject the whole tale as a fiction, is it likely
                  that Park with only eight men in his boat, &amp; an army upon the rock, over the door-way
                  as it is called to oppose his passage with arrows stones &amp;c – &amp; a very strong current
                  in his favour, should <span class="strikethrough">keep</span> make his slaves keep the canoe against the current while he fought with the army?

                  brought against him have turned back, – or have landed &amp; given up the property for

                  </div> one of the Directors of the Missionary Society has just added something to our knowledge
                  of Africa, by a volume in which his own remarks form a whimsical contrast to the really
                  valuable information which he communicates. It is among the odd things of this age
                  that places in Africa (rivers, mountains &amp;c) should be named after Methodist Preachers
                  in England! On the passage home he &amp; the Captain tried the well-known experiment of
                  sinking an empty bottle closely-corked to a certain depth in the sea, – they found
                  it as they expected the first time, the corked forced in, &amp; the bottle full of water.
                  Upon the second experiment a sail needle was passed thro the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> top of the cork <span class="strikethrough">&amp; left resting on op</span> &lt;over&gt; the mouth of the bottle, &amp; left there, the cork being waxed afterwards. He
                  &amp; the Captain both affirm that when they drew the bottle up, the cork had <span class="ital">not</span> been forced in, &amp; yet the bottle was full of sea-water, which must have come <span class="ital">thro’ the glass</span>. The thing appears impossible, – but tho’ I have not the slightest respect for this
