               altered prior to publication. Five stanzas were considered by Croker and Rickman to
               be inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and deleted them from the version published
               as <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the deleted stanzas into
               an ‘Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte’, published in the <em>Courier</em>, 3 February 1814.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
