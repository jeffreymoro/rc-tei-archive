                  dark by its very depth, – your own vase of burnished gold is a better illustration,
                  – the very richness of the metal occasions its darkness. Sometimes they are like pictures,
                  unless you get them in precisely the right point of view, their expression is lost.
                  I cannot tell how this is to be remedied, if it is remediable: it is what makes the
                  difference between difficult &amp; easy authors. – I will not yet specify what the passages
