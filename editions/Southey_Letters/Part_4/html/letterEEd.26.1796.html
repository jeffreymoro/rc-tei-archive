                           of Canada in 1759–1763. Southey had expressed his interest in Elliott’s project in
                           his letter of 5 June 1810 (Letter 1783).</span></div>
                  </div> – it tired <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> nothing but my eyes, – nevertheless my first opinion remains <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> unaltered, that the subject is utterly unfit for poetry, &amp; that if you will not be
                  content to regard all that you have written upon it as a heap of old materials in
                  which you may quarry for ready cut stones to employ in <span class="strikethrough">a better</span> building upon a happier site, – you had better resolutely throw the whole <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> behind the fire.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The event is so near our own times as to render any machinery not merely improper,
               but even absurd. We reconcile ourselves easily to the thought of a Greek or Trojan
               talking to the Gods, &amp; of Jupiter deciding between the two parties, &amp; even willing
               the death of any individual among them, because the mortal agents are so far removed
               into the age of fable that <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> the existence of them &amp; their Gods is alike to us, – we hear of both in the same
               story, &amp; always have heard of them together. But Gods &amp; Grenadiers, or Genii &amp; Grenadiers
               are a most ill-judged assortment, &amp; to introduce Deity as casting a thought upon the
               petty squabbles of the French &amp; English in Canada, is both monstrous in taste, &amp; would,
               I am sure, be offensive to the common religious feelings of the country. Besides,
               the subject itself is altogether unworthy of any supernatural agency, &amp; your Ghost
               is misplaced. Neither good nor evil has resulted from the conquest of Canada, – nor
               is any good to be expected from it while <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> French continues the language of the country. I am sure the event is utterly unfit
               for poetry, &amp; utterly unworthy of it, – &amp; the more you strain &amp; strive to elevate
               it, – the more gorgeous are the colours with which you embroider the canvas, the more
               is the coarseness &amp; poverty of the canvas itself displayed.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You appear to me to have an over-anxiety for raising &amp; ornamenting your subject. There
                  are two remedies for this, – chuse a topic so noble in itself as to lead you into
                  no temptation of this nature, – or one so wild that you may weave up with it as much
                  magic &amp; machinery as your heart desires. Try which of these plans you will &amp; when
