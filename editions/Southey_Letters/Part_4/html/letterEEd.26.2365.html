               <div class="l">How then, Alphonso, did thy eager soul</div>
               <div class="l">Chide the slow hours &amp; painful way which seemd</div>
               <div class="l">Lengthening to grow before their lagging pace!</div>
               <div class="l">Youth of heroic thoughts &amp; high desire,</div>
               <div class="l">Tis not the spur of arduous enterprize</div>
               <div class="l">That with unequal throbbings hurries now</div>
               <div class="l">The unquiet heart, then makes it die away;</div>
               <div class="l">Tis not impatient joy that this disturbs</div>
               <div class="l">In that young breast the healthful spring of life,</div>
               <div class="l">Joy &amp; ambition have forsaken him</div>
               <div class="l">His soul is sick with hope: – So near his home,</div>
               <div class="l">So near his mothers arms, – alas, perchance</div>
               <div class="l">The long’d for meeting may be yet far off</div>
               <div class="l">As earth from heaven! sorrow in these long months</div>
               <div class="l">Of separation may have laid her low,</div>
               <div class="l">Or what if at his flight the bloody Moor</div>
               <div class="l">Had sent the ministers of slaughter forth,</div>
               <div class="l">And he himself should thus have brought the sword</div>
               <div class="l">Upon his fathers house! – Sure Hoya too</div>
               <div class="l">Feels the same dark presage, the fearful boy</div>
               <div class="l">Said in himself, – or wherefore is his brow</div>
               <div class="l">Thus overcast with heaviness, &amp; why</div>
               <div class="l">Looks he thus anxiously in silence round.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Just then that faithful servant raisd his hand</div>
               <div class="l">And turning to Alphonso with a smile</div>
               <div class="l">He pointed where Count Pedros towers far off</div>
               <div class="l">Peer’d in the dell below: faint was the smile</div>
               <div class="l">And while it sate upon the lips, his eye</div>
               <div class="l">Return’d its troubled speculation still.</div>
               <div class="l">For long had he lookd wistfully in vain</div>
               <div class="l">Seeking where far or near he might espy</div>
               <div class="l">From whom to learn if time or chance had wrought</div>
               <div class="l">Change in his masters house; but on the hills</div>
               <div class="l">Nor goatherd could he see, nor traveller,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor huntsman early at his sport afield,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor angler following up the mountain glen</div>
               <div class="l">His lonely pastime: neither could he hear</div>
               <div class="l">Carol, or pipe, or shout of shepherds boy,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor woodmans axe, for not a human sound</div>
               <div class="l">Disturbd the silence of the solitude.</div>
               <div class="l">Is it the spoilers work? at yonder door</div>
               <div class="l">Behold the favourite kidling bleats unheard;</div>
               <div class="l">The next stands open, &amp; the sparrows there</div>
               <div class="l">Boldly pass in &amp; out. Thither he turnd</div>
               <div class="l">To seek what indications were within –</div>
               <div class="l">The chesnut-bread was on the shelf; the churn</div>
               <div class="l">As if in haste forsaken, full &amp; fresh,</div>
               <div class="l">The recent fire had mouldered on the hearth;</div>
               <div class="l">And broken cobwebs markd the whiter space</div>
               <div class="l">Where from the wall the buckler &amp; the sword</div>
               <div class="l">Had late been taken down. Wonder at first</div>
               <div class="l">Had mitigated fear, but Hoya now</div>
               <div class="l">Returnd to tell the signals of good hope,</div>
               <div class="l">And they pricked forward joyfully. Ere long</div>
               <div class="l">Perceptible above the ceaseless sound</div>
               <div class="l">Of yonder stream, a voice of multitudes</div>
               <div class="l">As if in loud acclaim was heard far off,</div>
               <div class="l">And nearer as they drew distincter shouts</div>
               <div class="l">Came from the dell, &amp; at Count Pedro’s gate</div>
               <div class="l">The human swarm was seen; – a motley group,</div>
               <div class="l">Maids, mothers, helpless infancy, weak age,</div>
               <div class="l">And wondering children, &amp; tumultuous boys,</div>
               <div class="l">Hot youth &amp; resolute manhood, gathered there</div>
               <div class="l">In uproar all. Anon the moving mass</div>
               <div class="l">Fell in half circle back; a general cry</div>
               <div class="l">Burst forth, exultant arms are lifted up</div>
               <div class="l">And caps are thrown aloft, as thro the gate</div>
               <div class="l">Count Pedro’s banner came. – Alphonso shriekd</div>
               <div class="l">For joy, &amp; smote his steed &amp; galloped on.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Fronting the gate the Standard-bearer holds</div>
               <div class="l">His precious charge. Behind in ordered files</div>
               <div class="l">The men divide. Green boyhood presses there</div>
               <div class="l">And waning eld pleading a youthful soul</div>
               <div class="l">Intreats admission. All is ardour here,</div>
               <div class="l">Hope &amp; brave purposes, &amp; minds resolved.</div>
               <div class="l">Nor where the weaker sex is left apart</div>
               <div class="l">Doth aught of fear find utterance, tho perchance</div>
               <div class="l">Some paler cheeks might there be seen, some eyes</div>
               <div class="l">Dimmed with sad bodings, &amp; some natural tears.</div>
               <div class="l">Count Pedro’s war horse in the vacant space</div>
               <div class="l">Strokes with impatient hoof the trodden turf;</div>
               <div class="l">And gazing round upon the martial show,</div>
               <div class="l">Proud of his stately trappings, flings his head</div>
               <div class="l">And snorts &amp; champs the bits, &amp; neighing shrill</div>
               <div class="l">Wakes the near echo with his voice of joy.</div>
               <div class="l">The page beside him holds his masters spear</div>
               <div class="l">And shield &amp; helmet. In the Castle gate</div>
               <div class="l">Count Pedro stands, his countenance resolved</div>
               <div class="l">But mournful, for Favinia on his arm</div>
               <div class="l">Hung frantic with her fears, &amp; drew him back.</div>
               <div class="l">Go not, she cried, with this deluded crew!</div>
               <div class="l">She hath not Pedro with her maddening words</div>
               <div class="l">Bereft thy faculty: she is crazed with grief,</div>
               <div class="l">And her delirium hath infected these, –</div>
               <div class="l">But Pedro, thou art calm; thou dost not share</div>
               <div class="l">The frenzy of the crowd; thy sober mind</div>
               <div class="l">Surveys the danger in its whole extent</div>
               <div class="l">And sees the certain ruin, for thou knowest</div>
               <div class="l">I know thou hast no hope! Unhappy man</div>
               <div class="l">Why then for this most desperate enterprize,</div>
               <div class="l">Wilt thou devote thy son, thy only child?</div>
               <div class="l">Not for myself I plead, – nor even for thee,</div>
               <div class="l">Thou art a soldier, &amp; thou canst not fear</div>
               <div class="l">The face of death; &amp; I should welcome it</div>
               <div class="l">As the best visitant whom Heaven could send.</div>
               <div class="l">Not for our lives I speak then, were they worth</div>
               <div class="l">The thought of preservation, – Nature soon</div>
               <div class="l">Must call for them, – the sword that should cut short</div>
               <div class="l">Sorrows slow work, were merciful to us.</div>
