               extends, &amp; therefore make out the heads with some apprehension. As he however will
               have set up the whole of the chapter, before he <span class="strikethrough">strikes</span> &lt;works&gt; off the first sheet, he can easily strike out <span class="strikethrough">any</span> such of the heads as may happen to belong to the second.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It is suggested to me by my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> that this is a book of which a certain number of large paper copies would be likely
               to sell, &amp; to which the existence of such copies would give a sort of respectability.
               This I merely mention because he desires me to mention it, perfectly aware that it
               is a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> matter of which you must be the best judge, &amp; having no wish upon the subject myself.</p>
