               <p>But of Coleridge I must say something. It gave me much pain to hear, as I accidentally
                  did, that you were offended with him, &amp; it gives me more that you should thus have
                  mentioned him with asperity.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Estlin had taken offence at a comment made by Coleridge in his lecture ‘On the Minor
                           Poems of Milton’ (7 April 1814), that Milton represented Satan as a sceptical Socinian.
                           Estlin had communicated his displeasure in a note to Coleridge, to which the latter
                           sent an apologetic reply on 9 April. See E.L. Griggs (ed.), Collected Letters of Samuel
                           Taylor Coleridge, 6 vols (Oxford, 1956–1971), III, 471–2, 477–8, 492.</span></div>
                  </div> You would find him different only in some of his opinions, a change which would certainly
                  break one bond of union, but should not methinks be allowed to break all ties asunder.
                  You would deem the Churchman a bigot who should &lt;have&gt; renounced all connection with
                  him when he became a Unitarian. It is very likely that he may have thrown out expressions
                  which he himself would not vindicate, in that warmth of language &amp; wantonness of mind
                  which you know are habitual to him. It is also likely that these expressions may have
                  been exaggerated by report, or at least so changed in their bearing by being presented
                  nakedly without all those circumstances which introduced, accompanied, qualified &amp;
                  explained them, as to represent something very different from what they were intended
                  to convey. But as I <span class="ital">know</span> no circumstances could ever abate his feelings of respect for you, I cannot but regret
                  that anything should have thus entirely alienated your <span class="strikethrough">good will</span> kindly ones towards him. – As for his conduct, – he can neither be censured nor commiserated
                  too much, – but in those who suffer <span class="strikethrough">the</span> most from it commiseration is the feeling which predominates. It is my belief that
                  he labours under a disease of the volition, nothing short of insanity: nosologists
                  perhaps will not admit of the term, where the moral &amp; not the intellectual faculties
                  are affected. But in his case it is the moral part which is diseased while the intellect
                  is as vigorous as ever.</p>
