                           on 2 June 1813, in order to besiege the town. But Lieutenant-General Sir John Murray
                           (c. 1768–1827; DNB) ordered a hurried retreat and re-embarked his troops on 11–12
                           June 1813, fearing the approach of a French army. His actions led to a court martial
                           in January 1815, which only admonished him for abandoning his guns.</span></div>

               their great captain, Mr. Wordsworth, we think he has kept clear of several of the
               faults that may be imputed to his preceptors; and assumed, upon the whole, a more
