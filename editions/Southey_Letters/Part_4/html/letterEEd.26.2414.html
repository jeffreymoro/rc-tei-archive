               <p>I am glad to hear from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</a> that you are improved in health and spirits. What you say of the inconvenience of
                  mathematical studies to a man who has no inclination for them, no necessity for them,
                  no time to spare for acquiring them, and no use for them when they are acquired, is
                  perfectly true; and I think it was one of the advantages (Heaven knows they were very
                  few) which Oxford used to possess over Cambridge, that a man might take his degree,
                  if he pleased, without knowing anything of the science. A tenth or a fiftieth part
                  of the time employed upon Euclid,

               <p>Your repugnance to the expense of time which this fatiguing study requires, is very
                  natural and very reasonable; and the best comfort I can offer is to remind you that
                  the time will soon come when you will have the pleasure of forgetting all you have
                  learned. Your apprehensions of deficiency in more important things are not so well
                  founded. The Church stands in need of men of various characters and acquirements.
                  She ought to have some sturdy polemics, equally able to attack and to defend. One
                  or two of these are as many as she wants, and as many as she produces in a generation;
                  she cannot do without them, and yet sometimes they do evil as well as good. Horsley

                  are sufficient. There are hardly more than half-a-dozen pulpits in the kingdom in
                  which an eloquent preacher would not be out of his place. Everywhere else, what is
                  required of the preacher is to be plain, perspicuous, and in earnest. If he feels
                  himself, he will make his congregation feel. But it is not in the pulpit that the
                  minister may do most good. He will do infinitely more by living with his parishioners
                  like a pastor; by becoming their confidential adviser, their friend, their comforter;
                  directing the education of the poor, and, as far as he can, inspecting that of all,
                  which it is not difficult for a man of good sense and gentle disposition to do as
                  an official duty, without giving it, in the slightest degree, the appearance of officious
                  interference. Teach the young what Christianity is; distinguish by noticing and rewarding
                  those who distinguish themselves by their good conduct; see to the wants of the poor,
                  and call upon the charity of the rich, making yourself the channel through which it
                  flows; look that the schools be in good order, that the workhouse is what it ought
                  to be, that the overseers do their duty; be, in short, the active friend of your parishioners.
                  Sunday will then be the least of your labours, and the least important of your duties;
                  and you will very soon find that the time employed in making a sermon, would be better
                  employed in adapting to your congregation a dozen, which your predecessors did not
                  deliver to the press for no other purpose than that they should stand idle upon the
                  shelves of a divinity library. The pulpit is a clergyman’s parade, the parish is his
                  field of active service.</p>
