               <p>Your letter addressed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers’s</a>, came to me the other day in a parcel from Bristol, a fortnight after that to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a>. I cannot express to you how it has provoked &amp; vexed me. Had I known that you thought

                           ever shone,/ That reverend British Saint [David, patron saint of Wales], in zealous
                           ages past,/ To contemplation liv’d; and did so truly fast,/ As he did only drink what

            <p class="indent1">I am no botanist, but like you, my earliest &amp; deepest recollections are connected
               with flowers, &amp; they &lt;always&gt; carry me back to other days. Perhaps this is because
               they are the only things which affect our senses precisely in the same manner as they
               did in childhood. The sweetness of the violet is always the same, &amp; when you rifle
               a rose &amp; drink as it were its fragrance, the refreshment is the same to the old man
               as to the boy. We see with different eyes, in proportion as we learn to discriminate,
               &amp; therefore this effect is not so certainly produced by visual objects. Sounds recall
               the past in the same manner, – but do not bring with them individual scenes like the
               cowslip field, or the bank of violets, or the corner of the garden to which we have
               transplanted <span class="strikethrough">the</span> field flowers. Oh what a happy season is childhood, if our modes of life &amp; education
               will let it be so! It were enough to make one misanthropical when we consider how
               great a portion of the evil of this world is mans own making, – if the knowledge of
               this truth did not imply that <span class="strikethrough">therefore</span> the evil is removable, &amp; therefore the prime duty of a good man is by all means in
               his power to assist in removing it.</p>
