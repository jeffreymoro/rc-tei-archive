                           used a review of Patrick Colquhoun (1745–1820; DNB), Propositions for ameliorating

                  </div> Thro this part I shall probably get to night, if the post (which is unusually late)
                  does not bring anything to prevent me. The main object of this article is to probe
                  the wounds of the body politic. We shall soon hear of scarcity again; <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> the Luddite system

                           The movement was based in the East Midlands, Lancashire and Yorkshire. Southey expressed

                  means are adopting for curing the evil, not merely for palliating it. I have a good
                  deal to say upon this subject, &amp; could not have a better place to say it in. Associations
                  for soup-shops &amp;c are mere palliatives, &amp; tho they have their good have their evil
                  also. The immediate desideratum is to supply employment to those who want it, – national
                  education is the alternative medicine slow in its operation but sure if time can be
                  found for it. Schemes of extensive &amp; liberal colonization are of the same character,
                  but will not be adopted so soon: an extended military establishment might be connected
                  with these, &amp; so connected as to render the country equally secure from within &amp; from
                  without. But there will be no time for any thing, unless that license of the newspaper
                  press is checked, which in its <span class="strikethrough">tendency</span> &lt;consequences&gt; is inevitably destructive to the liberty of the press &amp; to every thing
                  also that is valuable in society. Spring will be a trying season. It is now plain
                  that the harvest is rather below the average &amp; ordinary years. There will be no supplies
                  from America, none from the Baltic. Barbary &amp; the Black sea remain, from the latter
                  I think we <span class="strikethrough">might</span> ought to expect little or nothing, for Russia will want all its produce for herself.</p>
