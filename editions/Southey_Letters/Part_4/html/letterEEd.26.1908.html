                  about 1000 £ a year. An estate of half that value was left by the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">elder brother</a> to a farmers son, whom the father used to send sometimes with a hare &amp;c –.</p>

                           on Elton’s lack of cash are surprising, given that he was heir to a baronetcy, a large

                  has rather lowered Lucien in my opinion by the vanity which it implies. If his poem
                  be good for any thing – he may be sure it will find translators, – it looks ill to
                  be so impatient for fame as to look about for one &amp; pay him for his work. from whom
                  the application to my worship comes I do not know. – Lucien has probably applied to
                  some friend to recommend him to the best hand, – &amp; dispatch being one thing required,
                  the preference has perhaps on this score been given to me over M<sup>r</sup> Thomas Campbell,

                  shall return an answer expressing that respect, for I believe him to be a true republican,
                  &amp; any where out of England that is the best thing a man can be. To Grosvenor Bedford
                  I may say that if the poem in question be a bad one it will not be worth translating,
                  – &amp; if it be otherwise, I humbly conceive that the time which would &lt;be&gt; required
                  to translate it, may quite as worthily be bestowed upon a <span class="strikethrough">poem of</span> work of my own.</p>
