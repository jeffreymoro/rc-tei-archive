               <div class="l">Held by those huts its everlasting way</div>
               <div class="l">Toward Pionia. They whose flocks &amp; herds</div>

               <div class="l">Pelayo southward up the ruder vale</div>
               <div class="l">Traced it, his guide unerring. Amid heaps</div>
               <div class="l">Of mountain wreck on either side thrown high</div>
               <div class="l">The wide-spread traces of its wintry might,</div>
               <div class="l">The tortuous channel wound; oer beds of sand</div>
               <div class="l">Here silently it flows; here from the rock</div>
               <div class="l">Rebutted curls &amp; eddies, plunges here</div>
               <div class="l">Precipitate; here roaring among crags</div>
               <div class="l">It leaps &amp; foams &amp; whirls &amp; hurries on</div>

               <div class="l">Bared by the current, now against its force</div>
               <div class="l">Repaying the support they found, upheld</div>
               <div class="l">The bank secure. Here bending to the stream</div>
               <div class="l">The birch fantastic stretchd its rugged trunk</div>
               <div class="l">Tall &amp; erect from whence as from a base</div>
               <div class="l">Each like a tree its silver branches grew</div>
               <div class="l">The cherry tree hung for the birds of heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Its rosy fruit on high. The elder there</div>
               <div class="l">Its purple berries oer the water bent</div>
               <div class="l">Heavily hanging. Here amid the brook</div>
               <div class="l">Grey as the stone to which it clung, half-root,</div>
               <div class="l">Half trunk, the young ash rises from the rock,</div>
               <div class="l">And there its parent lifts a lofty head</div>
               <div class="l">And spreads its graceful boughs; the passing wind</div>
               <div class="l">With twinkling motion lifts the silent leaves</div>
               <div class="l">And shakes the rattling tufts.</div>
               <div class="l">Soon had the Prince</div>
               <div class="l">Behind him left the farthest dwelling-place</div>
               <div class="l">Of man; no fields of wavering corn were here</div>
               <div class="l">Nor wicker storehouse for the autumnal grain,</div>
               <div class="l">Vineyard, nor bowery fig, nor fruitful grove;</div>
               <div class="l">Only the rocky vale, the mountain stream,</div>
               <div class="l">Incumbent crags, &amp; hills that over hills</div>
               <div class="l">Arose on either hand, here hung with woods,</div>
               <div class="l">Here rich with heath that oer some smooth ascent</div>
               <div class="l">Its purple glory spread, or golden gorse’</div>
               <div class="l">Bare here &amp; striated with many a hue</div>
               <div class="l">Scored by wintry rain; by torrents here</div>
               <div class="l">Riven, &amp; with overhanging rock abrupt.</div>
               <div class="l">Pelayo upward, as he cast his eyes,</div>
               <div class="l">Where crags loose-hanging oer the narrow pass</div>
               <div class="l">Impended, there beheld his countrys strength</div>
               <div class="l">Insuperable, &amp; in his heart rejoiced.</div>
               <div class="l">Oh that the Musselman were here, he cried,</div>
               <div class="l">With all his myriads! While thy day endures</div>
               <div class="l">Moor, thou mayst lord it in the plains, but here</div>
               <div class="l">Hath Nature for the free &amp; brave prepard</div>
               <div class="l">A sanctuary, where no oppressors power,</div>
               <div class="l">No might of human tyranny can pierce.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">The tears which started then sprang not alone</div>
               <div class="l">From loft thoughts of elevating joy;</div>
               <div class="l">For love &amp; admiration had their part</div>
               <div class="l">And virtuous pride. Here then thou hast retired</div>
               <div class="l">My Gaudiosa! in his heart he said</div>
               <div class="l">Excellent woman! neer was richer boon</div>
               <div class="l">By fate benign to favoured man indulged,</div>
               <div class="l">Than when thou wert before the face of heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Given me to my childrens mother, brave</div>
               <div class="l">And virtuous as thou art! Here thou hast fled</div>
               <div class="l">Thou who wert nurst in palaces, to dwell</div>
               <div class="l">In rocks &amp; mountain caves! – The thought was proud</div>
               <div class="l">Yet not without a sense of inmost pain;</div>
               <div class="l">For never had Pelayo till that hour</div>
               <div class="l">So deeply felt the force of solitude.</div>
               <div class="l">High over head the eagle soard serene,</div>
               <div class="l">And the grey lizard on the rocks below</div>
               <div class="l">Basked in the sun: no living creature else</div>
               <div class="l">In this remotest wilderness was seen;</div>
               <div class="l">Nor living voice was there, – only the flow</div>
               <div class="l">Of Deva, &amp; the rushing of its springs</div>
               <div class="l">Long in the distance heard, which nearer now</div>
               <div class="l">With endless repercussion deep &amp; loud</div>
               <div class="l">Throbb’d on the dizzy sense.</div>
               <div class="l">The ascending vale</div>
               <div class="l">Long straitened by the narrowing mountains, here</div>
               <div class="l">Was closed. In front a rock abrupt &amp; bare</div>
               <div class="l">Stood eminent, in height exceeding far</div>
               <div class="l">All edifice of human power, by King</div>

               <div class="l">Assyrian or Egyptian in their pride.</div>
               <div class="l">Yet far above; beyond the reach of sight</div>
               <div class="l">Swell above swell, the shaggy mountain rose.</div>
               <div class="l">Here in two sources from the living rock</div>
               <div class="l">The everlasting springs of Deva gushd.</div>
               <div class="l">Upon a smooth &amp; grassy plat below,</div>
               <div class="l">By nature there as for an altar drest</div>
               <div class="l">They joined their sister stream, which from the earth</div>
               <div class="l">Well’d silently. In such a scene rude man</div>

               <div class="l">Gainst knights &amp; ladies waged discourteous war,</div>
               <div class="l">Erect within the portal might have stood.</div>
               <div class="l">The broken stone allowed for hand &amp; foot</div>
               <div class="l">No difficult ascent, above the base</div>
               <div class="l">In height a tall mans stature measured thrice.</div>

               <div class="l">Be with the noblest blood of martyrdom</div>

               <div class="l">By many a miracle made manifest;</div>
               <div class="l">Nor in the heroic annals of her fame</div>
               <div class="l">Doth she show forth a scene of more renown.</div>
               <div class="l">Then, save the hunter drawn in keen pursuit</div>
               <div class="l">Beyond his wonted haunts, or shepherds boy</div>
               <div class="l">Following the pleasure of his straggling flock</div>
               <div class="l">None knew the place.</div>
               <div class="l">Pelayo when he saw</div>
               <div class="l">Those glittering sources &amp; their sacred cave,</div>
               <div class="l">Took from his side the bugle silver-tipt,</div>
               <div class="l">And with a breath long-drawn &amp; slow-expird</div>
               <div class="l">Sent forth that strain, which echoing from the walls</div>
               <div class="l">Of Cangas wont to tell his glad return</div>
               <div class="l">When from the chase he came. At the first sound</div>
               <div class="l">Favilla started in the cave &amp; cried</div>
               <div class="l">My Fathers horn! a sudden flush suffusd</div>
               <div class="l">Hermesinds cheek, &amp; she with quickened eye</div>
               <div class="l">Lookd eager to her mother silently;</div>
               <div class="l">But Gaudiosa trembled &amp; grew pale</div>
               <div class="l">Doubting her sense deceived. A second time</div>
               <div class="l">The bugle breathed its well-known notes abroad,</div>
               <div class="l">And Hermesind around her mothers neck</div>

               <p>So the curtain has fallen after a tragedy of five &amp; twenty years! In two respects
                  the catastrophe is as it should be. Buonapartes degradation is compleat, even his
                  military reputation is lost, &amp; he is suffered to live more because he may safely be
                  despised than because of his Austrian marriage.
