                  </div> papers have <span class="strikethrough">most</span> cruelly disappointed me. During his employment at Paris he kept copies of all his
                  official correspondence, – but he ceased to do this when he went to Lisbon, – or at
                  least no such correspondence appears. I find what the principal matters were upon
                  which he was called upon to negociate, – but little of the progress of the negociation,
                  &amp; nothing of the result. Upon these points however I shall write to you fully erelong.
                  – There are some very valuable papers respecting the country itself, &amp; some interesting
