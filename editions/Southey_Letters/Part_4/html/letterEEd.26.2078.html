               the account. If the Register continues I shall by the same time have paid off a debt
               contracted for my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henrys</a> education, after which it will be in my power to lay by at least 100£ a year. At
               present I am worth 209£ – vested in the Register as a twelfth share. This is the foundation
               stone &amp; it is something to have laid one. If I live &amp; preserve my health &amp; faculties
               I have no doubt of realizing a decent competency in the course of twenty years: but
               twenty years is almost as much as my chance of life would be reckoned at in tables
               of calculation, &amp; much more than it really is, for besides my hereditary title to
               consumption, I am not of a long lived race. The Southeys of the last generation barely
               reached three score.</p>

               <p>One thing which I will do whenever I can afford leisure for the task, will be to write

                  my life-insurance, for there can be no doubt that I shall be sufficiently talked of
                  whenever I am gone. – Such are my ways &amp; means for the future. But if I should not
                  live to provide more than the very little which is already done, then indeed the exertions
                  of some friends would be required. An arrangement might be made with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> to allow of a subscription edition of my works, &amp; this would be productive in proportion
                  to the efforts that were used. I should hope also that in such a case the continuance
                  of my pension might be looked for from either of the present parties in the state,
