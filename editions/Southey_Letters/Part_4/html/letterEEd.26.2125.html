                  faithful to her orders, refused us admittance, saying that if we were going to the

                  in till we had promised to call at the Hall. Accordingly, against the grain in observance

               to remind me of Ludlow, &amp; a little, in its air of antiquity, of Glastonbury: – certainly
               one of the fine things of England. Easeby Abbey is near, on the banks of the river,

               of the Ure at Aysgarth (which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ErskineHenry">M<sup>r</sup> Erskine</a> recommended us to see) &amp; leaving the little town of Askrigg on our right. At the
               higher end of the valley, almost every field has an out house in it, for housing the
               hay &amp; the cattle, – this gives a most singular appearance to the country. Walked from
               Hawes a mile &amp; half to Ardra Scar, – a waterfall which I have no room to describe
               here. Took chaise that night 17 miles to Ingleton Walks, the morning a road of 13
               miles to the caves &amp; Thornton force. &amp; then 10 more to Settle. Tomorrow we walk to
               Malham &amp; Gordale Scar a round of 14, – back to Ingleton (weather permitting) &amp; chaise
               it to Lancaster. Our future movements depend upon the time for crossing the sands,
               so that I cannot say where our sleeping place will be – only that we shall go to Ulverston,
               see <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#FurnessAbbey">Furness Abbey</a>, make for Irton, &amp; come home by Wasdale over the Stye, – probably at home on Monday
               night. Our feet are sound &amp; we are as well as could be wishd, &amp; have thus far been
               as fortunate. I have finishd this since supper, having supt nobly. It was time, yesterday
               the only animal food which I took was three quarters of a fish at supper, out of a
               pie &amp; I had none today till supper: but eggs &amp; milk, &amp; tea &amp; toast are little things
