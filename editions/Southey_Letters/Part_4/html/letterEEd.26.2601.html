                  </div> – It is surprizing to me that men whose fortunes are not absolutely desperate at home
                  will go to India to seek them, that is men who have any feeling beyond what is connected
                  with the sense of touch. Fourteen years transportation is a heavy sentence, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</a> I think has been gone 17. – What a portion of human life is this, &amp; of its best years!
                  After such an absence the <span class="strikethrough">shock</span> &lt;pain&gt; of returning is <span class="strikethrough">has</span> hardly less severe, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">the</span> perhaps <span class="strikethrough">the grief more</span> &lt;more&gt; lasting, than that of departure. He finds his family thinned by death, – his
                  parents if he finds them at all, fallen into old age, &amp; on the brink of the grave,
                  – the friends whom he left in youth, so changed as to be no longer the same – What
                  fortune can make amends for this! It is indeed propter vitam vivendi perdere causas!

                  intercourse, meet now only at intervals of two or three years; tho besides &lt;our&gt; communication
                  by letter (too seldom I <span class="ital">confess</span> rather than <span class="ital">complain</span>) what we do in public serves to keep us in sight of each other. However indifferent
                  may be the matter of the debate, I always look to see if M<sup>r</sup> C Wynn has spoken. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</a> must almost feel himself in another world.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Your last letter was in a more despondent strain than I expected from you. You gained
               so much credit last year by strengthening the Government &amp; facilitating its exertions,
               – that I wished to have seen the same feeling displayed now, when it would have been
               both honourable &amp; popular to have spoken more boldly than ministers ventured to do.
               In some of the debates I know not whether they or their assailants <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> provoked me most.</p>

                  halter round the neck, at the door of the Burial Place in the Escurial. The contest
                  in France cannot surely be long; if Buonaparte could have acted with vigour on the
                  offensive he would have found perilous allies in Saxony, &amp; little resistance from
                  the Belgians. But the internal state of France paralises him, &amp; if he acts on the
                  defensive he can derive no advantage from the injustice of the great German powers.
                  Two things were wanting last year, the British army did not get to Paris, &amp; the French
                  were neither punished as they deserved nor humbled as the interests of the rest of
                  the world required. It will I trust now be put beyond all doubt that they have been
