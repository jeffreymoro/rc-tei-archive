                        The letter was possibly amongst the letters from Southey to Duppa that Robinson was
                        given by Duppa’s niece, Mrs Stone, in January 1844, see Henry Crabb Robinson on Books

                        note: the letter is possibly a reply to the letter from Duppa that Southey received
