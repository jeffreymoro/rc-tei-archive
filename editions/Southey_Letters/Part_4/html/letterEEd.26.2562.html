               <p>I have delayed longer than I ought to have done, to thank you in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartleys</a> name &amp; in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">his mother</a> for your unsolicited kindness toward him,

                  in your cancelled preface of the couplet coincides with the practice of our early
                  poets; many, or rather most of whom, wrote it with all the freedom &amp; variety of blank
                  verse.

                  </div> My judgement upon this point accords with theirs &amp; with yours. I could have wished
                  that the title of your poem had been different: because it unavoidably excites an
                  expectation that the subject will be the New &amp; not the Old Testament history – but
                  I see the difficulty of substituting any other which <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> would embrace the whole of so extensive a plan. Have you ever seen Sylvesters translation
                  of Du Bartas?

                  takes the same range of scripture history that you have done, tho’ handled in a very
                  different manner, being full of digressions &amp; desultory matter. Du Bartas comes down
                  to the Captivity. – Two other parts were to have compleated his plan – Messiah, &amp;
                  the Eternal Sabbath, but he did not live to write them. But I am inclined to think
                  that if he had lived, he would have filled up the intervening portion of Jewish history,
                  &amp; probably have made his Judith

                  </div> a part of this extensive undertaking. You who perhaps are not so tolerant in these
                  matters as I am, would perhaps be disgusted with the conceits of Du Bartas &amp; the quaintnesses
                  of his translator: I can see all their faults &amp; yet admire the powers which both have
                  perverted.</p>

                  of the New Testament. There are many splendid subjects, &amp; the connection of the whole
