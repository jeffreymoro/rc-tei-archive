               <p>You would hear of us from Nottingham, where we met the kindest and warmest reception;
                  – that after departing from your mother’s

                           November 1815 on their return trip from London to Keswick; see Southey to William
                           Wordsworth, 1 December 1815, Letter 2672.</span></div>
                  </div> house we broke down in the streets you probably would not hear, for we went to the
                  inn while our luggage was shifted to another chaise, and no hurt was done. On the
                  Tuesday night we reached <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</a> about seven o’clock; it would have been possible to have got home by ten, but to have
                  come in at night when the children were asleep, would have been a cruel disappointment
                  to them and to us! A return of this kind is a sort of triumph for which daylight is
                  required, and sunshine also, if it could be had upon demand. So we slept at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RydalMount">Rydal</a>, and the next morning made our appearance. I need not say that it was a happy house
                  that day. God be thanked we found them all in health, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</a> had improved in health every day after she left London.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My table was covered with letters; and though I fully intended to have told you of
               our safe arrival by the first post, I had not fulfilled my intention when the post
               hour came.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You loaded us with kindness in London, and added largely to the treasures which we
               brought home for the children, – treasures they may be called; for things of infinitely
               greater value would give them less delight in riper years. I shall feel myself your
               debtor till you have brought your sisters here; or rather let me say, you <span class="ital">owe</span> us this gratification; and if your excellent mother would be of the party, our gratification
               would be the greater.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteJames">James</a> was looking well. I wish I could assist him in his search for a curacy.</p>

               <p>It will be some days before I can, as it were, find my way, and resume the broken
                  thread of old employments. At this moment I am up to the elbows in letters, these
                  I hasten to clear off, in the hope of this night beginning my poem.
