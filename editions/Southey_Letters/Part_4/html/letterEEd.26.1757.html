                  </div> He has consulted me upon the subject, and the plain statement which I have here made
                  of the circumstances has interested me very deeply … My opinion is that great things

                  sale. Of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> I foresaw the success as much as such a thing could be foreseen. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobertsWilliamIsaac">Roberts</a> has left nothing so good as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> best pieces; in fact he died younger, and was precluded from the possibility of advancing
                  himself as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> did, in choosing a learned profession because his salary was wanted at home. There
                  is another reason too against their general sale; though he was most exemplary in
                  all his duties, and, as far as I can discover, absolutely without a spot or blemish
                  upon his character, and a regular and sincere churchman, there is nothing of that
                  kind of piety in his writings to which the Remains are mostly indebted for their popularity.
                  …</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My hope is that such a sum may be raised as will be sufficient to place Eliza Roberts
               in a situation respectably to support herself and her parents. I do not yet know what
               extent the publication will run to, but as soon as this is settled, I will beg you
               to <span class="ital">beg</span> subscriptions. … This whole account is written with such a cautious fear of saying
               too much, that I fear I have said too little, and may unwittingly have led you to
               think slightingly of what poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobertsWilliamIsaac">William Roberts</a> has left behind him. If I have done this I have done wrong, for certainly he was
               a youth of great genius and most uncommon promise, which it is my firm belief, founded
               upon the purity of his life and principles and the rectitude of his feelings, that
               he would amply have fulfilled, if it had not pleased God to remove him so early from
               this sphere of existence.</p>
