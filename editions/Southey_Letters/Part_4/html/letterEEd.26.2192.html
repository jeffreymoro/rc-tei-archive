               <p>I think R.B.s name was Robert Burton, – he is however a very well known personage
                  among our Bibliographers, – a Grub Street compiler who about 1680 used to make little
                  close printed volumes for country readers, at one shilling each, with vile wooden
                  cuts, – some of which books are now just reprinted in guinea quartos with fac-similes
                  of these disfigurements as they may <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> fitly be called.

                           Crouch (c. 1640–1725?; DNB). They were chosen in reference to Robert Burton (1577–1640;
                           DNB), author of the Anatomy of Melancholy (1620), which incorporated hundreds of translations
                           from Latin and Greek sources, thus making classical knowledge more widely available
                           to the less privileged classes. Crouch was equally keen to democratise learning, producing
                           simplified versions of more learned works and histories and publishing these cheaply,
                           thus ensuring a wide circulation.</span></div>
                  </div> The book which I have quoted could not help having some curious things in it, from
                  its subject, &amp; is in fact often quoted without any farther suspicion of its fidelity
                  than attaches to all works written in an age of physical credulity.

               Crouch (c. 1640–1725?; <em>DNB</em>). They were chosen in reference to Robert Burton (1577–1640; <em>DNB</em>), author of the <em>Anatomy of Melancholy</em> (1620), which incorporated hundreds of translations from Latin and Greek sources,
               thus making classical knowledge more widely available to the less privileged classes.
               Crouch was equally keen to democratise learning, producing simplified versions of
               more learned works and histories and publishing these cheaply, thus ensuring a wide
               circulation.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
