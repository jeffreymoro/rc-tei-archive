                  </div> brought in one of his own manufacturing, &amp; to convince us that it <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> was the actual horse hair; – putting his nails upon what seemed the skin of the creature <span class="strikethrough">he</span> stripped it down on both sides, &amp; laid bare the horse hair in the middle. It must
                  be an aggregation of life on the hair, for that remains unchanged; – but whether of
                  numerous animalculæ, or of a <span class="strikethrough">new form of xxxx</span> class <span class="strikethrough">of</span> not yet described, remains to be discovered; for want of glasses I could make out
                  nothing. There was no appearance of head or tail; – indeed the white root of the hair
                  was visible, somewhat swoln, &amp; its fibres assuming a stringy appearance from maceration;
                  the hair itself was covered with a very dark brown coating, &amp; writhed <span class="strikethrough">in all d</span> like an eel, in such a manner that I cannot think the motion could possibly be given
                  by any collection of animalculæ, but that it must have been an individual impulse.
                  It was as thick as a <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> middle-sized fiddle-string. – Here is <span class="strikethrough">a fine</span> something for the <span class="strikethrough">phil</span> naturalists to investigate – May it not lead to an explanation of the origin of our
