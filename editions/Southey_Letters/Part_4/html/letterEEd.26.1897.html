               <p>I am surprized by what you say about the Quarterly, – rather more at the gross mismanagement <span class="strikethrough">of the</span> than at the thing itself.

                           review of Sir Charles William Pasley (1780–1861; DNB), Essay on the Military Policy
                           and Institutions of the British Empire (1810). Southey, who had been supplied with
                           information by Rickman, used this as an opportunity to attack the government. The
                           finished article had been deemed by Gifford to be ‘perfectly incorrect and dangerous’
                           with the result that the version published in the Quarterly Review, 5 (May 1811),
                           403–457, was much altered by Croker, in consultation with Gifford and Murray; see

                  case they must take care to be civil enough. – The first thing I shall do upon receiving
                  formal notice of the suppression, – will be to demand back the MSS. or in preference
                  &lt;a set of&gt; the printed sheets, if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> has had the sense to preserve a fair impression, &amp; then I shall hand it over to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> – upon trial for his British Review.
