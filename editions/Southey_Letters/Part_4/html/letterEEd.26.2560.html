                           of his 1810 or 1811 expedition. In turn, Murray had sought Southey’s opionion on Nuttall’s

                  had been more of a journalist, &amp; given to his narrative that connected interest which
                  the recital of personal adventure can hardly fail to excite. But physical science
                  is his favourite pursuit, &amp; upon these things, I who know nothing, take it for granted
                  that every man who writes at all writes with a competent knowledge of his subject.
                  A very considerable part of the book is thus <span class="strikethrough">occupied</span> filled.
