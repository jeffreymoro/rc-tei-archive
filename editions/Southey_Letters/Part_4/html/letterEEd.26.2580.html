                  is diffused among the populace; the men in power either are ignorant of the danger,
                  or like the ostrich they shut their eyes to it. Do you remember what the parts were

                  order of events, which is perceptible to me, upon the great scale, throughout the
                  course of human history. And I felt with indignation that an outrage had been committed
