               <p>I hope these corrections will reach you in time. They were sent me the very day the

               of the year 1810, we had 27,391 Regular Cavalry, to which 2739 may be added for Commissioned
               Officers &amp; Serjeants, who are not reckoned among the Effectives, – &amp; who average at
               Four commissioned officers &amp; six serjeants to every 100 men, that is Ten per Cent:
               total Regular Cavalry therefore 30,131. Regular Infantry 183,768, add one Tenth as
               before, 202,144: Artillery Horse &amp; Foot 24,304, add for commissioned officers (for
               in this branch of our force only these are reckoned seperately) 941, in all 25,245.

               in round numbers 290,000. And this number is now about to be augmented largely from
               the Old Militia which amounts to 84,300 men, &amp; adding the Tenth, 92,730, so that we
               maintain 384,670 men, entirely dedicated to military pursuits, in the Army.</p>
