            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I should have answered your letter immediately, if I had not been engaged with visitors
                  when it arrived. In the course of my life, I have more than once had reason to be
                  thankful for having done things which would have been left undone if the first impulse
                  had been suffered to pass by; for second thought in matters of feeling usually brings
                  with it hesitation, and demurral, and doubt, from which the whole brood of sins of
                  omission are derived. Your letter affected me. It seems to come from a good heart,
                  and a wounded one; and therefore I will venture to say what is upon my mind, in spite
                  of those obvious considerations which might prevent me. You tell me that your schemes
                  of happiness are for ever frustrated; and this, you say, after years enough have elapsed
                  since your bereavement
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Barton’s wife, Lucy Jessup (1781–1808), died in childbirth after a year of marriage.

                  </div> to have taken away the keenness of grief. But though the object of your earliest attachment
                  is lost, I think you act erroneously in resolving that no other shall supply its place.
                  If I may judge of you by your letter, I can perfectly understand by how natural a
                  process of sorrow you would be induced thus, as it were, to consecrate your affections
                  to her who is in the world of spirits. But if you had a son who, in the same circumstances,
                  were to form the same resolution, you would blame as well as pity him. Our happiness,
                  and I may almost venture to add our virtue also, is in proportion to the duties which
                  we perform. A second attachment will never be like the first in degree, but it may
                  be like it in kind; it would not be difficult to find a woman who would place her
                  whole affections upon you; and in making her happiness you would find your own. The
                  evening of life affords no cheerful prospect to the happiest of us; to him whom it
                  will find in loneliness, a most mournful one.</p>

                  the support of my family, and value riches exactly at what they are worth. I have
                  store of books, and pass my life among them, finding no enjoyment equal to that of
                  accumulating knowledge. In worldly affairs, the world would consider me as unfortunate,
                  for I have been deprived of a good property which, by the common laws of inheritance,
