After the end of their affair in May 1806, she had threatened to publish intimate
               details of their relationship. More recently, both had been at the centre of a scandal
               over the alleged misuse of military patronage. After a lengthy investigation, the
               charges against the Duke, who was Commander-in-Chief of the army, were found to be
               unproven. It had, however, become apparent that Mrs Clarke had received money from
               individuals keen for her to use her influence with the Duke, and that the Duke himself
               had known of her actions. For Southey’s account, <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</em>, 2.1 (1811), 109–301.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
