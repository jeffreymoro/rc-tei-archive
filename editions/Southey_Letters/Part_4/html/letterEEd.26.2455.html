                  </div> A few days after they were dispatched I received a letter from him from Weymouth,
                  explaining the causes of his departure in a manner which I sincerely hope the natural
                  warmth of his mind has made him overcharge. The whole affair has given me great uneasiness,
                  – &amp; the more because I cannot but feel that I have been, very innocently, instrumental
                  in it, having been the means of introducing Betham to him.
