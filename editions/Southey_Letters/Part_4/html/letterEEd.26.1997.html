                  You can never send me too many books upon any subject on which I am to write, respecting
                  the Poor however, it seems that you have been forming one plan &amp; I another. My original
                  intention was to take the Reports of the Bettering Society for the text, &amp; show what
                  actually had been done &amp; was doing towards lessening the evils of humanity in this
                  country. – a set off on the part of the true reformers against those who ought to
                  be called refor<span class="ital">mists</span>. The subject is certainly, as you have felt it to be, materially connected with the
                  general state of the Poor, – but I am inclined to think it may be better to treat
                  it distinctly, &amp; form two essays.
