                           in 1817, he took with him, at Reumont’s request, a copy of Thomas Percy’s (1729–1811;

               <p>The day after my letter was written we reached Spa, &amp; remained there Sunday &amp; Monday,
                  a pleasant &amp; necessary pause, – tho the pleasure was somewhat interrupted by the state
                  of my own health, which was somewhat disordered there, – perhaps the effect of the
                  thin Rhenish wines &amp; the grapes. Tuesday we would have slept at Verviers (the great
                  clothing town) if we could have found beds, – an English party had preoccupied them,
                  &amp; we proceeded to Herve, a little town half-way between Liege &amp; Aix la Chapelle, in
                  the old principality of Limbourg. There, for the only time during our journey <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith-May</a> was put to sleep in a different from mine, for it was not possible to arrange things
                  otherwise. She slept with the servant of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VardonMr">Vardons</a>, – a young woman whom they have bred up.

                  </div> When we rose in the morning we found that she had not slept <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> any part of the night owing to a sore throat: – she had gone to bed apparently in
                  high health &amp; spirits. Being accustomed to see her tonsils swoln to a degree which
                  might have alarmed a person not used to <span class="strikethrough">such</span> see it, I was not uneasy; &amp; having bought some hartshorn to rub it with, we proceeded
                  to Aix la Chapelle – about 16 miles. – there was indeed no alternative, for any medical
                  advice which could have been found in Herve, would have been worse than nothing. But
                  the journey over a paved road, was the worst thing which could have <span class="strikethrough">been</span> befallen a patient in an incipient fever, &amp; when we arrived the child was so ill,
                  that after seeing her laid to bed (about one o clock <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> in the afternoon) I thought it necessary to go to the Bankers &amp; request them to recommend
                  me to a physician. You may imagine how painful a time we past. It was necessary for
                  her to gargle every hour, even if we waked her for it, – but she never slept an hour
                  continuously for the three first nights. Thank God however she seems thoroughly recovered
                  now, we are at Brussels, &amp; can estimate the good with calmness.</p>
