                  one of the many absurdities of this age that a man obtains more credit for an article
                  in the Review, than for the best work which he could possibly produce upon the same
                  subject, if his name were affixed to the volume. However it is of little consequence
                  to me in what manner the reputation has been obtained; in a fair way I am sure it
                  has been, &amp; I am sure too that tho it does not rest upon the proper ground, it is
                  well deserved. All that concerns me is that it affects favourably the marketable value
                  of my produce. I shall be tempted by the success of Kehama to move a little faster
                  with Pelayo.
