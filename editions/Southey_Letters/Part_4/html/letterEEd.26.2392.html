               <div class="salute">My dear Neville,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am afraid I have been silent for a longer time than has ever before passed without
               a letter since our communication began. How truly has it been said that the first
               twenty years of life are the longest part of it, let it be ever so long extended.
               Days, weeks, and months now pass away so rapidly and yet so imperceptibly, that I
               am scarcely sensible of the sum of time which has gone by, till some business stares
               me in the face which has been left undone.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is not, however, from uniformity of happiness that time of late has passed so speedily
                  with me. We have had ailments enough among the children to keep me perpetually anxious
                  for the last eight or ten weeks. These are things which a man hardly understands till
                  they have happened to himself, and even then some are affected more by them and some
                  less; but it is one of the weak parts of my nature to feel them more perhaps than
                  the occasion always justifies. I myself have had my share, though not a very heavy
                  one, of the complaints which the unusual length and obstinacy of the winter scattered
                  so plentifully in these parts. And though I have not been idle, and what I have done
                  might be deemed a sufficient quantity for one who had less to do, the last four months
                  have perhaps produced less than any former ones. I readily acknowledge that it may
                  be fortunate for me to be under the necessity of continually bestirring my faculties
                  in composition, otherwise the pleasure of acquiring knowledge, and continually supplying
                  those deficiencies in my own acquirements, of which they who know most are most sensible
                  in themselves, is so much more delightful than the act of communicating what I already
                  know, that very probably I might fall into this kind of self-indulgence. My great
                  poem will not be out before June.

                           wider strategic consequences. Southey disliked Graham both for his criticism of the
                           Spanish army’s operations at Barrosa and his Whig opinions (he was MP for Perthshire

                  </div> – a battle which he ought not to have fought, and which was worse than useless. Government
                  knew this, and felt concerning it as I am now expressing myself. Yet they of course
                  were glad to raise a cry of success, and the Opposition joined it in extolling Graham
                  for the sake of abusing the Spaniards; whereas, in truth, he was infinitely more in
                  fault than La Peña.
