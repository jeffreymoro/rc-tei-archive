               <p>My household is affected with a complaint which I take at this time to be epidemic,
                  – the fear of ugly fellows. In <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridge</a> perhaps this <span class="strikethrough">dislike</span> may have originated in her <span class="strikethrough">intercourse with</span> &lt;dislike to&gt; you, but the newspapers have <span class="strikethrough">certainly</span> increased it, – every day brings bloody news from Carlisle, Cockermouth &amp;c – last
                  night half the people in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> sat up, alarmed by two strangers who according to all accounts were certainly ‘no
                  beauties’ – &amp; I was obliged to take down a rusty gun &amp; manfully load it for the satisfaction
                  of the family. The gun has been properly cleaned to day, &amp; the Lord have mercy upon
                  him who may be destined to receive its contents. – But in sober truth the ugly fellows
                  abound here as well as in London, – we are indebted for them partly to the manufactories
                  at Carlisle, &amp; partly to that distinguished patriot Christian Curwen,

                  provide me with more convenient arms than this <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> old Spanish fowling piece. Buy for me therefore a brace of pistols, – the plainer
                  &amp; cheaper the better, so they <span class="strikethrough">wil</span> are good, – that is, – so they will stand fire without danger of bursting. Sights
                  &amp; hair-triggers may be dispensed with, as they are neither for show, nor for duelling,
                  of course this order includes a bullet mould. – And I have leave from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">my Governess</a> – nay more than that, she has <span class="ital">desired</span> me – to send for a Watchman’s rattle. think of that G.

                  designed by her to give the alarm when the ugly fellows come, – but oh Grosvenor the
                  glorious <span class="strikethrough">tunes</span>, tunes, the solo’s &amp; bravuras that I shall play upon that noble musical instrument
