                  our enemies as severe a chastisement as they deserve, I was, nevertheless, ready to
                  conform to the advice, or even inclination of others. Do not give me any credit for
                  this. The fact is, that though, whenever I write, it is with all my heart, and with
                  all my strength, I write too much and too variously to have any overweaning affection
                  for what is written, especially in a case like this, where the object is, that the
                  essay should do its work, not that I should gratify myself by any display of superiority.

                           Education (1812). Bell’s letter of 26 December 1811 had expressed concern that his
                           case would be damaged if Southey employed ‘any degree of acrimony and severity of
                           expression’. Instead he urged him to write in ‘the least offensive and most conciliatory
                           style’; see The Life of the Rev. Andrew Bell, 3 vols (London, 1844), II, p. 650. Southey
                           complied with Bell’s request; see Southey to John Murray [c. 30 December 1811], Letter
