            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By this time you are settled at Pembroke,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           of advice.</span></div>
                  </div> know your way to your rooms, the faces of your fellow collegians, and enough I dare
                  say of a college life to find its duties less formidable, and its habits less agreeable
                  than they are supposed to be. Those habits are said to have undergone a great reformation
                  since I was acquainted with them; – in my time they stood grievously in need of it;
                  but even then a man who had any good moral principles might live as he pleased if
                  he dared make the trial; and however much he might be stared at at first for his singularity,
                  was sure ere long to be respected for it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Some dangers beset every man when he enters upon so new a scene of life; that which
               I apprehend for you is low spirits … Walk a stated distance every day; and that you
               may never want a motive for walking, make yourself acquainted with the elements of
               botany during the winter, that as soon as the flowers come out in the spring you may
               begin to herbalize. A quarter of an hour every day will make you master of the elements
               in the course of a very few months. I prescribe for you mentally also, and this is
               one of the prescriptions; for it is of main importance that you should provide yourself
               with amusement as well as employment. Pursue no study longer than you can without
               effort attend to it, and lay it aside whenever it interests you too much: whenever
               it impresses itself so much upon your mind that you dream of it or lie awake thinking
               about it, be sure it is then become injurious. Follow my practice of making your latest
               employment in the day something unconnected with its other pursuits, and you will
               be able to lay your head upon the pillow like a child.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>One word more and I have done with advice. Do not be solicitous about taking a high
                  degree, or about college honours of any kind. Many a man has killed himself at Cambridge

                  </div> by overworking for mathematical honours; recollect how few the persons are who after
                  they have spent their years in severe study at this branch of science, ever make any
                  use of it afterwards. Your wiser plan should be to look on to that state of life in
                  which you wish and expect to be placed, and to lay in such knowledge as will then
                  turn to account. …</p>
