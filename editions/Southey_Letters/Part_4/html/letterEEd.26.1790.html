                        18 February 1810 and about 10 years after Southey and Barker met in June 1800. Therefore

                  business requiring immediate answer, – &amp; being once delayed, – the difficulty of knowing
                  what to say, – rather the impossibility of saying any thing to the purpose, became
                  a cause of farther delay. What can be said! – of all the persons whom I have ever
                  known you have been the most unfortunate in your family, – but even this, aggravated
                  as it has been by this last stroke, is a less painful consideration to me than to
                  think on how frail a tenure the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">only connection</a> rests in which you have found any kind of compensation. You yourself have never appeared
                  to me to be sensible on how very frail a thread it hangs, [two words crossed out]

                  willing to believe that as you have no friend who possibly can love you better, –
                  so there should be none to whose society you should more naturally look for as much
                  enjoyment as the untoward circumstances of life have left to be your portion. Ten

                  of persons of different sexes who are not related have given us a thorough knowledge
