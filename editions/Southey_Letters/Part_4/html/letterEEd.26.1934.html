            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My influence with the booksellers is not very great, yet I am not without hopes that
                  it may be in my power to open some channels thro which you may benefit the public
                  in a manner profitable to yourself. I have told <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</a> that I can perhaps procure a life of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a> for the next Edinb. Ann. Register, – that is the vol. for 1810, which will be published
                  early in the next year.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See ‘Life of Dr. Beddoes’, Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810, 3.2 (1812), 516–537.</span></div>
                  </div> The pay is ten guineas per sheet, &amp; the subject may fairly fill &lt;from&gt; two to three.
                  Stocks life will supply you with the leading facts, – but Stock is not a man by any
                  means capable of writing a philosophical account of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a>.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>John Edmonds Stock (1774–1835), Memoirs of the Life of Thomas Beddoes, M.D. With an
                           Analytical Account of His Writings (1811).</span></div>
                  </div> Some personal anecdotes I can <span class="strikethrough">supply yo</span> communicate, from my own knowledge, &amp; can procure any specific information which you
                  may wish to possess.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Probably also I can introduce you to the Quarterly Review, this however is said far
               more from a reliance upon you, than upon my own interest in that quarter, <span class="strikethrough">for</span> I have never seen either the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Publisher</a> or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Editor</a>, &amp; after all, personal recommendations would be of no avail, if the papers recommended
               did not approve themselves. The only sure mode of proceeding is, that you should chuse
               your own subject &amp; prepare an article. That upon Medical Reform would have done admirably.
               – You can easily find a text, &amp; I will put your paper into <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</a> hands. The pay here also is 10 guineas. – There is no reason why you should confine
               yourself to a medical subject if any other occurs to you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">These retail employments are the most gainful, – or at least they have this advantage
               that their returns are immediate &amp; certain. But it has occurred to me that you might,
               almost with a certainty of equal profit, &amp; with a probability of far greater, employ
               yourself upon a work which is intimately connected with your profession, &amp; would tend
               to advance you in it, which in itself is worthy of your time &amp; talents, &amp; would prove
               a delightful occupation. I mean a history at once popular &amp; philosophical of the art
               of medicine. There are <span class="strikethrough">many</span> I know histories of this art of great extent &amp; prodigious labour: – but they are
               exclusively professional &amp; from their bulk probably very little known to the profession
               themselves. What I propose to your consideration is a work wanting in general history,
               – tracing the origin of the art, following its progress till from a superstition it
               became a science, explaining the various theories which have encumbered it, &amp; enlivening
               the detail by biographical sketches, accounts of the various schools of medicine,
               – &amp; c. it would be a history of diseases also, – that is of the changes in the physical
               nature of man <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> produced by changes of habit, &amp; by other causes, as yet unascertained, but some of
               which you would probably be enabled to discover in the course of your enquiries. Two,
               three, or four octavo volumes upon such a plan would be sure of sale, &amp; any bookseller,
               I believe, would gladly contract for them.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will at once perceive the bearings of a subject like this, &amp; the rank which &lt;such&gt;
               a philosophic<span class="strikethrough">al</span> history would hold in general literature.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I shall be in your neighbourhood soon after this reaches you. We set out from home
               on Tuesday next, &amp; on the Monday following shall probably reach <span class="strikethrough">your</span> our journey’s end. After that day you will find me, just in your way to London, at
               <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a> – at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle’s</a> Parsonage. It will give me great pleasure to see you there, &amp; to introduce you to
               him. It would give me still more if you could be prevailed upon to make a visit to
               the North, before you leave Croydon &amp; settle in town. I should be very glad to have
               you for my guest, – here is a lovely country, – amusement enough both for the botanist
               &amp; mineralogist out of doors, – &amp; plenty of books for wet weather. And you could take
               your friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Henry</a> on the way either going or returning. Bear this in mind &amp; believe me</p>
