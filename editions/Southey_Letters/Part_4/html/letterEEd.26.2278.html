                  </div> I am much inclined to think that this is one of those works which might appear at
                  first with advantage in a splendid form, – with portraits &amp; views as well as plans.
                  In that case the plea of large paper copies &amp; first impressions would remove any objections
                  I <span class="strikethrough">might</span> should otherwise feel to a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> list of subscribers, – &amp; the names with which you could begin the list would draw
                  others after them, &amp; probably secure a greater first crop than could else be calculated
                  upon. This is a matter which you must understand far better than I possibly can do.
                  But I am the more induced to mention it as worthy of consideration, because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</a> to whom I was <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> speaking of my undertaking yesterday, suggested the same thing.</p>

                  talent for any thing else; – &amp; that his name has become conspicuous in history, almost
                  by mere accident, – certainly not by any greatness or merit of his own. He was a Quaker
                  who being rich by inheritance, vested his property in colonial speculations – those
                  speculations happened to succeed, – &amp; he <span class="strikethrough">being xx Quaker</span> necessarily framed his settlement upon the principles of his sect. – I knew he was
                  a mere Quaker in literature, but like the multitude I had given him credit for being
                  a great man till <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</a> undeceived me. – Such is my feeling upon the subject. Nevertheless if it must be reviewed
                  I will do what I can, &amp; serve <span class="strikethrough">him</span> &lt;it&gt; as we do a calf’s or a cods head, – conceal its inspiditty by <span class="strikethrough">the xxx xxxx</span> &lt;aid&gt; of the sauce.</p>
