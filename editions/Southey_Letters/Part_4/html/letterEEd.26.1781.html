               <p>Thank you for your Argument – it is well drawn up, &amp; deserves the most attentive consideration.
                  – still my opinion remains unaltered, that, if the H of Commons possess such a power,
                  – it is time it were taken from them, – for while it exists all discussion upon political
                  affairs is matter of sufferance &amp; not of right. Once establish the case of Gale Jones
                  as a precedent &amp; we have no other security against an actual despotism than what &lt;may&gt;
                  be found in the fears of the Ruling Powers.
