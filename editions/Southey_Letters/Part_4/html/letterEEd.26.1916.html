                  late in the spring; otherwise it was my intention to have been at this time in the
                  south. It will grieve me, if this unavoidable delay should deprive me of the pleasure
                  of seeing you. If, however, that should unfortunately be the case, any communications
                  with which you may favour me by letter, shall be received with the attention which
                  every thing coming from Dr Bell must deserve. Few circumstances could be so gratifying
                  to me, as to be made in any way instrumental in furthering your most important plans
