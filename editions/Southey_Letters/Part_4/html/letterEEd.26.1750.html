               <p>Having replied, as above, to your interesting letters from Bristol &amp; from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#StauntonOnWye">Staunton</a>, I proceed to the more immediate object of this present writing. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> has applied to me to write a life of Nelson,

                  hands. – a five shilling volume – for which he offers me 100 Guineas. I delay my final
                  answer. &amp; keep the documents till I learn whether you are coming or not, – because
                  if you are disposed to lend a hand, there is great part of this which can as well
                  be done by you as by me, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> some part better, &amp; between us it would be rather a pleasure than a task. If you are
                  not coming I shall repack the books &amp; return them without delay. Not that I want inclination
                  to undertake it, being confident that I could make both a good book &amp; a useful one,
                  – but I do not like to meddle with sea terms unless you are at my elbow, &amp; moreover
                  to do the whole would occupy more time than I can allow for it.</p>
