               Britain should have ‘taken possession of Sicily for ourselves’, <em>Essay on the Military Policy and Institutions of the British Empire</em> (London, 1810), pp. 171, 163. Southey undoubtedly agreed with this, making the inventionist
               case in the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</em>, 2.1 (1811), 99. In contrast, the published version of Southey’s review of the <em>Essay</em>, which had been rewritten by Croker, in consultation with Gifford and Murray, dismissed
               Pasley’s ideas as ‘fraught with dangerous principles’ (<em>Quarterly Review</em>, 3 (May 1810) pp. 429–431).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
