                           The History of Dissenters, from the Revolution in 1688–to the Year 1808 (1812); Walter

                           Southey was particularly outraged by the changes at 132 (Paul and Timothy); 135 (Milton
                           and Defoe); and 139 (final paragraph).</span></div>
                  </div> – in which I suspect <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> has done more mischief than usual. Merely in cutting open the leaves I perceived some
                  omissions which one would think the very Demon of stupidity had prompted. You may
                  remember the manner in which I had illustrated Mess<sup>rs</sup> Bogue &amp; Bennets mention of Paul &amp; Timothy; – he has retained the quotation &amp; cut out
                  the comment upon it. I believe the article has lost about two pages in this way. –
                  The only other instance which caught my eye will show you the spirit in which he has
                  gone to work. B &amp; B claim Milton, Defoe &amp;c as Dissenters. I called them blockheads
                  for not perceiving that it was “to their <span class="ital">catholick</span> &amp; <span class="ital">cosmopolite</span> intellect” that these men owed their immortality, not to their <span class="ital">sectarian</span> opinions &amp; the exterminating pen has gone thro the words catholick &amp; cosmopolite.
                  There is also a foolish insertion stuck in to introduce the last paragraph, which
                  at once attenuates <span class="strikethrough">the</span> it, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> says ‘now I <span class="ital">am</span> going to say something fine’ – instead of letting the feeling rise at once from the
                  subject. It is well perhaps that the convenience of this quarterly incoming makes
                  me placable, – or I should some day tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> that tho I have nothing to say against any <span class="strikethrough">alteration</span> omission which may be made for political or prudential motives, – yet when the question
                  comes to a mere matter of opinion in regard to the wording of a sentence, my judgement
                  is quite as likely to be right as his. – You will really render me a great service
                  by preserving my manuscript reviewals. For some of these articles may most probably
                  be reprinted whenever my Operas come to be printed in a collected form after I am
                  gone; – &amp; these rejected passages will then be thought of most value.</p>

               In 1813 Duppa’s <em>Memoirs by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</em> had attempted to prove Richard Glover (1712–1785; <em>DNB</em>) was the author of Junius’s letters. (It was a contribution to an ongoing controversy.
               In the same year, John Taylor’s <em>A Discovery of the Author of the Letters of Junius</em> proposed another, more plausible, though equally controversial, candidate: the politician
               and writer Sir Philip Francis (1740–1818; <em>DNB</em>).) Duppa defended himself against his critics in an anonymous pamphlet, <em>An Inquiry Concerning the Author of the Letters of Junius, with Reference to the Memoirs
