            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker<br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, ‘The Letters of Robert
               Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 424-425<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: this letter was written after Southey had sent his letter to Croker on
               15 December 1813 (Letter 2349), but before he received proofs of his poem on Saturday,
               18 December 1813.</p>

               <p>I think there must be something omitted in one of your extracts. No. 27 P 262 “The
                  hatred of the name of a Frenchman in Spain has been such the <span class="ital">reality</span> will by no means justify.”

                           from the Edinburgh Review to provide Southey with material for his notes to Carmen
                           Triumphale (1814). The fourth note to the published poem quotes Edinburgh Review,
                           14 (April 1809), 262: ‘The hatred of the name of a Frenchman in Spain has been such
                           as the reality will by no means justify.’</span></div>
                  </div> Pray refer to the passage. I dispatched my notes yesterday, &amp; cannot have the proof
                  of them before Saturday, so there is time to verify the extract. Thank you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HutchinsonSara">Miss H.</a> for your trouble — they are choice specimens, &amp; plenty of them. The expression about
                  strutting &amp; fretting I remember to have seen, &amp; it must have been in an early number
                  for 1810. But it is of no consequence, for you have sent enough to put them to shame,
                  — &amp; they may remain for a battery in reserve, whenever I am disposed to open another.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It never occurred to me that any reserve could be required in this unhappy poem, —
                  &amp; this want of foresight proves that I thought of the poem &amp; of nothing else. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> feels respecting it as you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> have done. So I have sent it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> in order at once to ascertain the point, &amp; so fully do I expect your apprehensions
                  will prove just, that I have set about a different conclusion. So the best stanzas
                  will most likely be cut off, &amp; sent as a separate whole to the Courier.

                  </div> The whole has cost me ten times the time &amp; trouble that it is worth. I have given
