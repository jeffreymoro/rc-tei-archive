                           related to Peter Crosthwaite (1735–1808), a retired naval commander, publisher of
                           maps and inventor of the aeolian harp. In the 1780s he established the first museum
                           in Keswick. Its treasures included a set of musical stones, a stuffed albatross and
                           a pig with no legs. By 1811 the Museum was run by his son Daniel (c. 1776–1847), a

                  </div> In reply to my first inquiries concerning it he had said that it was not published,
                  – &amp; his second order to his London correspondent produces the intelligence that the
                  whole edition is sold. This blundering deprives me of the satisfaction of seeing my
                  own opinions upon an important subject confirmed by one whose abilities &amp; authority
                  are of great weight: but it is not a subject upon which I stand in need of farther
                  knowledge, as there are very few upon which I have formed so decided a judgement.
                  I should however have perused the Bishops work with great interest. Have you seen
                  Herbert Marsh’s Comparative View of the differences between the Churches of England
                  &amp; of Rome?

                  </div> It is becoming yearly of more importance that these differences should be generally
                  understood. The Jesuits have established themselves within fifteen miles of Dublin
                  in the County of Kildare, where they have given £18,000 for a house &amp; about 140 acres
                  of land – They have opened a College there, where they have about 40 pupils, children
                  of farmers ‘who keep their gigs.” The age of admission is from 7 to 14, &amp; no vacations
                  are allowed, that nothing may disturb the operation of their system upon the growing
                  mind. Their friends boast that M<sup>r</sup> Kenney the President of this College has more money at command than any Bishop in
                  the Kingdom.
