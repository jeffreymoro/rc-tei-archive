The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a> observed that M<sup>r</sup> Southey had written some good things in defence of the Spanish cause, &amp; was a very
                  proper person to have it. <span class="strikethrough">before this</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> soon afterwards met <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord Liverpool</a> &amp; told him what had past, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord L.</a> expressed his sorrow that he had not known it a day sooner for he &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HertfordLord">Lord Hertford</a> having consulted together who was the best poet of the day, had in consequence offered

                  of; it was his pleasure that M<sup>r</sup> Southey should have it, &amp; therefore have it he should. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> then observed that <span class="ital">he</span> was <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</a> friend as well as mine, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> &amp; I were friends also, &amp; that for the sake of all <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span>, the matter must be allowed to rest where it was. – All this I learnt on my arrival

                           if you will like it, for the laurel has certainly been tarnished by some of its wearers,

                  not be expected to write verses like exercises at stated times &amp; on stated subjects,

                  hundred; – but to me <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> it will be of very material importance, for I shall appropriate the whole to a life
                  insurance, &amp; it will wholly, or nearly, cover a policy for 3000£. I have never felt
                  any fears about a provision for my family, but this goes so far towards securing one,
                  that it will give me <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> sincere pleasure to see the appointment confirmed, &amp; have the insurance effected.</p>

            <p class="indent1">The laurel however vain as an honour, thus becomes a serious benefit to my children.
               And if I do not find it an honour I shall make it so; – for such it will be to him
               who shall be thought worthy to wear it after me. If I write anything ex officio, as
               the great events which every hour is defining may possibly ere long require, you may
               trust me that it will be in <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> a strain which will be creditable to the office &amp; to myself.</p>
