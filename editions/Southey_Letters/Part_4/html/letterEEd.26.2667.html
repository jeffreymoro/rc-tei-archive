            <p class="indent1">I meant fully to have written when we were here on our way to Flanders but was literally
               unable from the incessant hurry &amp; bustle of business &amp; society in which I was involved.
               You know what this is, &amp; will therefore excuse an apparent but unavoidable neglect.
               We are once more in town &amp; now I trust we shall meet. Write to me &amp; speak to me at
               all times with entire confidence. my advice may be worth nothing, but upon my discretion
               &amp; the sincere good will with which I shall listen &amp; reply you may rely in full assurance.
               I hate &amp; distrust professions &amp; therefore never make them, but if you have not found
               out that I am glad to see you &amp; to hear from you &amp; that I take a proper interest in
               what concerns you, you must then know less of me &amp; of human character than I give
               you credit for having.</p>
