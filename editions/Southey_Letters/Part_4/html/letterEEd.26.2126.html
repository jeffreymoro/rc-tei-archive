            <p class="indent1">We have made enquiry concerning your trunk, – about which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridge</a> desires me to say she punctually did all that you desired. It was seen into the cart
               from this place, so that the delay must be at Kendal, – the book-keeper will instantly
               write there in quest of it, &amp; I hope you will receive it soon after this letter, or
               before it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You judged rightly of our movements. We found room in the mail at eleven. – took chaise
               from Kendal to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a>, &amp; walked the remaining stage, thro weather which just sufficed to wet us by the
               time we reached home at half past nine. It rained heavily the whole way from Lancaster
               to Ambleside. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> left me this morning.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I found a letter from Lord Radstock

                  </div> on my return, inclosing two others from different persons whom <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">D<sup>r</sup> Bell</a> had applied to to enquire concerning the children.

                  </div> cannot admit them, – &amp; both promise to make other enquiries. One says “there is a <span class="ital">compassionate List</span> from whence children &amp; widows of officers deceased receive some small annuity. the
                  mode of application is by Petition to the Secretary at War, but I am not certain how
                  far the children of assistant surgeons can be put upon that List.” – This is the import
                  of these letters – but if I could see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</a>, who is in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, I would frank them to you.</p>

               <p>I found also a letter upon my own concerns, with the pleasant intelligence that it
