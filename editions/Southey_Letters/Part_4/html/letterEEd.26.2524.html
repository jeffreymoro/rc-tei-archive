                           not happen. Bedford’s review was in Quarterly Review, 13 (April 1815), 83–113; Jeffrey’s
                           in Edinburgh Review, 25 (June 1815), [1]-86. The latter described Roderick as: ‘The

                  can resist. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoggEdward">Hogg</a> notwithstanding this has fallen in liking with me &amp; is a great admirer of Roderick.

                  as conceited as his neighbour <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>”. – B[MS torn] shall be happy to talk to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoggEdward">Hogg</a> upon this &amp; other <span class="ital">kindred</span> subjects &amp; he should be very glad to give me a <span class="ital">lavish allowance</span> of praise if I would afford him occasion, &amp;c – but he must do what he thinks his duty,

                  The sum of it is that I despise <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrays</a> commendation, &amp; defy his enmity; that <span class="ital">nettling</span> is too weak a word for what I have in store for him, – <span class="strikethrough">that</span> for in due time he shall be scorpioned &amp; rattlesnaked, – yea served up to the public
