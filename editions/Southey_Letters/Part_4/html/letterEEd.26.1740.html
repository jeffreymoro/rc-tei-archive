               <p>I am very far from thinking that a set of Politicians when they get into place are
                  bound to repeal all the measures which they have opposed when out of place; – even
                  supposing their opposition to have been upon pure principle &amp; not upon pure party,
                  as it usually is. Thus I hold Fox

                           in the ‘Ministry of all the Talents’ of 1806–1807. He had opposed the Union of Great
                           Britain and Ireland in 1800, but on 17 February 1806 declared ‘it was not now to be
                           lightly rescinded’.</span></div>
                  </div> to have been perfectly right in what he said about the Union. – You will see some
                  part of my objection to the Foxites in the Register.

                           for incomes of £50 to £150 p.a. In Edinburgh Annual Register for 1808, 1.1 (1810),
                           4, Southey vented his anger against this ‘Cruel and iniquitous’ tax.</span></div>
                  </div> what I abominate is the extent to which they carried it, &amp; the detestable manner in
                  which it is taken from every body. – leaving those who are <span class="strikethrough">not</span> below the line a right of getting it back again, – which it is so difficult for them
                  to do. But I hate them worst because they are already subdued in heart by Buonaparte,
                  &amp; ready to sacrifice the honour of the country, – without which there is no salvation
                  for us. – As for unrejectable terms of peace I do not agree with you. The independence
                  of S America is not his to offer, for our fleets prevent them from ever being his.
                  – You will see what I have said about making the war professedly personal against
                  Buonaparte &amp; distinguishing between him &amp; the French nation.
