                  </div> It is a building from which I have derived, from my earliest childhood, as many feelings
                  probably as Chatterton himself, with the addition of such as his memory has associated

            <p class="indent1">I wish it were in my power to furnish you with any information to your purpose. But
               with regard to the church itself I have only looked at it to admire it, – never as
               an antiquarian. You &lt;know&gt; probably that the old ceremony of strewing the church on
               Palm Sunday is still observed there, – I know not whether it be retained any where
               else in England, – but I have seen it there some five or six &amp; twenty years ago, when
               it never failed to draw together a great crowd.</p>

               <p>The Rowley question has long been dismissed from my thoughts. In fact since I had
                  the slightest acquaintance with old English literature I was perfectly convinced that
                  it was utterly improbable the poems could be genuine. I will however mention one decisive
                  argument, which I owe to a friend. The little facsimile of Cannynges feast contains
                  manifest proofs that the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> hand-writing is feigned.
