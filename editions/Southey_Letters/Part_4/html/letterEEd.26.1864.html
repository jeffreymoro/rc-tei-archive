                  the influence of Government cannot be diminished without the virtual destruction of
                  Government: that the real evil in our representation is the influence of the great
                  Land Leviathans, who can go to a minister &amp; demand a seat in the Cabinet for themselves
                  &amp; in reply to all his remonstrances upon the unfitness of the thing, make no other

                  </div> that this influence dies a natural death in the thriving counties, when the increase
                  of wealth splits property into small freeholds, – &amp; that it might be destroyed by
                  farther limitations of entails, or an income tax justly graduated. But that the two
                  main evils of our system of Government consist in governing by a Cabinet, instead
                  of a Prime Minister, – &amp; in the existence of a regular party in the legislature whose
                  business is to impede as far they can all measures of the Government &amp; to villify
                  the Administration (be it what it may) so as to bring it into contempt &amp; hatred with
                  the people: to argue always against their own country, &amp; against <span class="strikethrough">their</span> &lt;its&gt; allies, &amp; to act in <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;plain English&gt; as allies of the enemy. For this evil I see no remedy unless it is
                  possible to expose the scandal &amp; the absurdity &amp; the mischief so strongly as to excite
                  a sense of shame in party men themselves. There is no reason why we should not have
                  a responsible Premier instead of a Cabinet, – both being equally unknown to the Constitution,
                  which requires only that the Kings advisors be responsible. The vice &amp; original sin
                  of a Cabinet is that all measures are garbled there &amp; every thing carried on by concessions
                  &amp; compromises. Canning for instance would send <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> 50,000 men to Spain, – no says somebody else – I would not send any men at all there.
                  – so they agree to send 25,000 – &amp; in this way every thing is ruined. – The burthen
                  of my song is this, that – ‘in these times the paramount duty of a true patriot is
                  to exert himself in raising the spirit of his countrymen to the pitch of those days
                  when they won crowns, &amp; brought home captive Kings. The one business of England is
                  to abate the power of France; that power she must beat down, or fall herself; that
                  power she will beat down, if she do but wisely &amp; strenuously put forth her own mighty
                  means.’
