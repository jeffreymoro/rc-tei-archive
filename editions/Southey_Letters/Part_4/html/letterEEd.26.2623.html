               <p>I have received your draft, &amp; thank you for it. I am glad that the article upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellington</a> has not disappointed you, – but I perceive strong objections to putting it forward

                  up the subject at length; &amp; there was a <span class="ital">cause</span> for doing it, because it was right to show the country what grounds we had for engaging
                  in the present contest with hope &amp; confidence. But I should be very unwilling to put
                  it forth as a life of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellington</a> which might be supposed to be intended as a companion for the life of Nelson.

                  printed there would probably be another postscript required, &amp; still the story would
                  be left incompleat. To me it might be injurious, &amp; I should certainly feel it discreditable,
                  to be accused of catching at temporary subjects, &amp; writing for the demand of the day.
                  And ultimately it might be disadvantageous to us both, – for this campaign may well
                  be expected to furnish matter for a paper in your review, – &amp; to the enlargement of
                  that paper there may possibly be none of these objections, as it might form the groundwork
