               <p>Your letter I hope &amp; trust was written in a different tone of mind from what it would
                  have indicated if you had been writing at mid-day instead of day-break. Surely if
                  you are strong enough to travel &lt;to&gt; <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, the best pleasure which it affords you will be able in some degree to enjoy, – &amp;
                  lie at your ease in the boat, while <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &amp; I alternately amuse ourselves at the oars. Your disease is certainly not the ordinary
                  liver complaint in which abscess after abscess forms &amp; breaks <span class="strikethrough">till</span> till the system can no longer support the discharge. God knows what it is, – not improbably
                  the effect of that dreadful fall, – the liver being of all the viscera that which
                  is most likely to be injured by a general concussion of the whole frame. I wish <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> stood higher for you, – but in this country all towns &amp; villages are built in the
                  vallies, – with the exception of one little <span class="strikethrough">villa</span> hamlet &lt;(Watendlath)&gt; as lonely as it is lovely, about five miles from hence, which
                  is in a valley high among the mountains. To lodge you there however would be almost
                  as impossible as it would be in <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> one of the mountains of the Moon, &amp; I think here in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> you will taste the air of all the surrounding heights in sufficient purity whenever
                  the wind blows – which it does often enough most vociferously. – Lodgings here are
                  bad – in size something about your old apartments at M<sup>r</sup> Toon’s.

                  </div> – nor are they any of them well-situated – I shall get the most chearful &amp; airy which
                  are to be had, – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">in whatever</span> whichever that may be it cannot be more than a quarter of a mile from this room of
                  mine, – provided you make as much use of that as I expect &amp; require, I will answer
                  for my patience in any other trial to which you may think proper to put it. Here are
                  books in super-abundance for every studious mood, – when you are for conversation
                  you may have as much or as little as you like, – if you like chess <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> is fond of it, – &amp; when you are tired of all there is a sort of sofa-bed in the room. <span class="strikethrough">on which</span></p>

            <p class="indent1">If there be any thing in the way of diet beyond the most ordinary articles of consumption
               which you require it must be brought with you, – for <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> is a wretched town, &amp; very ill supplied with every thing. The best thing we have
               is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">an Apothecary</a>, for whom I hope in God <span class="strikethrough">I</span> you <span class="strikethrough">x</span> may feel no occasion, – but it is a satisfaction to know that <span class="strikethrough">he is</span> we have a much more skilful &amp; <span class="strikethrough">better infor</span> a better informed practitioner than is usually to be found, or indeed expected, in
               such a place. – Bring with you as much hope as you can, &amp; freedom from all business
               &amp; this pure air may work wonders.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Your route will be pleasanter if you make for Leeds instead of Manchester &amp; so to
               Skipton &amp; Settle, – by this means you will not &lt;only&gt; avoid much uninteresting country,
               but also I believe <span class="strikethrough">some</span> the detestable paved roads of the south of Lancashire, which are enough to shake
               a sound man into a liver complaint. If you cannot get from Settle to Lancaster, go
               on to <span class="strikethrough">Kendal &amp; from thence to Ambleside</span> Kirkby Lonsdale, &amp; it will be worth while turning back to Lancaster, for the sake
               of crossing the sands &amp; entering the Lake country by the best route. If you feel desirous
               to be at the end of your journey, your spirits flag, or you are fatigued, come on
               from Kirkby Lonsdale to Kendal, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Pray remember me to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Bedfordfamily">your father &amp; mother</a>. I hope I shall send <span class="strikethrough">you</span> or bring you back with a new stock of health.</p>
