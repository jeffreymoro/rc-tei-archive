            <p class="indent1">I write a few lines to request that you will halt a few days with us, on your way
               to the South. We hoped to have seen you during the winter, &amp; trust that you will not
               disappoint us now.</p>

                  </div> Hereafter I hope we shall hear more of justice &amp; less of magnanimity. If the evil
                  could be confined to France alone, we might contemplate it with complacency. What
                  a blessed consummation it would be to see Marshals fighting against Marshals, Frenchmen
                  against Frenchmen, <span class="strikethrough">Xx</span> Satan against Beelzebub, till the whole of that army which has been bred up under
                  this Monster should be exterminated! I feel so strongly that Paris ought to be burnt
                  as a mark of divine vengeance against the crimes which have been committed there,
                  &amp; proceeded from thence, that I could half persuade myself it will not escape a second
                  time. As for the issue of the contest I should have no fear concerning it, provided
                  all were sound at home. But the fabric of social order in this country is undermined,
                  &amp; we are treading upon gunpowder. Of all acts of insanity ever committed by a legislature,
                  that of quarrelling with the populace concerning <span class="ital">Bread</span>, is surely the most insane.
