               <p>The Vienna MSS has been here eight &amp; forty hours, &amp; in that time I have read two thirds
                  of one volume, which tho not enough to satisfy my curiosity is, I think sufficient,
                  for forming an opinion of the work. Certainly it is a highly curious work, but I very
                  much doubt whether it would find purchasers enough to indemnify the publication.

                           (1774–1856) of Evliya Çelebi (1611–1682), Seyahatname, which described the latter’s
                           travels through the Ottoman empire. Von Hammer-Purgstall had published a German translation
                           of Çelebi in 1814 and his English version, Narrative of Travels in Europe, Asia and
                           Africa, appeared in 1834. See also Southey to John Rickman, 4 December 1814, Letter

                  </div> For tho there is something for the historian, something for the geographer, something
                  for the statesman &amp; something for the poet, there is very little for the general reader.
                  It is one of those works which a public body should take the expence &amp; the credit
                  of publishing, but alas we have no Academy in England. – Buchanans Travels

                  in Germany, or the translation would not have been made in English. It would be a
                  fit book to publish by subscription, – if that mode should be adopted. I should willingly
                  be a subscriber: – but for fear it should not find a publisher, you will allow me
