                  personally disagreable to him. These expressions were repeated to Sir S. by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</a> at the time he was recalled, – he took the letter to the Prince, who burst into tears,

                  so false an assertion to the English court, &amp; bitterly repented of his signature.

                  was in a situation where he might have been essentially useful, &amp; which was just suited
                  for him. He had a great ascendancy over the Prince, – opened a correspondence with
                  the neighbouring Spanish Cabildos, &amp; would have rendered great services both to England

               in the story, or he has mistaken an ape for a savage, – for if the Portugueze had
