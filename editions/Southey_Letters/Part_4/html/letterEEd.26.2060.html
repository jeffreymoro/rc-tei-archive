                           intimately connected’ (p. 197). He also argued that the pupils at these new national
                           schools ‘should be allowed to accompany the master to church’ (p. 118). Bell’s letter
                           cautioned against compulsion in this matter (‘we should draw the children to church

                  such a test was to be insisted on, except at schools where the children are lodged,
                  and where, of course, as they cannot attend worship with their parents, they must
                  go with their schoolmaster. And I was anxious not to be misunderstood, and to show
                  that while I stood up as resolutely as Herbert Marsh

                           the Church of England included a sermon preached at St Paul’s on 13 June 1811 that
                           was critical of the interdenominational British and Foreign Bible Society (founded
                           1804) and urged that Anglicans should found their own Bible society. The sermon was
                           published as The National Religion the Foundation of National Education: A Sermon
                           Preached in the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, London (1811). Southey read it in early

                  than it was her indispensable duty to exact, and her undoubted right to require. I
                  have carefully (as I thought) guarded against giving offence, by making the distinction
                  between day-schools and boarding-schools. High or low Church are no more to me than
                  Whig or Tory, or the Shanavists and Caravats of the wild Irish;

                  </div> and if there be any persons who can be offended at such an opinion so expressed, and
                  in such a place, why I am sorry for them. The passage occurs just where I have been
                  repeating the arguments of others to show that the parents <span class="ital">cannot</span> give religious instruction, and adding others of my own to show that it is not the
                  business of the clergyman; but (for the children of the lower classes) that it must
                  be the business of the schoolmaster.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The cry which will be raised against the book is that of intolerance and illiberality,
               and this you will see. But I have, all my life long, been careless what accusations
               might be brought against me for speaking as I thought right. It will be too late to
               remedy the error, if error it be, which I trust it is not. The subsequent sheets will
               have been struck off; and if the leaf were to be cancelled, it would be necessary
               to supply precisely the same quantity of matter as that which should be expunged.
               How difficult this is, it must be needless to remark. Besides, I should rather incur
               the disapprobation of such persons as are capable of disapproving the expression of
               such an opinion, than be suspected of agreeing with them. My own opinions lean so
               strongly towards what it is the fashion to call intolerance, that it especially behoves
               me to take care, that there be no shadow of a reasonable charge on that head.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I congratulate you most truly upon the opening of the Preparatory School.

                  </div> You have now the reward of your long labours in sight. God grant that the government
                  may do their duty, and establish the system upon a secure and permanent foundation!
                  for I cannot conceal from myself, that what we see doing on the part of the heads
                  of the Church, has been forced upon them, and that they are doing that from fear of
                  the enemy, which they would never have done for love of the system. An establishment
                  of parochial schools would be the best outwork of the Church; and, God knows, it needs
                  all the defence that can be given it! Never was there such a monstrous coalition as
                  is now formed against it. Calvinists and Arminians, Socinians, Quakers, Papists, and
                  Unbelievers, all acting in concert for her overthrow. I can do her good service against
                  all her enemies, except the most dangerous of all—her intemperate friends.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Young and old join in the kindest remembrance. God bless you, my dear sir! Yours very
