                  </div> in a Portuguese translation, and much more so by its being your work than if it were
                  that of a stranger: – but I am altogether incompetent to judge of what you have done,
                  never having written in Portuguese. You are of course aware that it would require
                  something more than verbal correction from a native; a great deal would be to be expunged
                  as heretical, and not a little on the score of its political freedom. Still the general
                  tone of the work is much in favour of the Portuguese, for the long attention which
                  I have given to their history and the whole of their literature has given me a sort
                  of intellectual naturalization among them; – and when the needful castrations were
                  made, neither the Government nor the people would have cause to be offended with the
                  disposition of the writer.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Should you persevere in this undertaking the only advice I can give you is to refer
                  to the cited authorities wherever any speech or letter or saying is introduced in
                  the text, as you will then find the original expression, and the translation will
                  thus have that native raciness which the English wants. The readiest way of doing
                  this would be to make me a visit when the work was in forwardness, for here the books
                  are, and I could probably turn to any passage in a few minutes. Should you go on with
                  it, the sheets of the second volume shall be sent you as far as they are printed,
                  which in the course of a week or two will be to the end of the Pernambucan War.
