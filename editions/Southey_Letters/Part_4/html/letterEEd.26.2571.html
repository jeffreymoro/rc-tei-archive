            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I received your letter yesterday, &amp; allowed myself four &amp; twenty hours to chew the
                  cud upon it. This evening a letter has arrived from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeWilliamHart">M<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Coleridge</a>,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>William Hart Coleridge was well-suited to give advice about the University of Oxford
                           as he had graduated from Christ Church in 1811.</span></div>
                  </div> in answer to one which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> S. Coleridge</a> had written inquiring when it would be necessary for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> to be at Oxford. In this letter an opinion is expressed of the value of <span class="ital">time</span> at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley’s</a> age which comes in aid of my own judgement. – He is now in his nineteenth year.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I feel all the objections which you have stated to Merton,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Hartley Coleridge enrolled at Merton College, Oxford in 1815, largely because he was
                           awarded a scholarship or ‘Postmastership’.</span></div>
                  </div> – perhaps even more forcibly than you do, because I am thoroughly acquainted with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a>. There is no young man to whom it could be of so much importance to be under a tutor
                  whom he <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> &lt;might&gt; respect. Such a tutor <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> would find in &lt;him&gt; all the docility he could desire, &amp; would soon become attached
                  to him. But a man who should be incapable of seeing farther than the outside might
                  excite in him a contempt for the course of University Studies, which <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> of all things is most to be deprecated in his case.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Let me tell you as well as I can, what kind of youth this cousin of yours, &amp; nephew
                  of mine, is. Without being an ugly fellow, he is a marvellously odd one; – he is very
                  short, with remarkably strong features, some of the thickest &amp; blackest eyebrows you
                  ever saw, &amp; a beard which a Turk might envy. His manners are almost as peculiar as
                  his appearance, &amp; having discovered that he is awkward by nature, he has formed an
                  unhappy conclusion that art will never make him otherwise, &amp; so resigns himself to
                  his fate. My endeavours have not been wanting to remedy or rather palliate this, –
                  but it is bred in the bone, – &amp; you know the remainder of the proverb.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>i.e. ‘What’s bred in the bone will come out in the flesh.’</span></div>
                  </div> I have <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> even habitually quizzed him for the purpose of teaching him to bear such things with
                  good humour, – knowing how much he <span class="strikethrough">will</span> must be exposed to it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thus much for the outward man. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley’s</a> intellect will soon overcome all disadvantages that his exterior may incur, if it
                  do but <span class="ital">keep the course</span>. And here indeed I feel how fortunate it is that he has a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeWilliamHart">kinsman</a> upon the spot so willing &amp; able to direct him, &amp; whom he is so well prepared to respect.
                  The great lesson which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> &amp; myself have endeavoured to impress upon him is that he goes to Oxford to devote
                  himself to the studies of the place; &amp; that no degree of general ability, or general
                  knowledge, can, or ought to, atone for any deficiency in the attainments which the
                  University requires; that to these he must apply himself <span class="ital">totis viribus</span> 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>‘With all his might’.</span></div>
                  </div> while he is there; &amp; when he has attained by these that establishment for which we
                  look, life will be before him to cultivate his intellect in whatever manner he may
                  then please. His disposition is excellent: his principles thoroughly good; &amp; he has
                  instinctively a devotional feeling which I hope will keep them so. An overweening
                  confidence in his own <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> talents, &amp; a perilous habit of finding out reasons for whatever he likes to do, are
                  the dangerous parts of his character. – To extravagance he has not the slightest propensity,
                  – but he knows as little of frugality; &amp; it is well that he has a friend at hand who
                  may question him concerning his ways &amp; means, – for in these things he is, &amp; I believe
                  always will be a mere child.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will see from this faithful statement how especially desirable it is that he should
               be under good discipline. I should not therefore for a moment hesitate in preferring
               Corpus, were it not on the score of his age. [MS torn]ting till after Xmas, <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> three terms would be lost – &amp; I could not say that the time would certainly be as
               well employed as it might be. Emulation is wanting here, &amp; mathematics are evidently
               against the grain. <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxx xxxx xxxx xxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxxx</span> All things considered I incline to think that he had better taken the Merton situation,
               &amp; be removed from thence whenever it is practicable to Corpus. But I would better
               refer this to your judgement &amp; your cousin’s, than my own, for you need not be told
               that Oxford in my days was not what it is now. Do you therefore decide, – &amp; let us
               know your determination.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I must not forget to say that when he shall be fairly at college, there is a prospect
                  of getting some <span class="ital">city exhibitions</span> for him, – things perhaps of which you never heard. They come from the different companies,

                  </div> &amp; are of 8 to 10£ each, – but a man may hold as many of them as he can get: they are
                  obtained by interest, &amp; I have a friend
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> upon the watch in his behalf, with good hope of success. But the recipient must actually
                  be keeping terms, before he can be named to them.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">And now my dear Sir farewell. I hope it is needless to add how glad we should be if
               in one of your summer holydays, you would direct your course toward the Lakes; – <span class="strikethrough">x xxxxxxxx</span> you will find a bed, a sincere welcome, – &amp; an experienced guide.</p>
