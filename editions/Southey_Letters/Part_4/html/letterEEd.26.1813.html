                  the construction of the story, &amp; in a certain moral character which I think is peculiar
                  to it. A human being is represented suffering to the very height of human endurance,
                  &amp; even cut off from that hope of reward which makes the Martyr exalt at the stake.
                  Yet in the progress of the work you cease to regard him as an object of compassion,
                  &amp; every other feeling is lost in admiration for the strength of virtuous principle.
                  – This I believe will be felt by those who are capable of relishing in any degree
