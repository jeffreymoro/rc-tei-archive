                  It has however so happened that both in Thalaba &amp; Kehama, the nature of the story
                  led me to represent examples of faith.

               <p>At a very early age, indeed while I was a school-boy, my imagination was strongly
                  impressed by the mythological fables of different nations. I can trace this to the
                  effect produced upon me when quite a child by some prints in the Christians Magazine,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)

                           du Monde (1723–1743).</span></div>
                  </div> I got at Picart when I was about fifteen, &amp; soon became as well acquainted with the
                  Gods of Asia &amp; America as &lt;with those&gt; of Greece &amp; Rome. This led me to conceive a
                  design of rendering every mythology which had ever extended itself widely &amp; powerfully
                  influenced the human mind, the basis of a narrative poem. I began with the religion
                  of the Koran, &amp; consequently founded the interest of the story upon that resignation
                  which is the only virtue it has produced. Had Thalaba been more succesful, my whole
                  design would <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> by this time have been effected, for prepared as I was with the whole materials for
                  each, &amp; with a general idea of the story, I should assuredly have produced such a
                  poem every year. – For popular praise, quoad praise I cared nothing, – but it was
                  of consequence to me inasmuch as it affected those emoluments with which my worldly
                  circumstances did not permit me to dispense. The sacrifice therefore was made to prudence,
                  &amp; it was not made without reluctance. Kehama lay by me in an unfinished state for
                  many years, &amp; but for a mere accident might perhaps for ever [MS torn]ve remained
                  incompleat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Whether the design may ever be accomplished is now very doubtful. The inclination
                  &amp; the power remain, but time has past away. My literary engagements are numerous &amp;
                  weighty, beyond those of any other individual, &amp; tho by Gods blessing I enjoy good
                  health, never-failing chearfulness, &amp; unweariable perseverance, there seems to be
                  more before me than I shall ever live to get thro, – <span class="strikethrough">for the</span> being of a short-lived race. I have published no poem since Kehama, but have one in
                  considerable forwardness upon the Restoration of Spain by Pelayo,
