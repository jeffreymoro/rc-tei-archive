               by something under it. There is no pulsation, &amp; no pain or inconvenience of any kind.
               I am using a lotion in the hope of discussing it, &amp; if this fails a plaister for the
               same purpose will be applied. Meantime I do not button the collar &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> desires that I will use no muscular exertion which may be avoided, rowing for instance
               being forbidden. As the discovery is some days old, I have almost ceased to think
               of it except at rubbing times: but of course I can not go from home till he has seen
               the effect of his applications. There is no artery in that direction, – nor is any
               thing of the goitre or wen kind. If it be some hydattids, they will make way to the
               surface &amp; suppurate; – or as it may perhaps have existed a long while, it may remain
               in the same state, &amp; be remedied by a new set of shirt-collars.</p>
