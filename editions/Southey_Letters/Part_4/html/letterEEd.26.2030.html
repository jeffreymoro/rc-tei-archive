                  </div> can be deemd an exception to the rule. All I can say is, that if the Spanish war had

                  of Troy, I should have written with just the same feeling. But the fact is, that in
                  speaking of things which are long gone by, this liberty is allowd to the historian,
                  – whereas if the contemporary annalist arrogates it, it is at his peril. – To the
                  charge of want of compression I can better reply, – the volume is upon the same scale
                  as its predecessor, &amp; its bulk is <span class="strikethrough">only</span> &lt;owing&gt; to the greater quantity of the matter which the year afforded. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</a> has <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> censured it upon this score in a manner worthy of himself,

                  expressly to state his approbation of the manner in which the work was written, tho
                  he said, he differed in many &amp; indeed in most points from the writer.

                  </div> I believe the censure is one which implies a compliment to the work, – for it means
                  that people wish to read the book, &amp; yet do not wish to give so much time to it as
                  its length requires. Now Annual Registers have hitherto not been read, – they are
                  professedly works rather for reference than for reading, – &amp; therefore the more minute
                  they are <span class="strikethrough">the more</span> &lt;the better&gt; they answer the purpose for which they are designed. If therefore he
                  who reads the book now thinks it too long, – he who consults it ten year hence will
                  not be disposed to censure it upon that score. – I am close at work upon 1810, &amp; have
