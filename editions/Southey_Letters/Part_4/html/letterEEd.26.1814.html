            <p class="indent1">I have written to you less frequently than I should have done had not <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> been upon the spot, who, being an idle man, has time enough for correspondence, &amp;
               would tell you from time to time enough of my goings on to prevent you from either
               feeling anxiety, or suspecting neglect. This evening he has received your letter,
               the prospect of seeing you gives me very great pleasure; – the end of October may
               not be too late for autumnal fine weather, &amp; yet may be early enough for some or our
               winter magnificences. You will find the room ready from which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BethamMatilda">Miss Betham</a> so foolishly dispossessed you last year.</p>
