                           of 42 State Papers; there was no ‘Appendix’ to Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808,
                           1.2 (1810). In Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809, 2.1 (1811), the ‘Appendix’ contained
                           only 7 State Papers, pp. i–xxix. The ‘Chronicle’ remained in Edinburgh Annual Register,
                           for 1809, 2.2 (1811), still without an ‘Appendix’.</span></div>
                  </div> There appears to me however a convenience in placing it between them as it at present
                  stands, because <span class="strikethrough">the</span> of the division of the work into two parts or volumes. The History &amp; the State papers
                  filled one for the last year in as just a proportion as if they had been calculated
                  with that view. I apprehend that this year the history will occupy more room – the
                  state papers less; – the excess of one being balanced by the deficit in the other <span class="strikethrough">departmen</span> portion. But were the Chronicle transferred to the first part, it would, I apprehend
                  swell the bulk <span class="strikethrough">of the xxxxx xxxxxx</span> disproportionately &amp; there is no unfitness in referring <span class="ital">back</span> from it to the Appendix.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The Appendix I would confine exclusively to State-papers, – that is to say, Treaties
               Proclamations Manifestoes &amp; things of this kind. – Gazettes &amp; Bulletins belong to
               the Chronicle, – but whether to insert them as they occur, or place them altogether
               in chronological order, is certainly a point of some difficulty. I incline to the
               latter plan, &amp; to the opinion that the Chronicle should be considered chiefly as a
               register of domestic events, preserving every thing from our newspapers which marks
               the state of society, <span class="strikethrough">x</span> the virtues &amp; vices of the time, – in short whatever would assist our contemporaries
               abroad, or our posterity at home in obtaining as compleat a knowledge as possible
               of Great Britain in our times. Of the main events of the year I think it would be
               superfluous to give any account in this department, the substance being contained
               in the History, &amp; the official statement in the Gazettes. But those naval transactions
               <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> which have neither cause nor consequence beyond what their own story explains, may
               all be referred to the Chronicle, in preference to the Gazette. Gazette account being
               always the dullest, &amp; not always the clearest.</p>

               <p>The Duke of York’s business forms so material a part of the parliamentary proceedings
