               saluations with him once or twice when we met upon the road. Perhaps however I might

                  of the present generation, farther than as it may affect my <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> means of subsistence, which thank God it can no longer effectually do. There was a
                  time when I was materially injured by unjust criticism; but even then I despised it,
