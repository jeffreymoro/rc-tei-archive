                           Consequently, on 14 January 1814, the Danes signed the Treaty of Kiel with Britain
                           and Sweden. Most importantly, it ceded Norway, which had been under Danish rule, to
                           Sweden. The Norwegians responded with a declaration of independence in May 1814, but
                           Swedish troops were poised to invade the country, crossing the Norwegian border on
                           29 July 1814. Eventually, the Norwegians agreed to union with Sweden.</span></div>
                  </div> I look upon the interest which has been excited in this country concerning it as originating
                  in mere faction. The case is exactly as if when Scotland &amp; England were seperate <span class="strikethrough">king</span> monarchies, the one had ceded to another a portion of its border territory as the
                  price of peace at the end of an unsuccesful war. In the state of our relations with
                  Denmark, &amp; of Denmarks obstinate adherence to Buonaparte, England &amp; her allies would
                  have been clearly justified, if they had deprived Denmark of its existence as a Kingdom.
                  A cession like that of Norway is unjust if, as in the memorable instance of the Seven
                  Reductions in Paraguay,

                           in South America. Seven Reductions, or settlements, founded by Spanish Jesuits, east
                           of the Rio Uruguay were transferred to Portuguese territory and the population was
                           forced to relocate west of the river. Their resistance to this plan was crushed in
                           a short campaign by Spanish and Portuguese troops in 1756, called the Guarani War,
                           or War of the Seven Reductions.</span></div>
                  </div> the inhabitants are to be turned out of their own country; – if they are ceded to

                  is made by it &lt;in any way&gt; manifestly worse. In the present instance Denmark has a
                  clear right to make the cession, &amp; the Norwegians are not injured by it. I look upon
                  the resistance as a manœuvre of the Danish court.

                           presumptive to the Danish throne, to which he later succeeded as Christian VIII (1839–1848).
                           This led to accusations that the whole movement was merely an attempt to maintain

               Colburn had asked to borrow a portrait of Southey, in order to produce an engraving
               for the <em>New Monthly Magazine</em>. Not entirely satisfied with Southey’s response, he borrowed the bust and ‘got someone
               to attempt the impossible task of making a portrait from it, which he engraved as
               an original picture: - a miserable looking wretch it is – something in physiognomy
               between assassin &amp; hangman’. The offending engraving, accompanied by a ‘long Memoir’,
               appeared in the <em>New Monthly Magazine</em>, 1 (January-July 1814), Frontispiece; 566–571. See also Southey to Henry Colburn,

               Consequently, on 14 January 1814, the Danes signed the Treaty of Kiel with Britain
               and Sweden. Most importantly, it ceded Norway, which had been under Danish rule, to
               Sweden. The Norwegians responded with a declaration of independence in May 1814, but
               Swedish troops were poised to invade the country, crossing the Norwegian border on
               29 July 1814. Eventually, the Norwegians agreed to union with Sweden.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of the Rio Uruguay were transferred to Portuguese territory and the population was
               forced to relocate west of the river. Their resistance to this plan was crushed in
               a short campaign by Spanish and Portuguese troops in 1756, called the Guarani War,
               or War of the Seven Reductions.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               This led to accusations that the whole movement was merely an attempt to maintain

               invaded Spain in 1808. A majority of the troops managed to escape to Spain on British
               ships, but the rest were interned in Denmark. The Danes continued to co-operate closely
               with French troops in north Germany until 1813, including taking part in the re-occupation
