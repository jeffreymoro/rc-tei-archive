               <div class="salute">My dear Montgomery</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You talk of yourself &amp; of me in terms of comparison upon which I must not comment,
               lest you should be as much pained by the comment as I was by the text. – Let that
               pass. If I had not admired your poetry, &amp; felt it &amp; loved it, &amp; loved you for its
               sake, I should not so often have thought of you &amp; spoken of you, &amp; determined to see
               you, – nor have broken thro the belt of ice at last.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You wish me a sounder frame both of body &amp; mind than your own. My body God be thanked
               is as convenient <span class="strikethrough">as</span> a tenement as its occupier could desire. When you see me you will fancy me far advanced
               in consumption so little is there of it, – but there has never been more; – &amp; tho
               it is by no means unlikely (from family pre-disposition) that this may be my appointed
               end, it is not at all the more likely <span class="strikethrough">for xx xxxxx</span> &lt;because of&gt; my lean &amp; hungry appearance. I am in far more danger of nervous diseases,
               from which nothing but perpetual self-management, &amp; the fortunate circumstances of
               my life &amp; disposition preserve me. Nature gave me an indefatigable activity of mind,
               &amp; a buoyancy of spirit, which has ever enabled me to <span class="strikethrough">make light</span> &lt;think little&gt; of difficulties, &amp; to live in the light of hope; these gifts too were
               accompanied with an hilarity which has enabled me to retain a boys heart to the age
               of eight &amp; thirty: but my senses are perilously acute, – impressions sink into me
               too deeply, &amp; at one time ideas had all the vividness &amp; apparent reality of actual
               impressions to such a degree, that I believe a speedy removal to a foreign country
               <span class="strikethrough">where</span> bringing with it a total change of all external objects, saved me from imminent danger.
               The remedy, or at least the preventitive of this is variety of employment, &amp; this
               it is which has made me the various writer that I am, even more than the necessity
               of pursuing the gainful paths of literature. If I fix my attention morning &amp; evening
               upon one subject, &amp; if my latest evening studies are of a kind to interest me deeply,
               my rest is disturbed &amp; broken, &amp; those bodily derangements ensue which indicate great
               nervous susceptibility. Experience having taught me this I fly from one thing to another,
               each new train of thoughts neutralizing as it were the last, &amp; thus in general maintain
               the balance so steadily that I lie down at night with a mind as tranquil as an infants.</p>
            <p class="indent1">That I am a very happy man I owe to my early marriage. When little more than one &amp;
               twenty I married under circumstances as singular as they well could be, &amp; to all appearance
               as imprudent, – but from that hour to this I have had reason to bless the day. The
               main source of disquietude was thus at once cut off – I had done with hope &amp; fear
               upon the most agitating &amp; most important action of life, &amp; my heart was at rest. Several
               years elapsed before I became a father, &amp; then the keenest sorrow which I ever endured
               was for the loss of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">an only child</a> at twelve-months old. Since that event I have had five &lt;children&gt; more, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">one</a> of whom has been taken from me. Of all sorrows these are the most poignant. but I
               am the better for them, &amp; never pour out my soul in prayer without acknowledging that
               these dispensations have drawn me nearer to my God.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But I will not pursue this strain <span class="strikethrough">f</span> too far. The progress of my mind thro many <span class="strikethrough">maz</span> changes &amp; mazes of opinion you shall know hereafter, &amp; the up-hill work which I have
                  had in the world, up-hill indeed, but by a path of my own chusing, &amp; always with this
                  comfort that I felt myself gaining the ascent, as well as toiling for it. Something
                  I must say, while there is yet room for it concerning the World before the Flood.
                  You say that you are about to begin it again.
