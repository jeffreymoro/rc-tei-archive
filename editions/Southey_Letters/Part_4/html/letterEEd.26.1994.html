                           It was not reported because Parliamentary journalists objected to Windham’s attitude
                           in a debate of 23 March 1810 on the exclusion of reporters from the Inns of Court
                           – the boycott lasted until 10 April 1810. The Walcheren expedition was an unsuccessful
                           British landing in the Netherlands in 1809. The plan had been to open another front
                           in the war against Napoleon. Although there was little actual fighting, the British
                           forces were severely depleted by a sickness quickly dubbed the ‘Walcheren Fever’.
