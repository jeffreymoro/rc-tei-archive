               <p>I have a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">D<sup>r</sup> B.</a> this evening. Concerning the little essay now in the Press, it will be enough to say,
                  that I shall without the smallest reluctance suppress any thing which may be thought
                  needlessly or offensively severe.

                           an expansion of his advocacy of Bell in Quarterly Review, 6 (August 1811), 264–304.
                           Southey’s attacks on Brougham, Jeffrey and others were moderated before publication.
                           Bell had written to Southey on 26 December 1811 expressing concern that his case would
                           be damaged if Southey employed ‘any degree of acrimony and severity of expression’.
                           Instead he urged him to write in ‘the least offensive and most conciliatory style’;
