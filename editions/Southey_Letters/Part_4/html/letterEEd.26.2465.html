                           Perring was best-known for improving the design of anchors. His pamphlet was A Brief
                           Inquiry into the Causes of Premature Decay in our Wooden Bulwarks, with an Examination
                           of the means best calculated to prolong their duration (1812). Southey commended his
                           plans for ‘laying up our ships in ordinary’ (Quarterly Review, 12 (October 1814),
                           187) and in 1815 offered an article on them to the Eclectic Review; see Southey to
                           Josiah Conder, 28 January 1815, Letter 2546.</span></div>
                  </div> says what he has to say as well as it can be said, – for matters of this kind can
                  derive no advantage from any ornaments of composition. If the Quarterly Review were
                  open to me, I might perhaps be able to serve him, – but there the ground is occupied
                  by Barrow.

                  in my way, &amp; I have but too many demands upon my time. However I would do it, if it
                  were wished because I fully acknowledge the importance of his suggestions. The good
                  that I can do will be only to make the thing more public, by putting it within sight
                  of some 15 or 20,000 persons on the same day, – &amp; in return Mr Perrin I dare say will
                  take the trouble of showing me the docks, if ever I should happen to call upon him.</p>

                  </div> but the arrangement &amp; developement of the story puzzles me very much. The beginning
                  will need your help. On the way from England being bound to Plymouth in New England,
                  he is driven into the harbour at Cape Cod. Now my Lord Admiral please to tell me what
                  wind would compell him to put into this harbour, &amp; be pleased also to navigate the
                  ship for me from the time that the wind makes them seek shelter till she is safe at
                  anchor. The time is 1675, the season September, the ship a Bristolman of from 2 to
                  300 tons.</p>
