               <p>I have more than once been thinking of addressing a letter to Crediton for the sake
                  of ascertaining whether you were in this world or the next, &amp; had not my occupations
                  been so numerous &amp; so constant that every hour brings with it its business, you would
                  long ere this have been troubled with a question to that effect. – The history of
                  my unfortunate brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> I can carry on as far as last summer. – Having obtained the Ensigncy to which you
                  allude he wrote to inform me of it, <span class="strikethrough">to which</span> &lt;&amp;&gt; I replied by a letter of exhortation. Some months afterwards he acquainted me
                  with his promotion to the rank of Lieutenant, – &amp; I wrote to him again in a manner
                  which implied more hopes of his reformation than I really felt. In July last there
                  came a letter to me from a Major Chamberlayne
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  ranks, – that he had taken him by the hand, – &amp; obtained him a commission in a Portugueze
                  regiment which he was then raising, – &amp; that Lord J Fitzroy
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> had insisted upon fitting him out for this new appointment. I replied to Major Chamberlayne
                  as such conduct from one who was a perfect stranger to me deserved, – &amp; expressed
                  an ominous apprehension that even this fresh opportunity of retrieving himself would
                  be lost upon poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a>; – an apprehension <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> founded not merely upon my thorough knowledge of his nature, but also upon the melancholy
                  symptoms shown in a letter from himself, which arrived by the same post as Chamberlaynes,
                  – in which he imputed this change in his fortunes wholly to his own good conduct,
                  &amp; never mentioned one of the persons who had so generously befriended him. My fears
                  were soon verified – &amp; the last I heard of him by a circuitous channel was that he
                  was taking up money, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> drafts upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">M<sup>rs</sup> Tyler</a>, – had left the regiment, &amp; sold his mule, – in short was become a vagabond again.
                  By what means he lost his Militia Commission &amp; was reduced into the ranks of the regulars
                  I have never learnt. – You see how <span class="strikethrough">th</span> hopeless it is, – it is a case of moral insanity, – perfectly incurable.</p>
