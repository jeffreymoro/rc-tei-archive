               <p>I ought to have <span class="strikethrough">replied</span> answered your last letter ere this, – but I have had a pressure of letters of business
                  on my hands &amp; also I desired <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> to tell you whether he could <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> find a bed for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JardineDavid">David</a> at S<sup>t</sup> Helens. There lies the only difficulty, – on our journey a third will be convenient
                  as well as agreable, – because in case of rain, or fatigue, or bad quarters, we can
                  then take chaise for a stage, either for the sake of expedition, or of comfort. I
                  believe we must provide David with a bed in the town, for since I wrote to you respecting

                  Then I am ready to sling my knapsack &amp; start. So if you come on with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerMartha">Martha</a> as soon as you please, I can attend to you &amp; my reviewing at the same time.</p>

            <p class="indent1">There is a stage from Kendal to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> Tuesdays, Thursdays &amp; Saturdays, which starts at six in the morning. And there is
               a mail from Liverpool which reaches Kendal about five: your better way then will be
               to secure places in that mail for Friday: it sets out about five in the afternoon.
               But you must lose no time in securing them, for I believe only two places can be taken
               at Liverpool, the other chances being reserved for a coach from Manchester which joins
               at Preston.</p>

               <p>My politics are very gloomy. The best part of the prospect is that Spain &amp; Portugal

                  nor a Military Government <span class="strikethrough">with xxx xxx xx</span> must look out for an asylum: Catholick Emancipation will lead to the first of these
