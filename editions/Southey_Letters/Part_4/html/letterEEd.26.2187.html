               this feeling it would be folly to apologize to any man for discharging a duty, &amp; least
               of all can it be needful to you.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I believe that you will find no man who will understand yr feelings better than I
               do – or who will sympathize in them so far. Were it yr belief that all who do not
               die in the profession of a particular faith are everlastingly lost, &amp; in that belief
               you should chuse to go &amp; preach the gospel to the most cruel of the negro nations,
               or even in Japan itself, I might perhaps set forth to you the certain &amp; inevitable
               danger, but I should hardly dissuade you from it, with such a belief the object is
               tantamount to the sacrifice &amp; the means would seem adequate to the object. In some
               degree indeed they would actually be so. He who offers Hell on the one hand, &amp; redemption
               by the blood of Jesus on the other will make his preaching felt wherever he can make
               it understood.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But what object do you propose which can counterbalance – I will not say danger to
                  yourself (a thing not to be considered if the call of duty were clear, &amp; hardly to
                  be urged even in this case) but the pain which yr departure would cause to your nearest
                  &amp; dearest friends? Is it to Botany Bay that you would go? what could you do there?
                  there are already schools missionaries &amp; preachers. It is becoming a favourite station
