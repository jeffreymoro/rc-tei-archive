                           as Carmen Triumphale in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the
                           deleted stanzas into an ‘Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte’, published

                  else. I have inserted five stanzas in place of the first half of the 9<sup>th</sup>, – relating to Spain. They are in keeping with the rest, &amp; contain a wipe at some
                  of our lilly-livered politicians, which will serve to bring in an extract &lt;or two&gt;
                  from the Edinburgh Review in the notes. As for the poem it is necessarily rather an
                  oration in verse than an ode, – for which reason I have given it a <span class="ital">generic</span> name, – Carmen being any kind of poem.</p>
