               <p>You once told me a most interesting story of two Welshmen who endeavoured to effect
                  La Fayettes release.

                           was of a Hanoverian and an American who in 1794 had attempted to free Marie-Paul-Joseph-Roch-Gilbert
                           Motier, Marquis de La Fayette (1757–1834) from his imprisonment at Olmutz; see Edinburgh
                           Annual Register, for 1809, 2.2 (1811), 514–525.</span></div>
                  </div> I wish you would give me the particulars of that story, for I have an opportunity
                  of introducing it where it would have a striking effect – suppressing the names of
                  the parties or not as you may think proper. It is a circumstance so truly honourable
                  to British feeling that it would do my heart good to record it.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Register sells well in Scotland &amp; in consequence <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</a> has offered me a twelfth share in it for £209. – the profits upon which are £80. By
                  means of this work &amp; of the Quarterly I am beginning to see fair weather. My books
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a> hands I can now leave to clear off some long arrears there; – &amp; I have paid <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> 100£ in part of a debt contracted &lt;chiefly&gt; for my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry’s</a> education.

                  </div> This arrangement with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</a> was too favourable to be let pass, – &amp; by postponing my journey to London for six
                  months I am enabled to conclude it. The other proprietors attribute the success of
                  the work in great measure to me, &amp; this offer of theirs is evidently meant to tie
                  me to its continuance by involving my own interests in it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</a> it seems served it greatly, by calling upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</a> (for the first time in his life) to pronounce a formal approbation of the historical
                  part, tho he differed from most of the opinions expressed in it. This that Gog-minimus
                  would never have done had he suspected me to be the author, but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">B.</a> tells me it is amusing to hear how vaguely &amp; absurdly the author is guest. I wonder
                  at this, – because I make no secret of that – or of any thing else which I write,
                  &amp; because it bears pretty strong marks of its father.</p>
