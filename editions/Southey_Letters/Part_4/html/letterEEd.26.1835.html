               <p>There are some questions which your brother can answer for me. Are there any of the
                  native race near the Rio? If any, in what state of freedom, servitude, or slavery,
                  and of what tribes? What does he conceive the proportions to be in the city of the
                  mixed race and of the negroes to those of European blood? Is the Portuguese language
                  in any degree mingled there with the Brazilians? for in many parts of Spanish America
                  a mixed language has been found, and in some the native tongue predominates. At Asçuncion,
                  for instance, many of the Creole women speak nothing but Guarani. This is a curious
                  process going on in the world. Just as the Latin grew out of the Greek, and our southern
                  tongues out of the wreck of the Latin, just so are there new languages rapidly forming
                  from the amalgamation of European, negro, and American dialects. The <span class="ital">talkee talkee</span> of the slaves in the sugar islands, as it is called, will prevail at Surinam, and
                  become the language of Guiana. They have a printed Bible in it already.
