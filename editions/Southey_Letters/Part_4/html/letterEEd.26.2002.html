            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I write to you upon a subject in which I believe you will feel as much interested
                  as myself. I have lately received a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a>, – the first which he has written me since his late losses.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Taylor’s letter of 10 December 1811 provided an alarming and, as it turned out, exaggerated
                           account of his financial woes, J.W. Robberds (ed.), A Memoir of the Life and Writings
                           of the Late William Taylor of Norwich, 2 vols (London, 1843), II, pp. 349–353.</span></div>
                  </div> This letter has distressed me very much, – the principle which remains of their wrecked
                  property he says will last their joint lives “but I shall be abandoned at once to
                  solitariness &amp; penury. To what then can I look on but to a voluntary interment in
                  the same grave with my parents. Oh that nature would realize this most convenient
                  doom!” –</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My first feeling, after the shock which this passage occasioned had subsided, was
                  to think what could be done, &amp; the most practicable plan which I have been able to
                  devise is that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Ts</a> friends (surely he ought to have many friends) should among themselves provide him
                  with 100£ a year, the business to be managed with such perfect secresy that he himself
                  should never know any thing further than that such an annuity <span class="strikethrough">would</span> &lt;will&gt; regularly be paid him, by the friend, whoever that may be, who will take upon
                  himself the charge of collecting it. – All anxiety for mere subsistence will thus
                  be taken away, &amp; if this be done speedily, it may relieve his mothers mind from a
                  burthen which is likely to hasten her to the grave. There is no person to whom I can
                  so properly communicate this project as yourself, resident as you are upon the spot,
                  &amp; acquainted with all his connections. If a sum large enough to purchase such an annuity
                  could be raised, – that would be the most delicate way of proceeding, – because in
                  that case the whole might be conducted with such secresy that his only intimation
                  might come from the Office. But this probably is not so easy as to raise the yearly
                  amount. – I wish my own means were more adequate to my desires. If the former plan
                  be practicable count on me for fifty pounds, – if the latter for ten pounds annually.
                  – Nine persons more upon this plan &amp; the thing is done, – I know now what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother Henry’s</a> means are at this time, the loss of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">his wife</a> having unsettled him, – but I think that we may reckon upon him &amp; upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</a>.
