               <p>We have been wishing for you every hour of every day since we set foot in this country,
                  – a country which art seems to have endeavoured to render picturesque in proportion
                  as it has been made otherwise by nature. Bruges is beyond all comparison the most
                  interesting place I have ever seen. It seems as if there had not been one house built
                  within the last century or two centuries, &amp; yet nothing has been suffered to go to
                  decay; the decay of the city has been relative &amp; not actual; other towns have flourished
                  &amp; increased in size; – Bruges has stood still, &amp; its state is the more gracious. It
                  is like a city of Elizabeth’s age,

                  remarkable is that there appears to be no poverty there, at least no squalid poverty,
                  – no absolute want. The poorest person is well lodged, &amp; decently clothed. We met

               <p>We left Bruges on Monday morning by the barge for Ghent, – this barge is said to be
                  the best public conveyance in the world, &amp; I should not dissent from this opinion,
                  if the people had not taken two beggars on board &amp; suffered them to go round asking
                  charity. The barge was full of people of all nations, – a large proportion English.
                  A Baronet’s chariot was on board, the two persons who belonged to it kept aloof from
                  the other passengers, sitting sometimes on the box, sometimes in the carriage; &amp; they
                  would not dine with us. This called forth a good many sarcastic remarks, – but it
                  was soon whispered that they were Mr. Peele

                  time have chosen to recognise me. It is about 8 hours passage to Ghent, when, as in
                  our case there was no wind to assist the horse. For the first part of the way the
                  country like that between Ostend &amp; Bruges was cultivated like a garden &amp; highly beautiful
                  in its way, the general hue of the landscape being grey, from the predominance of
                  the willow &amp; aspen, – but there are elm &amp; ash &amp; oak &amp; acacia &amp; walnut. It was a Kermis
                  or fair-day, &amp; we past by a village where all the humours of a Flemish fair were displayed,
                  – houses full of drinkers &amp; smokers, &amp; old women at cards al fresco before their doors.
                  Our passage cost five francs each (4/2) for which we were provided with really an
                  excellent dinner, paying extra for wine.</p>
