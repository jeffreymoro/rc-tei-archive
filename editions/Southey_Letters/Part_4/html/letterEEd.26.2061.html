                  best way will be for the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Author</a> to take one of those opinions which he formerly proposed, &amp; be guided by it, – or
                  as a thing of less formality to let any legal friend of his own mark such passages

                  </div> The general nature of the book is such that &lt;it&gt; is not likely to be prosecuted, still
                  I think a writer acts very imprudently who renders himself liable to prosecution without
                  any occasion &amp; for no imaginable good. It is a book of extraordinary talent, so full
                  of original thoughts felicitously expressed that I should grieve if it were suppressed,
                  – but I should be far more grieved if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">L.</a> involved himself by it in vexations which it was quite unnecessary to provoke. The
                  good or evil which it would do is <span class="strikethrough">pretty small</span> balanced, – for the author is as often right as he is wrong, – &amp; almost as <span class="strikethrough">almost</span> often wrong as he is right; supposing therefore that it would leave the opinions of
                  men pretty much as it found them, the originality &amp; talent which it displays would
                  be so much clear gain to the public in the way of intellectual pleasure.</p>
