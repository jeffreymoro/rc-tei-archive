                           In Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808, 1.1 (1810) 42 state papers were published
                           as an ‘Appendix’ (xix–ciii).</span></div>

                  </div> (as in treaties) are of consequence, they are afterwards added. But my opinion decidedly
                  is that if there be any such papers which are not noticed in the history, they ought
                  nevertheless to be included in the Appendix, for by making the Register a full &amp; faithful
                  Repertory of these documents, you assure to it an undoubted &amp; permanent value. All
                  the periodical works which profess to record these papers are miserably, – most miserably
                  – incomplete. – It would have been a great satisfaction to me could I have obtained
                  the Spanish proclamations &amp;c in the original, – some mistranslations I was able to
                  detect by guessing at what the Spanish phrase must have been, – &amp; most probably much
                  of the force &amp; passion of the language has been lost, which I perhaps might have been
                  able to have transfused.</p>

                  the year, every year being now abundantly fertile in materials. Instead therefore
                  of promiscuous or arbitrary biography I should recommend exclusively, the Necrology
                  of the year, – persons enough who have made themselves remarkable are annually dropping
                  off. I do not mean any attempt at a general Obituary (for in that the Gent: Magazine
                  is likely to remain unrivalled, &amp; one of the kind is enough) – but merely the lives
                  of remarkable persons, – &amp; if literary men, – a general review of their works may
