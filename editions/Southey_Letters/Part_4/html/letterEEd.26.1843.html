                           opinion of Mr. C’s POETRY and prose, as we have never read any of his works, except
                           the Friend, we have no apology to make; but for suspecting him of the weakness and

                           ‘Some Imitations of Scott’ and signed ‘S.T.C.’. This compared extracts from The Lay
                           of the Last Minstrel and Marmion with ones from Dryden, Baillie, Home, Ossian, Pope,
                           Spenser, and Southey (Madoc) in an attempt to prove that Scott had been ‘more particularly
                           … guilty of imitation’. A declaration, supplied by Coleridge, that the ‘S.T.C.’ who
                           had signed the piece on Scott was not the same person as ‘Mr. S. T. Coleridge’ appeared

                  mischief, for I immediately wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> to assure him that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> was not the author of so pitiful a piece of malice, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> himself publicly disavowed it. – It is not unlikely that the articles in the M Post
                  (I have not seen them) may have been written by this same person, &amp; if they <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxx</span> &lt;personat&gt; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> I should have no doubt of it. The man who was rascal enough to forge his signature
                  for the purpose of annoying <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a>, &amp; occasioning a breach between two men of letters who are on courteous terms with
                  each other, would be rascal enough to do anything. – With respect to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">M<sup>r</sup> Coleridge’s</a> poetry or prose I shall say nothing – all men who publish are liable to be criticised
                  by the wise &amp; the foolish alike, &amp; I should be the last person in the world to complain
                  either for myself, or for my friends. But as the error into which your Editor has
                  fallen has thus been pointed out, I trust he will not repeat his attack upon that
                  ground.
