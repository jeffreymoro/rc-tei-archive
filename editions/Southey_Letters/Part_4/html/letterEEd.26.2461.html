                  This is the first thing which I have to say. The next is concerning the Dedication.
                  You know very well that the thought of addressing it to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a> would never have entered my head, had it not seemed proper that as a Poet I should <span class="strikethrough">pay</span> offer him some mark of respect &amp; this has been sufficiently done by beöding him.

                           Regent, and sent Bedford a draft dedication; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford,
                           [30 April–1 May 1814], Letter 2412. However, he had changed his mind after publishing
                           an ‘Ode to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
                           &amp; Ireland’, III and IV; Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince

                  </div> Any thing farther would be doing too much, &amp; you know me well enough to be certain
                  that I should rather err on the other side. Roderick therefore will go into the world
                  with a dedication much more accordant to my feelings. It is in Latin because a man
                  may promise himself immortality with a better grace in that language than he can do
                  in English, but I was never expert in Latin composition, &amp; for twenty years have entirely
                  disused it,
