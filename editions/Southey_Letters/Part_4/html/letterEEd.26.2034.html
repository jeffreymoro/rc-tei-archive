A Commentary on His Life and Character</em>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 146. Landor’s dislike of Fellowes had undoubtedly
               been fuelled by learning (from Southey) of the latter’s views on his poetry. Fellowes
               had observed in a letter to Seward of 1803 that: ‘The author of Gebir … has lately
               made another attempt to convey the waters of Helicon by leaden pipes, and many dark
               subterranean ways … having trod the dark profound of Gebir, I feel no inclination
               to begin another journey, which promises so little pleasure, and probably where only
               a few occasional flashes will enlighten the road’, <em>Letters of Anna Seward: Written Between the Years 1784 and 1807</em>, 6 vols (Edinburgh, 1811), V, p. 77 n. *. Fellowes’s <em>Poems, Chiefly Descriptive of the Softer and More Delicate Sensations and Emotions
