                           to provide an Army to assist Bonaparte’s campaigns in northern Europe. When Spain
                           was invaded by France in 1808, Keats was in command of the operation to help these
                           Spanish troops escape from Denmark and return to Spain to fight the French. Keats’
                           letter was widely reported; see, for example, National Register, 1 (28 August 1808),
