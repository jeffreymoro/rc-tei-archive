                  </div> – other sufferings have their natural cure, &amp; when the wound is healed, the loss of
                  those we loved becomes ultimately our gain, connecting us with the world where we
                  shall meet again. If I may reason from my own mind nothing can do this so effectually:
                  all other conceptions of our future state are necessarily vague &amp; doubtful, – <span class="strikethrough">tho the thought is</span> &lt;&amp; in some degree painful&gt; like the contemplation of space or of eternity <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxx</span>. But the thought of meeting again with our parents &amp; our children, – the playmates
                  of our nursery &amp; the friends of our riper years, – this is a definite expectation,
                  – making &lt;Heaven,&gt; as it were, <span class="strikethrough">Heaven</span> tangible &amp; within our reach. I have felt this so strongly that it is led to a project
                  which the Evangelicals no doubt, if it should ever be executed, will exclaim against
                  as impious, – &amp; which before it is attempted <span class="strikethrough">many</span> &lt;most&gt; persons from its exceeding difficulty would in all likelihood dissuade me from
                  attempting. It is that of making our own faith the basis of a poem, &amp; tho to give
                  it the interest of hope &amp; fear, &amp; of good &amp; evil the action must be earthly, yet taking
                  the point of view from our next stage of existence, &amp; laying the scene there.
