               contemplating God. Quietism had been definitively condemned as heretical by the bull

               appeared on the saint’s body: ‘the marks of the nails began to appear in his hands
               and feet, resembling those he had seen in the vision of the man crucified. His hands
               and feet seemed bored through in the middle with four wounds, and these holes appeared
               to be pierced with nails of hard flesh; the heads were round and black, and were seen
               in the palms of his hands, and in his feet on the upper part of the instep. The points
               were long, and appeared beyond the skin on the other side, and were turned back as
               if clenched with a hammer. There was also in his right side a red wound, like one
               made by the piercing of a lance; out of which there often issued blood, so as to stain
               the saint’s tunic and drawers … there miraculous wounds were seen by several during
               the two years which he survived … and by great multitudes after his death; and the

Fransham (bap. 1730, d. 1810; <em>DNB</em>) was a scholar and teacher with a reputation for eccentricity. Southey, who had a
               marked taste for the eccentric, undoubtedly enjoyed the anecdotes about Fransham’s
               unusual dress, taste in food, conduct and beliefs. The latter included a fear of being
               buried alive: ‘he repeatedly desired, that his body should be laid before a fire,
               that wine should be offered to his lip, and that the arm of a woman clasped about
               his neck, before he was given up as irrecoverable’ (348).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               not have considered Christianity and cruelty as synonimous terms’ (519). Taylor’s
               reply, ‘Biographer of Fransham, in reply to Christianus’, <em>Monthly Magazine</em>, 32 (September 1811), 117–119, set out his principles for ‘biographic writing’: ‘By
               whatever opinions a given individual was influenced, from the point of view which
               those opinions indicate, his conduct should be surveyed. The biographer ought to climb
               upon the same standing, and to take the same regard of men and things and thoughts,
               which the departed spirit took’ (117). Christianus replied in <em>Monthly Magazine</em>, 32 (December 1811), 452–453, pushing home his point that Taylor’s ‘Life’ was ‘an
               attack upon Christianity’ (452) and refuting his charge of ‘the want of moral courage
