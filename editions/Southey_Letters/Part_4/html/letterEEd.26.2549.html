                           (Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 30 January – [2 February] 1797, The Collected

                  </div> One of his principles was that in printing verse, wherever the lines were so indented
                  that two in succession did not begin in the same perpendicular, there was to be a
                  full stop at the end of the former; – &amp; upon this principle he punctuated my verses.
                  I discovered it at last in the printing office upon enquiring how it happened that
                  the very faults for which a leaf was cancelled appeared most perseveringly in the
                  reprint: the man then came forward, quite in a fit of madness, told me I should have
                  made a pretty book of it if he had not corrected it for me, – &amp; it was as much as
                  the master of the office could do to pacify him.
