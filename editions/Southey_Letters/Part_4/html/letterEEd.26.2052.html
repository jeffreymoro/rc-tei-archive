                  </div> which I think will convince you that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Lancaster</a> is a vulgar-minded plagiarist, and a liar of the foulest kind. The good which he has
                  done is very great, but it is pretty much in the way that the devil has been the cause
                  of Redemption.

                  </div> His cause was taken up by the insidious enemies of the Church; the beauty of the principle
                  which he had stolen was so manifest, and its power so great, in spite of all that
                  he has done to adulterate and disguise it, that it enables them to attach a very general
                  interest to the subject; and the manner in which this was made an engine against the
                  Church has at last frightened the clergy into doing their duty, which I verily believe
                  no other means would have effected. The Bishop of Durham

                           supporter of practical philanthropy and had promoted both the inter-demoninational
                           Religious Tract Society (founded 1799) and the British and Foreign Bible Society (founded
                           1804).</span></div>
                  </div> is a noble exception to the abominable indifference which they displayed for more
                  than ten years. As for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">Dr. Bell</a>, he has been, and is, as much an enthusiast in this pursuit, as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</a> has been respecting the slave trade, and is to me, who know both the men, not less
                  an object of respect and reverence. Herbert Marsh’s sermon very ably and clearly shows
                  in what manner the new system upon the Lancastrian scheme must needs operate to undermine
                  the Church Establishment.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Herbert Marsh (1757–1839; DNB), cleric and biblical critic. He had preached a sermon
                           at St Paul’s on 13 June 1811 that was critical of the interdenominational British
                           and Foreign Bible Society (founded 1804) and urged that Anglicans should found their
                           own Bible society. Southey had read the pamphlet form of the sermon, The National
                           Religion the Foundation of National Education: A Sermon Preached in the Cathedral
                           Church of St. Paul, London (1811).</span></div>
                  </div> It is, in reality, a self-evident absurdity to affirm that it is not the duty of the
                  State to see that national education be conducted upon the principle of the national
                  religion. Do not misunderstand me; my meaning is, that in parochial schools, which
                  I want to see established at the public expense over all England, the Church Catechism
                  ought to be taught, and no substitute for it; because this is known and approved,
                  and what may be substituted we know not, and we do know that <span class="ital">nothing</span> can be devised more conformable to the doctrines of the Church of England. This would
                  exclude none of the orthodox dissenters, except the Baptists; and those whom it would
                  exclude may have schools of their own. The dissenters who are not orthodox (Quakers,
                  Arians, and Socinians) have no poor to stand in need of gratuitous education. Neither
                  have the Baptists many. But if for these few it be thought right and liberal to abstain
                  from making any portion of the established creed a part of primary education, it must
                  of necessity be much more so to exclude Christianity altogether. It then makes room
                  for the Jews, who have many poor. To say that religious instruction may be left to
                  the parents is absurd; the poor have not the leisure for this, even if they had the
                  requisite knowledge and ability. Neither ought it to be left to the clergyman: he
                  has duties enough without it. But if it be made a part of education, it is impossible
                  not to draw the line of exclusion somewhere.
