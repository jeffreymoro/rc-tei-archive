            <p class="indent1">I should not expend your money or my paper upon this letter were it not in reply to
               the most important part of that which I have just received. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora</a> says it is useless for her to write, unless she could <span class="strikethrough">encourage you</span> &lt;explain to&gt; M<sup>r</sup> Whatshisname the kind of eruption with which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Bedfordfamily">your mother</a> is troubled. <span class="strikethrough">Explain</span> State this as clearly as you can, &amp; then she will without delay transmit the case

                  channel of franking, you shall have the first two books, &amp; the rest in sequence with
                  as little delay as possible. I have begun the 9<sup>th</sup> book.

            <p class="indent1">It is now in that state that it would be easy for me to finish it during the winter,

               &amp; think it may go to press in twelve months from this time, – if I live &amp; do well.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Shall I call it Roderick the Last of the Goths, – or, Spain Restored? Think of these
