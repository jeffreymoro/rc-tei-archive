                        certain letters of the alphabet; when the letters are put together in their numerical
                        order, they spell out the solution (see the end of the letter). It is not possible

               numbers above certain letters of the alphabet; when the letters are put together in
               their numerical order, they spell out the solution (see the end of the letter). It
               is not possible to reproduce this in the electronic text; instead, Southey’s numbers
               have been placed in superscript within square brackets after the letter of the alphabet
               to which they refer.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               critical of the United States, was John Barrow (1764–1848; <em>DNB</em>). Southey defended himself publicly; see Southey to the Editor of the <em>Courier</em>, 16 June 1815, Letter 2616.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
