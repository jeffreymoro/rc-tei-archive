               letter to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 3 October 1815, Letter 2659, that he had only
               ‘begun’ to write to Rickman. In the final paragraph, Southey states he will leave
               for Maestricht ‘to-morrow’ and he began this journey on 17 October 1815.</p>

               <p>I wish you had been with me at Ghent, where the Beguines have their principal establishment.

                  </div> The Beguinage is a remarkable place, at one end of the city, and entirely enclosed.

                           in Ghent was dedicated to her.</span></div>
                  </div> the patroness of the establishment. The space enclosed is, I should think, not less
                  than the area of the whole town of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> or of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ChristChurch">Christ Church</a>; and the Beguinage itself, unlike almshouse, college, village, or town: a collection
                  of contiguous houses of different sizes, each with a small garden in front, and a
                  high brick wall enclosing them all; over every door the name of some saint under whose
                  protection the house is placed, but no opening through which anything can be seen.
                  There are several streets thus built, with houses on both sides. There is a large
                  church within the enclosure, a burying-ground, without any grave-stones; and a branch
                  from one of the innumerable rivers with which Ghent is intersected, in which the washing
                  of the community is performed from a large boat; and a large piece of ground, planted
                  with trees, where the clothes are dried. One, who was the second person in the community,
                  accosted us, showed us the interior, and gave us such explanation as we desired, for
                  we had with us a lady who spoke French. It is curious that she knew nothing of the
                  origin of her order, and could not even tell by whom it was founded; but I have purchased
                  here the Life of S. Bega, from whom it derived its name, and in this book I expect
                  to find the whole history.

               <p>There are about 6000 Beguines in Brabant and Flanders, to which countries they are

                           and again in 1794, and incorporated the territory into France.</span></div>
                  </div> Their lands were then taken from them, and they were obliged to lay aside the dress
                  of the order; but this was only done in part, because they were supported by public
                  opinion; and being of evident utility to all ranks, few were disposed to injure them.
                  They receive the sick who come to them, and support and attend them as long as the
                  illness requires. They are bound by no vow, and my informant assured me, with evident
                  pride, that no instance of a Beguine leaving the establishment had ever been known.
                  She herself had entered it after the death of her husband; and I suppose their numbers
                  are generally, if not wholly, filled up by women who seek a retreat, or need an asylum
                  from the world. The property which a Beguine brings with her reverts to her heir-at-law.
                  At the Revolution, the church of the Beguinage was sold, as confiscated religious
                  property. This sale was a mere trick, or, in English phrase, a job to accommodate
                  some partisan of the ruling demagogues with ready money. Such a man bought it, and
                  in the course of two or three weeks resold it to two sisters of the community for
                  300 Louis d’ors, and they made it over again to the order. There is a refectory, where
                  they dine in common if they please, or, if they please, have dinner sent from thence
                  to their own chambers. We went into three chambers, – small, furnished with little
                  more than necessary comforts, but having all these, and remarkably clean. In one,
                  a Beguine, who had been bed-ridden many years, was sitting up and knitting. We were
                  taken into the chamber, because it amused her to see visitors. She was evidently pleased
                  at seeing us, and remarkably cheerful. In another apartment, two sisters were spinning,
                  one of eighty-five, the other of eighty-three years of age. In all this there is less
                  information than I should have given you, if my tongue had not been the most antigallican
                  in the world, and the Flemish French not very intelligible to my interpreter. The
                  dress is convenient, but abominably ugly. I shall endeavour to get a doll equipped
                  in it. The place itself I wish you could see; and, indeed, you would find a visit
                  to Bruges and Ghent abundantly overpaid by the sight of those cities (famous as they
                  are in history), and of a country, every inch of which is well husbanded.</p>

               <p>Bruges is, without exception, the most striking place I ever visited, though it derives
                  nothing from situation. It seems to have remained in the same state for above 200
                  years; nothing has been added, and hardly anything gone to decay. What ruin has occurred
                  there, was the work of frantic revolutionists, who destroyed all the statues in the
                  niches of the Stadtt House,

                  and if the cultivation of the ground and the well-being of the people be the great
                  objects of civilisation, I should almost conclude that no part of the world was so
                  highly civilised as this. At Ghent there is more business, more inequality, a greater
                  mixture of French manners, and the alloy of vice and misery in proportion. Brussels,
                  in like manner, exceeds Ghent, and is, indeed, called a second Paris. The modern part
                  of the city is perfectly Parisian; the older, and especially the great square, Flemish.
