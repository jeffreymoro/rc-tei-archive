               <p>I returned home on Saturday after an absence of twelve days, and a round of 300 miles,
                  more than two of which were performed on foot, – a seasonable change of air and occupation
                  to freshen me up for resuming my wonted employments, which, it seems, must commence
                  again with shorter intermission than I had proposed. Letters were awaiting me to urge

                  under an arch of stones, and falls from a height down a cleft in brown and naked rocks,
                  that hang over you, like the cliff under which Evangelist met Christian when he had

                  with a guide and a pony, you may see the Scar that evening. To Ingleton from Settle
