                  his health; – even if both these <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> difficulties were overcome, he would find himself less a gainer at the end of the
                  year than he should by producing a play which would cost him three months labour,
                  &lt;or by any other literary labour in that line.&gt; I advise him earnestly to raise what
                  he can by lecturing for immediate emergencies; &amp; then to come here, &amp; write for the
                  theatre, &amp; for the Reviews. From the Reviews <span class="strikethrough">he may</span> alone he may get if he chuses, as much as would suffice to keep <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> at College. Let him but come down here &amp; task himself merely to two hours in the day,
                  – &amp; he will make himself happy &amp; do all that is needful for his family. But the plan
                  of taking pupils would involve him in duties which he will never perform, &amp; in <span class="strikethrough">difficulties</span> &lt;embarrassments&gt; from which it may be very difficult to extricate himself.</p>

                  inserted in its place. The size of the written page must be that of the printed one;
                  – the writing not wider than the letter-press, – as for the size of the writing, it
                  matters not so it be clear, <span class="strikethrough">or the eight pages be</span> into how many pages the eight printed ones may be extended. The book is no beauty,
