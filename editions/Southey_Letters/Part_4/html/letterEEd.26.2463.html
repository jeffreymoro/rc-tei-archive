               to dedicate <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814) to Bedford, in a few lines in Latin. He had turned ‘Grosvenor’ into Latin
               as ‘Grosvenori’; whereas the name ‘Grosvenor’ literally means ‘great hunter’, like
               the Biblical figure, Nimrod, ‘a mighty hunter before the Lord’. <em>Genesis</em> 10: 9.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
