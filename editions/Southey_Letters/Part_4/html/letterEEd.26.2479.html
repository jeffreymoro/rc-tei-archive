               <div class="salute">My Dear Neville,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have for some time been in daily hope of a letter to announce that you were on your
               way to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>: during the delightful weather which we have enjoyed for the last fortnight we have
               repeatedly wished for you to enjoy it with us. Some of our purposed excursions are
               postponed till your arrival. The sooner you come the better: every day now shortens
               upon us, and though I hope we shall manage so as never to want daylight, this is a
               country in which we cannot have too much of it.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteJames">James</a> wrote to me, some week or ten days since, a very pleasing and good letter in every
               respect. He expresses a solicitude about taking his degree with some credit, on account
               of the pleasure which it would give you. This feeling does him great honour, but I
               fear he is rather too <span class="ital">anxious</span> about it; and it might perhaps have a good effect if you were to assure him that
               you see this point in its true light, and attach no undue importance to a thing which
               can in no degree affect his future fortunes. You have not sent him to college to seek
               his fortune by academical pursuits, but that he may be qualified for the ministry
               there, and obtain that degree and those testimonials which are very properly considered
               as necessary for one who enters into the service of the Established Church. I have
               said this because it is evident to me that the fear of not taking an <span class="ital">honorary</span> degree haunts him; and this is a bad thing for anybody, especially for one whose
               health and spirits cannot afford much wear and tear.</p>

                  that they shall be whipped at school!! The wicked conduct of that beast Ferdinand
