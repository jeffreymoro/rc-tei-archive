               Letter 1974. Charles had rented one of Landor’s largest farms at Llanthony. Unfortunately,
               Landor was not to share Southey’s opinion of his new tenant. Betham and Landor were
               soon in dispute over the rent and the use of the land. The final straw was when Betham’s
               brother, Frederick (b. 1789/1790), dug up trees Landor had planted. Landor denounced
               Frederick in a handbill that he personally posted up in Monmouth during the assizes.
               Betham sued for libel, Landor lost and had to pay £100 in damages. For Betham’s version
               of events, see Ernest Betham, <em>A House of Letters</em> (London, 1905), pp. 262–277.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
