               for. It would be very desirable that you should see her lays; the writing is likely
               not to be difficult, as it probably was written in an age when scrawling was not common;
               but I dare say that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge">George Dyer</a> would lend you his eyes, if your own should be puzzled. Go with him some day and
               reconnoitre them. If they are not very numerous, you will insure an antiquarian value
               in your book by inserting them. Why have you not noticed the most important part of
               my last note, that wherein <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> asked when we might expect you? You must come and make rhyme sketches from nature
               for your poem.</p>
