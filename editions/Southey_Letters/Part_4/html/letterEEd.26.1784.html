               <p>I do not believe that the same number of lines ever cost me half the time <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> (since I left off Bible – exercises) that these have done, – &amp; after all I doubt whether
                  they will please any body more than they do myself, – which Gods knows is little enough.
                  The structure of the poem is good, – &amp; that is all I can say in its praise. If you
                  throw it behind the fire my present feelings about it are such as to render it very
                  little likely that I shall ever make it rise again from its ashes. Believe me however
                  I have laboured very anxiously to do something which might gratify you, – &amp; the worse
                  the verses are the more do they evince this, – since in spite of fear &amp; foresight
                  I have chosen rather to <span class="strikethrough">do</span> &lt;write&gt; ill than to <span class="strikethrough">do</span> write nothing.
