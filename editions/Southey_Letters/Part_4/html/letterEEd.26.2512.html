               <p>I am three hundred miles from town, &amp; were I there upon the spot I should not know
                  of whom to ask a question which it behoves me to have resolved, – except of you. New
                  Years Day is at hand, &amp; whether I am expected to bring forth a New Years Ode <span class="ital">more nefasto</span> majorum,

                  I sent him such a portion as made a whole of itself sufficient for his purpose; &amp;
                  that I might not be deficient in any proper civility, told him that if any other parts

                  the whole to his choice. He never thought proper to take the slightest notice of my
                  letter, &amp; whether any portion of the Ode were performed, or if the ceremony were dropt,
                  I know not. But I rather <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> think it must have been waived, because no part of the poem appeared in the papers
