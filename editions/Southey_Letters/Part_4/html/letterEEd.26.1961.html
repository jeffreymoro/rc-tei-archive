                  you into it, and then made a thundering charge of malice and calumny, against those
                  who argue, from this single passage, in direct contradiction to the whole tenor of
                  the book.

               to educate, at their own expense, children enow to fill the stations which require
               higher qualifications; and there is a risk of elevating by an indiscriminate education,
               the minds of those doomed to the drudgery of daily labour above their condition, and
               thereby rendering them discontented and unhappy in their lot. It may suffice to teach
               the generality, on an economical plan, to read their bible, and understand the doctrine
               of our holy religion’, <em>An Experiment in Education</em>, 2nd edn (London, 1805), p. 62. Much criticised by Bell’s opponents, Southey quoted
               it in full and excused it as the product of Bell’s ‘deepest desire’ for the ‘general
               diffusion of education’, <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 6 (August 1811), 292. He also attacked Bell’s critics for their misappropriation
               of this one paragraph, Ibid., 299. In so doing, he thought he was more effective at
               defending Bell than the reviewer in the <em>British Review</em>, 1 (March 1811), 195–7.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
