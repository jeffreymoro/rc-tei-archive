                  stating the points of dispute (would that I had to draw it up!) then offering America
                  peace on condition that it paid the expenses of this armament sent to enforce it:
                  after a reasonable time allowed for accepting the proposition I would run down the
                  coast, &amp; treat the great towns with an exhibition of rockets; – then renew the proposals

                  on should they not chuse to put a stop to the illuminations by submission, – or till
                  Philadelphia, Baltimore – New York &amp;c – were laid in ashes. – They should feel the
                  power which they have so wantonly provoked. – I am now reading American-history of

               his assault on a Parliamentary congregation at Kendal Church, which provided the origin
               of the ballad, ‘Dick and the Devil’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody">Scott’s note to Canto 6, stanza 33 of <em>Rokeby</em> had recorded his indebtedness when describing a horseman riding ‘armed, at headlong
               speed’ to the ‘real achievement of Major Robert Philipson, called from his desperate
               and adventurous courage, Robin the Devil. He was a loyalist during the civil wars,
               and held out the castle of the Earl of Derwentwater, situated upon Lord’s Island in
               the lake of Keswick’, <em>Rokeby</em> (Edinburgh, 1813), p. cxv. Southey’s letter points out his ‘error’, and draws Scott’s
               attention to a new source, Joseph Nicolson (fl. 1770s) and Richard Burn (1709–1785;
               <em>DNB</em>), <em>The History and Antiquities of the Counties of Westmorland and Cumberland</em>, 2 vols (London, 1777), I, pp. 185–186 (no. 2106 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s
               library), which said that ‘Robin the Devil’ had been beseiged at his home on the island
               of Brendwood, in Lake Windermere. By 1813 the island had long passed out of the hands
               of the Philipson family and was owned by the Curwens. Scott responded to Southey’s
               point by correcting his mistake, see <em>Rokeby: A Poem</em>, 2nd edition (Edinburgh, 1813), p. 411.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
