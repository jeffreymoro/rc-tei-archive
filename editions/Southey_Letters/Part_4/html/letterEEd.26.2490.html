               <p>I will hunt out something for you respecting the Beguines, &amp; shall be right glad if
                  you resume a subject from which great good may arise: In 1803 they existed at Breda
                  &amp; at Antwerp – It is not likely that they should have been abolished since that time,
                  &amp; as they existed in those two cities, – it is probable that thr[MS torn] other establishments
                  existed also. I should think that there would be a full account of their Institutes
