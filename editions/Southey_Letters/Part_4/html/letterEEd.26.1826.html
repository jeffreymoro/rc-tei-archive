                  gratified when those whom I esteem are satisfied with my works. Doubtless it would

                  from misconduct, which misconduct never was investigated &amp; fixed upon the right person.
                  I was always of opinion that Egypt ought to have been occupied – not Alexandria alone.
                  But for Constantinople the project itself seems not to have been well considered,
                  &amp; with such an Admiral &amp; such an Ambassador to put it in execution, – little else
