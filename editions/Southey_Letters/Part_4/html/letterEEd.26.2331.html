               my return, – a former one reached me just before my departure, &amp; with many others
               remained unanswered, because amid the endless round of occupations &amp; engagements in
               which I was involved, it was impossible to find time for answering them. Thank God
               I am once more by my own fire side. My ancles are still somewhat swolen, for I was
               five &amp; forty hours upon the road; &amp; the sound of the mail coach is not yet out of
               my ears; but I am safe, sound &amp; at rest.</p>

                  </div> This is like pulling a house to pieces for the purpose of making something which formed
                  no part of the original design. There is in the dialogues of this play a peculiar
                  character which it is easier to feel than to analize; – your prose is like your verse
                  every where terse, condensed &amp; full of thought, – &amp; with flashes of which the thought
                  &amp; the expression, are so apt, so happy &amp; so original that I know &lt;not&gt; where they
                  are to be paralleled, or where any thing approaching them is to be found. – I was
                  asked in London whether I were the author of C Julian.
