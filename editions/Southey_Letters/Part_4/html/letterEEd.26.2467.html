                           of the second edition of Coleridge’s Remorse. A Tragedy (1814), Quarterly Review,
                           11 (April 1814), 183: ‘It appears to us that chance or a congenial mode of thinking
                           has brought into intimate connection minds of very distinct powers and peculiarities.
                           Thus a school of poetry has arisen of which all the members agree in some points,
                           but differ in others; and even where they agree in kind they sometimes differ in degree.
                           In examining their writings, therefore, we are to expect a general resemblance in

                  </div> The history of my style is simply this. In all young poets it is &amp; ever must be, mere

                  become the easiest objects of imitation. Thus they who imitate Milton succeed in writing
                  something very stiff, very pedantic &amp; anti-English. My favourite poet was Spenser
                  but at the age <span class="strikethrough">when</span> of what might be termed poetical puberty when the voice of song began to be fixed,
                  I had <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</a> by heart. – Perhaps I have read more poetry than any man living, – much Italian, much

                  a proper share of Greek. But for many years I had entirely laid it aside till within
                  these few months. My mature style aims at nothing but to express in pure English what
                  I have to say: – <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> I profess nothing but to avoid the barbarisms &amp; nonsense which have so long past current
                  in verse. Briefly, the subject being such as seems good to me, &amp; the manner of treating

         <div class="note" id="Note16"><span class="noteLabel">15.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey’s complaint was aimed at the description of the ‘Lake Poets’ in an appraisal
               of the second edition of Coleridge’s <em>Remorse. A Tragedy</em> (1814), <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 11 (April 1814), 183: ‘It appears to us that chance or a congenial mode of thinking
               has brought into intimate connection minds of very distinct powers and peculiarities.
               Thus a school of poetry has arisen of which all the members agree in some points,
               but differ in others; and even where they agree in kind they sometimes differ in degree.
               In examining their writings, therefore, we are to expect a general resemblance in
               all, which yet shall be neither so strong nor universal as to obliterare a peculiar
               character in each. Mr. Southey, for instance, appears to us more active and playful
               than those with whom his name is here associated: metaphysical enough to gratify the
               vanity, without fatiguing the attention, of the common reader; rather sweetly developing
               the virtues of the heart, than curiously untwisting the subtleties of the mind; diffusing
               over his whole picture a colouring more grateful and soothing, but less contrasted
               with strong light and shade; more delightful and amiable, more curious and excursive,
               but, on the whole, perhaps possessing less of that touching and irresistible power
               which incidentally redeems the wilder eccentricities of his friends’. The review’s
               author was Coleridge’s nephew, John Taylor Coleridge.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
