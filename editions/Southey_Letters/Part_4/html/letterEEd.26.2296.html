            <p class="indent1">You may be assured that a letter in which your intended movements are so kindly made
               to depend upon mine would not have remained a whole month unanswered without some
               very sufficient cause. In reality I did not receive it till last night. It had lain
               at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a>, &amp; lucky it is that they had not sent it off for <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> a week or fortnight ago, in which case it would have lain unopened there in the parcel,
               till my return.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I left home on Wednesday last, (this day week) took the mail from Penrith, &amp; arrived
                  safe &amp; without fatigue in town on Saturday at five in the morning. Here that is to
                  say, in &amp; about London, I shall certainly remain till the middle of October, possibly
                  till the end; – &amp; when I set forth on my return it shall be by the Ludlow mail, –
                  if such a mail there be, – otherwise by whatever coach will carry me there most expeditiously.
                  – Thank you for Broads book.

                  that it is miserably misdirected at present. Of this I am so convinced that the spirit
                  moves me strongly to address a letter to him, – a way by which I could more likely
                  impress him at first, than by any personal intercourse. It is true that my days to
