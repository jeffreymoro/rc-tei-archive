         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">2.. </span><span class="noteBody">An incredibly complex issue. The Nawabs of Carnatic had incurred massive debts to
               the East India Company and to private British traders. In 1801 a deal was struck whereby
               the administration of the State was handed over to the East India Company, in return
               for the Madras Government agreeing to pay the Nawabs’ debts. It soon became clear
               that many of the Nawabs’ alleged debts were not genuine and were based on forged bonds.
               The Madras Government’s attempt to prosecute a number of people for these forgeries
               produced inconclusive and contradictory verdicts; and the Government was accused of
               high-handed actions against local merchants and officials it suspected of being involved
               in the forgeries.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in Streatham. In 1813 Southey was commissioned by the Barlows to write a defence of
               the ex-Governor’s conduct. The result was the anonymously published pamphlet <em>An Exposure of the Misrepresentations and Calumnies in Mr Marsh’s Review of Sir George
                  Barlow’s Administration at Madras. By the Relatives of Sir George Barlow</em> (1813).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               East Retford 1812–1818. Southey’s dislike for him can also be explained by Marsh’s
               consistent support for Catholic emancipation and his opposition to attempts to impose
               Christianity in India.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               himself to the electors of East Retford as a Whig, and thus gaining his parliamentary

               1771–1800. Southey had these papers as John May had asked him to write Walpole’s life.
               Coxe was rumoured to be planning, though he did not write, a life of Jose I (1714–1777;
               King of Portugal 1750–1777). He was, however, a royal biographer and his <em>Memoirs of the Kings of Spain</em> was published in 1813.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
