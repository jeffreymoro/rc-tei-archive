               seen at least part of Lamb’s MSS, noted it was ‘both feeble and affected’ and much
               in need of revision; see Grosvenor Charles Bedford to Southey, 1 February 1815, Bodleian
               Library, MS Eng. Lett. d. 52. The fullest discussion of the ‘mutilations’ or revisions,
