                  I shall be abandoned at once to solitariness &amp; penury. To what can I look forwards,
                  but to a voluntary interment in the same grave with my parents? O that nature would
                  realize this most convenient doom.”

               <p>Now my reason for transcribing this passage to you is, because it has made a deep
                  impression on me, &amp; haunts me when I lie down at night. You know more of Norwich than
                  I do, &amp; more of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylors</a> connections. Who is most in his confidence? Is it <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SayersFrank">D<sup>r</sup> Sayers</a>? – I thought of writing directly to him, but was withheld by a suspicion that there
                  is no great warmth of heart about him. But what I would say to the person who may
                  be most likely to enter into my <span class="strikethrough">x</span> wishes is that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylors</a> friends should raise such an annuity for him, as would secure him from penury, &amp; at
                  once relieve his mind from the apprehension of it: – either raising <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxx</span> a sum sufficient to purchase it (the best way because the least liable to accidents)
                  – or by yearly contributions, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SayersFrank">D<sup>r</sup> S.</a> (<span class="strikethrough">xx</span> any other the fittest person) receiving &amp; regularly paying it, &amp; he never knowing
                  particularly from whence it comes, but merely that it is his. The former plan is the
                  best, because in that case there would be only to purchase the annuity &amp; put the security
                  into his hands, – &amp; this might be done without any person appearing in it, – the office
                  transmitting him the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> necessary documents. – This of course is a thing upon which the very wind must not
                  blow. Ten years hence, or perhaps five, if the <span class="strikethrough">fir</span> least desirable of these plans should be found most practicable, you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> may be able to cooperate in it.
