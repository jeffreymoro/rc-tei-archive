                           had led the first mission of the London Missionary Society to South Africa, and worked
                           extensively with indigenous populations, including the Khosa, who nicknamed him Jank’hanna
                           (‘the bald man’). A controversial activist, he argued that native African converts
                           (not their white peers) were the true Christians. He died in Cape Town of a fever
                           on 18 December 1811.</span></div>
                  </div> I am far from sympathizing with the Directors of the Missionary Society in all their
                  opinions &amp; feelings, – but I feel the whole heroism of such a man as much as they
                  can do, – &amp; would to God that statesmen could see the importance of such men as clearly
                  as I do. That souls which have never heard of redemption may nevertheless be saved
                  I certainly believe, &amp; God forbid that I should ever blaspheme him by thinking otherwise,
                  but I am equally certain that savage &amp; barbarous nations can be reclaimed by nothing
                  but Christianity. In thinking of the merits of a missionary therefore I never consider
                  his creed, – a martyr in Japan is to me not less an object of admiration than a martyr

                  Queen, – three cantos of the intended continuation was part of a huge pile which some
                  years ago I committed to the flames. I rather regret that the memoranda for this notable

                  of what the author designed to do in the other half. Nothing which I have done ever
                  gave me so much delight as the dream of what I intended to do. I lived in Faery Land
