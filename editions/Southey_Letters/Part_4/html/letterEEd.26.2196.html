               half my dinner which I had made was unmade. There was no nausea or sense of sickness
               of any kind, – nor can I in any way account for it. It began with an unusual sensation
               in the abdomen which if you can understand such a phrase, was as it were reflected
               by another in the head; this latter however was what I have been accustomed to for
               years, – a <span class="strikethrough">sudden</span> sense of sudden apprehension, such as a person feels when startled <span class="strikethrough">from</span> as he is falling to sleep, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; x</span> it began with me <span class="strikethrough">in my xx</span> in 1799: &amp; before I went to Lisbon alarmed me much.

               the abdomen. Some swinging doses of rhubarb I hope have set me to rights, &amp; as soon
               as this part of the process is over, I shall delight the great <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Doctoress</a> by going thro a course of her tonics.</p>
