                  the words which are specified as unusual, in every instance except one I think they
                  can be justified. <span class="ital">coronet</span> is a word appropriate to <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> rank heraldry &amp; rank, – a savage head-dress of feathers is not a coronet, nor <span class="strikethrough">am I</span> do I know any word except <span class="ital">coronal</span> by which it can <span class="strikethrough">appro</span> properly be called. I use tambour instead of drum, because drum represents to us a
                  specific musical instrument in daily use, – altogether different from any among the
                  savages. I use napery instead of napkins &amp; table-cloths because it is a comprehensive
                  word expressing both. Poitrals because exclusively appropriated to <span class="ital">horse</span> armour, – a breast-plate belonging to a man. The word <span class="ital">Broad</span> in the sense which I have used it, is in common use in Norfolk, &amp; will I have no doubt
                  be found in the maps of that country: it is that species of lake which is formed by
                  a <span class="strikethrough">great</span> river <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> on its course, – differing from lake &amp; from lagoon. <span class="strikethrough">&amp; required for</span> We must go to provincialisms when we want to designate natural objects with precision,
                  – for <span class="strikethrough">upon</span> in such things the dialect of the metropolis is necessarily deficient. <span class="ital">Plumery</span> I allow has no advantage over feathers except that I like it better in its place.
                  – The cause of my misuse of the word Lutheranism is rightly guessed at – I fell into
                  the obvious error from having the word Luteranos constantly before my eyes. – Araboutan
                  is not as the reviewer thinks the native name of the country, which was too extensive
                  &amp; in too wild a state to have a general name, – but of the Brazil-tree.</p>
