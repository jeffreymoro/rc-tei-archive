                           the Court of Session (since 1806). These posts gave him a combined salary of £1600

                  </div> This result had seemed to me so far probable, that I had thought seriously how it
                  would become me to act. So I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> saying that the time was past when I could write verses upon demand upon any subject
                  – but that if I were permitted upon great public occasions to write, or to be silent,
                  as the spirit might move, in that case the office would become a mark of honourable
                  distinction which I should gladly accept. Of course it was not for me to propose terms
                  to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a>, &amp; I left it to him to <span class="strikethrough">determine</span> discover how this sort of arrangement could be made.

                  £26 – &amp; the various deductions reduce the whole to £90. There was nothing to tempt
                  me in such a salary, but in thinking over the matter it occurred that there was a
                  way in which it might be made of great &amp; permanent advantage. Accordingly by adding
                  about 12£ annually I have ensured my life for 3000£, &amp; thus converted it into this
                  substantial legacy for my family. And this thought will make me even write the odes
