                  </div> on which I have fixed my eye. It is not to be supposed that I could have that &amp; the
                  Mus. at the same time, &amp; it cannot be doubted that that is the best thing of the two,
                  for tho the salary is the same &amp; there are no &amp;cs, there is likewise no duty expected,
                  &amp; no confinement. Besides the title would be of direct advantage to me. Now of this
                  I think myself tolerably secure whenever M. Dutens furnishes a conclusion to his Memoirs.

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">400£ a year, if liable to the same deductions as my pension, which I suppose it is,
               is frittered down to 280. the labour of three hours a day, required for cataloguing,
               if given to the booksellers, would produce twice that sum. It is not that cataloguing
               would be unpleasant work. – far from it, – <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> that kind of desultory employment <span class="strikethrough">which</span> is as good as idleness: but considering the objects which I have before me I ought
               not to allow time for any such (comparatively) unworthy employment. Even now I find
               it necessary to abstain from reading many things because there is not time for it.
               Did my ways &amp; means afford it, I would give up the Quarterly for the same reason,
               tho <span class="ital">there</span> it is that I am best paid &amp; that I obtain most reputation. – so ill are these rewards
               apportioned in our present state of things! – But it cannot be doubted that it is
               better to write even such miscellanies as these, than to employ the same time in cataloguing,
               &amp; three hours a day throughout the year, is nearly if not entirely as much as the
               Review &amp; the Register cost me. Granted that a few years would get thro the Catalogue
               I have not a few years to spare. – You know what a series of historical <span class="strikethrough">work</span> &lt;labour&gt; lies before me, – if it be compleated it will place me far above all the
               historians whom this country has produced, &amp; I must not let any thing which can be
               avoided impede the completion, from this time forward.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am of course strongly attached to this place of residence, – which you would not
               wonder at if you had seen it. Nevertheless a less lovely country would satisfy me,
               but it must be country, for my own sake &amp; that of the children. I cannot bear to confine
               either them or myself within the walls of London. As for the Mus. Gardens &amp; such other
               places they would be to us like a sod to <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;a&gt; Lark in a cage.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I would willingly come nearer to you, so as to be within an easy days distance, &amp;
               to this I look forward. The first term of my lease expires in five years. perhaps
               by that time it may be in my power to remove. Meantime however a yearly journey for
               myself is nothing. A month in town &amp; a week in travelling I can well spare.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am very much obliged both to <span class="strikethrough">xxx </span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a>. Had not you been so near London the decision would have cost me nothing. As it is
               – I wish the choice had not been offered – because it costs me as much disquietude
               thus to have decided.</p>
