               <div class="l">The mansion whitherward they went, was one</div>
               <div class="l">Which in his youth Theodofred had built;</div>
               <div class="l">Thither had he brought home in happy hour</div>
               <div class="l">His blooming bride, there fondled on his knee</div>
               <div class="l">The lovely boy she bore him. Close beside</div>
               <div class="l">A temple to that Saint he reard, who first,</div>
               <div class="l">As old tradition tells, proclaim’d to Spain</div>
               <div class="l">The gospel tidings, – &amp; in health &amp; youth</div>
               <div class="l">There, mindful of mortality, he saw</div>
               <div class="l">His sepulchre prepared. Witiza seiz’d</div>
               <div class="l">For his adulterous leman &amp; himself</div>
               <div class="l">The stately pile; but to that sepulchre</div>
               <div class="l">When from captivity &amp; darkness death</div>
               <div class="l">Enlarged him, was Theodofred consign’d,</div>
               <div class="l">For that unhappy woman, wasting then</div>
               <div class="l">Beneath a mortal malady, at heart</div>
               <div class="l">Was smitten, &amp; the tyrant at her prayer</div>
               <div class="l">This poor &amp; tardy restitution made.</div>
               <div class="l">Soon the repentant sinner followed him,</div>
               <div class="l">And calling on Pelayo ere she died,</div>
               <div class="l">For his own wrongs &amp; for his fathers death</div>
               <div class="l">Implor’d forgiveness of her absent child,</div>
               <div class="l">If it were possible he could forgive</div>
               <div class="l">Crimes black as hers, she said: &amp; by the pangs</div>
               <div class="l">Of her remorse, by her last agonies,</div>
               <div class="l">The unutterable horrors of her death,</div>
               <div class="l">And by the blood of Jesus on the Cross</div>
               <div class="l">For sinners given, did she beseech his prayers</div>
               <div class="l">In aid of her most miserable soul.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus mingling sudden shrieks with hopeless vows,</div>
               <div class="l">And uttering franticly Pelayo’s name,</div>
               <div class="l">And crying out for mercy in despair,</div>
               <div class="l">Here had she made her dreadful end, &amp; here</div>
               <div class="l">Her wretched body was deposited.</div>
               <div class="l">That presence seem’d to desecrate the place:</div>
               <div class="l">Thenceforth the Usurper shunnd it, with the heart</div>
               <div class="l">Of conscious guilt; nor could Rusilla bear</div>

               <div class="l">One day of “bitter &amp; severe delight”</div>
               <div class="l">When Roderick came for vengeance, she endur’d,</div>
               <div class="l">And then for ever left her bridal halls.</div>

               <div class="l">Oh when I last beheld this princely pile,</div>
               <div class="l">Exclaim d Siverian, with what other thoughts</div>
               <div class="l">Full, &amp; elate of spirit did I pass</div>
               <div class="l">Its joyous gates! The weedery which thro</div>
               <div class="l">The interstices of its neglected courts</div>
               <div class="l">In rank luxuriance waved its idle head</div>
               <div class="l">Then underneath the feet of thronging crowds</div>
               <div class="l">Was trampled down. Here drawn in fair array</div>
               <div class="l">The faithfull vassals of my masters house,</div>
               <div class="l">Their javelins sparkling to the morning sun,</div>
               <div class="l">Spread their triumphant banners: high-plumd helm</div>
               <div class="l">Rose oer the martial ranks; &amp; prancing steeds</div>
               <div class="l">Made answer to the trumpets stirring voice;</div>
               <div class="l">While yonder towers shook the dull silence off</div>
               <div class="l">Which long to their deserted walls had clung,</div>
               <div class="l">And with redoubling echoes swelld the shout</div>
               <div class="l">That hail’d victorious Roderick. Louder rose</div>
               <div class="l">The acclamation when the dust was seen</div>
               <div class="l">Rising beneath his chariot wheels, far off;</div>
               <div class="l">But nearer as the youthful hero came,</div>
               <div class="l">All sounds of all the multitude were hush’d,</div>
               <div class="l">And from the thousands &amp; ten thousands here,</div>
               <div class="l">Whom Cordoba &amp; Hispelis sent <span class="strikethrough">out</span> forth –</div>
               <div class="l">Yea whom all Betica, all Spain pourd out</div>
               <div class="l">To greet his triumph, not a whisper rose</div>
               <div class="l">To heaven, – such awe &amp; reverence mastered them</div>
               <div class="l">Such expectation held them motionless.</div>
               <div class="l">Conqueror &amp; King he came, but with no joy</div>
               <div class="l">Of conquest, &amp; no pride of sovereignty</div>
               <div class="l">That day displayd, for at his fathers grave</div>
               <div class="l">Did Roderick come to offer up his vow</div>
               <div class="l">Of vengeance well performd. Three coal black steeds</div>
               <div class="l">Drew on his ivory chariot… By his side</div>
               <div class="l">Still wrapt in mourning for the long deceasd</div>
               <div class="l">Rusilla sate; a deeper paleness blanchd</div>
               <div class="l">Her faded countenance, but in her eye</div>
               <div class="l">The light of her majestic nature shone.</div>
               <div class="l">Bound, &amp; expecting at their hands the death</div>
               <div class="l">So well deserved, the Tyrant followed them;</div>
               <div class="l">Aghast &amp; trembling first he gazed around</div>
               <div class="l">Wildly from side to side, then from the face</div>
               <div class="l">Of universal execration shrunk,</div>
               <div class="l">Hanging his wretched head abasd &amp; poor</div>
               <div class="l">Of spirit with unmanly tears deplord</div>
               <div class="l">His fortune, not his crimes. With bolder front</div>
               <div class="l">Confiding in the priestly character</div>
               <div class="l">Came Orphas next; &amp; then the spurious race</div>
               <div class="l">Whom in unhappy hour Favilas wife</div>
               <div class="l">Brought forth for Spain. O mercy ill bestowd</div>
               <div class="l">When Roderick in compassion for their youth</div>
               <div class="l">And for Pelayo’s sake forebore to crush</div>
               <div class="l">The brood of vipers!”</div>
               <div class="l">“Err perchance he might</div>
               <div class="l">Replied the Goth, suppressing as he spake</div>
               <div class="l">All signs of outward grief, tho every word</div>
               <div class="l">Went like a dagger to his bleeding heart, –</div>

               <div class="l">But not for this wouldst thou reproach the King.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Reproach him! cried Siverian. I reproach</div>
               <div class="l">My child, my noble boy – whom every tongue</div>

               <div class="l">Brave, beautiful &amp; generous as he was,</div>
               <div class="l">Never so brave, so beautiful, so great</div>
               <div class="l">As now! Not even on that glorious day</div>
               <div class="l">When in the field of victory, elevate</div>
               <div class="l">Amid the thousands who acclaimd him King,</div>
               <div class="l">Firm on the shield above their heads upraisd</div>
               <div class="l">Erect he stood, &amp; waved his bloody sword. – </div>
               <div class="l">Why dost thou shake thy head as if in doubt?</div>
               <div class="l">I do not dream, or fable. Ten short years</div>
               <div class="l">Have scarcely past away, since all within</div>
               <div class="l">The Pyrenæan hills &amp; the three seas</div>
               <div class="l">Which girdle Spain, echoed in one response</div>
               <div class="l">The acclamation from that field of fight.</div>
               <div class="l">– Or doth aught ail thee that thy body quakes</div>
               <div class="l">And shudders thus?</div>
               <div class="l">Tis but a chill, replied</div>
               <div class="l">The King, in passing from the open air</div>
               <div class="l">Under the shadow of this thick-set grove.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Oh if this scene awoke in thee such thoughts</div>

               <div class="l">Sunshine or shade, &amp; all things from without</div>
               <div class="l">Would be alike indifferent. – Gracious God</div>
               <div class="l">Only but ten short years &amp; all ‘so changed’,</div>
               <div class="l">Ten little years since in yon court he checkd</div>
               <div class="l">His fiery steeds! The steeds obeyd his hand,</div>

               <div class="l">In their deep silence, open-eard, the sound</div>
               <div class="l">With slower movement from the ivory seat</div>
               <div class="l">Rusilla rose, her arm as down she stept</div>
               <div class="l">Extended to her sons supporting hand,</div>

               <div class="l">But that the feelings of that solemn hour</div>
               <div class="l">Subdued her then, &amp; tears deceivd her sight.</div>
               <div class="l">Howbeit when to her husbands grave she came,</div>
               <div class="l">On the sepulchral stone she bowd her head</div>
               <div class="l">Awhile, then rose collectedly, &amp; fix’d</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the scene her calm &amp; steady eye.</div>

               <div class="l">So beautiful, so noble, so august, –</div>
               <div class="l">Or vengeance, when did it put on before</div>
               <div class="l">A character so aweful, so divine? –</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick stood up, &amp; reaching to the tomb</div>
               <div class="l">His hands, my hero cried, “Theodofred,</div>
               <div class="l">Father, I stand before thee once again,</div>
               <div class="l">According to thy prayer when kneeling down</div>
               <div class="l">Between thy knees I took my last farewell</div>

               <div class="l">Even from thee she did not seek to hide</div>
               <div class="l">That if our cruel parting should avail</div>
               <div class="l">To save me from the Tyrants jealous guilt</div>
               <div class="l">Surely should my avenging arm fulfill</div>
               <div class="l">What’eer he omened. Oh that Time, I cried</div>
               <div class="l">Would give the strength of manhood to this arm</div>
               <div class="l">Already would it find a manly heart</div>
               <div class="l">To guide it to its purpose! And I swore</div>

               <div class="l">And highest God whose justice slumbereth not</div>
               <div class="l">I made the vow. – According to thy prayer</div>

               <div class="l">The dastards chains were heard, link against link</div>
               <div class="l">Clinking. At length upon his knees he fell</div>
