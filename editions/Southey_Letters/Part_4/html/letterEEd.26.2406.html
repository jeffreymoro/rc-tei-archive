                           However, members of the Royal Family and their servants were exempt. Southey is asking

                  </div> is perfectly just. I had felt it myself, &amp; yet neither liked to strike out the line,
                  nor change its position, – this latter however is now done, &amp; if it does not please

               <p>In the interview with Rusilla you seem to have overlooked what is expressly stated,
                  that the presence of Florinda prevents Roderick from making himself known, &amp; what
                  follows also, (tho it is not expressed,) that the same cause would prevent Rusilla
                  from openly recognizing him, <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> if she should discover him. With this in your mind, you will not feel that the dog
                  interrupts any expected discovery. The specific purpose of the scene is to prepare
                  for what is to follow respecting Julian. I totally dissent from your objection to
                  Rodericks exclamation which concludes the book; – no reproach was intended in it,
                  – it is a speech of pure self-reflecting anguish, – <span class="strikethrough">not</span> referring not to those who did not know him, but to himself who was so changed as
                  not to be known. Remember also that instinct is unerring.

                  </div> – In Ulysses any exclamation would have been out of character – he sheds tears. Rodericks
                  feelings must necessarily be much stronger. One might object to Homer that a dog which
                  was not full grown when his Master went away, would <span class="ital">not</span> recognize him after twenty years. I certainly believe he would not. That the death
                  of Argus is overstrained. Dogs will die of grief beyond all doubt, &amp; cats also have
                  been known to pine after their <span class="strikethrough">owne</span> owners; but to die of joy implies a <span class="strikethrough">degree</span> &lt;kind&gt; of feeling above the faculty of brutes. One might object also to the description
                  of the dog as descending to loathsome objects, &amp; especially one might object that
                  Penelope Telemachus Eumæus &amp; every body else who loved Ulysses should been so unmindful
                  of the old proverb Love me love my dog, – which Rusilla &amp; Siverian, as you will see,
                  have religiously observed.
