                           Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 30 October 1814, Letter 2494. Southey had enrolled in Gray’s
                           Inn on 7 February 1797 with the intention of qualifying as a lawyer, but had abandoned
                           his legal studies on his return from Portugal in 1801. Presumably, he had forgotten
                           to inform Gray’s Inn and was still registered as ‘absent’. The last term he attempted
                           to keep was probably in May 1799.</span></div>
                  </div> which I will beg you to &lt;correct if needful, &amp; then to&gt; seal &amp; forward it. I do not
                  believe that I was indebted for any Term at Grays Inn; <span class="strikethrough">to the best of my recollection</span> the last time I was in the Hall I kept no term, &amp; for this reason, – a new regulation
                  had been made that three dinners must be eaten instead of one. In intended conformity
                  to this rule I had laid out my time, &amp; secured my place for Bristol in the mail; on
                  the third night <span class="strikethrough">of</span> from the commencement of the term. But on going into the Hall the first day I was
                  informed that the three dinners must be eaten in as many half weeks. It did not suit
                  me to alter my arrangements – &amp; lose my place – I preferred losing the term, &amp; especially
                  enquired at the time whether any expences would be acquired, – as I had not yet committed
                  the act of eating, when I was assured not. And I therefore left the Hall, with a distinct
                  understanding that that term was not kept, &amp; not chargeable. – I do not think this
                  could have been later than May, – &amp; perhaps could ascertain the point by reference
                  to some letters, – but 1–15–8 – is not worth the trouble of a dispute.</p>
