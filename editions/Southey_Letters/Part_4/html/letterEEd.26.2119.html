               <p>I am casting about in my mind how to get payment remitted to you, – which I believe
                  cannot very well be done in the manner you recommend, Edinburgh-men having no London
                  bankers. Had you thought of taking the draft to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> or to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> I think there would have been no difficulty. Indeed I found none in negociating a
                  bill upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</a> when last in London myself, – nor in remitting one to a larger amount on a former
                  occasion. However by some means or other the money shall speedily be sent.

                  not be here when he arrives to show him such attentions as may be in my power. The
