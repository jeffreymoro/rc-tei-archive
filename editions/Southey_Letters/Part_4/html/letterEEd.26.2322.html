He has turned up once more, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> having recognised him among a company of strollers in Wales, by his likeness to me:
                  To his other imprudencies he has added that of marrying, the most venial however of
                  all, &amp; that which offers the only chance of steadying him. My business at Chelsea
                  is to make out the history &amp; character of his wife, – a necessary measure before I
                  can determine in what manner to attempt to serve them. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</a> abode stands conveniently for me to dine at after this quest.</p>
