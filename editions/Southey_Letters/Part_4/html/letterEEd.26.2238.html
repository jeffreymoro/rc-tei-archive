            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your project of a View of the World has hardly been out of my thoughts since the receipt
                  of your letter. I meant in the Life of George 3. to have given a summary account of
                  the state of all those countries over which the influence of G Britain extends &lt;or
                  with which its political history was in any degree connected&gt;.

                           United Kingdom 1820–1830; DNB) were written.</span></div>
                  </div> My plan may perhaps be the better for having its object limited.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I was at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a> table when the scheme of his Collection of Voyages &amp; Travels was first suggested:
                  &amp; I was asked to undertake it. This I declined upon the ground that it required that
                  sort of scientific knowledge which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurneyJames">Cap<sup>t</sup> Burney</a> possesses, &amp; of which I knew nothing, – but at his desire I wrote to him upon the
                  subject, showing in what manner, according to my judgement, such a collection ought
                  to be formed. First I proposed a geographical arrangement; – then that the best accounts
                  of the respective regions, should be printed entire, in chronological order, &amp; the
                  great mass of inferior works brought to elucidate them in the form of notes &amp; appendices;
                  Thus giving the whole substance of the great standard works, &amp; the whole essence of
                  all the others. – You see what a disgraceful <span class="strikethrough">work</span> &lt;job&gt; Pinkerton has made of it! If the titles of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> different voyages had been put in a bag, &amp; he had drawn them out by lottery to the
                  amount of the quantity required, the probability is that the Collection would rather
                  have been better than worse.

            <p class="indent1">What you propose I clearly comprehend. Not a mere compilation, but a work which might
               live, &amp; which the character of the authors mind should prevade so as to individualize
               &amp; appropriate it: – A view of the world as it is, with references enough to what it
               has been for all purposes of elucidation. <span class="ital">Magnum opus</span>; – an <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> undertaking of great labour, but of proportionate delight. No man has ever taken
               more interest than I have done <span class="strikethrough">into</span> &lt;in&gt; looking &lt;back&gt; into the history of the human race, or in looking forward to
               their amelioration, &amp; collecting the light of the past as in the focus of a mirror
               to fling it before me <span class="strikethrough">into</span> that I may see into the future. I have therefore a great capital <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> to begin upon, – few men, if any can have more, for this peculiar kind of knowledge
               has for more than twenty years been my favourite pursuit. I have many good materials,
               some of the best, &amp; not a few rare ones. Still there would be many to seek.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You seem to guess well at the extent, &amp; to go to the extent in your estimate. Concerning
               the form, that which would carry with it most appearance of respectability would be
               best; because a work which may at first be taken for a mere piece of patchwork, ought
               to make some pretensions at its outset; – the first half dozen pages would overcome
               all prejudice of this kind. Prints would be indispensable, – <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> the views &lt;might perhaps best be&gt; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> given in outline, the costume in colours, &amp; the natural history in wood for head
               &amp; tail pieces.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The arrangement of the subject will form itself in my mind long before there will
                  be any necessity for beginning upon it. For this &amp; the life of George 3 must not go
                  on <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> together: – one at a time will be as much as I can manage with the great series of
                  my Portugueze histories,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> &amp; my poems, – of which I should always wish to have one in hand. I shall not <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> see you as I expected <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> in May, – nor before the close of the year. It would be vexatious to arrive in London
                  just when every body is leaving it, &amp; I cannot get from home before this would be
                  the case. Perhaps therefore you will, at your convenience, let me know how far the
                  plan which you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CadellThomas">Cadell &amp; Davies</a> have meditated, accords with mine, that we may see whether they had better be kept
                  separate, or made to agree. What I propose is not the history of the Age, – but the <span class="strikethrough">spirit</span> &lt;philosophy&gt; of that history: having all the result of research but none of the form
                  of it; – <span class="strikethrough">xxx counts only of xxx xx</span> dealing rather with causes &amp; consequences than with events, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; using</span> culling the flow of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> events to illustrate, &amp; elucidate, &amp; enhance &amp; adorn &amp; extracting their essential
                  spirit to be the life of the book. – There is one reason why the view of the world
                  (this title would not do for it) seems entitled to precedence in order of time, &amp;
                  that is that the Age of George 3 is not yet at an end. Perhaps the ensuing campaign
                  may bring with it the consummation so devoutly to be wished for. If Alexander had
                  reestablished Poland as a kingdom I should have had little anxiety for the result:
                  not having done this I fear that France is as certain of finding strength there, as
                  Alexander is in Germany.
