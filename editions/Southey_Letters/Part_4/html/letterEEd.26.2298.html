                  </div> Its contents were not altogether unexpected, &amp; having half-anticipated such a result
                  I had given the <span class="strikethrough">subject</span> &lt;matter&gt; its due consideration.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Twenty years ago when I had a reputation to win it would have been easy for me to
               furnish odes upon demand on any subject. This is no longer the case. I should go to
               the task like a school boy, with reluctance &amp; a sense of incapacity for executing
               it well; <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> &lt;but&gt; unless I could so perform it as to give credit to the office, certain it is
               that the office could give none to me.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But if these periodical exhibitions were dispensed with, &amp; I were left to write upon
               great events, or, to be silent, according as the spirit moved, I should then thankfully
               accept the office as a mark of honourable distinction, which it would then become.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I write thus to you; not as proposing terms to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a>, an impropriety of which I should be fully aware, but as to a friend who has more
               than once shown me acts of kindness which I had no reason to expect, &amp; by whose advice
               I would be guided.</p>
            <p class="indent1">On Monday I will <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxxx</span> enquire at the Admiralty if you be at leisure.</p>
