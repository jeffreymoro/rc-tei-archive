               <div class="salute">My dear friend</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I ought ere this to have replied to your last letter. I was from home when it arrived,
               on a weeks visit to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, &amp; there it followed me. You know my employments, – but not my dissipations, which
               in a very natural process multiply to rob me of time as time becomes more valuable.
               From June to November this place is any thing rather than a retirement. The task of
               tuition also, tho managed with as little fatigue as possible, occupies daily an hour
               &amp; half, which, tho I read by snatches even then, is lost to regular employment.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As soon as I returned from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RydalMount">Rydale</a> I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">G Coleridge</a>, &amp; have received from him as satisfactory a reply as could be expected or desired,
                  tho much yet remains to be adjusted.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> He proposes to my consideration, two plans, – which indeed he would leave to my choice.
                  1. That of obtaining for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> the situation of Bible Clerk
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Bible Clerks were students at Oxford University who received benefits such as reduced
                           fees or free meals in return for performing certain tasks, such as reading aloud chapters
                           from the Bible at meals or in chapel. The term had come into use in preference to
                           that of Servitor, as the duties attached to this office had, in the past, included
                           acting as a servant to other students and wearing a distinctive plain black gown and
                           round hat.</span></div>
                  </div> at one of the Oxford Colleges, where the emoluments are very considerable: to this
                  he states &amp; strongly feels two objections: that the person holding such a situation
                  is actually, tho not by any statute, disqualified from gaining a fellowship in the
                  same college, custom, &amp; probably the want of respectability of character in the Bible
                  Clerks to rise above their situation, having established this bar: – &amp; that tho there
                  is no difference in the dress (as among the Servitors) still there is a practical
                  degradation attached to the office – men who hold it being rarely or difficultly admitted
                  into the society of the commoners. This objection is doubtless felt the more strongly
                  because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> has <span class="strikethrough">in</span> so many cousins who are so well known &amp; stand so high in the University, &amp; has undoubtedly
                  on that account the more force. 2<sup>dly</sup> He says that it might be preferable to send him as an independent member notwithstanding
                  the additional expence; &amp; at the expiration of two years, if the immediate college
                  prospects were not promising, place him somewhere as an Usher; where from the emoluments
                  of his situation he might support himself, &amp; keep annually one or two terms, till
                  he had compleated the number requisite for his degree, &amp; for admission into Orders.
                  To effect this he says that if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeaumontLadyMary">Lady Beaumont</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PooleThomas">Poole</a> would advance all that they offered for four years, in the space of two there would
                  then be 80 £ per year, which the Ottery family would double, making thus 160 £. –
                  I incline to this latter plan, – because I have great hopes that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> will make friends at College, as he has never failed to do every where else, which
                  will make his success certain there; – &amp; because if College Prospects fails, he cannot
                  be made independent too soon, nor subject to the discipline of self controul too early.
                  But I wait to see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> before I reply to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">G Coleridge</a>; &amp; <span class="strikethrough">I</span> am in daily expectation of him. Meantime my poor old friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> has offered an annual five guineas toward this object: &amp; if it be necessary, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> will contribute 20 £. per year.

               had traditionally provided the Poet Laureate with a tierce of canary wine, as a supplement
               to his salary. The wine had been converted into an annual sum of £27, but this was

               upset the long-established export of Portuguese wine to Britain in exchange for textiles.
               British merchants who were Catholics were not allowed to join the British Factory
