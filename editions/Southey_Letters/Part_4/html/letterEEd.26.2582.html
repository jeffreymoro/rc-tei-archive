                  </div> are both exceedingly well written: in great part of both I agree with you, and where
                  I do not, still I admire both the manner and spirit. My attachment to the Established
                  Church, in preference to any other existing form of Christianity, is not founded in
                  bigotry or in prejudice; for, though I conform to it, I do not subscribe to its articles,
                  and am thereby precluded from being (what otherwise I should most ardently desire
                  to be) one of its ministers. You are wrong in thinking that our cathedral service
                  is inferior to that of the mass-book. The cathedral service you feel to be solemn;
                  who indeed can fail to feel it so? But it would be impossible for you not to see that
                  the mass is a mummery, and not to feel, if you reflected upon what was going on, that
                  it is gross and monstrous idolatry. I have seen it performed before the Court of Portugal,
                  and the only thing which I could have borrowed from it was its incense. P. 345: Sir

                  </div> There is frequently a fine conception of the old chivalrous character, and almost
                  always a strength and vividness in the outline which he offers you. Lord Byron’s faults
                  are to me far worse than Scott’s, and they are likely to produce a much worse effect
                  upon the herd of imitative writers. It is a clumsy mode of narration to give you the
                  characters of men by describing them, instead of letting the character describe itself
                  in the course of the story; but strip one of Lord Byron’s poems of these descriptions,
                  and what remains? The fable is a mere nothing; and the characters themselves are incongruous

                  she has so long and so mercilessly inflicted upon other countries; that the generation

                  which I verily believe to be a guiltier city than even Rome or Constantinople, will
                  be made a signal example of the vengeance of God and man. I wish I could feel the
                  same confidence respecting the state of things at home; but the more I reflect upon
                  the changes that have taken place within my own remembrance, and upon the principles
