                  </div> than at its marketable value. What that may be is extremely doubtful, – more, probably,
                  for a philosophical work than a political one, – more for a religious one than either.
                  There are two ways of proceeding in such a business, – either to publish it by subscription,
                  or to offer it to the booksellers. If the owner has some active friends who would
                  bestir themselves in good earnest to collect names for him, the former would be the
                  best plan, because should the book prove of any permanent value, the property remains
                  with him. But unless a couple of thousand subscribers could be procured, (which would
                  require the exertions of several zealous friends) the latter plan is preferable, for
                  I think the booksellers would be likely to give as much as could be gained by an edition
                  of 1500 copies. Suppose you were to put the MSS. in your pocket, &amp; call upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> with it, – he knows something of these things &amp; will shew it to the booksellers. Were
                  I upon the spot I would gladly do this. Or if you think proper to see them yourself, <span class="strikethrough">no intro</span> tho no introduction can be necessary upon a matter of business, my name if you like
                  to make use of it, will serve as one both at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a> house, &amp; at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</a>. There is a publisher who would perhaps bid higher for it than either, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PhillipsRichard">Sir Richard Phillips</a>; – he would sell half an edition by mere dint of puffing. But if your friend thinks
                  proper to go to him, – let him remember that he is dealing with one of the most accomplished
                  rogues in his majestys dominions. – Whatever is done I should recommend that a slip
                  of paper simply stating that such a work is in existence should be left at Sir Richards
                  for announcement in the Monthly Magazine. This will cost only the trouble of writing
                  the memorandum, – the notice will be widely diffused, &amp; copied in other journals,
                  &amp; the expectation raised will benefit the sale of the work, &amp; perhaps (very probably
                  indeed) produce an overture from Sir Richard; – now the knowledge of what he would
                  give for it would be of advantage <span class="strikethrough">wh</span> if it were thought better to offer it to other publishers.</p>
