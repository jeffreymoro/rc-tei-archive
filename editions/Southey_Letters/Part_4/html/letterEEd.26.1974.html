               free, extremely small parochial rates, a lease for 21 years, but after the first ten,
               a rise of four shillings per acre. Many thousands of land to be inclosed at 3/shillings
               for the first 10 years, six for the remaining, – a rail now forming within a mile
               along a level to the market-town – lime &amp; marl on the estate, &amp; underwood sufficient
               for all the new inclosures, which will be given. I hope to get a scientific tenant
               for about 1600 acres. He shall have every encouragement, but he should have 6 or 7000£.”</p>
            <p class="indent1">There are his words. Should your brother think it worth while to write, his address
