               <p>The last four lines of your note, Senhora, are all that could have been wished, &amp;
                  all that should have been said; – but I am far too desirous of seeing things return
                  to their former course to dwell upon any expression in the former part, however improper
                  I may think them &amp; however much I may wish they had not been there. – A chance meeting
                  would at any moment have set all to rights, &amp; this was so likely that it seemed the
                  wisest &amp; the easiest way to wait for it. The chapter of accidents turned out unluckily,
                  but for this no person is blameable.

               <p>I should have written this last night, but the post brought me a letter from poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> telling me [he] had broken a blood-vessel, that the haemorrhage continues &amp; that he
                  did not expect to recover.

                  is upon me night &amp; day, &amp; even when the wound is healed I shall feel the loss like
