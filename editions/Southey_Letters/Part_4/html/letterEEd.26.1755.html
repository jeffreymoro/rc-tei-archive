               <p>Upon looking over the printed sheets of the Register when they arrived the other day,
                  I discovered an interpolation of the Editor (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</a>) by which he had made me subscribe to an eulogium upon M<sup>r</sup> Pitt.

                  him to cancel the leaf. – a requisition which was immediately complied with &amp; in a
                  way to atone as much as possible for the liberty which had been taken. It is rather
                  a melancholy thing to perceive by what an accident the political character of this
                  book (which will have a circulation beyond any thing of the kind that has ever yet
                  appeared) has been determined. The person engaged for the historical part was a downright
                  courtling &amp; Pittite. I suspect it to have been young Rose,
