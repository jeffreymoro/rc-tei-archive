            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your manuscript reached me this evening.

                           Roberts had asked Hogg and Paul Moon James to prepare an edition of his works for
                           the benefit of his family.</span></div>
                  </div> I have perused it carefully, &amp; not with the less interest because <span class="strikethrough">its contents we</span> the matter of its contents was already familiar to me. You have done me the honour
                  to ask me to criticize it, a task which is easily performed. The alterations which
                  appear to me desirable are few &amp; very easily made. I would omit the letter of Oct
                  16. 1799. – because there is nothing remarkable in it, – it cannot be noticed for
                  commendation, &amp; it might be selected for censure by any evil natured critic. In mentioning
                  my poor old friend Charles Fox something should be added to specify who he was, –
                  this is particularly necessary on account of his name.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s concern was that the Bristol-based orientalist Charles Fox (c. 1740–1809;
                           DNB) was not confused with the politician of the same name, Charles James Fox (1749–1806;
                           DNB).</span></div>
                  </div> Only one thing more remains to be mentioned, – the paper in which the poems are bequeathed
                  for publication should assuredly be inserted in the text, not added as a note. It
                  is exceedingly affecting, &amp; should form part of the narrative, for I am sure nothing
                  else in the volume will make so deep an impression. Every body will love <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobertsWilliamIsaac">Roberts</a>, every body will regret him, every body will, or ought to, acknowledge the promise
                  of excellence which his poems display, – but it is this will which will individualize
                  him in the memory of the reader.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I have obtained a few <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> &lt;additional&gt; names for the subscription, &amp; am in expectation of more.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The expressions which have been objected to <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> seem to me I must frankly declare, to be objectionable; because if strictly interpreted
               they bear the meaning imputed to them. I think also that your narrative might advantageously
               be lengthened by incorporating with it such parts of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JamesPaulMoon">M<sup>r</sup> James’s</a> as convey any additional facts or information, – if my recollection does not deceive
               me it may &lt;thus&gt; be considerably increased both in extent &amp; interest. Of such a youth
               as your deceased friend, the more that can be communicated the better.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I thank you for the book which accompanied the memoir.
