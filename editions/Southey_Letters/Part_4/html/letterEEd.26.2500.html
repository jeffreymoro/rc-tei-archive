               <p>The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">General</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">Dr. Bell</a> were dining with me yesterday when your letter arrived, and they did not leave me
                  till after ten o’clock; this was unfortunate, as it prevented me from immediately
                  writing to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteJames">James</a>. I have written to him by this day’s post, endeavouring, as far as I could, to convince
                  him that the degree, and not the honour, is the essential object of his studies; that
                  such honours are not worth much in the University, and worth nothing anywhere else;
                  and that the opinion of what he <span class="ital">could</span> have done, if he had attempted it, will be of as much use to him as an actual honour,
                  in case of taking pupils, or standing for a fellowship: which I verily believe.

                  </div> In a soldier, the want of presence of mind is disgraceful and criminal, because he
                  has entered a profession which makes weakness a crime; yet even in a soldier some
                  degree of compassion (out of his profession) usually attaches itself to the consideration
                  of this failing; and in other men I am not sure that it does not in some degree compensate
                  for the inconvenience which it occasions, by exciting an interest in considerate and
                  kindly natures. I have written to him sportively as well as seriously and endeavoured
                  to put him in good humour with himself. If his health is not permanently injured,
                  there is no real injury sustained. I have an absolute hatred of this stimulating system;
                  it is equally injurious to mind and body, and but too often fatal to both. Better
                  was the old sleepy course of things at Oxford, under which men were left to themselves
                  to do just what they pleased and nothing more.</p>

               <p>What shall I say about your present? I could be angry with you if anger had any effect

                  one, was no small proof of virtue; the rest, however, were mutinous, and, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs. Coleridge</a> putting herself at the head of the mutineers, they succeeded. They agreed among themselves
                  that I was not to be told what each of them had received, but that they were to surprise
                  me in the morning; and, accordingly, I was beset in the very act of shaving. “Here,
                  Pappa! here, Pappa! – only look at mine,” cries one; “Look at mine,” cries another. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> brings his books, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</a> her box, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bel</a>, jumping for joy in the midst of them, told me that “ Mitter White sent her a deal
                  of pretty things in a <span class="ital">boss</span>!” I cut myself, of course, in all this confusion; and the father and children with
                  their treasures, and the razor, and the lather, and just blood enough to give effect
                  to the scene, would have made a good comic picture. But indeed, Neville, you are too
                  bountiful.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I hope you will see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother Harry</a> frequently, now you have been fellow-travellers among the mountains. He has a thoroughly
               good heart of his own, an admirable temper, and, with very considerable talents, a
               larger portion of practical good sense than has fallen to my lot, – one of those men
               whom you love and respect the more the better you know him. You will be glad to hear
               that he is likely to give me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">a new sister</a>, – a very interesting woman, whose <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GonneMrs">mother</a> I have known nineteen years, and always considered as the model of whatever is most
               lovely and excellent in womankind. They were a Lisbon family, but for some years past
               have lived at Champion Hill. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GonneWilliam">father</a> has long been lingering in a slow consumption, from which there is little or no hope
               of his recovery. In point of fortune the connection, on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry’s</a> part, is exactly what I should wish it to be – neither ambitious nor imprudent.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am charged with more thanks for you than would have filled this whole sheet; and
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bel</a>, moreover, says she “will send you a kiss.” Imagine, therefore, all joyful expressions
               of thankfulness from the young, and all warm thanks and affectionate remembrances
               from the elders. God bless you.</p>
