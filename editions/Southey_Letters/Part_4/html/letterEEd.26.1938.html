            <p class="indent1">I saw <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</a> yesterday, – he had been talking with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KnightonSirWilliam">D<sup>r</sup> Knighton</a> (I think that was the name) &amp; the opinion which he had formed respecting your intended
               change of situation agreed entirely with <span class="strikethrough">what</span> mine. Of your succeeding in London there can be little doubt, but you must be prepared
               to live two or three years without practise. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</a> expects to starve two years in the city; his prospect is more certain than yours,
               &amp; you cannot reckon upon a shorter apprenticeship. The course therefore for you to
               pursue is obvious; save enough where you are, to meet the expenditure of two barren
               years, &amp; then you may remove securely. I am well aware that what <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxxxx as</span> &lt;was to be wished was&gt; an immediate removal, but this was utterly impossible <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxxxxx xx</span> when it was most desirable.</p>
