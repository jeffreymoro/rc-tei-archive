                  loss of youthful thoughts and hopes. In the last six weeks he has lost two children
                  – one of them <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthThomas">a fine boy</a> of seven years old.

                  </div> – that God takes from us those we love as hostages for our faith (if I may so express
                  myself), – and that to those who look to a reunion in a better world, where there
                  shall be no separation, and no mutability except that which results from perpetual
                  progressiveness, the evening becomes more delightful than the morning, and the sunset
                  offers brighter and lovelier visions than those which we build up in the morning clouds,
                  and which disappear before the strength of the day. The older I grow – and I am older
                  in feeling than in years – the more I am sensible of this: there is a precious alchemy
                  in this faith, which transmutes grief into joy, or, rather, it is the true and heavenly
                  euphrasy which clears away the film from our mortal sight, and makes affliction appear
                  what, in reality, it is to the wise and good, – a dispensation of mercy.</p>
