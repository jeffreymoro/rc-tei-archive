               <p>I found your letter here yesterday, too late to answer it. And I cannot answer it
                  in the proper manner till I can get a stamp from town. I will then send you a draft
                  on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</a>. As things stand there is no doubt in my mind, but that it will be duly paid. You
