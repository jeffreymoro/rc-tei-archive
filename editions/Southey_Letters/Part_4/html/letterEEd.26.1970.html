            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Twas in the grey of morning; soon the sun,</div>
               <div class="l">Rising above Albardos, pourd his light</div>
               <div class="l">Over the forest, &amp; with ray aslant</div>
               <div class="l">Entering its depth, illumed the branchless pines,</div>
               <div class="l">Brightend their bark, tinged with a redder hue</div>
               <div class="l">Its rusty stains, &amp; cast along the floor</div>
               <div class="l">Long lines of shadow, where they rose erect</div>
               <div class="l">Like pillars of the temple. With slow foot</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick pursued his way, for penitence,</div>
               <div class="l">Remorse which gave no respite, &amp; the long</div>
               <div class="l">And painful conflict of his troubled soul</div>
               <div class="l">Had worn him down: now brighter thoughts had risen,</div>
               <div class="l">And that triumphant vision floated still</div>
               <div class="l">Before his sight, with all her blazonry,</div>
               <div class="l">Her towered helm, &amp; the victorious sword</div>
               <div class="l">Which flashd like lightning over the field of blood:</div>
               <div class="l">Thus musing as he went, the distant cry</div>
               <div class="l">Of horn, &amp; hound, &amp; huntsmans loud halloo,</div>
               <div class="l">Brake on his ear. Twas the first living voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of man which he had heard since he beheld</div>
               <div class="l">Romanos lips while blessing him, break off</div>
               <div class="l">The faltering prayer, &amp; fall for ever fixd:</div>
               <div class="l">And started at the sound, his heart in fear</div>
               <div class="l">A moment stopt, then throbbd with quicker spring.</div>
               <div class="l">Nearer the clamour came, with louder shout,</div>
               <div class="l">And broader blast of horn, &amp; deeper cry,</div>
               <div class="l">And tramp of thundering hoofs; anon the stag</div>
               <div class="l">Bursts full in view, the huntsmen close behind</div>
               <div class="l">Press on his flight, a turbaned company,</div>
               <div class="l">And lo the Moorish javelin gores his flank.</div>
               <div class="l">Yet a few paces with convulsive bound</div>
               <div class="l">He sprung, then dropt at Rodericks feet; his eyes</div>
               <div class="l">Were turnd on him, &amp; at that look of death.</div>
               <div class="l">And at his dying sobs, as at a sound</div>
               <div class="l">Of human agony, the fallen Goth</div>
               <div class="l">Shuddered; to him they seem’d to speak reproach,</div>
               <div class="l">Stinging reproach &amp; shame; &amp; as he shrunk</div>
               <div class="l">And hid himself from sight within the wood.</div>
               <div class="l">“Caitiff!” his inward soul upbraided him,</div>
               <div class="l">“Wretch that thou art, the Misbelievers take</div>
               <div class="l">“This pastime in thy land! the innocent beast</div>
               <div class="l">“That bleeds beneath their spear accuseth thee!</div>
               <div class="l">“Yea all the blood,” – with that as if his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Had risen &amp; shaken off that dreadful thought,</div>
               <div class="l">“These enemies O Lord! are thine,’ he cried</div>
               <div class="l">“Vengeance is thine! for thine own holy will;</div>
               <div class="l">“Thy own redeeming Law, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> in thy good time</div>
               <div class="l">“Thou wilt deliver Spain; yea, I shall see</div>
               <div class="l">“The dawn of her deliverance, of her day</div>
               <div class="l">“Of glory, &amp; my spirit ere I die,</div>
               <div class="l">“Shall taste of joy once more.”</div>
               <div class="l">Such hope sustaind</div>
               <div class="l">His heart when he drew near Leiria’s walls.</div>
               <div class="l">Twas evensong time, but not a Bell was heard;</div>
               <div class="l">Instead thereof <span class="strikethrough">in</span> her polluted tower</div>
               <div class="l">Bidding the Moor to his unhallowed prayers</div>
               <div class="l">The cryer stood, &amp; with his sonorous voice</div>
               <div class="l">Filld the delicious vale where Lena winds</div>
               <div class="l">Thro groves &amp; pastoral meads. The sound, the sight</div>
               <div class="l">Of turban, girdle, robe, &amp; scymitar</div>
               <div class="l">And tawny skins, arousd contending thoughts</div>
               <div class="l">Of shame &amp; wrathful anguish in the Goth;</div>
               <div class="l">The unaccustomed face of humankind</div>
               <div class="l">Confusd him now, &amp; thro the streets he went</div>
               <div class="l">With haggard mien, &amp; countenance like one</div>
               <div class="l">Crazd or bewildered. All who met him turnd</div>
               <div class="l">And wondered as he past; One stopt him short</div>
               <div class="l">Put alms into his hand, &amp; then desird</div>
               <div class="l">In broken Gothic speech, the moonstruck man</div>
               <div class="l">To bless him. With a look of vacancy</div>
               <div class="l">Roderick receivd the alms; his wandering eye</div>
               <div class="l">Fell on the money, &amp; the fallen King,</div>
               <div class="l">Seeing his own royal impress on the piece,</div>
               <div class="l">Broke out into a quick convulsive voice</div>
               <div class="l">That seemd like laughter first, but indeed soon</div>
               <div class="l">In hollow groans supprest, the Musselman</div>
               <div class="l">Shrunk at the ghastly sound, &amp; magnified</div>
               <div class="l">The name of Allah <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> as he past along.</div>
               <div class="l">A Christian woman spinning at her door</div>
               <div class="l">Beheld him, &amp; with sudden pity touchd</div>
               <div class="l">She laid her spindly by, &amp; hastening in</div>
               <div class="l">Took bread, &amp; following after, calld him back</div>
               <div class="l">And placing in his passive hands the loaf</div>
               <div class="l">She said, Christ Jesus for his mothers sake</div>
               <div class="l">Have mercy on thee; with a look which seemd</div>
               <div class="l">Like idiotcy he heard her, &amp; stood still</div>
               <div class="l">Staring awhile, then bursting into tears</div>
               <div class="l">Wept like a child, &amp; thus relievd his heart,</div>
               <div class="l">Full even to bursting else with struggling thoughts</div>
               <div class="l">So thro the streets &amp; thro the northern gate</div>
               <div class="l">Did Roderick, restless of a resting place</div>
               <div class="l">With feeble, yet with hurried step pursue</div>
               <div class="l">His agitated way, &amp; when he reachd</div>
               <div class="l">The open fields, &amp; found himself alone</div>
               <div class="l">Beneath the starry canopy of heaven,</div>
               <div class="l">The sense of solitude so dreaded late</div>
               <div class="l">Was then repose &amp; comfort. There he stopt</div>
               <div class="l">Beside a little rill, &amp; broke the loaf,</div>
               <div class="l">And shedding oer that unaccustomed food</div>
               <div class="l">Painful but quiet tears, with grateful heart</div>
               <div class="l">He breathd thanksgiving forth then made his bed</div>
               <div class="l">On heath &amp; myrtle.</div>
               <div class="l">But when he arose</div>
               <div class="l">At day break &amp; pursued his way, his heart</div>
               <div class="l">Felt lighten’d that the shock of mingling first</div>
               <div class="l">Among his fellow-kind was overpast:</div>
               <div class="l">And journeying on he greeted whom he met</div>
               <div class="l">With such short interchange of benison</div>
               <div class="l">As each to other gentle travellers give,</div>
               <div class="l">Recovering thus the power of social speech</div>
               <div class="l">Which he had long disusd. When hunger prest</div>
               <div class="l">He askd for alms; slight supplication serv’d,</div>
               <div class="l">A countenance so pale &amp; woe-begone</div>
               <div class="l">Movd all to pity, &amp; the marks it bore</div>
               <div class="l">Of rigorous penance &amp; austerest life,</div>
               <div class="l">With something too of majesty that still</div>
               <div class="l">Appeard amid the wreck, inspird a sense</div>
               <div class="l">Of reverence too. The Goatherd on the hills</div>
               <div class="l">Opened his scrip for him; the babe in arms</div>
               <div class="l">Affrighted at his visage, turned away,</div>
               <div class="l">And clinging to its mothers neck in tears,</div>
               <div class="l">Would yet again look up &amp; then again</div>
               <div class="l">With cry renewd shrink back. The bolder imps</div>
               <div class="l">Who playd beside the way, at his approach</div>
               <div class="l">Break of their sport for wonder, &amp; stood still</div>
               <div class="l">In silence, – some among them cried A Saint!</div>
               <div class="l">The village matron when she gave him food</div>
               <div class="l">Besought his prayers, &amp; one intreated him</div>
               <div class="l">To lay his healing hands upon her child.</div>
               <div class="l">For with a sore &amp; hopeless malady</div>
               <div class="l">Wasting it long had lain, &amp; more, she said,</div>
               <div class="l">He was a Man of God.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus travelling on</div>
               <div class="l">He past the vale where wild Arunca pours</div>
               <div class="l">Its wintry torrents, &amp; the happier site</div>
               <div class="l">Of old Conimbrica, whose ruined towers</div>
               <div class="l">Bore record of the fierce Alani’s wrath.</div>
               <div class="l">Mondego too he crost, not yet renownd</div>
               <div class="l">In poets amorous lay, &amp; left behind</div>
               <div class="l">The walls at whose foundations pious hands</div>
               <div class="l">Of Priests &amp; Monks &amp; mitred Prelates toild</div>
               <div class="l">For so the insulting Arian gave command.</div>
               <div class="l">Those stately palaces &amp; rich domains,</div>
               <div class="l">Were now the Moors, &amp; many a weary age</div>
               <div class="l">Must Coimbra wear the Misbelievers yoke,</div>
               <div class="l">Before Fernandos banner thro her gates</div>
               <div class="l">Shall pass triumphant, &amp; within the Mosque</div>
               <div class="l">Then <span class="strikethrough">purified</span> &lt;sanctified&gt;, the hero of Bivar,</div>
               <div class="l">He who in happy hour was born, receive</div>
               <div class="l">The knighthood which he glorified so oft</div>
               <div class="l">In his victorious fields. Oh if the years</div>
               <div class="l">To come might then have risen on Rodericks soul</div>
               <div class="l">What joy! what joy would Douro’s stream have given</div>
               <div class="l">Doomd one day from its have to give name</div>
               <div class="l">To that heroic race whose lineage</div>
               <div class="l">And language oer the undiscovered West</div>
               <div class="l">Shall spread their reign, – what joy those Keltic walls </div>
               <div class="l">Where Mumadona one day shall erect</div>
               <div class="l">Her tower, her town, her convent, to become</div>
               <div class="l">The cradle of that famous monarchy,</div>
               <div class="l">What joy might these prophetic scenes have given,</div>
               <div class="l">What ample vengeance on the Musselman,</div>
               <div class="l">Driven out with foul defeat, &amp; taught to feel </div>
               <div class="l">In Africa the wrongs he wrought to Spain,</div>
               <div class="l">And still pursued by that relentless sword</div>
               <div class="l">Even to the farthest Orient, where his power</div>
               <div class="l">Receivd its mortal wound.</div>
               <div class="l">O years of pride</div>
               <div class="l">In undiscoverable futurity</div>
               <div class="l">Yet unevolved, your destined glories lay</div>
               <div class="l">And all that Roderick in these fated scenes</div>
               <div class="l">Beheld, was grief &amp; wretchedness, the waste</div>
               <div class="l">Of recent war, &amp; the more mournful calm</div>
               <div class="l">Of joyless, helpless, hopeless servitude.</div>
               <div class="l">Twas not the ruined walls of church or tower</div>
               <div class="l">Cottage or convent, bleak with smouldering smoke</div>
               <div class="l">Twas not the unburied bones, which where the dogs</div>
               <div class="l">And crows had strewn them, lay amid the field</div>
               <div class="l">Bleaching in sun &amp; shower, that wrung his heart</div>
               <div class="l">With keenest anguish; twas when he beheld</div>
               <div class="l">Some turbaned traitor show his shameless front</div>
               <div class="l">In the open eye of heaven, some renegade</div>
               <div class="l">On whose base brutal nature unredeemed,</div>
               <div class="l">Even black apostasy itself could stamp</div>
               <div class="l">No deeper reprobation, at the hour</div>
               <div class="l">Assignd, fall prostrate, &amp; unite the names</div>
               <div class="l">Of God &amp; the Blasphemer, – impious prayer,</div>
               <div class="l">Most impious when from unbelieving lips</div>
               <div class="l">The accursed utterance came || But when he saw &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; || see below</div>
               <div class="l">The daughters of the land, who as they went</div>
               <div class="l">With chearful step to church, were wont to shew</div>
               <div class="l">Their innocent faces to all passers eyes,</div>
               <div class="l">Freely, &amp; free from sin as when they lookd</div>
               <div class="l">In adoration &amp; in prayer to heaven,</div>
               <div class="l">Now maskd in Moorish mufflers, to the mosque</div>
               <div class="l">Holding uncompanied their jealous way,</div>
               <div class="l">His spirit seemd at that unhappy sight</div>
               <div class="l">To die away within him, &amp; he too</div>
               <div class="l">Would fain have died, so death could bring with it</div>
               <div class="l">Entire oblivion.</div>

               <div class="l">Of Suevi kings, where in contempt of Rome</div>
               <div class="l">Degenerate long, the North’s heroic sons</div>
