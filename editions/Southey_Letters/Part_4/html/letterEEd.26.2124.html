About two years a remarkable accident occurred
                  here. Three men from Alstone Moor were crossing the mountain, &amp; were on the descent

                  face on the crust of snow &amp; fixed his hands into it. In this manner he was floated
                  down about two hundred yards, with tremendous rapidity, faster he said than ever mail
                  coach went, but he reached the bottom with no other injury than a few scratches from
                  the masses of hard snow &amp; found his way to M<sup>r</sup> Salkelds which was the nearest house. Salkeld immediately mustering all the men about
                  his house set out with his sheep dog in quest of the other two. The dog who had been
                  accustomed to search for sheep under the snow soon found their bodies, – they had
