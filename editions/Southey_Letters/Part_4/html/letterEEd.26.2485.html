                  chief part of their education at the school, &amp; even then it appears that every thing
                  is decided not by a fair competition, but by direct favour, the exhibition to Oxford

            <p class="indent1">The task of addressing you upon this subject Sir, is a painful one. It would be more
               so if I did not verily believe that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">your brother</a> labours under a species of insanity. His intellect is as powerful as it ever was,
               &amp; perfectly unclouded, – but all moral strength is paralyzed in him; &amp; when any thing
               comes before him in the form of duty, it seems to take away from him not merely the
               inclination but even the power of performing it. It would scarcely be speaking too
               strongly were I to say that he has abandoned his family to chance &amp; charity. He never
               writes to them; &amp; it is in vain to importune him with letters when by chance we learn
               the place of his abode; for it has very long been his custom never to open any letter
               which he thinks may by possibility contain any thing that he does not wish to hear,
               or relate to any thing of which he does not chuse to be reminded.</p>

                  – &amp; it can scarcely be necessary to add that the whole is consumed in the inevitable
                  expences incurred by the two boys, tho the schooling of the elder has been gratuitously
                  afforded him</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> is now eighteen years of age. His talents are extraordinary, &amp; wherever he has been,
               he has been remarkably fortunate in making friends. But he is not one of those fortunate
               persons whose talents are convertible to any course, – in any other pursuit than that
               of letters, (the army perhaps excepted) he would be helpless. His father has just
               so far interfered with his education as to derange it: in consequence of which while
               he was a well-taught Grecian, he acquired for a long time no <span class="strikethrough">x</span> other Latin than what was accidentally picked up. His Greek however will more than
               cover his defects, &amp; from his acquirements, his talents &amp; his application, he must
               (in my judgement) infallibly succeed at the University, if he takes the right course.
               It is, I am well aware, an expensive course of life to propose for one who must be
               indebted to the bounty of relations who know him not, for the chief means of his support.
               But no other course could so soon, or so surely enable him to obtain a provision for
               himself; – &amp; I know not what alternative could be <span class="strikethrough">proposed</span> suggested.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeaumontLadyMary">Lady Beaumont</a> has offered for this purpose 30£ a year, – an act of great &amp; [MS torn]cited kindness. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PooleThomas">Mr Poole</a>, who is his godfather has pr[MS torn] £10 more. The duty &amp; the absolute, imperious,
                  necessity of strict frugality must be impressed upon him. He will be able to practise
                  it, because under whatever circumstances he may appear, his acquirements &amp; his understanding
                  will command attention &amp; respect; &amp; I trust that feeling the duty &amp; the necessity
                  he will practice it. It is so long since I left college that I am little able to estimate
                  what the inevitable expences at this time would be. Should Cambridge be preferred
                  for him he must go as a Sizar,

                  concerning exhibitions, scholarships &amp;c. He was born in Gloucestershire. My friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeberRichard">M<sup>r</sup> Heber</a> has been made acquainted with this, &amp; will make enquiry at Oxford. On this subject
                  I shall be happy to receive your opinion &amp; advice.</p>

               <p>I have written so fully concerning <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a>, the immediate &amp; pressing object being to provide for him – that there is scarcely
                  room to say anything of the other two children. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</a> who is in his 14<sup>th</sup> year, is an excellent boy, quick at every branch of learning, &amp; fond of mathematics:
                  he has no eccentricities (in this respect unlike his brother) &amp; his temper &amp; talents
                  &amp; steadiness will ensure his success in any way of life. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">little girl</a> is uncommonly clever. At the age of 12 she is a good Italian scholar, a tolerable
                  one in French &amp; in Latin. She is at this time learning music, &amp; if her health fail
                  her not, will be admirably qualified for a Governess. I consider it as peculiarly
                  unfortunate that these interesting children should be totally unknown to all their
                  fathers family: if however their present state of abandonment should lead to a renewal
                  of that connection which ought never to have been interrupted, good will arise from
                  evil.
