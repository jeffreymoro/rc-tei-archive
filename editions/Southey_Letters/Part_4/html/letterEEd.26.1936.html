            <p class="indent1">To our great surprize we are here. The mail was full – by which we meant to have travelled
               to Newark. We took chaises, – &amp; when on the way from Brough to Greta Bridge, – I thought
               it was a pity to pass within sixteen miles of Tom, – especially when he was on the
               point of travelling to the same point, – so I orderd the post boy to alter his course
               &amp; make for Barnard Castle. – <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxx</span></p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</a> departure was fixed for Saturday. It is put off till Monday now, – that we may not
               go as soon as we came, &amp; that we may have time for some communication with the Durhamite
               branch of the family – who are but 13 miles off. – We shall be with you on Saturday
               22<sup>d</sup> – sans fail, &amp; we shall see York &amp; S<sup>t</sup>. Albans, &amp; whatever else is to be seen on the way.</p>
