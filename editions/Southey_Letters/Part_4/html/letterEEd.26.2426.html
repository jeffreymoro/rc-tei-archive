               sleeplessness. <span class="strikethrough">But at present she has decided dropsical symptoms, – &amp; her kidneys are in such a state
                  that her urine is deeply tinged with blood. The swelling first appeared in the face
                  &amp; then in the abdomen; yesterday it seemed to diminish &amp; to day is absent again; but

               medical superintendance, – but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">Coleridge</a> leaves every thing to chance – it is useless to write to him, he never answers a

               is ill till he reads of her death in the newspapers.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the autumn she was supposed to have strained one of her feet, a slight pain &amp; swelling
               began which was then accounted for, &amp; for which she has been twice blistered, before
               this more formidable disease put all slighter ailments out of mind. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> thinks her affliction scrofulous, for that there is a scrofula in the blood is now
               too certain, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> having at this time an abscess in his neck. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridge</a> is not fully aware of this, nor perhaps is she quite sensible of the extent of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Saras</a> danger.

                  may frustrate it, for even if no fresh wars should break out, those countries which
                  have been the scene of hostilities will long be overrun with banditti. This is so
