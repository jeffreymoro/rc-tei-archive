                  </div> In chewing the cud of bitter thoughts after the perusal of your letter, my first inclination
                  was to write to him, &amp; endeavour to discover from the tenor of his answer, what the
                  state of his feelings might be, &amp; whether he himself saw any way in which his fate
                  might be ameliorated, – for the army &amp; navy are out of the question, – &amp; so would
                  any situation be which required either character or confidence. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> &amp; I talking over the matter, agreed that it might yet be possible to qualify him for
                  a country practitioner in medicine, – but <span class="strikethrough">then</span> it would be <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> highly imprudent to incur an expence which we are so ill able to bear, unless there
                  were strong reason to believe that it would answer the end. Time &amp; suffering are the
                  only <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxxxx xxxxxx</span> medicines for a case like his, &amp; they are slow in their operation. – He has talents
                  in abundance, but there is a sort of moral insanity about him: he seems to have been
                  born without the sense of shame or of truth. I do not believe that there is any wickedness
                  in his nature; – he is rather without principles than actuated by bad ones, exactly <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> such a character as the old word <span class="ital">picaroon</span> 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> expresses. Such he was from the beginning, &amp; therefore there is but too much reason
                  to fear that such he will be to the end. The only ground of hope is that he may have
                  sense enough to perceive <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> how grossly he has erred in seeking for happiness by such courses.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">At all events the first thing to be done is to endeavour to learn what sort of character
               he bears among the poor creatures with whom he has associated himself, – <span class="strikethrough">Whether they xxxxxxxx xxxx xx xxxxx</span> whether he has a fair reputation with them for honesty, – what vices he is addicted
               to, if any (for I do not know that he is debauched) &amp; whether he <span class="strikethrough">in any way</span> appears at any time opprest in spirits, – for this would be the best symptom. This
               you could probably learn by causing secret enquiry to be made, &amp; then if the report
               should be in any point favourable, I will write to him, – &amp; do every thing which I
               possibly can do. – I need not say how much I feel your kindness on this occasion:
               – but this is a feeling to which I have long been accustomed. What I might have been
               without your help <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> God alone knows, &amp; I hardly dare ask myself.</p>
