            <p class="indent1">Your letter of the 10<sup>th</sup>. which I have this evening received offers so fair a prospect of a desirable establishment
               for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a>, that it is not necessary for me to say any thing respecting the two former plans
               which were proposed. Nothing can be more satisfactory than the present arrangement
               seems. The only inconvenience is that of leaving College during the Vacations, &amp; this
               we shall find means of obviating. Your opinion respecting the time of his entering
               &amp; his intermediate studies is perfectly judicious, &amp; shall of course be followed.
               No youth can promise better, &amp; I have well-founded hopes that he will do honour to
               his name.</p>

                  </div> These letters are certainly his. Impossible as it is to depend upon him, I never <span class="strikethrough">lose</span> wholly give up the hope that in some fit of exertion he may produce something worthy

                  to meet with. – I do not mean to extenuate his total disregard of all duties, – but
                  it must be some consolation to you to know that those persons who have been most intimately
                  connected with him during the last twenty years, who best know his conduct &amp; have
                  most <span class="strikethrough">reason</span> cause to deplore &amp; to condemn it, retain for him thro all a degree of affection which
