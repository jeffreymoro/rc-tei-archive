               <p>Is your Spanish information accurate in representing Ferdinand as having been at Seville?
                  – I thought his schemes had been matured at Valencia, &amp; that he had proceeded from
                  thence to Madrid.

                  fairly have represented the educated class of Spaniards: the <span class="strikethrough">Ja</span> Jacobines were the minority in it, but the grievances were so manifest &amp; so grievous
                  that the most bigotted joined in many of their reforms, &amp; they were able to raise
                  a popular cry which enable them to effect others. Both parties I doubt not have been
                  grievously wrong: but the Ferdinand party ought to be damned for imprisoning Quintana,
