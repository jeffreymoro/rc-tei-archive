         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">14.. </span><span class="noteBody">In 1806 a secret committee of enquiry (the ‘Delicate Investigation’) had been set
               up to look into the conduct of Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1768–1821; <em>DNB</em>), the estranged wife of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent</a>. Southey is here probably expressing distaste at the publication of a detailed account
               of the committee’s activities in <em>The Genuine Book. An Inquiry, or Delicate Investigation into the Conduct of Her Royal
                  Highness the Princess of Wales</em> (1813), seen through the press by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Spencer Perceval</a>. In addition to the publicity garnered by this, Caroline’s behaviour and treatment
               had generated renewed public interest. On 14 January 1813, Caroline had written to
               her husband protesting about the restrictions placed on her access to their daughter,
               Princess Charlotte Augusta (1796–1817; <em>DNB</em>). In early March a second letter on the same subject was sent to the Speaker of the
               House of Commons. As it was unsigned its authorship was initially questioned, though
               it was later attributed to Caroline. After debate, parliament agreed that it was the
               Regent’s right as a father and ruler to be in charge of his daughter’s education;
