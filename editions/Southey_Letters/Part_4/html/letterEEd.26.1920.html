                           officers to become involved in a scheme to capture the port of Belleisle-sur-Mer.
                           The clumsy plot had been uncovered and Owen had told all he knew to the French authorities,

                  folly, &amp; it was bad enough to set it on foot in the way he did, but the worst part
                  of the affair was that some weeks afterwards he wrote to Admiral Sotheby

                  in price by a greatly increased consumption, &amp; a greatly diminished supply. The question
                  as it appears to me is whether this will not soon render it necessary to alter the

               and barley to make sugar more attractive for distilling into alcohol. As such it was
               seen as hostile to British agriculture. Martinique, a sugar-growing island in the
               West Indies, had been captured from the French in 1809.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
