                  have heard the vulgar notion that a horse hair, plucked out by the root &amp; put in water,
                  becomes alive in a few days. The boys at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#LowBrathay">Brathay</a> repeatedly told <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PembertonSophia">their mother</a> it was true – that they had tried it themselves, &amp; seen it tried. Her reply was –
                  show it me &amp; I will believe it. – While we were there last week in came Owen with
                  two of these creations in a bottle. <span class="strikethrough">xxx </span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> was there, – &amp; to our utter &amp; unutterable astonishment did the boys to convince us

                  hold of them by the middle while they writhed like eels, &amp; stripping their nails down
                  on each side, actually lay bare the horse-hair in the middle, which seemd to serve
                  as the back-bone of those <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> creatures, – or the substratum of the living matter which had collected round it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> &amp; I should both have supposed that it was a collection of animalculæ round the hair
                  (which however would be only changing the nature of the miracle) if we could any way
                  have accounted for the motion upon this theory, – but the motion was that of a snake.
                  We could perceive no head, – but something very like the root of the hair. And for
                  want of glasses could distinguish no parts. The creature or whatever else you may
                  please to call it is black or dark brown, &amp; about the girth of a fiddle string. As
