                           on Memoirs of Mr Fox, which was ostensibly a response to John Bernard Trotter’s (1775–1818;
                           DNB) laudatory account of his erstwhile employer Charles James Fox. See Southey to

                           1812 (Letter 2041). Although the Commentary was printed, Murray eventually suppressed
                           its publication, refusing to issue a book that attacked the Tory government and was

               Mexico on the other: &amp; happy would Buonaparte be if he could see them doing his work.

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">At the request of Murray, Southey had read and reread a MS of Landor’s <em>Commentary on Memoirs of Mr Fox</em>, which was ostensibly a response to John Bernard Trotter’s (1775–1818; <em>DNB</em>) laudatory account of his erstwhile employer Charles James Fox. See Southey to Walter
               Savage Landor, 10 February 1812 (Letter 2034) and 11 February 1812 (Letter 2035),
               and Robert Southey to John Murray 15 February 1812 (Letter 2039) and 18 February 1812
               (Letter 2041). Although the <em>Commentary</em> was printed, Murray eventually suppressed its publication, refusing to issue a book
               that attacked the Tory government and was dedicated to James Madison (1751–1836),
               President of the United States 1809–1817, with whom Britain was about to go to war.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of the Board of Trade 1807–1812. He was the author of a volume criticising Fox (<em>Observations on the Historical Work of C. J. Fox</em> (1809)): ‘I leave him [Rose] … where I found him, and where Mr. Fox too, I am certain,
               would have left him. The King has been graciously pleased to distinguish him by the
               title of right honourable; I should probably have distinguished him by one very different,
               and certainly much more lasting. But it would have been an unworthy and most idle
               business; for it is only on soft and miry ground that such creatures can leave any
               impression. Their impetuous attack is not courage, but stupidity, and their dissonant
               clamour is not for our security, but for their own voracious and insatiable appetite.
               Perhaps it might be cruel to break the neck they stretch out so angrily and so awkwardly,
               yet it would be a piece of good husbandry to pluck them well, and to turn them up
               again on their common’, <em>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</em>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), pp. 235–236. Southey’s defence of Rose was possibly
               connected to his important role in Rickman’s career – Rose had noticed Rickman’s proposal
               for a census and brought the idea to the attention of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AbbotCharles">Charles Abbot</a>, who became Rickman’s main patron.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Riversdale (1724–1787), was born William Hull and was probably the illegitimate son
               of the substantial Irish landowner, Robert Tonson (1695–1773). Landor had referred
               to the 1st Lord Riversdale as ‘the bastard of a scullion’; <em>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</em>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 90.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Landor singled out Robert Fellowes (1770–1847; <em>DNB</em>): ‘Of late years, if any one had paid any attention to such people [reviewers] …
               one would imagine … that Aristotle only kept a box for Mr. Fellowes.// This reverent
               gentleman having settled religion to his mind, but unhappily … driven out from the
               poets, is retaliating on them as their judge. He writes, or did write, for I know
               not whether the work survives his hand, in <em>The Critical Review</em>; strange successor to the gentle, but high-minded Southey’, Landor, <em>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</em>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 146. Landor’s dislike of Fellowes had undoubtedly
               been fuelled by learning (from Southey) of the latter’s views on his poetry. Fellowes
               had observed in a letter to Seward of 1803 that: ‘The author of Gebir … has lately
               made another attempt to convey the waters of Helicon by leaden pipes, and many dark
               subterranean ways … having trod the dark profound of Gebir, I feel no inclination
               to begin another journey, which promises so little pleasure, and probably where only
               a few occasional flashes will enlighten the road’, <em>Letters of Anna Seward: Written Between the Years 1784 and 1807</em>, 6 vols (Edinburgh, 1811), V, p. 77 n. *.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               him during his time at Oxford. Kett features regularly in Landor’s satirical writings
               and the <em>Commentary</em> related an anecdote about his unprofessional, self-serving conduct; <em>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</em>, ed.

               by name, he drew attention to the Irish ‘attorney general, who brought gentlemen of
               the first respectability to trial, when, according to his own confession, he believed
