                  me till this morning, and that I have now laid it down after a full perusal. It was
                  overlooked at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray’s</a>, for I have received several parcels from him in the course of the last two months;

                  half that time, intimately. The strength and the character of his mind you see in

                  beyond any of his contemporaries; and as a poet, I speak not from the partiality of
                  friendship, nor because we have been so absurdly held up as both writing upon one
                  concerted system of poetry, but with the most deliberate exercise of impartial judgment
                  whereof I am capable, when I declare my full conviction that posterity will rank him

                  Pennsylvania, he has no other merit than that of having followed the principles of
                  the religious community to which he belonged, when his property <span class="ital">happened</span> to be vested in colonial speculations. The true champion for religious liberty in
