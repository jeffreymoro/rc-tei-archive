            <p>MS: the letter survives only in a partial transcript in the hand of Henry Crabb Robinson
               and dated by him ‘23 Apl 1811’, Dr Williams’s Library, London, Crabb Robinson MSS.
               The original letter was possibly amongst the letters from Southey to Duppa that Robinson
               was given by Duppa’s niece, Mrs Stone, and that he ‘made extracts from’ in March 1844;
