                  had that if he could have fair play he should excel me, – I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> telling him the substance of these letters, said that the only thing which could be
                  done for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> was to obtain for him such a situation in the army or navy as he had left, – &amp; that
