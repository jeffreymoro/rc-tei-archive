            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Some mischief having been committed upon my outhouses during Monday night, I went
                  yesterday to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CalvertWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Calvert</a>, not for the purpose of complaining so much, as to press upon him the necessity of
                  taking <span class="strikethrough">some</span> measures for putting some check to the outrages which almost <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> every night <span class="strikethrough">take place</span> &lt;are committed&gt; in the town of Keswick. One main cause of the evil lies in the publicans,
                  who keep their houses open much later than they should be suffered to do.—three or
                  four houses in particular have acquired a very bad character. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CalvertWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Calvert</a> desired me to write to you &amp; request that you would come to Keswick (if you conveniently
                  can) on Saturday. to have a meeting with him &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Denton.

                  lawless. — A singular instance of the evil which these disorders may occasion occurred
                  when the Barn at Monk-Hall was burning.

                  </div> Many persons in the town heard the fire-bell &amp; the cry of fire, &amp; because they had
                  been so often wantonly disturbed in the same manner &amp; by the same cry, continued to
                  lie in their beds, instead of hastening to give that assistance which they would so
                  willingly have given.</p>
