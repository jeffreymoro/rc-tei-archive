               He started the required poem (<em>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</em>) but in the event it was not needed as the engagement was broken off in June 1814.
               The <em>Lay</em> was recycled in 1816 to celebrate Charlotte’s marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg
               (1790–1865; <em>DNB</em>).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of the proposed 30 inscriptions were written. They were not collected together until
               1837–1838 when they appeared in the last-lifetime edition of Southey’s <em>Poetical Works</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

The notes to <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> had attacked the personalities and politics of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. The review of <em>Carmen</em> in <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, 22 (January 1814), 447–454, retorted: ‘For our own parts, when we are seriously
               occupied with the destinies of Europe, or of mankind, we should think very contemptibly
               of ourselves, if we could permit the recollection of our differences with Mr Southey
               to intrude either into our writings or our thoughts’ (452), before going on to criticise
               his support of the Spanish and acceptance of the Laureateship. An article in <em>The Times</em>, 7 April 1814 attacked these comments. Finally, <em>The Times</em>, 21 April 1814 reprinted the ‘Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte’,
               in a corrected version and retitled ‘Ode; Written in January, 1814’. A short headnote
               again defended Southey from the criticism levelled against him in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
