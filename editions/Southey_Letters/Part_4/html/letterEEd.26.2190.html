                           King of Haiti 1811–1820). Haiti was only briefly mentioned in Edinburgh Annual Register,

                  </div> I entirely agree with you that it must not find place in the History, as we have not
                  to cut our coat according to our cloth, – but our cloth according to our coat. There
                  is no room for any work of supererogation. For such works the second volume would
                  be a very fit place, &amp; in those volumes I should be very well disposed to give a series
                  of papers upon the great changes which are going on in the different parts of the
                  world, – their operating causes, &amp; their probable results. The Black Empire, – Serra
                  Leona, – Spanish America, the United States, – New Holland, – &amp;c – would furnish each
                  materials for most interesting speculation &amp; historical review. But I must curtail
                  my projects, instead of extending them, – for my own historical works upon which so
                  many years of labour have been bestowed, &amp; on which I am fully sensible my future
                  reputation will rest, are standing still. I have promised to prepare a Memoir of M<sup>r</sup> Walpoles Life, our envoy for above thirty years at Lisbon:

                  </div> &amp; this will be all I can do for the second volume. I have the whole of his correspondence
                  here, &amp; tremble at the sight of it. However I must have perused it for another purpose.
                  This Memoir will include some interesting matter about Portugal, &amp; will certainly
                  have the effect of selling some copies of the book.</p>

               sale of the Register would not be diminished a single copy in England by raising the
               price. I merely tell you this – because if you have no fear<span class="strikethrough">s</span> in Scotland, &amp; they have none in England, I do not see what there is to fear. My
               own opinion of course is of no weight, as I can have nothing but mere opinion to go
