            <p>Address: For/ Cap<sup>t</sup> Burney<br>Endorsement: R. Southey<br>MS: Morgan Library, MA 38<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: This letter contains the ‘notices’ about the ‘Buccaneers’ compiled by
               Southey for Burney’s use; see Southey to John Rickman, 4 November [1814], Letter 2496.
               A letter to John Rickman of 16 December 1814 (Letter 2518), records that Southey had
               been thwarted in his plan to put together the ‘memoranda’ for Burney ‘this evening’
               by the unexpected demand for a Laureate ode. The ‘notices’ were probably compiled
               and sent shortly after this, giving a date of between c. late 1814 and early 1815.</p>
