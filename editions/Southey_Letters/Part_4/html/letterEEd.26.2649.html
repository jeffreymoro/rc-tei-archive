                  </div> – but some unlucky ingredient in my moral, physical &amp; intellectual composition has
                  all my life long operated upon me with respect to forms like that antipathy which
                  some persons feels toward cats, or other objects equally inoffensive. I get thro them
                  so badly at all times, that <span class="strikethrough">x</span> whenever I am obliged to the performance my chief concern is how to slink out of it
                  as expeditiously as possible. I have moreover a propensity which may seem at first
                  not very well to accord with that constitutional hilarity <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> which is my best inheritance. Occasions of joy &amp; festivity serve rather to depress
                  the <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> barometer of my spirits than to raise it: birthdays &amp; wedding days therefore pass
                  uncelebrated by me, &amp; with the strongest conviction of the good effect of national
                  holydays, &amp; a feeling toward them which men who are incapable of understanding what
                  is meant by the imaginative faculty might call superstition, I <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> yet wish if it were possible that Xmas &amp; New Years Day <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> could be blotted from my kalendar. It might not be difficult to explain why this is,
                  – but it would be somewhat metaphysical which is bad, – &amp; somewhat sentimental, –
                  which is worse.</p>
