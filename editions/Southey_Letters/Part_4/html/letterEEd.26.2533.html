               <p>As for any such possibilities as those at which you hint, they are so very like impossibilities
                  that I do not know how to distinguish them. For in the first place you may be sure
                  that if the men in power were ever so well disposed toward me, they would think me
                  &lt;already&gt; liberally <span class="strikethrough">x</span> remunerated for my literary merits: – they cannot know that by gaining a pension of
                  £200. I was actually a loser of 20 £ a year;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey received a government pension in 1807 in place of the annual sum of £160 that
                           Wynn had granted him. But as the pension was taxed, Southey was actually worse off.</span></div>
                  </div> they, if they thought about it at all, <span class="strikethrough">n</span> would needs suppose that it was a clear addition to my former means, &amp; that if I lived
                  decently before, the addition would enable me to live with ease &amp; comfort. Secondly
                  they are never likely to think about me farther than as I may in pursuing my own principles
                  happen to fall in with their view of things. This happened in the Spanish war, &amp; would
                  have happened in the Catholic question, if the Quarterly had not been under <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Cannings</a> influence.

                           – though Canning, who supported the latter cause, prevented Southey’s views appearing
                           in the Quarterly Review.</span></div>
                  </div> Thirdly I am neither enthusiast nor hypocrite, but a man deeply &amp; habitually religious
                  in <span class="strikethrough">my</span> all my feelings, according to my own views of religion; which views differ from those
                  of the Church which I defend, in material points; – otherwise I should be in that
                  church. <span class="strikethrough">But</span> I am too old to bring my own opinions upon this subject into discussion unnecessarily;
                  but when I am conversing with persons in whose zeal I can sympathize I take scrupulous
                  care that they may <span class="strikethrough">more</span> &lt;not&gt; misunderstand me, &amp; imagine that because we agree in feeling we agree also in
                  points of faith: But there is no occasion to do this in public. I write religiously
                  because I write as I feel. <span class="ital">Not</span> being of the Church I hold the Church Establishment one of our greatest, perhaps the
                  greatest of our blessings; &amp; conscientiously <span class="strikethrough">recommend all</span> desire to strengthen &amp; support it. <span class="ital">Not</span> believing in the inspiration of the Bible, but believing in the faith which is founded
                  upon it, I hold its general circulation as one of the greatest benefits which can
                  be conferred upon <span class="strikethrough">it</span> &lt;mankind.&gt; <span class="ital">Not</span> believing that men are damned for not being Christian I believe that Christianity
                  is a divine religion, &amp; that it is our duty to diffuse it. See whether whatever I
                  write in my person is not consistent with this exposition. – The consequence <span class="strikethrough">a deal of</span> naturally is that I am <span class="strikethrough">le</span> exposed to a double imputation, of <span class="strikethrough">hypocrisy</span> &lt;enthusiasm&gt; from those who believe less, – of irreligion from those who believe more.
                  And whether they regard me at court in the one light or the other, the effect must
                  be equally prejudicial.</p>
