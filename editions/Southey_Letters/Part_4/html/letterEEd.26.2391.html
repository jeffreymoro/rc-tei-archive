            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It is one of the Miseries of Human Life in times like these to be disappointed of
               one’s newspaper, – &amp; for the last three or four weeks the Courier has fallen into
               such a course of irregularity that I think the cause cannot lie in the Post-Office.
               To day we have the paper which ought to have arrived on Sunday, – &amp; indeed the right
               paper seldom arrives on the right day, – for one whole week we were sometimes one,
               sometimes two days behind hand, – I am sure you will excuse me for informing you of
               this misery.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I cannot but assent to all you say about the Bourbons.

                           power in France, especially once Napoleon rejected the terms of the Treaty of Chaumont
                           of 1 March 1814, which offered France a ceasefire in return for accepting the country’s
                           borders of 1791.</span></div>
                  </div> Most certainly it is a desirable event that they should be restored; &amp; if I have any
                  feelings which would allay the joy that such an event ought to excite, they would
                  arise not so much from a remembrance of the early days of the Revolution, as from
                  the history of the family, – for the policy of Louis 13, 14 &amp; 15

                  They have been bitter &amp; treacherous enemies to England: – this however was natural,
                  &amp; the Government of France is always likely to be actuated by the same spirit.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At present I look at the contest with more apprehension than hope. The readiness of
                  our ministry to make peace against the opinion both of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a> &amp; the people, must tend greatly to dishearten such of the allies as are hearty in
                  the cause, which no doubt Russia &amp; Prussia are, &amp; the Germans also in general, – but
                  I distrust some of their courts. And if peace be made, in the course of a year or
                  two when <span class="strikethrough">he is</span> &lt;Buonaparte is&gt; strong enough to break it I fear we should see him fighting on German
