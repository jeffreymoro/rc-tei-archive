                  than that the system of feeding-up young men like so many game cocks for a sort of
                  intellectual <span class="ital">long-main</span> is every way pernicious.

                  not the only currency, nor the best. Doubtless there are many men at Cambridge in
                  high repute, who have taken no honours and gained no prizes: and should you yourself
                  stand for a fellowship or take pupils, you will find the opinion of what you <span class="ital">might have done</span>, will act as well in your favour as if your acquirements had received the seal and
                  stamp of approbation in the Senate House. Content yourself with graduating among the
                  many; and remember that the first duty which you have to perform is that of keeping
