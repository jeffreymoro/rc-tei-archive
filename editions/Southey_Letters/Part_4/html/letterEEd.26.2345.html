               <p>I meant to have seen you in the morning before my departure from town, and also to
                  have answered in person a note from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ConderJosiah">Josiah Conder</a>; but the day proved rainy, and prevented me. The day we met at New Inn

                  </div> I caught a violent cold, which lasted me during the remainder of my stay in London;
                  and perhaps I should have thought any other person imprudent in setting out with such
                  a companion for a two-nights’ journey in the mail. But I persuaded myself that five-and-forty
                  hours’ travelling would shake it out of my system; and though the theory certainly
                  was founded upon inclination, or rather made to suit it, it was confirmed by the result:
                  for I reached home with little cold left, and with no other symptom of fatigue than
                  that my ankles remained swollen for two or three days. All at home were well, and
                  I was as happy and as thankful as it became me to be, at finding them so after so
                  long an absence.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Since my return I have paid off some long epistolary arrears, and got through a good
                  deal of miscellaneous preparatory work; but my chief employment has been that which
                  has grown out of my new situation. You will see my New Year’s Ode announced for separate
                  publication under the title of “Carmen Annuum.”

                           of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the deleted stanzas into an ‘Ode Written

                  </div> I have given it this Latin name to avoid calling it an ode, partly because it is longer
                  than such compositions usually are, and partly because the poem is of a peculiar character;
                  I was glad to find a general name for it, rather than one which might convey an erroneous
                  expectation of its manner. It is an oration in verse, rather than a poem: — but whether
                  it be worth the trouble and the time which it has cost me, must be left to others
                  to determine. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> will send it you as soon as it is ready. It must appear on New Year’s Day; and an
                  extract from it serves the purpose of the Ode in ordinary.

                  made, and no otherwise, unless this event be prevented, as it so easily may, by the
                  recall of the Bourbons. Whether in my own individual mind I wish to see them re-established
                  is a question which I am really unable to answer; for if on the one hand the immediate
                  benefits would be great, on the other they are a bad race, and I never can forget,
                  whatever have been the crimes of the French Revolution in its course, and the incalculable
                  evils of its consequences, that the feelings which occasioned their expulsion were
                  far nobler than those which would bring about their restoration.</p>
