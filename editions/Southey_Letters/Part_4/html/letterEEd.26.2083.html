                           they often sent letters for friends (like Southey). The matter was raised periodically
                           in the Commons (e.g. on 14 December 1812, by the Whig, Thomas Creevey (1768–1838;

                  Halter-Maker to prepare a greater number of hempen necklaces than he is usually in
                  the habit of manufacturing. – Perhaps you do not know that the ropes used on such
                  occasions are manufactured for the purpose, the noose &lt;or rather noose-hole&gt; being
                  being made in them, like the eye of a needle, ready to be threaded with the other
                  end. – Franking is almost the only instance in which an act of government contributes
                  directly to keep up kindly feelings &amp; promote the real comforts of intellectual life.
                  I could write a long chapter upon this subject, – but I was led to it by thinking <span class="strikethrough">that</span> it was one of the comforts of a frank that it removed all scruples at writing a short
                  letter, – for a few lines I was resolved upon writing to you only to say that you
