               <p>Last night I received a singular &amp; gratifying proof that in some of my late endeavours
                  I have not altogether been labouring in vain. A circular letter was sent me from the

                           the Lives of their Reformers and Martyrs, Extracts from her Writings, and from the

                  first, &amp; I am afraid that the Homilies &amp; the writings of the Reformers are not suited
                  to this purpose. The other publications which the Society proposes cannot fail of
                  being useful, – I am only anxious that none of their funds should be misdirected in

                  it will be some months before I can command that. My plan is briefly this, – to show
                  1<sup>st</sup> <span class="strikethrough">the</span> what were the superstitions of the various nations from whom we are descended – the
                  Britons, Romans &amp; Northern Tribes, with the effect of those superstitions upon the
                  manners &amp; morals, – consequently upon the happiness of society, – these being the
                  evils from which England was delivered by its conversion to Christianity. 2<sup>dly</sup> a picture of Popery &amp; the evils from which the Reformation delivered us. 3<sup>dly</sup> Puritanism rampant &amp; the evils from which the restoration of the church delivered
                  us. – 4<sup>thly</sup> a picture of Methodism &amp; the wilder sects, showing what the evils are from which the
                  Church Establishment preserves us. Under the three first heads the history of the
                  English Church would be included, with biographical sketches of all its greatest characters.
                  – In the composition my aim would be so to write as to impress the feelings of the
                  young, making every thing as level as possible to their capacity, in the manner, &amp;
                  as impressive as possible to their imagination, while the matter should stand the
                  test of critical examination &amp; satisfy the maturest judgement. I should call it, the
                  Book of the Church, &amp; (if I write it) shall not improbably accompany it with a Book
                  of the Constitution
