            <p class="indent1">First to the first part of your letter. Very glad should I be if I could point out
               to you any profitable employment in literature; but they who know most of such things
               best know how exceeding difficult this is. Nothing is so likely to succeed as a dramatic
               attempt, and I should think it very possible you might adapt some of our old plays
               to the stage. Of these the emolument would be considerable. Next to this, the most
               promising attempt would be to versify some popular tale; better still, to manufacture
               one with a melodrama or grand spectacle for the stage. These are things which may
               be talked over at leisure when you come to us; we shall all rejoice to see you, and
               it is very likely that among my books you may find something which will suit your
               purpose. So bear in mind that you are expected here, and the sooner you come the better.
               ... All my <span class="ital">cattle</span> send their love. I have a fine square daughter to show you, called <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</a>, after her godfather, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">Dr Bell</a>, and who, live as long as she will, ‘will be a Belle still.’ When shall we see you?</p>
            <div class="closer">Yours very truly,
               <div class="indent5">ROBERT SOUTHEY.</div>
