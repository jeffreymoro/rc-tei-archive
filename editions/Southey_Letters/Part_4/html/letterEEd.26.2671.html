               mention that Wellington had been surprised by the movements of the French forces,
               and to clarify statements on Prussian accounts of the battle. These included, the
               report on Waterloo issued by the Prussian commander August Wilhelm Antonius, Count
               Neidhardt von Gneisenau (1760–1831). Its pro-Prussian slant was defended by Southey
               in <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 13 (July 1815), 507n. The same note went on to attack the ‘libellers in the Rhenish
               Mercury, who attempt to depreciate the merits and the glory of the Duke of Wellington,
               and endeavour to support their calumnies by the authority of this official paper,
               – their conduct will only excite the contempt of the British army, and the indignation
