               <p>Do me the kindness to cast your eye over these stanzas before they pass the bourne
                  from which there is no return. I do not make this request for the sake of criticism,
                  however valuable that might be, – your <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> time is far too precious for this; – but because, for the first time in my life I
                  feel it is possible that there may be something more than my own opinion &amp; character
                  to consult in publication, even tho I am not subject to the jurisdiction of M<sup>r</sup> Larpent.

                  officers who have fallen.
