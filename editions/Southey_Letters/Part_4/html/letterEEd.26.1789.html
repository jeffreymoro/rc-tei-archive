            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your parcel arrived this afternoon, and about an hour afterwards the two boxes from
                  Nottingham. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith’s</a> astonishment at the sight of the largest doll she has ever seen is hardly yet subsided;
                  it is resolved that she is carefully to preserve it for her children’s children, to
                  be an heir-loom and family doll for evermore; and the conceit of the value which all
                  the caps and coifs will acquire when they come to be fashions of the generations that
                  are gone, has contributed to reconcile me to the profusion with which their wardrobe
                  has been fitted up. The screens are to ornament my library, – being the drawing or
                  full-dress room of the house. I hope they will give <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</a> an inclination for drawing flowers. It has always been my wish that she should acquire
                  this particular branch of the art, as one which may be applied to scientific purposes,
                  and for which, in whatever part of the world her lot may be cast, subjects will always
                  be to be found. A collection of accurate drawings is far more valuable than the plants
                  themselves, however well preserved in a <span class="ital">hortus siccus</span>.

                  </div> Our lichens, mosses, fungi, and ferns afford exquisite subjects for painting; and
                  few things would be more interesting than to have a series of drawings representing
                  the complete history of all our English trees, in their various appearances from the
                  time that the seed pushed out its first leaflets, to its full-grown beauty, and its
                  final decay, – the bud in all its stages till the foliage is fully developed, and
                  the flowers and fructification in like manner. This would in itself be a delightful
                  work, and it could not be executed without leading to a considerable experimental
                  knowledge in natural history, which, when pursued as it was by your namesake, White,
                  of Selborne,

                  the blood, he is entitled by birth to be a punster, and some of these cards may quicken
                  the propensity. They are very comical, and have made the elder branches of the family
                  laugh. For each and all of these things, Neville, you must express our several and
