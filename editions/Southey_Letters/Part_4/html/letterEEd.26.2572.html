               <p>I have this moment received your parcel &amp; am not a little mortified at the contents
                  of your postscript. I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">M<sup>r</sup> Frere</a> immediately upon the receipt of his letter to express my admiration of his epitaph,
                  &amp; to thank him for it.

                           It was not attached to the third edition of 1825. For Southey’s reply; see Southey
                           to John Hookham Frere, 16 January 1815, Letter 2545.</span></div>
                  </div> He had given me no address, &amp; therefore I inclosed my reply to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gifford</a>, that he might direct it for me. On my part I have been wondering meantime at not
                  having heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">M<sup>r</sup> Frere</a> for in this ill fated letter I told him that I had procured a copy of the <span class="strikethrough">Poema del Ferr</span> Poem of Ferran Gonzalez

                           Count of Castile 931–970. The poem survived in one 15th-century manuscipt in the royal
                           archive at Escurial. A copy was sent to Southey by Manuel Abella; see Southey to John

                  </div> (which I heard him in 1808 regret that he had neglected to do) – &amp; added that if he
                  had not <span class="strikethrough">seen</span> yet seen it, I would send my copy, thro you. I am truly vexed that the miscarriage
                  of this letter should have made me appear guilty of great rudeness in a quarter where
                  I am truly desirous of showing the respect which I feel.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Whether the letter was lost on its way to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gifford</a>, or after he forwarded it I know not. Possibly it may have been mislaid by him &amp;
               forgotten – In that case an inquiry may recall it to his mind. And I should rather
               the old letter were recovered, – because its date would show <span class="strikethrough">how</span> with what promptness I acknowledged what I felt to be an honour.</p>
