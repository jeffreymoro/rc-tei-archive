                  </div> has succeeded &amp; that so much of its success is attributable to you, I am empowered
                  by the literary proprietors here (&amp; heartily concur myself) to offer you 1/12<sup>th</sup> share, which will be vacated by the concern on your account. The outlay on each 12<sup>th</sup> has been 209£ the profit on these two volumes, £ 80; being about 40 p cent on the
                  outlay. We sell the books of the literary sharers, &amp; give them our bill at a year
                  for their profit immediately. The outlay on the first volume, which is stock, goes
                  on towards the conduct of the second; &amp; when any proprietor would retire, his share
                  is purchased by the remaining parties at the original £ 209.”</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">– Aug 20<sup>th</sup>. following, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</a> wrote thus, “We have agreed to sell for them the shares of the other literary proprietors,
               &amp; to grant them a bill for the profits arising, at twelve months after the date of
               the publication of each volume; the profits to be calculated on the difference arising
               betwixt the sum laid out for the volume, &amp; the value at what is technically called
               Trade-price, with the deduction of 10 p cent for trouble &amp; risk. The profits upon
               each twelfth so calculated of the Register for 1808 amounts to £80, for which sum,
               if it is agreable to you that we shall sell your proportion of the books, we shall
               presently grant you our bill.”</p>
            <p class="indent1">These were the <span class="strikethrough">terms upon</span> &lt;offers by&gt; which I &lt;was induced to&gt; become a proprietor of the Register. – But in
               the terms which were after drawn up, an important alteration was introduced. It was
               there thus expressed: “on a proprietor signifying a wish to retire, his <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> share must be offered to the other proprietors in the first instance, at the original
               cost price of £ 209.” – By not having adverted to this alteration at the times I perceive
               that I have <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> lost all right of requiring that my share should be repurchased.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I committed a farther oversight in not calling upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJohn">M<sup>r</sup> John Ballantyne</a> for the stipulated Bill at 12 months date upon the publication of each volume. This
                  neglect however in no degree invalidates my right. He now after repeated evasions
                  &amp; delays has avowed his intention of witholding from me monies due for <span class="strikethrough">the fourth history</span> my contributions to the fourth volume,

                  my agreement involves no risk on my part whatever: that the share was proposed to
                  me not as a speculation but as a <span class="ital">bonus</span>, or recompense: that <span class="strikethrough">it</span> he told me not what the profits <span class="ital">might be</span>, but what they <span class="ital">actually were</span>; that he ought to have given me his bill for those profits at the times appointed
                  by himself, – that if those bills had been given, payment could not have been resisted
                  upon the plea of stock in hand, &amp; that I am morally &amp; legally entitled to £80 profits
                  upon the first volume, as clearly as if I had his note for the sum, &amp; that <span class="strikethrough">x</span> tho I am content to look for no profit upon the second &amp; third volumes owing to their

                  – My share is plainly worth nothing, – this loss I must no doubt submit to, &amp; it is
                  quite sufficient. But as long as I hold that share I hold <span class="strikethrough">no</span> myself not liable to any loss upon it; &amp; shall require upon the publication of each
