                  to insert two stanzas – if I can please myself with them, – one which shall recapitulate
                  the sufferings of the peninsula, – another the crimes of France. – The first of these
                  would come in the middle of the 9<sup>th</sup> stanza, the other after the 14<sup>th</sup>. – As for the poem I have worked at it doggedly, &amp; hope you will like it better than
                  I do.
