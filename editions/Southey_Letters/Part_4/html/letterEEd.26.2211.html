                  in the North.

                           Europe, after the defeat of the French army in Russia in 1812. He hoped to draw Prussia
                           and Saxony (though not Austria) into a new coalition with Russia against the French;
                           and to replace the Duchy of Warsaw, which France had created out of Prussian Poland
                           in 1807, with a new, enlarged Kingdom of Poland, thus reversing the division of the
                           country between Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1792–1795.</span></div>
                  </div> Never in civilised Europe had there been so great an army brought together as Bonaparte
                  had there collected, and never was there so total and tremendous a destruction. I
                  verily think that this is the fourth act of the Corsican, and that the catastrophe
                  of the bloody drama is near. May his fall be as awful as his crimes! The siege of
                  Dantzic, and the accession of Prussia to our alliance, will, probably, be our next
                  news. Saxony will be the next government to emancipate itself, for there the government
                  is as well disposed as the people. I wish I could flatter myself that Alexander

                  Poland, not after the villanous manner of Bonaparte, but with all its former territory,
                  giving up his own portion of that infamously acquired plunder, and taking Prussia’s
                  part by agreement, and Austria’s by force; for Austria will most likely incline towards
                  the side of France, in fear of Russia, and in hatred of the House of Brandenburgh.
                  May this vile power share in his overthrow and destruction, for it has cursed Germany
                  too long!</p>

               <p>Was there ever an infatuation like that of the party in this country who are crying
                  out for peace? as if this country had not ample cause to repent of having once before
                  given up the vantage ground of war, at a peace forced upon the state by a faction!
                  Let us remember Utrecht, and not suffer the Whigs of this day to outdo the villany
                  of the Tories of that.

                  </div> There can be no peace with Bonaparte, none with France, that is not dictated at the
                  edge of the sword. Peace, I trust, is now not far distant, and one which France must

                  the looms to work again, we may hope that it will suspend the danger which has manifested
                  itself, and give time for measures which may prevent its recurrence. You will see
                  in the next Quarterly a paper upon the State of the Poor, – or, rather, the populace,
                  – wherein I have pointed out the causes of this danger, and its tremendous extent,
                  which, I believe, few persons are aware of. I shall be sorry if it be mutilated from
                  any false notions of prudence.

                  I pursued such employments. I was then impatient to see myself in print: it was not
                  possible to long more eagerly than I did for the honour of authorship. This feeling
                  is quite extinct; and, allowing as much as may be allowed for experience, wiser thoughts,
                  and, if you please, satiety in effecting such a change, I cannot but believe that
                  much must be attributed to a sort of autumnal or evening tone of mind, coming upon
                  me a little earlier than it does upon most men. I am as cheerful as a boy, and retain
                  many youthful or even boyish habits; but I am older in mind than in years, and in
                  years than in appearance; and, though none of the joyousness of youth is lost, there
                  is none of its ardour left. Composition, where any passion is called forth, excites
                  me more than it is desirable to be excited; and, if it were not for the sake of gratifying
                  two or three persons in the world whom I love, and who love me, it is more than probable
                  that I might never write a verse again. God bless you!</p>
