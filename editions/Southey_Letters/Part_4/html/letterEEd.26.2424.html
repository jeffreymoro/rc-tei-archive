                  be, will build me out of my lease, by rendering the situation no longer desirable,
                  – &amp; this makes me think of removing at the end of my first term, – three years hence.
                  I shall be much inclined, if I can possibly command means for the removal, to pass
                  two or three years with my family on the continent, where they may acquire the languages
                  in the easiest manner, &amp; I may enjoy fruits &amp; sunshine. The difference of <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> expence in living would probably cover the costs of travelling, &amp; Othellos occupation

                  by accounts of the Spanish backsettlers, passing from tribe to tribe, but mostly by
                  that propensity to exaggerating &amp; lying which is almost as mischievous as it is common.

                  the language at Nootka Sound contains indisputable characteristics of the Aztec speech.
