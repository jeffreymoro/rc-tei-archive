                  of having fixed a maximum for gold, the value of which like that of every thing else
                  depends upon the supply. Now the mines supply less than they did, &amp; the watch makers
                  consume more in an astonishing proportion, &amp; this is the mystery of the wonderful
                  history. He is very erroneous in the latter part of his tract, but this seems to me
