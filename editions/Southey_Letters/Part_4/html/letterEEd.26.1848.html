                           had also applied to review the poem and had been shown a pre-publication version of
                           Scott’s article. Bedford was concerned at its emphasis upon narrative, rather than
                           morality, and was allowed to make additions to it along the lines suggested in this
                           letter. Bedford remained, however, unhappy with the overall tone. For the review as
                           published see Quarterly Review, 5 (February 1811), 40–61 (esp. 55–56, probably Bedford’s
                           interpolation).</span></div>

                  is out of the question) would be to interpolate it with one paragraph, written to
                  point out the moral grandeur of the fable, <span class="strikethrough">which then</span> &lt;&amp; how it&gt; becomes of universal interest &amp; application, founded as it is upon a particular

                  of mind which made her feel superior to herself.” This is precisely what it ought

                  written a poem of 5000 lines for the purpose of teaching Hindoo mythology. You will
                  thus prevent his reviewal from being detrimental, – &amp; your own will be serviceable
