            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have so many things to say to you that I scarcely know where to begin. It was a
               great mortification that I could not make the circuit which I had proposed in my way
               home, &amp; halt with you by the way; but the state of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughters</a> health kept us in a state of feverish disquietude, &amp; for the <span class="strikethrough">time</span> first time I felt how serious an evil it was to be at so great a distance from my
               own fire side. Happily the weather favoured us, the child grew better as we proceeded,
               &amp; like a true mountaineer seemed to be revived as soon as the breath of the mountains
               reached her. We arrived safely without other accident than that of breaking down in
               the street at Nottingham, – the only accident which occurrd during the whole journey
               at home &amp; abroad.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The infrequency of my letters my dear Wynn God knows is owing to no distaste, – the
                  pressing employments of one who keeps pace with an increasing expenditure by temporary
                  writings, the quantity which from necessity as well as inclination I have to read,
                  &amp; the multiplicity of letters which I have to write, are the sufficient causes. You
                  do not know the number of letters which come to me from perfect strangers, who seem
                  to think a Poet Laureat has as much patronage as a Lord Chancellor, <span class="strikethrough">both xxxxxx unfrequently xxx</span> not unfrequently the writers remind me so strongly of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> my own younger days that I have given them the best advice I could with earnestness
                  as well as sincerity, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> more than once been thus led into an occasional correspondence. The Laureateship itself
                  with me is no sinecure. I am at work in consequence of it at this time. Do not suppose
                  that I mean to rival <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a>. My poem will be in a very different strain. It is in the sixlined stanza of Gualberto,

                  be obnoxious to the charge of egotism, – no matter, if it is called of, it must answer
                  a useful purpose. The Lamentation will express a feeling concerning <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> the state of affairs very similar to yours – &amp; the Reproof instead of answering the

                           that ‘the name of Waterloo was given to the battle by the Duke of Wellington in a
                           spirit of the lowest &amp; vilest jealousy’ (Southey to Thomas Southey, 17 December 1815,

                  </div> On my return after an absence of six weeks to my surprize the number was still unpublished,
                  tho this was the last article in it. I suspected that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> had kept it back for the sake of getting from me what farther knowledge I might have
                  acquired upon the spot, &amp; tho not very well pleased at the supposition I nevertheless
                  willingly proposed to <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> him to revise it before it should be worked off, &amp; correct any error into which ignorance
                  of the ground might possibly have led me. It was not however till I had been <span class="strikethrough">above a for</span> nearly three weeks in London that I could procure the proofs, tho I repeatedly applied
                  for them both to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>, &amp; at last only the latter half of the article was sent me. With this I was satisfied
                  as it contained the Waterloo part. Imagine my surprize &amp; indignation at finding two
                  huge interpolations placed so as totally to destroy the effect of a continuous narrative
                  &amp; compleatly spoil the composition. But this was a light objection to them: – for
                  the object of the first was to deny in the most audacious &amp; insolent terms that the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke of Wellington</a> had been surprized, &amp; that of the second to deny in the same manner that any merit
                  whatever was due to the Prussians in the victory!</p>

            <div class="wrapper">

                  alterations were made at Paris, &amp; the correspondence <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> took place between that city &amp; Dublin, – in short that I had been chosen as a fit
                  mouthpiece for conveying falsehood to the public thro an accredited channel. – You
                  may guess what followed. I insisted upon having the <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxxx</span> paper put into my hands, struck out their falsehoods, reinserted what had been expunged
                  to make room for them, &amp; carried my point with a high hand: whereby I shall not doubt
                  have deserved &amp; procured the ill-will &amp; the respect both of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke</a> &amp; his friend. I saw <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> afterwards at his particular &amp; repeated desire, after having declined an invitation
                  to dine with. You will easily believe that he carefully avoided all reference to the
                  subject, tho his conversation was often influenced by it, &amp; that he behaved with the
                  greatest possible civility.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">One of the passages which I struck out was a sentence saying that the good sense of
