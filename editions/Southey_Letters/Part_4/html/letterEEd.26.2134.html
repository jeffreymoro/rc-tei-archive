                  Street to the city, &amp; which if it prove succesful will essentially enrich my store
                  of historical documents. I have just learnt by accident that there is in High Holborn
                  a set of Muratori’s great collection of the Italian Historians which <span class="strikethrough">being</span> wanting one volume, is on that account offered for sale at a very low price, – some
                  five or six pounds for a collection which I should joyfully purchase at the price
                  of five &amp; twenty were it entire.

                           Muratori’s Annali d’Italia dal Principio dell’era Volgare sino all’anno 1750 (1786);
                           no. 1894 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, though this lacked the first
