                  </div> which I have read with pleasure, as the faithful transcript of a good man’s mind.
                  It contains ample proof that you possess the perceptions of a poet; and if the diction
                  in which they are clothed has sometimes its defects, it is because you have been too
                  laboriously employed in more dignified pursuits to have had leisure for maturing the
                  mechanical part of an art which, of all other trades or professions, requires the
                  longest apprenticeship.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>What I have written upon the Missionaries I well knew would accord with your feelings
                  and opinions.

                  </div> I have not yet done with the subject, meaning, so soon as my many occupations will

                  missions; proved my own firm belief that there are but two methods of extending civilisation,
                  – conquest and conversion, – the latter the only certain one; entered fully into the
                  difficulties which oppose the reception of Christianity; and, finally, connected this

                  do far better if it was emancipated from the shackles of party. It wants also some
