                  </div> but nothing so much to the purpose as what you have remarked. It is not a little extraordinary
                  that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> who is fond of logic, &amp; who has an actual love &amp; passion for close, hard, thinking,
                  – should write in so rambling &amp; inconclusive a manner, – while I who am utterly incapable
                  of that toil of thought in which he delights, never fail to express myself perspicuously
                  &amp; to the point. I owe perhaps something of this to the circumstance of having lived
                  with him during that year in my life which was most likely to give my mind its lasting
                  character.

                  </div> Disliking his inordinate love of talking, I was naturally led to avoid the same faults,
                  – when we were alone &amp; he talked his best (which was always at those times) I was
                  pleased to listen, – &amp; when we were in company &amp; I heard the same things repeated,
                  – repeated to every fresh company, seven times in the week if we were in seven parties,
                  – still I was silent, – in great measure from depression of spirits at perceiving
                  those vices in his nature which soon appeared to be incurable, – When he provoked
                  me into an argument, I made the most of my time, &amp; as it was not easy to get in more
                  than a few words, took care to make up in weight for what they wanted in measure.
                  His habits have continued &amp; so have mine.</p>

               <p>Never was anything so grievously mismanaged as the Friend. Because he would have all
                  the profits (having taken it in his head that I was cheated by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">my publishers</a> ) he would publish for himself, – thus has he the whole trouble of collecting his
                  money, – the whole responsibility instead of having a publisher to look to, – &amp; the
                  expense of postage will far – very far exceed – any publisher’s per centage. Then
                  he writes to the Public about all his difficulties, &amp; his projects, – as if they wanted
                  to know anything about them, – not perceiving that this is lowering himself in the
                  eyes of the foolish, &amp; certainly does not raise him in the judgment of the wise. And
                  certainly of all modes of publication that could be devised, nothing could be so ill
                  adapted for such materials as a weekly form. Had he brought out these same papers
