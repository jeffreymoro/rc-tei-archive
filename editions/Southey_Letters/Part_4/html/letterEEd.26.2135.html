                  on the other side of the picture, showing, that altho literature in almost all cases
                  is the worst trade to which a man can possibly betake himself, it is the best &amp; wisest
                  of all pursuits for those whose provision is already made, &amp; of all amusements for
                  those who have leisure to amuse themselves. It has long been my intention to leave

                  for my own profession, – with every advantage of education it is true, but under more
                  disadvantages perhaps of every other kind than any of the persons in his catalogue.
                  I have never regretted the choice. The usual censure ridicule &amp; even calumnies which
                  it has drawn upon me never gave me a moments pain, – but on the other hand literature
                  has given me friends among the best &amp; wisest &amp; most celebrated of my contemporaries
                  it has given me distinction, – if I live twenty years longer I do not doubt that it
                  will give me fortune, &amp; if it pleases God to take me before my family are provided
