               <p>I have seldom in the course of my life felt it so painful to answer a letter as on

            <p class="indent1">Of sorrow &amp; humiliation I will say nothing. Let me come at once to the point, – on
               what grounds can such a subscription be solicited? – </p>
            <div class="wrapper">

                  for 1000£ &amp; pays the annual premium. He never writes to them, &amp; never opens a letter

               <p>In truth <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> his embarrasments &amp; his miseries of body &amp; mind are all owing to one accursed cause:
                  – excess in opium, <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> &lt;of&gt; which he habitually takes more than <span class="strikethrough">any</span> was ever known to be taken by any person before him. The Morgans

                  </div> with great effort succeeded in making him wholly leave it off for a time, &amp; he recovered
                  in consequence health &amp; spirits. He <span class="strikethrough">now</span> has now taken to it again. Of this indeed I was too sure before I heard that his looks
                  bore testimony of it. Perhaps you <span class="strikethrough">were</span> are not aware of the <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> costliness of this drug. In the quantity which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> takes it would consume more than the whole annuity which you propose to raise. A frightful
                  consumption of <span class="strikethrough">spr</span> spirits <span class="strikethrough">must be added xxxx</span> added to this, – in this way bodily ailments are produced, &amp; the wonder is that he
                  is still alive.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">There are but two grounds on which <span class="strikethrough">it xx</span> a subscription of this nature can proceed, – either where the object is disabled
               from exerting himself, – or when his exertions are unproductive. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> is in neither of these predicaments. Proposal after proposal has been made to him
               by the Booksellers, &amp; he has repeatedly closed with them. He is at this moment as
               capable of exertion as I am, &amp; would be paid as well for whatever he might please
               to do. There are two Reviews (the Quarterly &amp; the Eclectic) in both of which he might
               have employment, at ten guineas per sheet, – in the former I could obtain it for him,
               – in the latter they are urgently desirous of his assistance. He promises &amp; does nothing.
               – He has poems which have been written many years &amp; repeatedly advertised; – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">his wife</a> would transcribe them for the press – all that is wanting is he will not take the
               trouble of overseeing this, or collecting them for her. He has footing in the theatre
               &amp; might annually bring out a play which would not cost him three months amusing occupation.
               – But I need not pursue this subject.</p>
            <p class="indent1">What more can I say? – He may have new friends who would subscribe to this plan, but
               they cannot be many, – <span class="strikethrough">&amp; I</span> but among all those persons who know him, his habits are known also.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Do you as you think best. My own opinion is that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> ought to come here, &amp; employ himself, – collecting money on the way by lecturing
               at Birmingham &amp; Liverpool. Should you proceed in <span class="strikethrough">this</span> &lt;your&gt; intention my name must not be mentioned. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">His wife</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">daughter</a> are living with me, – &amp; here he may employ himself without any disquietude about
               immediate subsistences. Nothing is wanting to make him easy in circumstances &amp; happy
               in himself, but to &lt;leave off opium, &amp;&gt; devote a certain portion of his time to the
               discharge of his duty. Two hours a day would suffice.</p>
