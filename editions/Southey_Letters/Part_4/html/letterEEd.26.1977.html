               Shaver. A New Song’, which Thelwall claimed had been sent to him by the author (whose
               name he did not know) in the aftermath of his 1804 dispute: ‘Oyes! all good people
               of every degree,/ Scotch, English, and Irish, come listen to me,/ While I chaunt,
               so sublimely, in verse analytic,/ To the praise and the glory of <span class="ital">Jeffrey</span> the critic.// The Prince of Reviewers is <span class="ital">Jeffrey</span>, by jingo!/ Who damns authors by wholesale in horrible lingo,/ And hears the poor
               devils so dismally groan,/ With a heart that’s as hard – as his grandpapa’s hone.//
               Then he writes for amusement, nor pockets a boadle;/ So <span class="ital">gratis</span> he fractures poor Priscian’s noddle./ But as to his wit! a good wager I’d lay sir,/
               ’Tis as keen as his grandpapa’s razor.// For whatever pilgarlicks (or pig-tail or
               crop)/ This shaver so dextrous lugs into his shop,/ Of <span class="ital">Brough’m</span> his mad ’prenctice becoming the butt,/ Like his grandpapa’s customer’s – sorely they’re
               cut.// To cure the itinerant <span class="ital">Thelwall</span> of roaming,/ He gave his black locks a right barberous combing,/ Till the froth and
               cold sweat stood the Orator’s face on,/ Like – the lather that foams in his grandpapa’s
               bason.// But <span class="ital">Thelwall</span>, provok’d by this villainous shock,/ Started up in a passion and kick’d down the
               block,/ And bestirr’d him so nimbly – that, ’spite of their bloods,/ Both <span class="ital">Jeff</span> and his ’prentice were left in the suds.// Now invoke, O ye authors! on Thelwall
               a blessing,/ For giving this brace of barb<span class="ital">e</span>rians a <span class="ital">dressing</span>./ And may prigs who vend malice in critical barter,/ Like <span class="ital">Jeff</span>, cut their fingers, – by catching a Tartar.’; see <em>Thelwall’s Selections</em> (Newcastle, n.d.), pp. 7–8.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
