               <p>Your letter of Feb<sup>y</sup>. 21<sup>st</sup> ought not to have been so long unacknowledged. The truth is that my time is very much
                  occupied, &amp; I have but little leisure for correspondence, – nevertheless I ought to
                  have replied to your last, on account of the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> bill which it contained, because my silence may perhaps have led you to suppose that
                  I was in some degree offended. Certainly it was by no means my intention in sending
                  you a copy of Madoc

                  </div> that you should pay me for it, – nor should you have done so. To have sent back the
                  note would have hurt you, &amp; implied <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> a displeasure which I did not feel, – as however you have overpaid by seven shillings
                  that which was intended as a mark of respect to a man of genius, – you must allow
                  me to send you the poem which I have in the press &amp; which will appear in the course
                  of two or three months.

                  </div> You will find something unlike any poem which you have never seen before, – by examining
                  its structure &amp; versification you may derive some advantage in your own compositions,
                  by learning what faults you have to avoid. That spirit of criticism which looks only
                  for faults, &amp; delights in exaggerating &amp; ridiculing them, is more mischievous to the
                  critic who employs it, than to the author on whom it is employed: – the man who suffers
                  himself to be actuated by such a spirit, if he does not begin with an incapacity of
                  feeling what is good, is sure to render himself incapable as he proceeds. But if you
                  read other poems in the same temper with which you scrutinized Madoc, every great
                  work which you peruse will render you more equal to the task which you have projected
                  for yourself.</p>
