               published <em>Pelayo</em>, a subject Southey dealt with in his <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814). Quintana served as secretary to the Cortes during the French invasion and
               produced a series of patriotic odes and proclamations. In 1808 he had republished
               <em>El Bernardo</em> (1624), Bernardo de Balbuena’s (1564–1627) epic on the legendary Spanish hero Bernardo
               del Carpio, whose exploits included slaying the French paladin Roland at the battle
               of Roncesvaux (778). Southey did acquire a copy – it was no. 3175 in the sale catalogue
               of his library.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
