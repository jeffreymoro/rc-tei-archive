               <div class="l">Moving among the trees, &amp; coming sounds</div>
               <div class="l">Were heard, as of a distant multitude.</div>
               <div class="l">Anon a company of horse &amp; foot</div>
               <div class="l">Advancing in disorderly array</div>
               <div class="l">Came up the vale: before them &amp; beside</div>
               <div class="l">Their torches flash’d on Sellas rippling stream,</div>
               <div class="l">Now gleam’d thro chesnut groves, –emerging now</div>

               <div class="l">Vanished in nearer vision, high-wrought hope</div>
               <div class="l">Departing, left the spirit pall’d &amp; blank.</div>
               <div class="l">No turband race, no sons of Africa</div>
               <div class="l">Were they who now came winding up the vale,</div>
               <div class="l">As waving wide before their horses feet</div>
               <div class="l">The torch-light floated, with its hovering glare</div>
               <div class="l">Blackening the incumbent &amp; surrounding night</div>
               <div class="l">Helmet &amp; breastplate glittered as they came,</div>
               <div class="l">And spears erect; &amp; <span class="strikethrough">x</span> nearer as they drew</div>
               <div class="l">Were the loose folds of female garments seen</div>
               <div class="l">On those who led the company. Who then</div>
               <div class="l">Had stood beside Pelayo, might have heard</div>
               <div class="l">The beating of his heart</div>
               <div class="l">But vainly there</div>
               <div class="l">Sought he with wistful eye the well-known forms</div>
               <div class="l">Beloved; &amp; plainly might it now be seen</div>
               <div class="l">That from some bloody conflict they return’d</div>
               <div class="l">Victorious, for at every saddle bow</div>
               <div class="l">A gory head was hung. Anon they stopt</div>
               <div class="l">Levelling in quick alarm their ready spears.</div>
               <div class="l">Hold! who goes there? cried one. A hundred tongues</div>
               <div class="l">Sent forth with one accord the glad reply,</div>
               <div class="l">Friends &amp; Asturians! – Onward moved the lights</div>
               <div class="l">The People knew their Lord.</div>
               <div class="l">Then what a shout</div>
               <div class="l">Rung thro the valley! From their clay-built nests</div>
               <div class="l">Beneath the overbrowing battlements,</div>
               <div class="l">Then first disturbd the affrighted martins fled</div>
               <div class="l">And uttering notes of terror short &amp; shrill</div>
               <div class="l">Amid the yellow glare &amp; lurid smoke</div>
               <div class="l">Wheeld giddily. Then plainly was it shown</div>
               <div class="l">How well the vassals loved their generous Lord,</div>
               <div class="l">How like a father the Asturian Prince</div>
               <div class="l">Was dear. They crowded round, they claspd his knees</div>
               <div class="l">They snatchd his hand, they fell upon his neck, –</div>
               <div class="l">They wept, – they blest Almighty Providence</div>
               <div class="l">Which had restored him thus from bondage free,</div>
               <div class="l">God was with them &amp; their good cause they said,</div>
               <div class="l">His hand was here, His shield was over them</div>
               <div class="l">His spirit was abroad, His power displayd,</div>
               <div class="l">And pointing to their bloody trophies then</div>
               <div class="l">They told Pelayo there he might behold</div>
               <div class="l">The first fruits of the harvest they should</div>
               <div class="l">Soon reap in the field of war. – Benignantly</div>
               <div class="l">With voice &amp; look &amp; gesture did the Prince</div>
               <div class="l">To these warm greetings of tumultuous joy</div>
               <div class="l">Respond; &amp; sure if at that moment aught</div>
               <div class="l">Could for awhile have overpowered those fears</div>
               <div class="l">Which from the inmost heart oer all his frame</div>
               <div class="l">Diffused their chilling influence, worthy pride</div>
               <div class="l">And sympathy of love &amp; joy &amp; hope,</div>
               <div class="l">Had then possessed him wholly. Even now</div>
               <div class="l">His spirit rose: the sense of power, the sight</div>
               <div class="l">Of his brave people ready where he led</div>
               <div class="l">To fight their countrys battles, &amp; the thought</div>
               <div class="l">Of instant action &amp; deliverance,</div>
               <div class="l">If Heaven which thus far had protected him</div>
               <div class="l">Should favour still, revived his heart, &amp; gave</div>
               <div class="l">Fresh impulse to its spring. In vain he sought</div>
               <div class="l">Amid that turbulent greeting to enquire</div>
               <div class="l">Where Gaudiosa was, his children where,</div>
               <div class="l">Who called them to the field, who captained them,</div>
               <div class="l">And how these women thus with arms &amp; death</div>
               <div class="l">Environed, came amid their company.</div>
               <div class="l">For yet amid the fluctuating light</div>
               <div class="l">And tumult of the crowd he knew them not.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Guisla was one. The Moors had found in her</div>

               <div class="l">Exchange delightful welcome, soul with soul,</div>
               <div class="l">Hers was the conscious eye that cannot chuse</div>
               <div class="l">But look to what it fears. She could not shun</div>
               <div class="l">His presence, &amp; the rigid smile constrain’d</div>

               <div class="l">Of obstinate guilt &amp; unrepentant shame.</div>
               <div class="l">Sullenly thus upon her mule she sate</div>
               <div class="l">Waiting the greeting which she did not dare</div>
               <div class="l">Bring on. But who is she that at her side</div>
               <div class="l">Upon a stately war horse eminent</div>
               <div class="l">Holds the loose rein with careless hand? A helm</div>
               <div class="l">Presses the clusters of her flaxen hair,</div>
               <div class="l">The shield is on her arm; her breast is maild,</div>
               <div class="l">A sword-belt is her girdle, &amp; right well</div>
               <div class="l">It may be seen that sword hath done its work</div>

               <div class="l">Is stiff with blood. An unregardant eye</div>
               <div class="l">As one whose thoughts were not of earth, she cast</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the turmoil round. One countenance</div>
               <div class="l">So strongly-markd, so passion worn was there,</div>
               <div class="l">That it recalled her mind. Ha! Maccabee!</div>
               <div class="l">Lifting her arm exultingly she cried,</div>

               <div class="l">With timely impulse now; for he had seen</div>
               <div class="l">His mothers face, &amp; at her sight the past</div>
               <div class="l">And present mingled like a frightful dream</div>
               <div class="l">Which from &lt;some&gt; dread reality derives</div>
               <div class="l">Its deepest horror. Adosinda’s voice</div>
               <div class="l">Dispersed the waking vision – Little deemd</div>
               <div class="l">Rusilla at that moment that the child</div>
               <div class="l">For whom her supplications day &amp; night</div>
               <div class="l">Were offered, breathd the living air. Her heart</div>
               <div class="l">Was calm; her placid countenance, tho grief</div>
               <div class="l">Deeper than time had left its traces there,</div>
               <div class="l">Retained its dignity serene; yet when</div>
               <div class="l">Siverian pressing thro the people, kissd</div>
               <div class="l">Her reverend hand, some quiet tears ran down</div>
               <div class="l">As she approachd the Prince, the crowd made way</div>
               <div class="l">Respectful. The maternal smile which bore</div>
               <div class="l">Her greeting, from Pelayo’s heart almost</div>
               <div class="l">Dispelld its boding. What he would have asked</div>
               <div class="l">She knew, &amp; bending from her palfrey said</div>

               of 900 killed and wounded and 1800 prisoners. Graham had defeated the French forces
               besieging Cadiz on 5 March 1811 at the Battle of Barrosa. This victory proved a significant
               boost to British morale, but had no wider strategic consequences. Southey disliked
               Graham both for his criticism of the Spanish army’s operations at Barrosa and his
               Whig opinions (he was MP for Perthshire 1794–1807).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
