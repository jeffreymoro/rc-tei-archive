            <p>Address: To/ C W Williams Wynn Esq<sup>r</sup> <br>Postmarks: OC/ 28/ 1813<br>MS: National Library of Wales, MS 4812D<br>Unpublished.</p>
            <div class="opener">
               <div class="salute">My dear Wynn</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I own I am afraid of recommending <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> into any military service. There is a gap in his history which cannot possibly be
               filled in his favour. When I wrote to him in 1807 or 8 – he was a Lieutenant in one
               of our militias, – &amp; the next news of him was that he had been recognized as my brother,
               a private in the 24<sup>th</sup> at Lisbon, – it was &lt;to&gt; this recognition that he owed his Portugueze commission,
               – &amp; the worst appearance at present is that he attributes it to his &lt;own&gt; good conduct.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>God knows I am not disposed to judge too hardly, – I did not know he was married
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Edward Southey had a female companion (a Miss Lack), but on making further enquiries
                           into her background and visiting her uncle, Southey discovered that they were not
                           married; see Southey to Edith Southey, 5 November [1813], Letter 2324.</span></div>
                  </div> – &amp; this places another difficulty in the way of his going abroad, <span class="strikethrough">for if</span> dependent however upon the character of his wife. If she be that kind of woman to
                  whom no other objection could be made than that it was imprudent to marry her, I cannot
                  but feel that he would not be justified in leaving her upon the steps to subsist as
                  she could. – You know how easy it is to dream of what one would wish; – if he be really
                  attached to his wife that circumstance which might seem at first to compleat his ruin <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> would in reality appear to me the best means of his redemption.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I incline to think that if he could obtain a decent subsistence from the stage he
               is safer in that way of life than in any other, nor have I any <span class="strikethrough">pride</span> &lt;feeling&gt; which could now be wounded by seeing him there. On the contrary I would
               use every means in my power for getting him an engagement in some respectable theatre,
               &amp; equipping him for it. The strong inclination which he has for this way of life is
               no proof that he has talents for it, but it is some presumption; &amp; very possibly he
               may have made the mistake of playing tragedy when his vein is in a contrary direction.
               If he were steadily &amp; respectably fixed in his <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> unlucky vocation the best hope for him would be that he might become a dramatic writer:
               for if my judgement of his intellectual character be as pert as it has unfortunately
               proved of his moral disposition, he has abilities sufficient for any thing.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>If you have seen his wife tell me what her age appears, &amp; what sort of countenance
                  she has. I would have made enquiry about her from Kemble

                  </div> if I had known her former name. Whether he found her a vagabond or made her one is
                  a material consideration. Should the latter prove to be the case <span class="strikethrough">which is</span> as is most likely &amp; as on the whole I am inclined to hope, it would certainly confirm
                  my opinion that he ought not to try his fortune in the army again. – In this case
                  my present notion that I would <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> have them to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> to remain with me <span class="strikethrough">while I xx</span> till some decent engagement could be procured for them, – but of course I must be
                  perfectly satisfied with her history &amp; character before this can be hinted at.</p>
