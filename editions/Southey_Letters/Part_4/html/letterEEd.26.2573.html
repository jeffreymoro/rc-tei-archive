                           his command at Marseilles under the Bourbons and was studiously neutral during the

                  </div> at Toulon, – that place in particular should have been held by a Royalist. Buonaparte
                  has shown more real spirit in this than in any former action of his life, &amp; it is
                  a frightful lesson concerning <span class="ital">armies</span>, which comes strongly in aid of my old doctrine that no country can ever be safe
                  from foreign &amp; domestic enemies till every man in it be trained to the use of arms.
                  But what a world of reforms does this presuppose, for before this can be done, all
                  men must be properly educated, &amp; all men made to feel that their own individual interests
                  are inseparably connected with the continuance &amp; preservation of &lt;the&gt; existing order
                  of things.</p>

               ago. In the first place some 300,000 troops who were then prisoners! Worse than this
               is the feeling of the Italians &amp; Swiss, – perhaps of the Saxons. Had Italy been made
               an independent kingdom as it ought to have been, Buonaparte durst not have moved,
               for on every side Louis would have had allies.</p>
            <p class="indent1">However At him Trojan! There is but one course to pursue, the Allies must steer clear
               of the sin of the Anti Jacobin war; they must stick to Louis, &amp; fight his battles
               in France, where there is certainly a Bourbon party in some provinces. I could almost
               persuade myself that the work of retribution was imperfect as long as Paris should
               be left standing, – that Marshal must fight Marshal, Frenchman kill Frenchman in battle,
               <span class="strikethrough">hang</span> all prisoners on both sides be hanged, &amp; the Accursed City be burnt to the ground,
