                           a selection of manuscript letters from Wolfe to his family, possibly with a view to
                           their publication. No edition appeared at this time.</span></div>
                  </div> I read them &lt;carefully&gt; &amp; am glad so to have done, but the utmost ingenuity could

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Perhaps you may get scent of other <span class="strikethrough">letter</span> parts of his correspondence, – it is very clear to me that these family letters must
                  be the least interesting of all he can have written, – for Wolfe’s father &amp; mother

                  &amp; sunshine to this kind of intercourse. If the present series is printed, his name
                  will probably secure a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> sale to a certain extent but the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> publication will do little toward raising that name. I have the highest admiration
                  for Wolfe: the last scene of his life was eminently heroic, &amp; he had a true sense
                  of duty <span class="strikethrough">for</span> toward his country. But the intellect which he undoubtedly possessed is seldom called
