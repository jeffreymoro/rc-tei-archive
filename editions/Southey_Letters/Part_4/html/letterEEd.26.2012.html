                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Henry Brougham, whom Southey believed was encouraging parliament to summon him to
                           Westminster to explain comments he had published in the Edinburgh Annual Register.
                           These had been drawn to parliament’s attention in a long aside in the Edinburgh Review,
                           18 (August 1811), 420–423n, which had questioned whether the ‘virulent personal abuse
                           … levelled at the most respectable members of the Legislature’ in the Edinburgh Annual
                           Register was in breach of Parliamentary privilege and hinted that action against the
                           author and publishers might be taken. In the event, nothing happened.</span></div>
                  </div> I believe in every instance the text of his speech will justify the comment. You have
                  heard of <span class="strikethrough">x xxxxx</span> taking <span class="strikethrough">the ear</span> the wrong sow by the ear, – he had better take a wild boar by the ear than hawl me
                  up to London upon this quarrel. I should tell him it was true that I had said his
                  speeches were translated into French &amp; circulated thro all the departments of France,
                  but I had not said what has since come to my knowledge, – that when they were thus
                  circulated nobody believed them genuine, – nobody believed it possible that such speeches
                  could have been uttered by an Englishman. I should ask the House (that is his side
                  of the House &amp; of course in that <span class="ital">humble</span> language becoming a person at the bar) – at what time they would be pleased to let
                  their transactions become matter for history, – &amp; I should give <span class="strikethrough">him</span> &lt;the party&gt; a gentle hint not to delay that time too long, for <span class="strikethrough">when a few years had reduced their</span> reputations like every thing else find their level, &amp; if he &amp; such as he do not get
                  into history soon, – they may run a risk of not getting into it at all. I should speak
                  of the situation in which Spain &amp; England stand to each other, &amp; contrast my own feelings
                  with those which he has continually expressed. I should appeal to the whole tenour
                  of the book whether the design of the writer was to vilify Parliament, or to bring
                  the Government into contempt. And as an Englishman, – a man of letters – &amp; an historian
                  I should claim my privileges.</p>
