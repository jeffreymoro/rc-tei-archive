            <p class="indent1">It would be needless I trust, my dear friend, for me to express the concern which
               I feel at the information which you communicate respecting your concerns in Brazil,
               – even if I could tell how to express it. Something of this kind you imparted to me
               when we saw each other at Richmond last year, but one of your letters led me to believe
               that that business had been settled to your wishes. Is this then a new evil, or were
               you deceived when you expected that the affair was terminated? And is there – for
               I cannot help referring to selfish considerations, – is there any reason for your
               friends to apprehend that the mismanagement of your concerns at Rio Janeiro may make
               it necessary for you to go there yourself? – This you would probably regard as the
               worst consequence, – the loss of property may be repaired, &amp; the success of one year
               make amends for the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> reverses of another, but time past in a foreign country – away from our nearest &amp;
               dearest ties, is an irretrievable loss of comfort &amp; happiness.</p>
