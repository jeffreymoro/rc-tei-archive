                           return to Keswick in order to provide for his family (Cottle, Early Recollections:

                           day, outlining his addiction and suggesting he put himself under the care of Edward
                           Long Fox (1760–1834), who ran a private asylum (E. L. Griggs (ed.), The Collected

                  that <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> while acknowledging the guilt of the habit, he imputes it still to morbid bodily causes,
                  whereas after every possible allowance is made for these, every person who has witnessed
                  his habits, knows that for the greater &amp; infinitely the greater part, – inclination
                  &amp; indulgence are the motives. <span class="strikethrough">Xx</span> It seems dreadful to say this with his expressions before me, but it is so &amp; I know
                  it to be so, from my own observations &amp; that of all <span class="strikethrough">who</span> with whom he has lived. The Morgans

                  </div> with great difficulty &amp; perseverance <span class="ital">did</span> break him of the habit, at a time when his ordinary consumption of laudanum was from
                  two quarts a week to a pint a day. He suffered dreadfully during the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> first abstinence so much so as to say it was better to die than to endure his present
                  feelings. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MorganMary">M<sup>rs</sup> Morgan</a> resolutely replied it was indeed better that he should die, than that he should continue
                  to live as he had been living. It angered him at the time, but the effort was persevered
                  in. To what then was the relapse owing? I believe to this cause, – that no use was
                  made of recovered health &amp; spirits, – that time past on in idleness, till the lapse
                  of time brought with it a sense of neglected duties, &amp; then <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> relief was again sought for a self accusing mind, in bodily feelings which when the
                  stimulus ceased to act, added only to the load of self accusation. This <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> is an insanity of that species which none but the Souls physician can cure. Unquestionably
                  restraint would do for him as much as it did when the Morgans tried it, but I do not
                  see the slightest reason for thinking it would be more permanent. – This too I ought
                  to say, that all the medical men to whom <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> has made his confession, have uniformly ascribed the evil not to bodily ailments,
                  but to indulgence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The restraint which would effectually cure him is that which no person can impose
                  upon him. Could he be compelled to a certain quantity of labour for his family every
                  day, – the pleasure of having done it would make his heart glad, &amp; the sane mind would
                  make the body sane. I see nothing so advisable for him as that he should come here.
                  My advice would be that he should <span class="strikethrough">go to</span> &lt;visit&gt; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PooleThomas">Poole</a> for two or three weeks to freshen himself, &amp; recover spirits, which new scenes never
                  fail to give him. While there he may consult his friends at Birmingham &amp; Liverpool
                  on the fitness of lecturing at those places, at each of which he has friends, &amp; would
                  I should think beyond all doubt, be succesful. He must be very unfortunate if he did
                  not raise from 50 to 100£ at the two! But whether he can do this or not, here it is
                  that he ought to be. He knows in what manner he will be received – by his children
                  with joy, – by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">his wife</a>, not with tears if she can controul them, – certainly not with reproaches, – by me
                  only with encouragements. He has sources of direct emolument open to him in the Courier,
