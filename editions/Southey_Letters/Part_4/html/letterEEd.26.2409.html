               of Prussia 1797–1840). The poems were published in book form as <em>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty

         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">11.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey’s feud with Jeffrey continued unabated. The notes to <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> had attacked the personalities and politics of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. The review of the <em>Carmen</em> in <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, 22 (January 1814), 447–454, retorted: ‘For our own parts, when we are seriously
               occupied with the destinies of Europe, or of mankind, we should think very contemptibly
               of ourselves, if we could permit the recollection of our differences with Mr Southey
               to intrude either into our writings or our thoughts’ (452), before going on to criticise
               his support of the Spanish and acceptance of the Laureateship. <em>The Times</em>, 7 April 1814 carried an article criticising the <em>Edinburgh</em>’s remarks; and <em>The Times</em>, 21 April 1814, reprinted the ‘Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte’,
               in a corrected version and retitled ‘Ode; Written in January, 1814’. A short headnote
               again defended Southey against the criticism levelled against him in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. Southey’s ‘sturdy friend’ was probably John Stoddart (1773–1856; <em>DNB</em>), who played a prominent role in <em>The Times</em> until 1817.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
