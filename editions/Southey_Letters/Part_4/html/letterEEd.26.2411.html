            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My main employment at present is upon Roderick.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> The poem is drawing towards its completion; in fact, the difficulty may be considered
                  as over, and yet a good deal of labour remains, for I write slowly and blot much.
                  However, land is in sight, and I feel myself near enough the end of this voyage to
                  find myself often considering upon what course I shall set sail for the next. Something
                  of magnitude I must always have before me to occupy me in the intervals of other pursuits,
                  and to think of when nothing else requires attention. But I am less determined respecting
                  the subject of my next poem than I ever was before when a vacancy was so near. The
                  New England Quaker story

                           was published posthumously.</span></div>
                  </div> is in most forwardness, but I should prefer something which in its tone of feeling
                  would differ more widely from that on which I am at present busied. As to looking
                  for a <span class="ital">popular</span> subject, this I shall never do; for, in the first place, I believe it to be quite
                  impossible to say what would be popular, and, secondly, I should not willingly acknowledge
                  to myself, that I was influenced by any other motive than the fitness of my story
                  to my powers of execution.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The Laureateship will certainly have this effect upon me, that it will make me produce
               more poetry than I otherwise should have done. For many years I had written little,
               and was permitting other studies to wean me from it more and more. But it would be
               unbecoming to accept the only public mark of honour which is attached to the pursuit,
               and at the same time withdraw from the profession. I am therefore reviving half-forgotten
               plans, forming new ones, and studying my old masters with almost as much ardour and
               assiduity as if I were young again. Some of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> papers yonder strikingly resemble what I used to do twenty years ago, and what I
               am beginning to do again.</p>

                  </div> there is in it, as in all his poems, great life, spirit, and originality, though the
