                  </div> for the injustice with which it was laid on, I would rather have seen it continued
                  for another seven years than that it should have been thus surrendered to a coalition
                  of the mob &amp; the Squirearchy. In my own judgement it ought to have been continued
                  one or perhaps two years longer, in order to afford Government as much facility as
                  possible in winding up the accounts of so long &amp; arduous a contest. This would have
                  been creditable to our national character; – but the people have no sense, &amp; the Ministers
