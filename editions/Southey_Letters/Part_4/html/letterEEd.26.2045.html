               <p>I have a letter this evening from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> which I would inclose to you, if it were not for the time which would be lost in sending
                  it round for a frank. The sum of it is that it would relieve his mind from some very
                  natural &amp; very unpleasant feelings, if you would allow him to procure another publisher
                  for this Commentary, into whose hands he will deliver it ready for publication, &amp;
                  with whom he will settle for you.

                           Bernard Trotter’s (1775–1818; DNB) laudatory account of his erstwhile employer Charles
                           James Fox. Although the Commentary was printed, Murray eventually suppressed its publication,
                           refusing to issue a book that attacked the Tory government and was dedicated to James
                           Madison (1751–1836), President of the United States 1809–1817, with whom Britain was
                           about to go to war. The Commentary was not published until 1907. See Robert Southey

                  to the perusal of the book as a pleasure. – What he wishes will be no inconvenience
                  to you, &amp; no doubt you will readily assent to it, – “I confess, he says, I hesitatingly
                  propose this, for I fear even you could not now speak of this to the author in any
                  way that would not offend him. I will however leave it entirely to you, &amp; if you say
                  nothing about it, I will publish it without any farther trouble to you or M<sup>r</sup> L. however painful, from my peculiar situation, if will prove to me.” – These are
                  his words. For my own part I should feel any fear of giving offence as the only thing
                  which could occasion it. It is but for you to signify your assent to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> in a single line, &amp; the business is settled without any injury to any persons feelings.
                  That it is purely a matter of feeling with him I verily believe. His not reading the
                  MSS. was a compliment to the author, &amp; a mark of confidence in him.
