               <p>Here I arrived last night, &amp; having written to Price

                  </div> from Bristol, found a note from him, &amp; saw him this morning. We went to Lloyd

                  </div> &amp; I have come away from him with quite as bad an opinion as you can possibly entertain.
                  He affects to be offended at the manner in which his last letter was answered, as
                  if throwing upon him the responsibility of farther proceedings, &amp; when I told him
                  that he required an answer by return of post, which was impossible, &amp; that he had
                  repeatedly been written to since, urging him to proceed, – he shuffled a good deal,
                  &amp; at last declared upon his word of honour, that he had never received a letter from
                  you since. – I have little doubt that this is a lie, &amp; Price has as little doubt of
                  it as myself – but what could be said to a fellow who extricates himself by such means
                  – or what is to be expected from him? – I urged him however to write to you immediately,
                  &amp; this he has promised to do. He says also that he will proceed without delay both
                  against Mason &amp; Dausey,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> – that it is not his way to let affairs <span class="ital">mildew</span> in his hands as this has done, but that the delay has taken place because he was hurt
                  &amp;c – . Price thinks he is unwilling to offend Dausey. However it is now brought to
                  this point, that if he does not directly write to you &amp; take proper measures, nothing
                  is to be done but to get rid of him &amp; place the business in other hands. If you find
                  it necessary to do this, my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BrowneWade">Mr Browne</a> desires me to offer his services; – he has but lately settled in Ludlow but as he
                  is a man of <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> good fortune, &amp; has bought probably the best house in the town, <span class="strikethrough">any</span> &lt;a&gt; Lawyer whom he might recommend would feel as well disposed to discharge his duty
                  under his inspection, as Lloyd seems inclined to neglect it – from fear of the Squire.</p>

               <p>At Taunton I found that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">my aunt Mary</a> is likely to save property to the amount of 4 or 500£ out of the wreck, – consisting
                  of cottages &amp; land bought after the will was made, &amp; falling to her by the peculiar
                  tenure of Taunton Dean.
