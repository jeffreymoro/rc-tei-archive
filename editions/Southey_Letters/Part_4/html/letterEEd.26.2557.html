               It is four months since the discharge began, first it was like water, it has since
               been <span class="strikethrough">a</span> icherous or fetid, – always <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> very small. The ear swelled &amp; gathered, &amp; in that state I believe was <span class="strikethrough">lanced too soon &amp;</span> improperly treated, – having been first blistered, &amp; afterward lanced too soon; –
               for a long time it has been left alone, merely keeping it clean &amp; now a <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> fistulous opening is formed.

               convenient. I am uneasy about this, – for I do not know the extent of the evil. The
               child suffers neither pain nor inconvenience, but I suspect that such things are very
               difficult of cure, &amp; cannot tell from the nature of the plan how it is to be operated
