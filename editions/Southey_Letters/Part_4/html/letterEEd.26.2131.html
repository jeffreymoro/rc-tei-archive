            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I found your letter on my return from a twelve days absence during which I made a
                  round of 300 miles, mostly on foot, going eastward as far as Durham, &amp; returning by
                  Wensley-dale &amp; the Yorkshire caves. My holydays are shorter than yours, – but my work,
                  thank Heaven, of a less fatiguing nature. I must postpone my journey to London till
                  Spring, for the purpose of getting out the Register
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811 (1813).</span></div>
                  </div> for 1811 in March, – a thing deemed esseantial to its interest, &amp; perhaps to its continuance.
                  It will not be difficult for me to do this, – but I doubt its continuance more than
                  another year. It sells well in Scotland, &amp; hardly has any sale in England. The London
                  booksellers are mostly interested in the other Registers, &amp; if they do not, as there
                  is strong reason to suspect, unfairly keep this back, it is certain that they make
                  little or no attempt to forward it. – This probable defalcation of [MS torn] would
                  seem at first a very serious evil to a man in my situation, but I dare say by the
                  time it comes I shall not consider it so. The marketable value of my time increases
                  every year, &amp; I am not without some expectation that even my poetry will prove a lucrative
                  commodity at last. The 2<sup>d</sup> edition of Kehama is so nearly sold that a third is sent to press.

                  </div> My profits on the two are about 260£. – there is hope then that a Poem may hereafter
                  produce as much as a volume of the Register. Perhaps I shall quicken my pace with
                  Pelayo
