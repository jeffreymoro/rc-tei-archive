            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker<br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, ‘The Letters of Robert

               <p>I suppose Senhora your letter has given me some vexation, if the utter astonishment
                  into which it has thrown me would as yet let me feel it. — but you know when a man
                  is knocked down in battle, the blow prevents him from feeling the wound. If you fancied
                  in any expression of mine that you perceived the language of wounded pride &amp; wounded
                  feeling, — in your fancy alone could it possibly have existed. Nature has given me
                  enough of both, but time has taught me not to make a fool’s use of the one, &amp; the
                  other being of the right kind, has never been in any danger of being misdirected.
                  What I said, I do not remember; — for it was in perfect good-humour &amp; forgotten as
                  soon as said; — but whatever it was, the Devil take to, I say now, &amp; no farther comment
                  will I make upon it. You ought to have known that I neither could have been offended
                  myself or have intended to hurt you, — &amp; you ought to be cart’s-tailed for not knowing
                  it, &amp; waggon’s-tailed for chewing the cud of your anger for ten days. Enough, &amp; too
                  much of this.
