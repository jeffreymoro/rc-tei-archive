                  it is nevertheless a considerable relief to me to find that these unpleasant symptoms
                  are the effect of the remedy, &amp; not consequences of the disease, for they are much

            <p class="indent1">I came back yesterday from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a> after a three days absence. My motive for leaving home was to give myself a dose
               of different air, &amp; shake up the solids by a good round walk – in addition to these
               benefits I obtained that of a thorough rain-bath on my return, for which I am no worse.
               There was a large parcel awaiting me, so that my return would have been a joyful one
               if I had not found three of the children indisposed; – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Moon</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</a> with a feverish attack, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">the infant</a> with an oppression of the chest which has been very prevalent among children, &amp; has
               killed that robust child where <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> lodged, &amp; one other in the town. To day they are all better, yet none of them well
               enough to make me feel quite at ease, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is now sickening in her turn.</p>

                  half dozen of my own friends, should like it. – I am sorry to see that a number of
                  errors have crept into the printing since I corrected the proofs, &amp; which I am certain
                  did not exist at that time. In several instances two paragraphs are printed as one,
                  when there was a natural &amp; necessary division. Pray notice the fashion of the typography,
                  &amp; complain that the first two or three sheets are not correct in this respect. It
                  is a great improvement &amp; any public mention of it in this way will go far towards
