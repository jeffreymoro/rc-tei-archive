         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9.. </span><span class="noteBody">The battle of the Basque Roads had generated considerable public controversy. Although
               they achieved some success, the British fleet failed to destroy the French navy completely.
               Captain Thomas Cochrane, later 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775–1860; <em>DNB</em>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of the battle, accused
               his commanding officer, the evangelical Admiral James Gambier, Baron Gambier (1756–1833;
               <em>DNB</em>), of being reluctant to pursue the attack and thus achieve a complete victory. Cochrane
               was also an MP with a reputation for exposing abuses of office, and, in the weeks
               after the battle, he pursued his campaign against Gambier via parliamentary speeches.
               Gambier demanded a court-martial at which he was exonerated and, by implication, Cochrane
               was convicted of libelling a superior officer. Whilst Gambier received public thanks
               from parliament for his actions in the battle, Cochrane was not permitted to rejoin
               his ship for a few months. When he received new orders to serve in the Meditteranean,
               Cochrane refused and went on half-pay, devoting his time to exposing abuses in the
               Admiralty.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
