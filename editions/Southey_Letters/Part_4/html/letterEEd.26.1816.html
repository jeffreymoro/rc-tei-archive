               at leisure in a better season, that I will say come with all speed. Your place must
               be taken in the Carlisle &amp; Glasgow mail as far as Penrith. Now there are two Carlisle
               mails, the one runs thro Manchester, &amp; they are rascals enough at the coach office
               to take travellers in, <span class="strikethrough">Carlisle</span> &lt;tho&gt; it involves a change of coaches on the road, &lt;an additional charge&gt; &amp; two hours
               delay at midnight in a miserable common room at Manchester. You must come by the Newark
               &amp; Doncaster road. This mail used to set out from the <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BullandMouth">Bull &amp; Mouth</a>, &amp; I suppose still does. It will land you at Penrith between 11 &amp; 12 &lt;the second
               day&gt; &amp; from thence you must take chaise for <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> – 17 miles. The whole journey is performed in 43 hours.</p>
