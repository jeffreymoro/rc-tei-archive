               <p>This is certain that I saw the thing: that it was not a young eel; &amp; that I had never
                  seen any thing like it before. I could distinguish no head or tail, but at one end
                  something like what I suppose the root of the hair would appear after maceration,
                  – stringy, or fibrous. I saw too, most decidedly, the hair in the middle when the
                  conglomeration of life was stript off with the two nails. I incline to the opinion
                  that the animal, if it may so be called, is <span class="ital">one</span>, tho perhaps not <span class="ital">indivisible</span>; for I cannot conceive that any joint motion of an aggregate of animalculæ could
                  have produced that strength &amp; apparent unity of motion. No snake or eel ever writhed
                  with more vivacity. The colour is that of a leech. The hairs were plucked from the
                  tail <span class="strikethrough">x xx</span> of a living horse; but I failed in learning precisely where or how long they had been <span class="strikethrough">imme x pla</span> kept in water, for the room was full of persons all talking at once. – But I will
                  apply to the Maker
