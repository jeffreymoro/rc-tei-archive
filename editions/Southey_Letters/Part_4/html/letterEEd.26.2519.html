                           of his cousin Barré Charles Roberts, who had died in 1810 aged 21. It was reviewed
                           by Southey in the Quarterly Review, 12 (January 1815), 509–519.</span></div>
                  </div> I have read it with great interest and great admiration; could the cause of its publication
                  have been forgotten I might have added with unmingled pleasure.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">We know too many instances of promising talents cut off in the bud, but I remember
               no instance in any way resembling this. The good sense, the careful research the playful
               temper which the letters display are truly delightful; and the picture of filial and
               fatherly affection might be held up as the ideal of all that can be desired between
               parent &amp; child.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Books are more durable than marbles; &amp; while this volume <span class="strikethrough">lasts</span> exists, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobertsBarreCharles">Barré</a> will be known and admired. That he would have attained a distinguished reputation
               if a longer life had been granted him I cannot doubt. Perhaps under any other circumstances
               he would not have been so entirely laid open to the world; and if he had not been
               made known so well, however distinguished his attainments, he would never have been
               admired or lamented so much.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You, Sir, have the consolation of reflecting that everything which the wisest and
                  fondest parent would do for the welfare and happiness of his child was done, and of
                  knowing that what death has taken away death will restore. One who has felt this latter
                  consolation may be allowed to touch upon it.
