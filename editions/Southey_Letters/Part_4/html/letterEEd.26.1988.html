               <p>You know that I would write anything for you as readily and with as much pleasure,
                  and with as great a desire to do it, as for any person living.

                           Mary in December 1811. Southey attempted the task, but soon admitted his failure;
                           see Southey to John May, 8 December 1811, Letter 1996.</span></div>
                  </div> You will therefore give due weight to my reasons for not attempting what you now desire
                  of me. First, the inscription ought to be – in Latin, decidedly; – so it appears to
                  me. Now I have not written a Latin sentence these seventeen years,

                  </div> and, moreover, have read so much of the middle-age Latin, that classical Latinity
                  is one of those things which I have forgotten. This I am by no means ashamed of confessing:
                  on the contrary, it is to my credit that I can afford to forget it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But you will say it may be in English verse – which alone I could do, – having never
                  attempted the lapidary style of composition. This I could do had there been time for
                  it. It is true, little time is required for composing ten or fifteen lines, when the
                  matter is once ready; but it might be weeks or months before I could conceive in what
                  form it ought to be cast. There is no sitting down to these things doggedly. Fifteen

                  </div> I could have answered any of these calls on demand, because I was more easily satisfied
                  with myself. Two instances of later occurrence will show you the state of my ability
                  now. I was requested to write two epitaphs by different persons, and very desirous
                  in both cases of doing it: in the one because I knew and loved the dead almost as
                  if she had been my sister;

                           in Minor Poems, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 129–130, as ‘Inscription XVII. Epitaph’.</span></div>
                  </div> Both were fine subjects for monumental inscriptions, and this I immediately felt,
                  and neither of them employed me an hour, but I was six weeks before I could perceive
                  in what manner to shape the one inscription, and three months on the other; and I
                  can safely affirm that no day passed without the subject recurring to my mind, and
                  in some degree harassing me. Heaven knows how long it might be before I could do anything,
                  and when it were done it might very probably be worth very little! You see, therefore,
                  that I have no chance of having verse of mine engraved on silver. If I could do it
                  to my own satisfaction I would most cheerfully, though there are two poets in the
                  family, by either of whom an inscription might be supplied.

                           Portuguese. Edited by Hipolito Jose da Costa (1774–1823), it was printed in London
                           and ran from 1808–1822. It was critical of the Portuguese monarchy and advocated liberal
                           ideas. Southey possessed a complete set, no. 3203 in the sale catalogue of his library.
                           The ‘treaties’ were probably the agreements between Britain and Portugal in 1807–1808
                           for the Portuguese Court to flee to Brazil under British protection and to open Brazil
                           to trade with ‘friendly’ nations i.e. primarily Britain; and a formal Treaty of Frien…</span></div>
                  </div> Do you see that work? The editor’s parallel between the English and Portuguese constitutions
                  is exceedingly able, and I would wish nothing better for Portugal or Brazil than to
                  see its ministers acting upon such principles as this writer holds out. But they go
                  on ill in Brazil. If things can be kept quiet there, the tendency of society now is
                  to mend itself. The English will act upon the people there as they did at Lisbon and
                  Porto, – soften down their intolerance, and teach them commercial industry. What is
                  to be feared is, that the abuses of the Government will increase the disaffection
                  of the subjects, and that the principles of their neighbours on the Plata will spread
                  among them. The provocations which the Spanish Americans have received are very great,
                  I fully admit, but not such as to justify them. I have a good many B. Ayres “Gazettes”

                  total subjugation of the Peninsula, because that subjugation would seem to justify
                  them, and would remove all obstacles to a free commerce with Great Britain. The more
                  I think of Spanish America, the worse the prospect appears. For the mother country
                  I do not regard the separation as eventually an evil, except that, as in our case
                  with North America, the cause of the separation will always remain a blot upon her

               Jose da Costa (1774–1823), it was printed in London and ran from 1808–1822. It was
               critical of the Portuguese monarchy and advocated liberal ideas. Southey possessed
               a complete set, no. 3203 in the sale catalogue of his library. The ‘treaties’ were
               probably the agreements between Britain and Portugal in 1807–1808 for the Portuguese
               Court to flee to Brazil under British protection and to open Brazil to trade with
               ‘friendly’ nations i.e. primarily Britain; and a formal Treaty of Friendship (1810).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               scholarship. In 1792 Reed had tried, and failed, to prevent the printer of <em>The Flagellant</em> from revealing Southey’s name to the authorities at Westminster School; see Southey
