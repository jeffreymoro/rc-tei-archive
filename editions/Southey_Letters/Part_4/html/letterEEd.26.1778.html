                           the famous Long Main cock fight.</span></div>
                  </div> I found your Poem

                  </div> lying on the table, – a provoking engagement called me from it for two or three hours,
                  but notwithstanding this, &amp; my obstinate habit of getting early to bed, I did not
                  go to rest till I had finished the book. Every readers first thought, when he begins
                  to think at all, will be to compare you with yourself, – if I may judge from my own
                  feelings the Lady will be a greater favourite than either of her elder brethren.

                  </div> There is in all the same skilful inscrutability of story till the artist is pleased
                  to touch the spring which lays the whole <span class="strikethrough">mechanism</span> machine open, – but while <span class="strikethrough">on</span> the plot is <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> thus well wound up in the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> &lt;new poem&gt; I think the narrative is more uniformly perspicuous than in the two former <span class="strikethrough">poems</span>. There is in all <span class="strikethrough">the same</span> &lt;a&gt; like originality &amp; beauty of circumstances, – I am not willing to admit that some
                  of the situations in the Lay &amp; Marmion <span class="ital">can</span> be outdone, – &amp; if I thought they <span class="ital">were</span> outdone last night, &amp; still incline to think so, it is probably because new impressions
                  are more vivid than the strongest recollection.</p>

                  the story, my admiration of the things themselves does not prevent me from thinking
                  them misplaced. – your title is likely to be a popular one, – &amp; for that very reason
                  I wish it had not been chosen. Of course it led me to expect some tale of Merlin, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> &lt;or&gt; King Arthurs days, – but what <span class="strikethrough">it</span> is of <span class="strikethrough">some</span> &lt;real&gt; consequence to one who loves old lays is that whenever hereafter the Lady of

                           love with Lancelot.</span></div>
                  </div> – &amp; in this way a sort of offence against antiquity has been committed. This is something
                  in the manner of Momus’s criticism

                  you have a right to expect, which you deserve, &amp; which you will find. – The portrait
                  seems more like the more I look at it, – &amp; my friend Camp is &lt;now&gt; doubly immortalized.
