                  – but these are irrelevant to the immediate object. It would not be possible from
                  these papers to do any thing <span class="strikethrough">x</span> more than give the dates of M<sup>r</sup> Walpole life &amp; professional appointments, accompanied with a general eulogium &amp; with
