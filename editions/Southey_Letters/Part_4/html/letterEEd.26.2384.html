               with a case of this most rightly – named disorder? <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry Bedford</a> has had it. And do you know any remedy for it, besides the slow one of patience,
               or the, in this case, impracticable one of change of air? It is curious that the disease
               should be undistinguishable from hooping cough by any other circumstances than its
               not being infectious, – which means I suppose in other words that <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> the hooping cough in the very rare instances of its recurrence is always mitigated

               <p>I am very ill pleased at the aspect of public affairs. A moving mind is equally wanted
                  at home &amp; abroad. It is disheartening to see that the experience not only of former
                  times, but &lt;even&gt; of their own is lost upon our statesmen. They themselves made the
                  peace of Amiens, &amp; they have the execrable example of the peace of Utrecht before
