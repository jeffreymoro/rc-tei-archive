               <p>One reason why you have not for so long time heard from me you will readily have imagined,
                  – knowing how idly I am disposed to pass my time, &amp; how many employments there are
                  for me, whenever I sit down to the desk. Another has been that I have very long been
                  expecting to see the end of your old acquaintance Kehama,

                           visited Mrs Dolignon’s house when he was at school at Westminster and was very close
                           to her son, John, who was at Charterhouse and then Trinity College, Cambridge (BA
                           1797, MA 1800). In 1811 John Dolignon married Eliza Yonge (dates unknown), daughter
                           of William Johnson Yonge (1752–1844), Vicar of Swaffham in Norfolk. This match gave
