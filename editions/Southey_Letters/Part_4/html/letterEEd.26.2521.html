                  to be perfomed with some respect, would you hoist it over? &amp; from what part of the

                  become popular, till time has made it so. It is like an acorn upon Latrigg now. The

                  </div> He tells me last night that tho the custom ought to be abolished, it is not yet, &amp;
                  therefore I must write one: &amp; he holds out a vague sort of prospect of its abolition,
                  upon which very little dependance can be placed. You may be sure I care very little
                  about this. An immediate &amp; public abolition of so idle a custom would <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> reflect credit upon the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a> but as for me, it may very possibly be more to my credit that it should continue;
                  for subjects can never be wanting to a man who looks at public events as I do, in
                  their causes &amp; consequences. So instead of <span class="ital">pesting</span> the ode (that French word is better than either our synonims in c or in d,) I set
                  about it; formed the plan immediately, &amp; have today written 37 lines; – which considering
                  I had a headache in the morning, &amp; took a humming dose of magnesia at two o clock
                  to get rid of it, is pretty well. If you were a medical man you would think it a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> curious fact that this dose should have performed its work in the course of two <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> hours: – it has carried away the head aches, – &amp; I should have written <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> another stanza of the ode, instead of taking up this letter for your lordship, if
                  I had not <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> wished to get it as much out of my mind as possible before I go to bed.</p>

               literally like dust: we could see it beginning to rise far up under Brandelhow, white
               as smoke or as a morning mist, gathering &amp; growing all the way to the bottom of the
               lake, &amp; there dispersed as far as the tempest could carry it. The report from the
