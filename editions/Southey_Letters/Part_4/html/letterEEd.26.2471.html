               <p>You know there prevails an unlucky opinion in the world respecting Wales, that it
                  never produced a man of genius; as if nature having bestowed great care in bringing
                  the mutton of the principality to perfection, left the men thereof in a very unfinished
                  state. I have more than once been driven to a nonplus in opposing this wicked opinion,

               since my promotion to a dignity, which they seem to regard as curates do the archiepiscopal

               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EvansGreeton">a Welsh herdsman in the Vale of Clwyd</a>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">He tells me that his father died when he was seven years of age, leaving him nothing
               to depend upon but a knowledge of reading writing &amp; the principles of <span class="strikethrough">arithmetic</span> &lt;grammar&gt;, which must needs have been little enough. That for nine years &amp; a half
               he has tended the herds of a farmer between Ruthin &amp; Denbigh. That thro the indulgence
               of a neighbouring gentleman (whom he has not named) he possesses many advantages,
               &amp; he requests permission to send me specimens of his compositions in prose &amp; verse
               that I may advise him whether to submit them to public notice or let them rest in
               oblivion. The most remarkable part of the letter is that he <span class="strikethrough">says he is</span> seems to be perfectly contented. He says that his situation is comfortable, that
               he has no wish to change it, &amp; that his highest ambition is the acquaintance of learned
               men. Whether he will prove poet or not remains to be seen, – but he is certainly an
               extraordinary man, &amp; seems to possess that wisdom which is more rare &amp; far more valuable
               than any brilliancy of talents.</p>
