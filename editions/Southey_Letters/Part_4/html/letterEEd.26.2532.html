                  </div> You will find a good deal of characteristic matter in this portion of the history.
                  I happen to have perfect materials for the cabinet deliberation at Lisbon, – a whole
                  series of authentic papers in ms. They are very curious, &amp; show how compleatly Catholicism
                  was the great moving principle.</p>
