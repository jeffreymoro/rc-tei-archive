            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Thus long had Roderick heard her powerful words</div>
               <div class="l">In silence, awed before her; but his soul</div>
               <div class="l">Was fill’d the while with swelling sympathy,</div>
               <div class="l">And now with impulse not to be restrain’d</div>
               <div class="l">The feeling overpowerd him. Hear me too,</div>
               <div class="l">Auria, &amp; Spain &amp; Heaven! he cried; &amp; thou</div>
               <div class="l">Who risest thus above mortality,</div>
               <div class="l">Sufferer &amp; Patriot, Saint &amp; Heroine,</div>
               <div class="l">The Servant &amp; the Chosen of the Lord,</div>
               <div class="l">For surely such thou art, – receive in me</div>
               <div class="l">The first fruits of thy calling! – Kneeling then</div>
               <div class="l">And placing as he spake his hands in hers,</div>
               <div class="l">As thou hast sworn, the Royal Goth pursued,</div>
               <div class="l">Even so I swear. My soul hath found at length</div>
               <div class="l">Her rest &amp; refuge: in the invaders blood</div>
               <div class="l">She must efface her stains of mortal sin,</div>
               <div class="l">And in redeeming this fallen land work out</div>
               <div class="l">Redemption for herself. Herein I place</div>
               <div class="l">My penance for the past, my hope to come,</div>
               <div class="l">My faith &amp; my good works, here offer up</div>
               <div class="l">All thoughts &amp; passions of mine inmost heart,</div>

               <div class="l">For Spain! Receive the vow all Saints in Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">And prosper its good end.</div>
               <div class="l">Clap now your wings,</div>
               <div class="l">The Goth with louder utterance as he rose</div>
               <div class="l">Exclaimd, – clap now your wings exultingly</div>
               <div class="l">Ye ravenous fowl of Heaven; &amp; in your dens</div>
               <div class="l">Set up ye Wolves of Spain a yell of joy!</div>
               <div class="l">For lo! a Nation hath this day been sworn</div>
               <div class="l">To furnish forth your banquet; for a strife</div>
               <div class="l">Commenceth which must know no end or rest</div>
               <div class="l">Till in this land the last invader bow</div>
               <div class="l">Beneath the exterminating sword!</div>
               <div class="l">With that,</div>

               <div class="l">But who art thou who hast professd with me</div>
               <div class="l">My first sworn brother in the appointed rule?</div>
               <div class="l">Tell me thy name!</div>
               <div class="l">Ask any thing but that!</div>
               <div class="l">The fallen King replied. My name was lost</div>
               <div class="l">When from the Goths the sceptre past away.</div>
               <div class="l">The nation will arise regenerate,</div>
               <div class="l">Strong in her second youth, &amp; beautiful,</div>
               <div class="l">And like a Spirit which hath shaken off</div>
               <div class="l">The clay of dull mortality, shall Spain</div>
               <div class="l">Arise in glory; but for my good name</div>
               <div class="l">No resurrection is appointed here, –</div>
               <div class="l">Let it be blotted out on Earth, – in Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">There will be written with it penitence,</div>
               <div class="l">And grace &amp; saving faith, &amp; such good deeds</div>
               <div class="l">Wrought in atonement as my soul, this day</div>
               <div class="l">Hath sworn to offer up.</div>
               <div class="l">Then be thy name,</div>
               <div class="l">She answered, Maccabee from this day forth,</div>
               <div class="l">For this day art thou born again, &amp; like</div>
               <div class="l">Those brethren of old times, whose holy names</div>
               <div class="l">Live in the memory of all noble hearts</div>
               <div class="l">For love &amp; admiration, ever young, –</div>
               <div class="l">So for our native country, for our hearths</div>
               <div class="l">And altars, for her cradles &amp; her graves,</div>
               <div class="l">Hast thou thyself devoted. Let us now</div>
               <div class="l">Each to our work: among the neighbouring hills</div>
               <div class="l">I to the vassals of my fathers house</div>
               <div class="l">Thou to Visonia; tell the Abbot there</div>
               <div class="l">What thou hast seen in Auria, &amp; with him</div>
               <div class="l">Take counsel who of our old baronage</div>
               <div class="l">Is worthiest to lead on the sons of Spain</div>
               <div class="l">And wear upon his brow the Spanish crown.</div>
               <div class="l">Now brother fare thee well! We part in hope,</div>
               <div class="l">And we shall meet again, be sure, in joy</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">So saying, Adosinda left the King</div>
               <div class="l">Alone amid the ruins: There he stood</div>
               <div class="l">As when Elisha on the farther bank</div>
               <div class="l">Of Jordan, saw that elder prophet mount</div>
               <div class="l">The fiery chariot, &amp; the steeds of fire</div>
               <div class="l">Trampling the whirlwind, bear him up the sky.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus gazing after her did Roderick stand;</div>
               <div class="l">And as the immortal Tishbite left behind</div>
               <div class="l">His mantle &amp; prophetic power, even so</div>
               <div class="l">Had her inspiring presence left infusd</div>
               <div class="l">The spirit which she breathd. Gazing he stood</div>
               <div class="l">As at a heavenly visitation there</div>
               <div class="l">Vouchsafed, in mercy to himself &amp; Spain;</div>
               <div class="l">And when the heroic mourner from his sight</div>
               <div class="l">Had past away, still reverential awe</div>
               <div class="l">Held him suspended there &amp; motionless.</div>
               <div class="l">Then turning from the ghastly scene of death,</div>
               <div class="l">Up murmuring Lona he began toward</div>
               <div class="l">The holy Bierzo his obedient way.</div>
               <div class="l">Sils ample stream he crost, where thro the vale</div>
               <div class="l">Of Orras from that sacred land he bears</div>
               <div class="l">The whole collected waters; northward then</div>
               <div class="l">Skirting the heights of Aguiar, he reached</div>
               <div class="l">That consecrated pile amid the wild,</div>
               <div class="l">Which sainted Fructuoso in his zeal</div>
               <div class="l">Reard to S<sup>t</sup> Felix on Visonias banks.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">In commune with a Priest <span class="strikethrough">whose</span> &lt;of&gt; age mature</div>
               <div class="l">Whose thoughtful visage &amp; majestic mien</div>
               <div class="l">Bespake authority &amp; weight of care,</div>
               <div class="l">Odoar the venerable Abbot sate,</div>
               <div class="l">When ushering Roderick in the Porter said</div>

               <div class="l">His private ear. From Auria? said the old man,</div>
               <div class="l">Comst thou from Auria brother? I can spare</div>
               <div class="l">Thy painful errand then; – we know the worst.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Nay, answerd Roderick, but thou hast not heard</div>
               <div class="l">My tale. Where that devoted City lies</div>
               <div class="l">In ashes, mid the ruins of the dead</div>
               <div class="l">I found a woman whom the Moors had borne</div>
               <div class="l">Captive away: but she, by Heaven inspird</div>
               <div class="l">And her good heart, with her own hand wrought</div>
               <div class="l">Her own deliverance, smiting in his tent</div>
               <div class="l">A lustful Moorish miscreant, as of yore</div>
               <div class="l">By Judiths holy deed the Assyrian fell;</div>
               <div class="l">And that same spirit which had strengthend her</div>
               <div class="l">Workd in her still. Four walls with patient toil</div>
               <div class="l">She reard, wherein as in a sepulchre</div>
               <div class="l">With her own hands she laid her murderd babe,</div>
               <div class="l">Her husband &amp; her parents, <span class="strikethrough">sid</span> side by side;</div>
               <div class="l">And when we covered in this shapeless tomb,</div>
               <div class="l">There on the grave of all her family,</div>
               <div class="l">Did this courageous mourner dedicate</div>
               <div class="l">All thoughts &amp; actions of her future life</div>
               <div class="l">To her poor country; for she said, that Heaven</div>
               <div class="l">Supporting her, in mercy had vouchsafd</div>
               <div class="l">A foretaste of revenge, – that like the grace</div>
               <div class="l">Of God revenge had savd her; that in it</div>
               <div class="l">Spain must have her salvation, &amp; henceforth</div>
               <div class="l">That passion thus sublim’d &amp; sanctified</div>
               <div class="l">Must be to all the loyal sons of Spain</div>
               <div class="l">The pole star of their faith, their rule &amp; rite</div>
               <div class="l">Observances &amp; holiest sacrifice</div>
               <div class="l">I took the vow, unworthy as I am,</div>
               <div class="l">Her first sworn follower in the appointed rule,</div>
               <div class="l">And then we parted: She among the hills</div>
               <div class="l">To rouse the vassals of her fathers house,</div>
               <div class="l">I at her bidding hitherward, to ask</div>
               <div class="l">Thy counsel, who of our old baronage</div>

               <div class="l">In act of pious passion raisd to heaven,</div>
               <div class="l">O none but Adosinda! none but she –</div>
               <div class="l">None but that noble heart, which was the heart</div>
               <div class="l">Of Auria while it stood, its life &amp; strength,</div>
               <div class="l">More than her fathers presence, or the arm</div>

               <div class="l">Hers was the spirit which inspird old age,</div>

               <div class="l">With ever anxious love, – she breathd thro all</div>
               <div class="l">That zeal &amp; that devoted faithfulness</div>
               <div class="l">Which to the invaders threats &amp; promises</div>
               <div class="l">Turn’d a deaf ear alike, which in the head</div>

               <div class="l">Repelld him from the walls, &amp; when at length</div>
               <div class="l">His overpowering numbers forced their way,</div>
               <div class="l">Even in that uttermost extremity</div>
               <div class="l">Unyielding, still from street to street, from house</div>
               <div class="l">To house, from floor to floor, maintaind the fight</div>
               <div class="l">Till by their altars falling, in their doors,</div>

               <div class="l">A life misspent, but never bound by vows</div>
               <div class="l">Till Adosinda taught me where to find</div>
               <div class="l">Comfort, &amp; how to work forgiveness out.</div>
               <div class="l">When that exalted woman took thy vow</div>
               <div class="l">She calld me Maccabee; from this day forth</div>
               <div class="l">Be that my earthly name. But tell me now</div>
               <div class="l">Whom shall we rouse, &amp; place upon his head</div>
               <div class="l">The crown of Spain? Where are the Gothic Chiefs</div>
               <div class="l">Sacaru, Theudemir, Athanagild,</div>
               <div class="l">All who survivd that days obstinate fight,</div>
               <div class="l">When cloggd with bodies Chrysus scarce could force</div>
               <div class="l">Its bloody stream along. Witizas sons,</div>
               <div class="l">Bad offspring of a stock accurst, I know,</div>
               <div class="l">Have put the turban on their recreant heads.</div>

               <div class="l">His were a noble heart &amp; worthy head</div>
               <div class="l">To wield the sceptre &amp; the sword of Spain.</div>

               <div class="l">Odoar &amp; Urban eyed him while he spake,</div>
               <div class="l">As if they wondered whose the tongue might be,</div>
               <div class="l">Familiar thus with chiefs &amp; thoughts of state.</div>
               <div class="l">They scannd his countenance, but not one trace</div>
               <div class="l">Betrayd the royal Goth, sunk was that eye</div>
               <div class="l">Of sovereignty, &amp; on the emaciate cheek</div>
               <div class="l">Had penitence &amp; anguish deeply drawn</div>
               <div class="l">Their furrows premature, forestalling time,</div>
               <div class="l">And shedding upon thirtys brow more snows</div>
               <div class="l">Than three score winters in their natural course</div>
               <div class="l">Might else have sprinkled there. It seems indeed</div>
               <div class="l">That thou hast past thy days in solitude,</div>
               <div class="l">Replied the Abbot, or thou wouldst not ask</div>
               <div class="l">Of things so long gone by. Athanagild</div>
               <div class="l">And Theudemir have taken on their necks</div>
               <div class="l">The yoke. Sacaru playd a nobler part.</div>
               <div class="l">Long within Merida did he withstand</div>
               <div class="l">The invaders hot assault, &amp; when at length</div>
               <div class="l">Hopeless of all relief, he yielded up</div>
               <div class="l">The gate, disdaining in his fathers land</div>
               <div class="l">To breathe the air of bondage, with a few</div>
               <div class="l">Found faithful to the last, indignantly</div>
               <div class="l">Toward the ocean did he bend his way,</div>
               <div class="l">And shaking from his feet the dust of Spain,</div>
               <div class="l">Took ship &amp; hoisted sail thro seas unknown</div>
               <div class="l">To seek for freedom. Our Cantabrian Chiefs</div>
               <div class="l">All have submitted, but the wary Moor</div>
               <div class="l">Trusteth not all alike. At his own Court</div>
               <div class="l">He holds Pelayo, as suspecting most</div>
               <div class="l">That calm &amp; manly spirit. Pedros son</div>
               <div class="l">There too he holds as hostage, &amp; secures</div>
               <div class="l">His fathers faith. Count Eudon is despisd</div>
               <div class="l">And so lives unmolested: when he pays</div>
               <div class="l">His heavy tribute, then perhaps a thought</div>
               <div class="l">Of sorrow may disturb him; or more like</div>
               <div class="l">He meditates how profitable ’twere</div>
               <div class="l">To be a Moor, &amp; if apostacy</div>
               <div class="l">Were all, &amp; to be unbaptized might serve –</div>
               <div class="l">But I waste breath upon a wretch like this,</div>
               <div class="l">Pelayo is the only hope of Spain,</div>
               <div class="l">Only Pelayo.</div>
               <div class="l">If as we believe</div>
               <div class="l">Said Urban then, the hand of Heaven is here,</div>
               <div class="l">And dreadful tho they be, yet for wise end </div>
               <div class="l">Of good, these visitations do its work,</div>
               <div class="l">All dimly as our mortal sight may scan</div>
               <div class="l">The future, yet methinks my soul descries</div>
               <div class="l">How in Pelayo should the purposes</div>
               <div class="l">Of Heaven be best accomplishd. All too long</div>
               <div class="l">Here in their own inheritance the sons</div>
               <div class="l">Of Spain have ground beneath a foreign yoke,</div>
               <div class="l">Punic &amp; Roman, Kelt &amp; Greek &amp; Goth;</div>
               <div class="l">This later tempest comes to sweep away</div>
               <div class="l">All proud distinctions which commingling blood</div>
               <div class="l">And times long course had faild to efface; &amp; now</div>
               <div class="l">Perchance it is the will of fate to rear</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the soil of Spain a Spanish throne,</div>
               <div class="l">Restoring in Pelayos mountain line</div>
               <div class="l">The sceptre to the Spaniard.</div>
               <div class="l">Go thou then</div>
               <div class="l">And seek Pelayo at the Conquerors court.</div>
               <div class="l">Tell him the mountaineers are unsubdued,</div>
               <div class="l">The precious time they needed hath been gaind</div>
               <div class="l">By Aurias sacrifice, &amp; all they ask</div>
               <div class="l">Is him to guide them on. In Odoars name</div>
               <div class="l">And Urbans, tell him that the hour is come.</div>
               <div class="l">Then pausing for a moment he pursued,</div>
               <div class="l">The rule which thou hast taken on thyself</div>
               <div class="l">Toledo ratifies; tis meet for Spain</div>
               <div class="l">And as the will divine to be received,</div>
               <div class="l">Observed &amp; spread abroad. Come hither thou</div>
               <div class="l">Who for thyself hast chosen the good part.</div>
               <div class="l">Let me lay hands on thee &amp; consecrate</div>
               <div class="l">Thy life unto the Lord.</div>
               <div class="l">Me! Roderick cried;</div>
               <div class="l">Me sinner that I am! – &amp; while he spake</div>
               <div class="l">His withered cheek grew paler, &amp; his limbs</div>
               <div class="l">Shook; As thou goest among the infidels</div>
               <div class="l">Pursued the Primate, many thou wilt find</div>
               <div class="l">Fallen from the faith, by weakness some betrayd,</div>
               <div class="l">Some led astray by baser hope of gain,</div>
               <div class="l">And haply too by ill example led</div>
               <div class="l">Of those in whom they trusted. Yet have these</div>
               <div class="l">Their lonely hours, when sorrow, or the touch</div>
               <div class="l">Of sickness, or that aweful power divine</div>
               <div class="l">Which hath its dwelling in the heart of man,</div>
               <div class="l">Life of his soul, his monitor &amp; judge</div>
               <div class="l">Move them with silent impulse, but they look</div>
               <div class="l">For help, &amp; finding none to succour them</div>
               <div class="l">The irrevocable moment passes by.</div>
               <div class="l">Therefore my brother, in the name of Christ</div>
               <div class="l">Thus I lay hands on thee, that in his name</div>
               <div class="l">Thou with his gracious promises mayst raise</div>
               <div class="l">The fallen, &amp; comfort those that are in need,</div>
               <div class="l">And bring salvation to the penitent.</div>
               <div class="l">Now brother go thy way, the peace of God</div>
               <div class="l">Be with thee, &amp; his blessing prosper us.</div>
