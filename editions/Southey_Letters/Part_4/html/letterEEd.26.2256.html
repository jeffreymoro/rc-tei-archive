                  </div> It will greatly facilitate the progress of the missionaries, and give stability to

                  be, will feel as Britons of every reformed communion used to feel in Portugal, when
                  Protestant and Papist were the only demarcations which were acknowledged.</p>

               their usual elasticity. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerGeorge">A brother</a> of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">my wife’s</a>, who came here hoping to enjoy a few weeks of relaxation, is lingering under a complication
               of obscure and incurable diseases; and how long he may live, or rather how long he
               may continue dying, is what no medical skill can foresee. I know just enough of nosology
               to punish me for ever having looked into the science without making it my study. Not
               an ailment can occur among my children that I cannot in my own mind explain by some
               alarming cause; and thus little illnesses, which men who lived less with their children
               would hardly hear of, and men in healthier feelings and happier ignorance would never
               think of, give me serious disquietude. It seems as if I had as many hopes and fears
               as the veriest worldling, and that having none with respect to common worldly objects,
               they had all taken this direction.</p>
