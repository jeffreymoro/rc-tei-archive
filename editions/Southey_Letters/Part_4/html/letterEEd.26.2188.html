               <p>Your news of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReidSamuel">S. Reid</a> made me so uncomfortable about him that I could not rest till I had written to him;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Reid was thinking of becoming a missionary; see Southey to Samuel Reid, 5 December
                           1812, Letter 2187.</span></div>
                  </div> – with little hope indeed of turning him from his purpose, but in the only manner
                  which has any chance of doing it. By showing him that he may do more good by staying
                  at home. I have endeavoured to convince him that for foreign service the Methodists
                  &amp; other such enthusiasts are the men. That if he could be content to do good silently
                  &amp; certainly his surest way would be to act as minister to some congregation – provided
                  his opinions admit of it – otherwise to continue his present course of life &amp; contract
                  new duties by marriage. But if, like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</a>, he must have some specific object in view – for which to devote himself, I have
                  asked him if such objects are not to be found in England, &amp; thrown out hints to him
                  of two either of which would give scope enough to his zeal. The one to become the
                  founder of some such institution for women as you may remember was once the subject
                  of much correspondence between <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> me

                  </div> will thank me for setting him upon a scheme like this, if it should have the effect
                  of keeping him in England. I think I see you laughing at my notion of setting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReidSamuel">Sam</a> to preach to the Gypsies – I laugh too, but it would be really a good thing to set
                  the Evangelicals &amp; the Philanthropicals at them. They are at once a pest to the community
                  &amp; a disgrace to it, &amp; if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReidSamuel">Sam</a> could be persuaded to <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx xxx</span> fancy this his call, it would take so <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> well that funds would not be wanting, for any reasonable plan which might be devised.
                  The other is a worthier object, &amp; blessed will that man be who shall carry it into
