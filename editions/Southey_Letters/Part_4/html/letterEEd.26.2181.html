                  </div> which you have had the goodness to send me, &amp; to thank you also for the gratification
                  which it has afforded. It is indeed gratifying to perceive that a poem, written <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> to exemplify a Christian virtue tho in Mohammedan dress (but with no such specific
                  applications as you have drawn from it) should be capable throughout, &amp; with so little
                  violence, of <span class="strikethrough">such</span> being thus applied.</p>

               <p>The poem upon which I am employed at present, has to represent historical characters,
                  – consequently of a more mixed nature.

                  </div> They are delineated as far as &lt;is&gt; in my power, with dramatic truth, – not as ideals
                  to exemplify any virtue or combination of virtues, but as individuals acting under
                  the <span class="strikethrough">influence</span> &lt;sway&gt; of strong feelings. The effect of this will be that no specific lesson is inculated;
                  but that if the Reader is affected as the Author hopes to affect him, he will have
                  his mind elevated by the general strain of the poem; &amp; that line of thought &amp; feeling
                  will be produced, which ennobles us while it continues, &amp; leaves some traces of good
                  even when its immediate influence has past away.</p>
