               <p>A note like yours ought not to have remained so long unanswered, but during a route
                  of nearly 400 miles, the greater part performed on foot I found no time for writing.
                  On my return letters were awaiting me which materially alter my prospects for the
                  winter. It is considered essential to the interests of the Register, – almost indeed
                  necessary to its farther continuance, – that it should be published in March, instead
                  of July. In the main this depends upon me, – for if I can be ready with it, no other
                  person excused can have any apology for being behind hand. I need not say that the
                  success of this work is to <span class="strikethrough">x</span> me a matter of great importance. So I postpone my London journey till the fourth years
                  volume is finished,
