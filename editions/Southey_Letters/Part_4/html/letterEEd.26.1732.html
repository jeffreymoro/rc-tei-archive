            <p class="indent1">I was startled yesterday at seeing in the papers that poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobertsBarreCharles">Barre Roberts</a> is dead. – Had he gone abroad when the first symptoms appeared this might perhaps
               have been prevented, – but &lt;in such cases&gt; there is no other chance whatever. I am
               sorry for you &amp; his nearer friends, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">sorry</span> regret the loss of a young man who had given hopeful promise of good. This perhaps
               has occasioned your long silence for it seems unusually long since I heard from you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My frames are arrived – the Idiotic maker sent them by the Mail instead of the Waggon
               in consequence of which I have a guinea carriage to pay, &amp; the large glass is of course
               broken. Certes I ought not to pay for it, – when you call to pay the bill, do your
               best to make him settle with the coach <span class="strikethrough">if</span> about the damage, – tho I suppose the loss will fall upon me at last. I do not mean
               to impose any farther lip-litigation upon you than you feel to be seemly upon such
               an occasion, – but it was so confoundedly stupid a trick, that I am more provoked
               at the folly, than the mischief which it has occasioned; &amp; you will soon find out
               whether there is any redress to be had.</p>

                           Southey quoted from the Letters in his review of lives of Nelson in the Quarterly
                           Review (p. 248). In Morning Post articles of 3 February 1800 and 17 February 1800,
                           Coleridge set out to prove the letters were a forgery by the British government. In
                           a final article on 17 March 1800, Coleridge concluded that the British were themselves
                           the dupes of a French Republican forgery.</span></div>

                  &amp; the result was some letters upon the subject in the Morning Post. One letter more
                  was to have concluded the investigation, &amp; this was lying upon the Editors table one
