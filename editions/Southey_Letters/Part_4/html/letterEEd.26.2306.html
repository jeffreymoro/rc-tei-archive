               It will nearly or entirely cover a policy for 3000 £. I am already insured for 1000
               £. This windfall therefore goes so far towards making a <span class="strikethrough">respectable</span> decent provision for my family that I am anxious to effect the insurance, &amp; therefore

               that night if you do not like to sleep away from home. Our dinner hour is four, but
