               <p>I ought to have told you a week ago that I was once more in England safe &amp; sound.
                  But the continual excitement &amp; hurry &amp; bustle of this place scarcely allow me time
                  for sleep. Our journey has been very interesting, – the route was thus – Ostend, Bruges,
                  Ghent, Brussels, the fields of battle of the 18 &amp; 16th – Namur, Huy, Liege, Spa, Aix
                  la Chapelle, – this the farthest point. Then Maestricht, Louvain, Brussels, Antwerp,
                  Ghent, Courtray, Menin, Ypres, Bergues, Dunkirk &amp; Calais. I kept a minute journal
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> &amp; you know that a traveller who attempts to do this can find no time for any other
                  writing. Perhaps no five weeks of my life were ever better employed. I bought a good
                  many books, &amp; among others have bargained for a set of the Acta Sanctorum.

               <p>The political aspects are as bad as possible. The universal belief is that we let
                  Buonaparte loose from Elba: &amp; the answer to one who attempts to prove the folly of
                  this supposition – “why did you not put him to death then when you had him in your
                  hands? If the Devil had called <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> all his imps to council to invent a means for confirming this notion he could not
                  have devised a better than that of this present of house &amp; furniture! The absurdity <span class="strikethrough">&amp; unpopularity</span> &amp; indecency of the thing are felt so strongly that it is stoutly denied at present,
                  – as if it were possible to conceal it when the bill is to be paid!
