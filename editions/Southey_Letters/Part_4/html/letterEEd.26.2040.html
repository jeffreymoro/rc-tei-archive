            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I was glad to hear from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</a> that you were comfortably settled, and growing attached to college; and glad to hear
               afterwards from yourself that you begin to feel your ground. There is no part of my
               own life which I remember with so little pleasure as that which was passed at the
               university; not that it has left behind it any cause of self-reproach, but I had many
               causes of disquietude and unhappiness, — some imaginary, and some, God knows, real
               enough. And I cannot think of the place without pain, because of the men with whom
               I there lived in the closest intimacy of daily and almost hourly intercourse; those
               whom I loved best are dead, and there are some whom I never have seen since we parted
               there, and possibly never shall see more. It is with this feeling I believe, more
               or less, that every man who has any feeling always remembers college. Seven years
               ago I walked through Oxford on a fine summer morning, just after sunrise, while the
               stage was changing horses: I went under the windows of what had formerly been my own
               rooms; the majesty of the place was heightened by the perfect silence of the streets,
               and it had never before appeared to me half so majestic or half so beautiful. But
               I would rather go a day’s journey round than pass through that city again, especially
               in the day-time, when the streets are full. Other places in which I have been an inhabitant
               would not make the same impression; there is an enduring sameness in a university
               like that of the sea and mountains. It is the same in our age that it was in our youth;
               the same figures fill the streets, and the knowledge that they are not the same persons
               brings home the sense of change which is of all things the most mournful.</p>

               <p>I see your name to the Bible Society, concerning which I have read Herbert Marsh’s

                           at St Paul’s on 13 June 1811 that was critical of the interdenominational British
                           and Foreign Bible Society (founded 1804) and urged that Anglicans should found their
                           own Bible society. Southey had read the pamphlet form of the sermon, The National
                           Religion the Foundation of National Education: A Sermon Preached in the Cathedral
                           Church of St. Paul, London (1811). Its arguments were rebutted by Edward Daniel Clarke
                           (1769–1822; DNB), A Letter to Herbert Marsh, D.D., F.R.S. … in Reply to Certain Observations

                  </div> Marsh may possibly be fond of controversy, because he knows his strength. He is a
                  clear logical writer, and in these days a little logic goes a great way, for of all
                  things it is that in which the writers of this generation are most deficient. His
                  reasoning is to me completely satisfactory as to these two points, – that where Christians
                  of all denominations combine for the purpose either of spreading Christianity or distributing
                  Bibles in other countries, the cause of the general church is promoted thereby; but
                  that when they combine together at home, as that condition can only be effected by
                  a concession on the part of the churchmen, by that concession the Church of England
                  is proportionally weakened. Nothing can be clearer. But though the Margaret Professor
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> is perfectly right in his views, and his antagonists are mere children when compared
                  to him, I think he has been injudicious in exciting the controversy, because upon
                  that statement of the case which his opponents will make, and which appears at first
                  sight to be a perfectly fair one, everybody must conclude him to be in the wrong,
                  and very few persons will take the trouble of looking farther. And I think his object
                  might have been effected by a little management without much difficulty, — by an arrangement
                  among the Church members of the Society that the Liturgy should be appended to the
                  Bibles which they distributed at home, or by a Prayer-book Society.

                  </div> A man should be very careful how he engages in a controversy, in which, however right
                  he may be, he is certain to appear wrong to the multitude; and he ought to be especially
                  careful, when he thus exposes not his own character alone but that of the body to
                  which he belongs. Besides, the mischief which Marsh perceives is not very great, because
                  I apprehend that at least nine tenths of the business of B. Society relates to foreign
                  countries. But I agree with him entirely as to the mischief that lurks under the name
                  of liberality; by which is meant not an indulgence to the opinions of other communities,
                  but an indifference to your own.</p>

                  in His Pamphlet Relative to the British and Foreign Bible Society</em> (1812). In late 1811 the dispute spread to Cambridge, where students proposed forming
               an auxiliary group of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Marsh publicly opposed
               this in his <em>Address to the Members of the Senate of the University of Cambridge</em> (1811). The students gained support from Lord Hardwick (1757–1834; <em>DNB</em>) and the Duke of Gloucester (1776–1834; <em>DNB</em>), Chancellor of the University. The first meeting of their new society was a great
               success, and Marsh backed down. James White had clearly joined this new Cambridge
