               <p>I was in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</a> office when your letter arrived; its intelligence was certainly a disappointment,

                  </div> death was announced a day or two before my departure from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, &amp; at the time I thought it so probable that the not-very-desirable succession might
                  be offered me, as to bestow a little serious thought upon the subject, as well as
                  a jest or two. On my arrival in town <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> came to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brothers</a> to meet me at breakfast, – told me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> had spoken with him about it &amp; he with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>; – that they supposed the <span class="ital">onus</span> of the office would be dropt, or if it were not that I might so execute it as to give

                  </div> was the maxim upon which the thing was likely to be bestowed, they thought it would
                  become me to accept it: – my business however, <span class="strikethrough">at xx</span> whatever might be my determination, was to call without delay at the Admiralty, thank <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">C.</a> for what was certainly intended well, &amp; learn how the matter stood.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Accordingly I called on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a>. He had spoken to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a> &amp; the Prince observing that I had written “some good things in favour of the Spaniards”
                  said the office should be given me. You will admire the reason; – &amp; infer from it
                  that I ought to have been made historiographer because I had written Madoc.

                  – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> was the greatest poet of the day, &amp; to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> therefore they had written to offer it. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a> was displeased at this; he, he said, ought to have been consulted, it was his pleasure
                  that I should have it &amp; have it I should. Upon this <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> represented that he was <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</a> friend as well as mine, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> &amp; I were upon friendly terms; &amp; for the sake of all three he requested that the business
                  might rest where it was.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thus it stood when I made my first call at the Admiralty. I more than half suspected
                  that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> would decline the offer, &amp; my own mind was made up before this suspicion was verified.
                  The manner in which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> declined it was the handsomest possible: nothing could be more friendly to me, or
                  more honourable to himself.

                           if you will like it, for the laurel has certainly been tarnished by some of its wearers,
                           and as at present managed, its duties are inconvenient and somewhat liable to ridicule’,

                  </div> I then wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</a> saying that as for writing odes, like exercises, the time was past when I could do
                  such things either with readiness or propriety; that unless I could do credit to the
                  office, the office could do none to me; but that if it were understood this idle form
                  was to be dropt &amp; I were left on great public events to <span class="strikethrough">attempt to</span> commemorate them in verse, or not, as the spirit moved, in that case I should willingly
                  accept the situation as a mark of honourable distinction, which it would then become.

                  </div> How to effect this I left to him, as of course it was not for me to dictate terms

                  pleased &amp; I suppose the signature is all that is now wanted. – It will be suggested
                  to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</a> that a good opportunity is offered for dropping a silly custom, because during the
