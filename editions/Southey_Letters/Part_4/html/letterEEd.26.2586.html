               <p>I fear the Devil of cowardice has got into our Cabinet – God grant the ague fit do
                  not prove catching. Vigorous measures might conquer France in the course of six months,
                  – but if six months be lost he must be a bolder prophet than I am who would venture
                  to say when or how the struggle will terminate. Buonaparte is come back because his
                  soldiers cannot &amp; will not live without war, &amp; accordingly he begins by promising
                  them their fill of it. But he finds that the people, passive as they are, want peace,
                  &amp; that he is not ready to meet the allies upon this present footing – therefore he
                  now talks about peace, &amp; at the same time endeavours to curry favour with the old
                  Jacobines, &amp; take his stand upon the old ground of the Revolution.
