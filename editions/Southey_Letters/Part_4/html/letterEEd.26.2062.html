                  have succeeded I should have sent you the poem, if I had failed the disappointment
                  would have been confined to myself. This is the only reply which I can make to you
                  on my own part. I can engage to produce a great poem which shall be the work of years,
                  and is to be drawn from accumulate stores — the work of long meditation and labour;
                  but for those smaller pieces, which, if they come, must come unsought, I never can
                  bind myself. From <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> I could, without difficulty, procure you a promise, but am very certain that such
                  a promise would end in nothing. His good nature would render it impossible for him
                  to refuse, and his habits would render it still more impossible for him to perform
                  what he had thus incautiously pledged himself to do. I would not have the book assume
                  the appearance of a formal collection of verses; there must be, as in all these “Illustrations,”
                  some short descriptive accounts of the places represented in the prints, and such
                  poems as you may obtain had better appear interspersed in their respective places.

            <p class="indent1">I congratulate you on your good resolutions, and shall be truly glad to congratulate
               you when they are carried into effect. A man may be cheerful and contented in celibacy,
               but I do not think he can ever be happy; it is an unnatural state, and the best feelings
               of his nature are never called into action. The risks of marriage are far greater
               on the woman’s side; women have so little the power of choice, that it is not perhaps
               fair to say they are less likely to choose well than we are; but I am persuaded that
               they are more frequently deceived in the attachments which they form, and their opinions
               concerning men are much less accurate than men’s opinion of their sex. Now if a lady
               were to reproach me for having said this, I should reply that it was only another
               mode of saying there were more good wives in the world than there are good husbands,
               which I verily believe. I know nothing which a good and sensible man is so certain
               to find, if he looks for it, as a good wife.</p>
