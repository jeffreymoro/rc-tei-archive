            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Before your letter arrived this evening, I had resolved to send off the commencement
                  of my book of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">Bell</a> &amp; the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Dragon</a>;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s The Origin, Nature and Object, of the New System of Education (1812), an
                           expansion of his advocacy of Bell in Quarterly Review, 6 (August 1811), 264–304.</span></div>
                  </div> – according to all probability it will be finished before the first proof sheet can
                  reach me. – You will perceive among the additions such a view of the New System as
                  you very probably felt the want of in the reviewal. It was drawn up with great care
                  for the purpose of sending it to Cadiz, – where plans of education are even in this
                  season of danger, contemplated by the Spanish Government. &amp; having had the advantage
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">D<sup>r</sup> Bells</a> presence at the time I am certain of its accuracy. The system cannot be more concisely
                  stated, &amp; I hope it is as perspicuous as possible.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your hint respecting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</a> is one which I ought always to bear <span class="strikethrough">mi</span> in mind, my own nature leading me to speak strongly what I feel strongly. For the
               most part I shall deal in sarcasm, – &amp; when I speak with serious severity it will
               be in the tone of a Judge, not of an accuser. Tell me as the work goes thro the press,
               if any thing seems too strong, or strikes you as in any way injudicious.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The title will be ‘The Origin, Nature &amp; Object of the New System of Education.” –
                  you will of course say reprinted from the Q.R. &amp;c – with considerable additions, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">dedicated</span> &lt;a dedication&gt; to the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Editor of the Ed. Review</a>. This portion is about two thirds of the whole, – a little less perhaps. As to the
                  form of publication you are the best judge, I will only <span class="ital">suggest</span> (leaving it wholly to your decision) that if instead of the loose pamphlet form, it
                  were printed in duodecimo, it would then bind up with the rest of my works, which
                  I am very desirous it should accompany. For tho the subject is of temporary interest, <span class="ital">some</span> value it must always possess as <span class="strikethrough">the</span> being the true history of a most important discovery, &amp; a detection <span class="strikethrough">as</span> compleat as that of Lauder.

                  </div> It will fall from seven to eight duodecimo sheets, – thick enough to be put in <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> boards &amp; so to assume a substantial &amp; substantive shape.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There is not time to reply to the rest of your letter. – “The Life of Horatio Lord
                  Nelson – I suppose will be the appropriate title. My name you will either add or withhold
                  as you judge best.

            <p class="indent1">– One thing I will request – if you have no stronger reason against it. – that you
