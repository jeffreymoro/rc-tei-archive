            <p class="indent1">I impute it to my most wicked cold that in spite of a dogged application for the last
               week I have made very little progress for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>. Whether I have blown all ideas out of my head thro the nose, or <span class="strikethrough">shaken them</span> drawn them out by sneezing I cannot tell, – but I am very stupid, &amp; that part of
               my time which has been most profitably spent, has been when in pure despair, &amp; for
               the sake of my eyes I have een removed to the sofa &amp; gone to sleep. By way of trying
               what exercise would do I went one day with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> to the top of Causey Pike, &amp; made my sides sore for three days with rolling great
               stones down the mountain, – which (be it known to you M<sup>r</sup> Bedford) is among the amusements <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> reserved for you in your sound state. Causey Pike is my Bowling mountain, – &amp; a most
               grand thing it is to see a huge stone go bounding down to the very bottom.</p>
