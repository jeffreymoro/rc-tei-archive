                  I am on the verge of departing, tho not sufficiently certain of my movements as yet
                  to say when the day will be. I finish my work tomorrow, – or perhaps to night – but
                  I have not secured seats in the mail because there is a good hope of avoiding the
                  purgatory of that conveyance. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterHenry">Henry Koster</a> is going with me, – not merely to town but to Waterloo. Now there is a certain D<sup>r</sup> Stanger

                           including (pp. 70–72) a pair of leather breeches. The Works of the Reverend William

                           Quarterly Review, 24 (January 1821), 462–510, where he condemned Huntington’s work
