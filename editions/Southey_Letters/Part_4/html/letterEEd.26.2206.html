            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Thank you for your solicitude. I am nearly arrived at that age when every man is said
               to be either a fool or a physician, – &amp; I can explain my own attack satisfactorily.
               The head feeling I have been subject to since the year 1798; – it is no doubt the
               same sensation which is experienced, in fainting, &amp; in an hysterical woman &lt;it&gt; would
               end in a fit. The sickness was an accidental effect of flatulence, – my stomach is
               so easily irritated, that in the sick head aches to which I am subject, no emetic
               is ever needed; – as soon as I perceive that it is necessary to clear the stomach,
               it is scarcely necessary to put my finger into my mouth, – I can <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> effect the same purpose by an act of volition. The moment therefore in this last
               case <span class="strikethrough">I</span> an apprehension of something was excited, – the thing itself followed – Your prescription
               of exercise however is followed. Before your letter arrived I had given <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Lunus</a> full powers to rouse me at day break, &amp; we <span class="ital">fetch a</span> walk before breakfast whenever the weather permits.</p>
