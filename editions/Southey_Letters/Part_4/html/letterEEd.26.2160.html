               rebuilt Drury Lane theatre on 10 October. It – along with about 100 other entries

               ensued. Byron’s prologue was spoken on the opening night, but on the nights of 14
               and 15 October Busby’s son and then Busby himself caused a furore by attempting to
               address the Drury Lane audience on the subject of the claims of the authors of the
               rejected verses. The high point of the proceedings was on 15 October when Busby promised
               ‘such a monologue as they had seldom heard’, which his son then proceeded to recite
               in an inaudible voice. Busby published his address in the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 16 October. Southey was not alone in finding him a figure of ridicule, Busby was
               the target of Byron’s parody ‘Parenthetical Address, by Dr Plagiary, to be recited
               in an inaudible voice by his Son’, <em>Morning Chronicle</em> (23 October 1812) and of the satirical print ‘Management-or-Butts &amp; Hogsheads’ (1812).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
