                  </div> Nothing would grieve me more than to be thought capable of throwing aside a letter
                  like yours without noticing it as it deserves. Believe me M<sup>r</sup> Evans, when I tell you that that letter has made me most desirous of becoming acquainted
                  with a man whom nature seems to have endowed with a wise &amp; happy temper of mind more
                  valuable than any brilliancy of talents, &lt;or than any gift of fortune.&gt;</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I can only repeat now what was said in my reply of yesterday. It will give me great
               pleasure to peruse any of your productions, I will tell you with perfect sincerity
               whether it appears to me advisable to publish them or not, – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> in case of publication will most chearfully give you every assistance in my power.
               You may direct to me under cover to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">CWWilliams Wynn Esq<sup>r</sup>.</a> M. P. Llangedwin, Oswestry. <span class="strikethrough">Remb</span> Remember that my name must not appear on the direction to him, &amp; that the weight
               of the <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> inclosure &amp; its cover must not exceed one ounce, in either of which cases it would
               become chargeable.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Tell me more of yourself, – the history of your intellectual life, – your age, – your
               habits, – whether you are married or single &amp;c: you have excited in me so strong an
               interest that I am desirous of knowing <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> whatever relates to you. And tell me the name of the Gentleman of whose indulgence
               you speak, – for he too is entitled to a large portion of respect.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You tell me of the pleasure which you have felt in reading my poems. I am so far a
               proud man that <span class="strikethrough">the</span> common <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> praise affects me as little as common censure; – but when any work of mind finds
               its way into a heart &amp; mind like yours, the hope with which it was written is fulfilled.</p>
