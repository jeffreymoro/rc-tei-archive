            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Upon the subject of the new system of education, two persons who desire the general
                  good, and have neither party nor private interests to serve, can hardly fail of coming
                  to the same conclusion, when they understand each other, and understand the system.
                  My view of the subject is, that it is a thing of far too great importance to be trusted
                  to so evanescent a source of support as contributions, of which nine-tenths are procured
                  like votes at a county election, by dint of earnest solicitation and the activity
                  of party spirit. It is the interest, the business, and the duty of the State to provide
                  for the education of all those whose parents have not the means of providing it for
                  them. Parochial schools ought to be established in every parish throughout the kingdom.
                  If this were done, it is absurd to expect that the State should not provide that these
                  children be educated according to the religion of the State; that is to say, that
                  they should be instructed in the Church catechism. And it would naturally follow,
                  that the parish priest should become the superintendent of the parish school. My own
                  wish would be, that the parish clerk should always be the master; care being taken
                  to train up a race for this purpose, for thus the character would be raised into respectability.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey was a keen advocate of the Madras system of Andrew Bell. He had recently expanded
                           a lengthy defence of Bell, and attack on Joseph Lancaster, in Quarterly Review, 6
                           (August 1811), 264–304, into a full-length study, The Origin, Nature and Object, of
                           the New System of Education (1812). The latter advocated that the ‘school and church
                           establishments ought … to be intimately connected’ (p. 197) and that the pupils at
                           these new national schools ‘should be allowed to accompany the master to church’ (p.
                           118). Even Bell felt that Southey had gone too far and in a letter of 10 March 1812

               <p>Thus much for the application of the system in England. In Scotland, of course, such
                  alterations are to be made as would suit the catechism to the Kirk (though I believe
                  little, if any, would be required); and in Ireland, when you give it to the Catholics,
                  you must let them teach their monstrous idolatry. But you are not to expect that a
                  scheme will succeed in that country, which endeavours to embrace Papist and Protestant,
                  by carefully excluding all points of difference. The Papists are far too wise to suffer
                  this; and I know that when it has been tried, and a few parents have been found willing
                  to send their children to these schools, the priest has waylaid them with a horsewhip,
                  and horsewhipped them back. I have not seen your friend’s book,

                  system—that whatever is learnt must be learnt thoroughly, and that every boy must
                  find his level. And by his system of punishment he sows the seeds of the vilest passions.

                           Farquahar (1738–1819; DNB), physician and confidant of the Prince of Wales. Hook had

                           of Winchester Cathedral 1807–1825, and in 1825 became Dean of Worcester. He espoused
                           political and religious orthodoxy, publishing sermons against Jacobinism and Methodism.
                           Not all his family pursued respectability with such avidity. Hook’s brother was the

                  </div> etc.—fellows with whom it is mortifying to think alike upon any subject, because you
                  are sure they would not be right, if it were not for some unworthy motive. The Dissenters
                  are consistent in taking up his cause, but I do not think they are wise in doing it.
                  There is a monstrous coalition of fanatics, infidels, and Roman Catholics against
                  the Church of England. I do not subscribe to the Church; if I could do it, I should
                  be in orders—an office to which my inclination would always strongly have led me.
                  My mind has undergone many changes, and is in many points nearer to the Church than
                  when I forbore to enter it as a minister. Still, I am far from being in communion
                  with it, or from ever expecting to be so. But I am perfectly sensible of the infinite
                  good which we derive from such a Church, and of the dreadful consequences which would
                  inevitably attend its overthrow. Your metaphor of the waste lands is a happy one;
                  what I contend against is that scheme of improvement which would throw down the inclosures.
                  You will agree with me that the great object is to secure the benefit of national
                  education; this can only be done by a permanent parochial establishment. When next

               Francesco Petrarca (1304–1374)) appeared in <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</em>, 3.1 (1812), xcii–xciii and civ–cv; see Southey to James Montgomery, 26 March 1812,
               Letter 2066. At least one poem by Jane Taylor, ‘To the Moon’, was also published in
               this volume, ciii. ‘A Character, a Fragment’, ci–cii, was probably by Ann Taylor.
               Conder’s poem ‘The Reverie’ was rejected, much to Southey’s disgust; see Southey to
               Neville White, 27 September 1812, Letter 2151. Conder later revealed in <em>The Star of the East; with Other Poems</em> (London, 1824). p. viii, that ‘The Voice of the Oak’, <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</em>, 3.1 (1812), xcviii–ci, was by ‘Eliza Thomas’, whom he married in 1815.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey was a keen advocate of the Madras system of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BellAndrew">Andrew Bell</a>. He had recently expanded a lengthy defence of Bell, and attack on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Joseph Lancaster</a>, in <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 6 (August 1811), 264–304, into a full-length study, <em>The Origin, Nature and Object, of the New System of Education</em> (1812). The latter advocated that the ‘school and church establishments ought … to
               be intimately connected’ (p. 197) and that the pupils at these new national schools
               ‘should be allowed to accompany the master to church’ (p. 118). Even Bell felt that
               Southey had gone too far and in a letter of 10 March 1812 cautioned against compulsion
               in this matter (‘we should draw the children to church by cords of love, and not drag
               them by chains of iron’), see Southey, Caroline Southey and Charles Cuthbert Southey,
               <em>The Life of the Rev. Andrew Bell</em>, 3 vols (London, 1844), II, pp. 656. <em>Hints to the Public and the Legislature, on the Nature and Effect of Evangelical Preaching.

               Clerks, but the passage was cut out. In the early nineteenth-century Clerks could
               be full or part-time and duties varied enormously from parish to parish. They might
               include reading lessons in church, organising the choir, serving at the altar and
               leading the responses, opening the church, ringing the bell and even digging graves
               if there was no sexton.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
