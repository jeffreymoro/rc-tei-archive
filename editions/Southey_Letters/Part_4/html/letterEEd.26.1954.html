               <p>We concluded our long journey with remarkable good fortune, having in the course of
                  twelve weeks &amp; nearly nine hundred miles met with only two days of wet weather, &amp;
                  neither let, hindrance, accident or inconvenience of any kind. I was much pleased
                  with Ludlow Castle, the only ruin of the kind I ever yet saw which bears evident marks
                  that it has formerly been the seat of comfort. One of my walks was to the Boney Well
                  near Richards Castle, it is one of the wonders of Guthries Grammar, &amp; had wonderfully
                  impressed my imagination when a boy.

                           2 vols (London, 1771), I, p. 281, described the ‘remarkable fountain near Richard’s
                           castle in Herefordshire, commonly called Bone-well, which is generally full of small
                           bones, like those of frogs or fish, though often cleared out’. Southey at some point
                           acquired an 1808 edition of Guthrie, no. 1256 in the sale catalogue of his library.</span></div>
                  </div> The description made me suppose a deep well, &amp; I was well enough read in the legends
                  even then to dream of caverns &amp; pigmy people. When I came to the spot I found a beautiful
                  spring, no where a foot in depth, &amp; for all I could hear about the bones the wonder
                  seemed to be that there should ever have been any wonder about them. The old Naiad
                  of the spring told me that March was the time when they were to be found, &amp; I vehemently
                  suspect that if I were to go in March she would then recommend October.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Crossing from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Teddesley</a> to Shrewsbury we past thro the iron country near Wellington. There is something very
               striking in that sort of Hell above ground, – hills of scoria, an atmosphere of smoke,
               &amp; huge black piles, consisting chiefly of chimneys &amp; furnaces, grouped together in
               <span class="strikethrough">what x</span> the finest style of the damnable picturesque. The things are too mean in themselves
               <span class="strikethrough">ever to be a</span> ever to acquire <span class="strikethrough">a</span> sublimity, to whatever <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> &lt;magnitude&gt; they may attain, but they have a hideousness which almost produces the
               same effect. They are more hideous than horrid, – there should be an obscurity about
               horror, <span class="strikethrough">hid</span> whatever is hideous is definite.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We saw a prodigious work of art of very different character, – the aqueduct over the
                  Dee near Llangollen. It is <span class="strikethrough">little</span> &lt;not&gt; more than <span class="strikethrough">half</span> &lt;two thirds&gt; the height of the aqueduct at Lisbon, but the effect is far more dizzying.
                  At Lisbon you walk between the covered gallery where the water runs, &amp; a parapet wall
                  breast high, so that you feel your security. The iron rails of the Welsh bridge by
                  giving sight of the depth immediately under your feet, make it an effort of reason
                  to imagine yourself safe, &amp; the effect of looking across a narrow canal upon a precipice,
                  from which <span class="strikethrough">as it appears</span> nothing but a two inch plank seems to seperate it, gave birth to the ‘toys of desperation’

                  </div> in a greater degree than I had ever before felt them. My knees were loosened, tho
                  I did not stop to allow them to shake, &amp; I felt an absolute longing for wings that
                  I might have launched myself into the air. This sort of feeling explains how animals
                  are fascinated by the eye of a snake or a beast of prey.</p>

               <p>I have written to Durham &amp; hope it may prove to some effect. The Taylors must so frequently
                  know persons who are in want of farms &amp; qualified to improve them, that it will be
                  unlucky if this is not the case now.
