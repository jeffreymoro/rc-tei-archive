               II (c. 1752–1814; Nawab of Oudh 1798–1814). The motion to censure Wellesley was defeated
               by 182 votes to 31 on 15 March 1808. Southey summarised the debates in the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</em>, 1.1 (1810), 133–137. Dr Knighton had presumably expressed his reservations about
               Southey’s account and suggested revisions to it.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
