                  Lake of Thirlmere, in a way seldom seen by travellers. He was exceedingly delighted
                  with it; and, as he had three waterfalls, all very fine ones, to see in the course
                  of the morning, this day, notwithstanding it is that of his departure, will not be
                  the least agreeable that he has passed in this country. He was very fortunate in the
                  weather, and saw nearly as much as the shortness of the time permitted; but enough
                  has been left unseen to supply a proper motive for another journey and a longer stay.
                  Remember your sisters are to visit us next midsummer, and I hope your excellent mother
                  will accompany them.

                  book, as a bookselling concern, seems to me rather doubtful; its failure would make
                  more difference in my emolument than in my occupation, for I am now so sensible of
                  the utility of the book, and so much interested by it, that if this concern were broken
                  up I should continue my labours, and go on with this contemporary history, as one
                  of the most important works which I could possibly bequeath to after times.</p>

                           Park had included a handful of poems by Lovell; Bristol, A Satire (1794) was added

            <p class="indent1">We had a long and weary round before we reached home.

               days with our friends at each of these places. We dined also at Llangollen with the
               celebrated ladies of the place, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LlangollenLadies">Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby</a>. The singularity of their history, the highly ornamented state of their grounds,
               and the elegance of everything about their cottage, made this a very interesting visit.</p>

                  </div> I am going on with it in a manner which satisfies me; and very probably the bearing
                  which it has upon the present state of things, and the possibility that if it were
                  published it might tend to excite in others the same ardent sympathy with the Spaniards
                  which I feel myself, may induce me to devote more time to its completion than I otherwise
