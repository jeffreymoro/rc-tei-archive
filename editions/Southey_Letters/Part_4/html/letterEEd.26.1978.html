                  </div> can doubt. I will give you only one caution, – do not be deterred from entering occasionally
                  into the minutest details because they may be trivial to you, &amp; to your contemporary
                  countrymen; these things will be novelties to us, &amp; they will be history hereafter,
                  even in Spain itself. We in England love that life &amp; reality which fulness of costume
                  gives to representation of every kind, whether in painting or poetry, historical narrative,
                  or the drama. The more of this life-painting that you give us, the more willing will
                  the reader be to follow you in your views &amp; feelings. It is a melancholy thing to
                  reflect how many valuable things have been lost to the world, because the persons

                  in 1808, &amp; gave me tidings which I <span class="strikethrough">was</span> rejoiced to hear, that the man who by his writings, both in prose &amp; verse, contributed
                  most to keep up the spirit of the Galicians, was one who had been introduced as a
                  philosopher &amp; a poet to me in 1795. – It was very delightful to me to find that a
                  man who at that time founded his hopes upon France, &amp; entertained views as enthusiastic
                  &amp; ardent as my own, – should have coincided as entirely <span class="strikethrough">with</span> &lt;in&gt; feeling with me now, as he did then. – His name is Pardo, – he had been a friar,
                  but had walked to Rome to obtain a dispensation when I saw him, &amp; then lived as a
                  secular Priest.
