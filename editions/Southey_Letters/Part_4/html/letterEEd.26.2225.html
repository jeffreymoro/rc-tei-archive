            <p class="indent1">I have something to ask you respecting Cambridge, and must first relate the circumstances
               which occasion me to make the inquiry.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Some three or four months ago, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DusautoyJames">a boy at school</a> sent me sundry specimens of his verses, asking my opinion of certain poetical plans
                  which he had formed. The verses were nothing like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> at the same age, for he had a prematurity of sense and judgment in which none but

                  and effect, and promise. I wrote him in reply a letter

                  him, cautioning him against early publication; and endeavouring to show him how these
                  pursuits, which, if they were entered upon rashly, would prove his bane, might be
                  made instrumental, in every way, to his advancement and happiness. A fortnight ago
                  there came a second letter, telling me he had left school, that his friends thought
                  the law would be the best profession for him, – that he was one of ten children, and
                  his father (an old officer)

                  </div> could do little to set him forward in life. While, therefore, he should be preparing
                  for the bar, he must do something for himself. For this purpose, he wished to make
                  his love of literature available. This, therefore, he thought, would justify, or even
                  require, earlier publication than would else be advisable; and he applied to me to
                  instruct him how he should proceed. I liked his letter; it bore with it an appearance
                  of goodness, as well as of talents; so I told him that the best way to the bar lies
                  through the University, and that there is no means by which he may so immediately
                  obtain assistance in his education, and so soon, as well as certainly, make himself
                  independent, as by going to college, – provided he behaves well there.

                           equivalent figures at Oxford University – originally they had acted as servants to
                           richer students. They wore a distinctive plain black gown and round hat.</span></div>
                  </div> (for the Oxford servitors, owing, perhaps, to an invidious distinction of dress, are
                  really a degraded class), and spoke in proper terms of those frugal habits which I
                  believed he would feel to be as honourable as they were necessary. To-night I have
                  received his answer. He and his friends are equally persuaded that I have advised
                  him well; they only doubt their means of meeting the unavoidable expenses. My first
                  business, therefore, is to ascertain what they will be as nearly as possible; and
                  my next, to see if I can procure him a sizarship.</p>

               <p>Now, my dear Neville, you can give me the needful information, by telling me what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteJames">James’s</a> yearly expenses are, and what assistance he obtains from his college. I know there
                  is a difference in these things at different colleges, but any one fact will be something
                  to judge by. What success I may have in my other applications remains to be seen.
                  There is a fellow of Peterhouse who, I think, will assist me if he can.
