               <p>I thank you for your hint about ‘Which buy’. – In the Omniana I saw no more unfitness
                  in making a note upon one of my own books than upon any other; – &amp; the lie of the
                  Critical about J of Arc was originally <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> pointed out in the Athenaeum – when you told me of it, otherwise I <span class="strikethrough">should</span> &lt;might&gt; never have known that such a thing had been said.

                           took the opportunity to rebut the assertion in the Critical Review, 10 (March 1807),
                           305, that Hole’s poem had only failed because of the number of other epics published
                           at the same time. These included his own Joan of Arc (1796). Southey pointed out that
                           his poem was published seven years after Hole’s Arthur. Southey had already made this
                           point in a letter to the Athenaeum, 13 (1 January 1808), 1–2; see Collected Letters

                  is a light evil compared to the laws of copyright. Do you know that if a bookseller
                  publishes a work upon the agreement that he takes the risk &amp; shares the profit, –
                  this by their custom gives them half the copyright! – No author ever dreamt of this;
