               <p>I shall not get this bad news out of my intestines, where it has made a lodgement,
                  if I do not give some vent to my vexation. It is very clear to me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">M Wellington</a> committed a gross blunder in besieging 2000 men at Burgos

                  </div> instead of pursuing a routed army till he had effected its destruction. And it is
                  equally clear that ministers in that cursed spirit of parsimony which is the worst
                  of all wastefulness, have crippled his exertions, &amp; sent out reinforcements, scanty
                  in themselves, &amp; such as they were too late. The tide has turned compleatly, &amp; however
                  unwilling I may be to <span class="strikethrough">confess</span> look the evil in its face, I cannot but see that we have lost the opportunity which
                  the Russian war afforded us for delivering Spain; – lost it, I verily believe, irrecoverably.
                  Buonapartes system may <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> receive its death blow in the North, – this is possible enough; – but any success
                  in that quarter will come as a God-send to us, – advantageous it would be in the highest
                  degree, but the country would have no part in the honour.</p>

            <p class="indent1">The loss of reputation sustained in Spain at this time is an evil so great in itself,
               &amp; so fearful in its consequences that I can hardly bear to think of it. The old game
               I fear will now be played over again; the next step in retreat will be to the Portugueze
               frontier, &amp; then for a defensive campaign, which will equally exhaust the blood &amp;

               praised him for a more <span class="strikethrough">enlightened</span> rational piety, if he had suspected the voice which ordered the sacrifice, to be
