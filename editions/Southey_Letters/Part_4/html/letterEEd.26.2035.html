               In <em>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</em>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p.7, Landor suggested that the British people

               Landor singled out Robert Fellowes (1770–1847; <em>DNB</em>): ‘Of late years, if any one had paid any attention to such people [reviewers] …
               one would imagine … that Aristotle only kept a box for Mr. Fellowes.// This reverent
               gentleman having settled religion to his mind, but unhappily … driven out from the
               poets, is retaliating on them as their judge. He writes, or did write, for I know
               not whether the work survives his hand, in <em>The Critical Review</em>; strange successor to the gentle, but high-minded Southey’, Landor, <em>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</em>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 146. Landor’s dislike of Fellowes had undoubtedly
               been fuelled by learning (from Southey) of the latter’s views on his poetry. Fellowes
               had observed in a letter to Seward of 1803 that: ‘The author of Gebir … has lately
               made another attempt to convey the waters of Helicon by leaden pipes, and many dark
               subterranean ways … having trod the dark profound of Gebir, I feel no inclination
               to begin another journey, which promises so little pleasure, and probably where only
               a few occasional flashes will enlighten the road’, <em>Letters of Anna Seward: Written Between the Years 1784 and 1807</em>, 6 vols (Edinburgh, 1811), V, p. 77 n. *. Fellowes’s <em>Poems, Chiefly Descriptive of the Softer and More Delicate Sensations and Emotions
