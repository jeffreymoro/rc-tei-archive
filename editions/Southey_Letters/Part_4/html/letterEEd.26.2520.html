               she has been tormented with vain attempt to remove it. First merely milk &amp; water was

               We leave it now to nature &amp; only inject the myrrh once a day. But I think there must

                  by those faults which fall in with the humour of the times, &amp; &lt;which&gt; are of course
                  ultimately fatal to the poems that contain them.</p>
