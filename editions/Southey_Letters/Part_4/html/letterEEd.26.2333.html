                  </div> My case would tend to support his theory. I got into the mail with a plentiful flowing
                  at the nose, &amp; a great disposition to cough. You know the weather was so warm during
                  the day that I did not put on my elastic shirt. It became very severe. My body clothes
                  kept my legs &amp; thighs from suffering much; but in the course of the night I found
                  it necessary to pull off great coat, coat &amp; waistcoat, &amp; slip on this new fashioned
                  under waistcoat, which I accomplished without disturbing the repose or shocking the
                  delicacy of a stupid old woman whom ill fate had <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> made the sole companion of my journey. The Laureat dressing in the mail in this situation
                  was even a better scene than his dressing for court, – had there been any one present
                  to have enjoyed it.</p>
