                  they would obtain an immediate sale is certain; everything beyond this must depend
                  upon their merit; and I confess I am a little apprehensive upon this score, merely
                  because of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> youth. It is one thing to write poems, and another to write a tale. The former requires
                  feeling, fancy, imagination – things to be found <span class="ital">within</span> – and a command of language which memory is very soon able to supply; the latter a
                  knowledge of human character and of the human mind, for which experience is necessary.
                  Of course, this fear of mine only applies to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> to him only on account of his age at which he wrote it.</p>

               <p>We in the country here are thinking and talking of nothing but these dreadful murders,
                  which seem to bring a stigma, not merely on the police, but on the land we live in,
                  and even our human nature.

                           outrage and panic, stoked by sensationalist newspaper reporting. The prime suspect,
                           John Williams (1783/4–1811; DNB), was arrested on 24 December, but hanged himself
                           in prison on 27 December before a trial could take place. His corpse was dragged through
                           the streets and (according to custom) buried at a crossroads with a stake through
                           the heart. The panic caused by the crimes led to an investigation into the London

                  </div> No circumstances which did not concern myself ever disturbed me so much. I have been
                  more affected, more agitated, but never had so mingled a feeling of horror, and indignation,
                  and astonishment, with a sense of insecurity too, which no man in this state of society
                  ever felt before, and a feeling that the national character is disgraced. I have very
                  long felt the necessity of an improved police, and these dreadful events, I hope and
                  trust will lead to the establishment of one as vigilant as that of Paris used to be.
                  The police laws cannot be too rigorous; and the usual objection that a rigorous police
                  is inconsistent with English liberty might easily be shown to be absurd.</p>

                  it, in every fair and well-judging mind. A few days ago I received a curious proof
                  of the effect which is produced by writing in the “Quarterly.” A circular letter was

                  with which my essay upon the “Evangelical Poets” concluded, and the letter itself
                  consisting in great part of my own words.
