                  speaking) must be the best judge of what will <span class="ital">tell</span> on the stage, – &amp; because the author can always restore the piece to its original

                           thought,/ Those restless elements for ever wrought,/ Fermenting in her with perpetual
                           stir,/ And thus her spirit to all evil mov’d’, The Curse of Kehama (1810), Book 11,

                  throughout the poem availed myself of the power which this gave me. The verse was
                  no bondage to me. If I do not greatly deceive myself it unites the advantages of rhyme
                  with the strength &amp; freedom of blank verse – in a manner peculiar to itself. – As
                  far as I can judge (which is of course must be from very imperfect &amp; partial means)
