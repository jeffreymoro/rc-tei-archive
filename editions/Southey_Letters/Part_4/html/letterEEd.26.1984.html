                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Thomas Kinder (c.1781–1846), a merchant, had spent some time in South America. Southey
                           borrowed Kinder’s unpublished journal of events in Buenos Ayres in 1808–1810 that
                           led to the independence of the states of the Rio de la Plata. In 1813 Southey had
                           a copy made of the journal, no. 3162 in the sale catalogue of his library. The copy

                  </div> But upon the general question no additional knowledge is required to make me form
                  my judgment. All parties are greatly to be blamed, and, from the conduct which both
                  have pursued, nothing but immediate evil can result. The colonies had long been most
                  grievously misgoverned. In that misgovernment, however, they only shared the misfortune
                  of the mother country; and if they did not receive the immediate concessions which
                  they justly expected and required when the revolution took place, they ought to have
                  remembered that this was entirely owing to the undue influence which the city of Cadiz
                  had obtained, – an influence arising wholly out of the circumstances of the war, which
                  could not be permanent by any possible contingency; for whether Spain were won or
                  lost, Cadiz would not remain the seat of government, and when it ceased to be so the
                  influence of her commercial junta would be at an end. The duty of the colonies, therefore,
                  should have been to have stated to the mother country what the grievances were from
                  which they expected to be relieved; then they should have said, “We require claiming
                  our part in your deliverance; but we will not discuss this at present, – we will not
                  appear to bargain with you in your hour of need, as if we were endeavouring to force
                  that from your distress which it ought to be your pride and truest policy to grant
                  us in your prosperity. If you succeed in this dreadful struggle, you will grant it.
                  If you fail, the Spaniards will have no other country than these colonies. We will,
                  therefore, stand by you to the last, and assist you to the utmost of our resources.”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The <span class="ital">fact</span> is, Neville, that there is a French party in these colonies. To my knowledge, the
                  deputies from the Caraccas have expressed their sorrow that England does not recall
                  her troops from Portugal, because they say, then the contest would be over; the mother
                  country must fall, and there would no longer be any obstacle to a free trade between
                  this country and Venezuela.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A Congress at Caraccas had declared the independence of Venezuela on 5 July 1811.
                           Southey was deeply hostile to the Venezuelan Revolution, seeing it as a tool of French
                           and American interests, Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811, 4.1 (1813), 367–394.</span></div>
                  </div> Thus would these men barter away the birthright of a whole nation, and the independence
                  of the country of their fathers, for a mess of pottage. I have no patience for such
                  sordid selfishness. It is better (supposing the two things incompatible) that Spain
                  should be free, than that the Caraccans should have a free trade; for this is the
                  alternation upon which these men, who call themselves patriots, and talk of liberty
                  and of rights, have thus decided.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It is evident to me that the Anglo-Americans separated from the parent state at least
               a century too soon. They became independent before they had a race of scholars or
               of gentlemen among them. Their independence is not yet thirty years old, and see what
               a national character they have obtained and deserved. But the Spanish Americans are
               even less fitted to form a new state, for they are far more ignorant; and the morals
               of the worst part of the United States (Virginia and the other southern states) are
               less depraved than those of the best parts of Spanish America; but the one main cause
               of inevitable depravity exists in both – the practice of slavery. The idleness of
               the Spaniards leads them still more to sensuality, and the Roman Catholic religion
               demoralises every people among whom it takes root.</p>
