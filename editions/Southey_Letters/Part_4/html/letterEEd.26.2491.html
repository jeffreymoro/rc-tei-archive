               was all in a fume/ At the thought of the march to Moscow:/ The Russians, he said,
               they were undone,/ And the great Fee-Faw-Fum/ Would presently come/ With a hop, step,
               and jump unto London./ For as for his conquering Russia,/ However some persons might
               scoff it,/ Do it he could, and do it he would,/ And from doing it nothing would come
               but good,/ And nothing could call him off it./ Mr. Jeffrey said so, who must certainly
               know,/ For he was the Edinburgh Prophet./ They all of them knew Mr. Jeffrey’s Review,/
               Which with Holy Writ ought to be reckon’d:/ It was through think and thin to its party
               true;/ Its back was buff, and its sides were blue/ Morbleu! Parbleu!/ It served them
