                  for narrative poetry, – the tone &amp; character of the narrative always with me determine
                  what the metre should be, – but of all measures the heroic couplet seems to me the
                  most unsuitable for narration. You have broken yours by a free admixture of pauses
                  in your West Indies, &amp; in so doing you have gained much; still I dislike it, it continually
                  seduces the writer to commit sins against good sense &amp; good English, he aims at pointing
                  his meaning instead of bringing it distinctly out, gets into all the tricks of antithesis,
                  &amp; when he should be thinking &amp; feeling, passes off a sort of way-jolt of words both
                  upon himself &amp; &lt;his&gt; readers. Our poetry owes half its barbarisms to this metre. You
                  will do with it all that can be done, &amp; I have no doubt will avoid its natural faults
                  as far as they can be avoided. Were I to use a regular rhymed measure for narration,
