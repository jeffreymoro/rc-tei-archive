               <p>I have written a chapter this week in D<sup>r</sup> Daniel Dove which will delight your heart – it contains an account from an Ogham inscription
                  of the second fall of Eve &amp; her eating the forbidden Potatoe, &amp; how Pahat escaped
                  at the Deluge &amp; his Ark rested upon Mount Taurus. Likewise a fragment of Milesian
                  history concerning Pahats family, King Ballunder &amp;c – &amp; how the people of the Verdant
                  Isle worshipped the Queen of the Bulls, who is the Whore of the Hills. I long to show
                  you this. The account of Pahats family will do your heart good. You will also enjoy
                  D<sup>r</sup> Doves proofs of the excellences of the letter D, &amp; the birth of Nobs &amp;c. I have about
                  a volume of this great history done, &amp; could willingly stick to it till the whole
                  were finished.
