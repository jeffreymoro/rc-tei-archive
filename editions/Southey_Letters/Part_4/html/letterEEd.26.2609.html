               &amp; a little to the right of the windpipe, which I found out by my shirt collars becoming
               tight upon me. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> saw it yesterday. You know I just know enough of nosology to have in turn every imaginable
               disease; – however I persuaded <span class="strikethrough">x</span> myself that this was not an aneurism, because I could find no pulsation. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> is not certain whether it is an enlargement of some muscle whose name I do not remember,
               – or if it be something under that muscle which protrudes it, &amp; which he imagines
               may be some of those hydatids who seem to have taken a fancy to me. You know I have
               two lumps of them on my head &amp; there is a third coming. If it be so, he says, they
               will make way to the surface &amp; suppurate. But there is no soreness nor any pain whatever.
               He has given me a discutient lotion, &amp; if that fail will apply a mercurial plaister
               for the same purpose, – &amp; he desires me to use no muscular exertion that I can avoid.
               I am not sensible of having straind myself, – tho it is very possible I may have done
               so, for I am fond of muscular exertion, such as hanging by the hands from a bough
               &amp;c. Aneurism, he says, it is not: which of course he would say, – but I believe him;
               – nor is it any thing in the nature of a wen. In short it is some damned thing or
               nother, as the Hampshire foxhunter said of his dyspepsy, – &amp; I cannot button my shirt-collar
               &amp; must not row in a boat, – which prohibition at this season is an evil.</p>

               captained by himself or his father. He wished to lead a government sponsored expedition,
               and in 1817–1818 corresponded at length about this with Joseph Banks (1743–1820; <em>DNB</em>). His idea was taken up, but command was given to the naval officer David Buchan
               (1780–1838). In spite of this, Scoresby continued his Arctic researches, publishing
               numerous scientific papers and an <em>Account of the Arctic Regions</em> (1820) and <em>Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale-Fishery</em> (1823). Southey’s information was from a report in the <em>Literary Panorama, and National Register</em>, 2 (May 1815), cols 290–291.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
