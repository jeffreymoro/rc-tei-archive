                  He has been writing upon this Bullion question, &amp; the doctrine which he advances is
                  that the whole evil consists in the error of having fixed a standard price for gold,

                           Also Demonstrating that the Notes of the Bank of England are Not Depreciated (1810).
                           It went into a second edition in 1811, and Koster followed this with Further Observations

                  this seems almost incredible. The kingdom’s depreciation of Bank Notes he shows to
                  be a mere absurdity. The depreciation of paper money shews itself like that of the
                  stocks numerically &amp; palpable. A pound note is not depreciated when it passes for
                  twenty shillings. The fact is that gold has become scarcer &amp; therefore dearer. &amp; no

               of allegations that he had profited from office trafficking. After a lengthy investigation,
               the charges were found to be unproven. It had, however, become apparent that his former
               mistress Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776–1852; <em>DNB</em>) had received money from individuals keen for her to use her influence with the Duke,
               and that the Duke himself had known of her actions. For Southey’s account, <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</em>, 2.1 (1811), 109–301.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
