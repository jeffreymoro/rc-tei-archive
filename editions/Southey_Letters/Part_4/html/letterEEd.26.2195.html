               <p>In the first volume of Clarkes Travels there are the portraits of some Calmuck Gods,
                  – very notable to me, as distinctly showing me the pedigree of Tezcalipoca &amp; my other
                  Mexican friends, – traceable in this line to India.

                  </div> This book of Clarkes is curious. I never derived so much valuable information from
                  any work, which left me with so little respect for the author. Shallow, conceited
                  &amp; prejudiced to the highest degree; perseverance, activity, amiable spirits, &amp; acquired
                  talents have enabled him to render good service to literature.</p>
