                  </div> The truth is that tho they went with me to Durham, they came back with me also, –
                  for dissipation allowed me less leisure than I always possess amid my own regular
                  employments. I had to see this place &amp; that place, – people called on me &amp; I was to
                  call on them in return, visiting eating &amp; drinking took up no small portion of my
                  time, &amp; what little time was not thus taken up was given to some books from the Cathedral
                  libraries. We were absent from home nineteen days, two of which were past with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LoshJames">Losh</a>. He desired to be remembered to you, &amp; requested me to say how glad he should be
                  if when you came into the North you could make his house in your way. Now that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Sir Domine</a> is at Durham you may perhaps one day accomplish this, especially as Durham is I think
                  more worth seeing than any other place in England. Indeed I never saw any thing equal
                  to it, &amp; the more I saw the more it delighted me.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> went with us, meaning to return here, – he has however fallen over head &amp; ears in
               love, &amp; remains at Durham. From all his goings on there, &amp; his staying behind it seems
               as if he were very much in earnest, notwithstanding the mortal objection of want of
               fortune on both side. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheySarah">Lady</a> is about 30, singularly interesting, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">with xx</span> very much respected for her excellent conduct during many family difficulties. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> was so incessantly at the house that it is not possible his attentions could have
               been overlooked, &amp; hardly possible that he could have been there so much unless they
               had been encouraged, – which considering worldly circumstances is sufficiently strange.
               I suppose he will write to me ere long &amp; explain his views. She was engaged to a young
               man who died, &amp; his family then settled 100£ a year upon her, as a mark of their respect.
               This &lt;annuity&gt; I should suppose would cease if she married. As to prudential calculations
               however <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> is <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> able to make them for himself, &amp; as I believe he might search the world round without
               making a better choice, I shall be more disposed to excuse him if he acts imprudently,
               than to volunteer advice which when it is unwelcome is generally unavailing.</p>
