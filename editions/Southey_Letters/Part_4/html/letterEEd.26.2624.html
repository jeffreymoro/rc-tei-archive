                  – &amp; they are extensive: the consequence probably will be that in spite of all endeavours

               “ascending me to the brain,” and drying up the vapours’; ‘We have produced ample authorities
               to prove the deplorable extent of this practice of drinking in England, and, if any
               further example should be wanting, it may be found in the person of our laureat himself,

               fascination of a butt of sack, and taken to tippling and scandalizing his neighbours
