                           Letter 1974. Charles had rented one of Landor’s largest farms at Llanthony. Betham
                           and Landor were soon in dispute over the rent and the use of the land. The final straw
                           was when Betham’s brother, Frederick (b. 1789/1790), dug up trees Landor had planted.
                           Landor denounced Frederick in a handbill that he personally posted up in Monmouth
                           during the assizes. Betham sued for libel, Landor lost and had to pay £100 in damages.

                  alter the plain facts, which are as bad as possible. – He sent me a vulgar fellow
                  from Aberga’ny last summer, which gave me a bad opinion of his taste in companions.
