                  nothing more has been heard, and probably the next intelligence about it may be in
                  the Gazette. There can be no doubt that it will be mine, tho of course I shall not
                  reckon upon it till the appointment has been signed. Now my dear Edith, whenever this
                  does take place, I have made up my mind to consider it as a God-send the use of which
                  I may very well forego &amp; therefore the best manner in which it can be applied will
                  be to insure my life as far as the salary will go; it will cover an insurance for
                  2500£, or perhaps 3000£. The paltry income <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxx</span> which is attached to the laurel becomes of real importance by enabling me to make
                  this provision in addition to my former insurance. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> tells me that there can be no better way of investing money; for if at any time I
                  should find it either unnecessary or inconvenient to continue <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> the insurance (either from being too rich to need it, or too poor to afford it) the
                  office will always purchase my life out, – that is they will repay all that has paid
                  in with a current interest upon it. And the advantage is always increasing, so much
                  so that the one thousand for which I stand insured would in case of my death at this
                  time produce 1100, – a yearly interest of 2½ per cent accruing upon the sum insured.
                  – As soon as my appointment is gazetted I will give <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> a power of attorney to receive the salary, &amp; apply it in this manner.</p>
