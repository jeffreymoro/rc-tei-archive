            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Six months ago you asked me a question respecting my Income Tax.

                           Bedford, who worked in the Exchequer; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 21
                           April 1814, Letter 2406. Bedford’s response had clearly not allayed his concerns.</span></div>
                  </div> I have chewed the cud upon that question ever since. <span class="strikethrough">The pr</span> When a man once gets into his own Court of Conscience he is sure to be cast there.
                  The process in my mind has been – I wish I had paid it. I wish I could pay it. I ought
                  to pay it. I must pay it. I will pay it. You have it here in brief, but the process
                  was long &amp; not very easy. Especially with the staring question How the Devil is it
                  to be paid?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My income was fairly given in originally, – for my authorship concerns for many years
                  left me more &amp; more a debtor to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a>, – to whom I am debtor at this moment between 2 &amp; 300 £. I was living upon credit
                  till the Register began,

                  </div> &amp; am living upon credit now. For the Register most certainly the tax was clearly due,
                  – but to the best of my recollection I have never <span class="strikethrough">been</span> received a schedule since it began. For after having returned first my annuity

                  I must engage again in the heavy task of a Register which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> offers;

                  </div> &amp; set apart 100 £ out of each volume for this purpose. You must find <span class="strikethrough">means</span> &lt;the way&gt; of paying it for me, &amp; no person but you must know the transaction, if it

                  of two years &amp; a half. – there is a difficulty also in beginning to pay regularly:
                  &amp; I must avail myself of the commencement of this new concern to do it, if I can tell
                  how. As for the removal of the tax

                  </div> it is manifestly a thing not to be looked for, – not possible in the state of our
                  finances; &amp; I hardly think it can even be lessened. Altered it most certainly ought

                  I have written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a>, without saying a word about terms; – in my letter to him I rather advise that the

                  </div> – but in spite of the additional labour <span class="strikethrough">I</span> my secret wishes are that he may chuse to continue the former work; – for were I to

                  has ever yet produced. Perhaps too, &amp; this has at the moment occurred to me, a continuance
                  of the work might make my luckless share in it turn out a good venture after all.
