                    opinion, that I have no doubt but that they will all be obviated.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The letter deals with
                        Southey’s work for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>, for which he wrote the historical section. It is part of an
                        exchange with Lundie and <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames ">Ballantyne</ref> over the content and tone of Southey’s
                        contributions and also the structure and contents of the <title>Register</title> itself. In particular, the potential overlap
                        between Southey’s account in part 1 of the <title>Register</title> of British and continental events in 1808 and the
                        ‘Chronicle’ that appeared separately in part 2. See also Southey to John Ballantyne 19 September 1810, Letter 1807.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I perfectly agree with you that the Appendix should be common both to the History &amp; Chronicle.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), pp. i–ciii, contained an ‘Appendix’ of 42 State Papers; there
                        was no ‘Appendix’ to <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.2 (1810). In <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), the ‘Appendix’ contained only 7 State Papers, pp. i–xxix. The ‘Chronicle’ remained in
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.2 (1811), still without an ‘Appendix’.</note> There appears to me
                    however a convenience in placing it between them as it at present stands, because <del>the</del> of the division of the work into
                    two parts or volumes. The History &amp; the State papers filled one for the last year in as just a proportion as if they had been
                    calculated with that view. I apprehend that this year the history will occupy more room – the state papers less; – the excess of
                    one being balanced by the deficit in the other <del>departmen</del> portion. But were the Chronicle transferred to the first part,
                    it would, I apprehend swell the bulk <del>of the xxxxx xxxxxx</del> disproportionately &amp; there is no unfitness in referring
                        <hi rend="ital">back</hi> from it to the Appendix. </p><p rend="indent1"> The Appendix I would confine exclusively to State-papers, – that is to say, Treaties Proclamations Manifestoes
                    &amp; things of this kind. – Gazettes &amp; Bulletins belong to the Chronicle, – but whether to insert them as they occur, or
                    place them altogether in chronological order, is certainly a point of some difficulty. I incline to the latter plan, &amp; to the
                    opinion that the Chronicle should be considered chiefly as a register of domestic events, preserving every thing from our
                    newspapers which marks the state of society, <del>x</del> the virtues &amp; vices of the time, – in short whatever would assist
                    our contemporaries abroad, or our posterity at home in obtaining as compleat a knowledge as possible of Great Britain in our
                    times. Of the main events of the year I think it would be superfluous to give any account in this department, the substance being
                    contained in the History, &amp; the official statement in the Gazettes. But those naval transactions <del>xxxxx</del> which have
                    neither cause nor consequence beyond what their own story explains, may all be referred to the Chronicle, in preference to the
                    Gazette. Gazette account being always the dullest, &amp; not always the clearest.</p><p rend="indent1"> The Duke of York’s business forms so material a part of the parliamentary proceedings that I am compelled to enter
                    into a full detail of it: it is a task equally irksome &amp; laborious.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809, Prince
                        Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763–1827; <title>DNB</title>) had been forced to resign as commander-in-chief of the
                        British army in the wake of allegations that he had profited from office trafficking. After a lengthy investigation, the
                        charges were found to be unproven. It had, however, become apparent that his former mistress Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776–1852;
                            <title>DNB</title>) had received money from individuals keen for her to use her influence with the Duke, and that the Duke
                        himself had known of her actions. For Southey’s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
                        109–301.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> You, as it appears to me, need only refer to <del>xxx</del> what passed in Parliament: while the out-of-door
                    meetings upon the subject in town &amp; country belong to your department.</p><p rend="indent1"> Concerning the arrangement of dates I have only to say that your observations are perfectly just, &amp; that there
                    cannot be a better plan than the one which you propose to adopt, both as to the occurrences of the year, &amp; the articles of
                    miscellaneous matter occurring in the journals. The work will also be very materially benefitted by your occasional comments &amp;
                    explanations.</p><p rend="indent1"> You complain of a scantiness of materials, – <del>x</del> this is a difficulty which I know but too well how to
                    appreciate. The daily London papers are not those which would afford you the best supply. – I believe one of those weekly papers
                    which exclude all advertisements &amp; thereby in any lack of news are compelled to fill their columns with provincial
                        <del>news</del> events would prove more useful in this point than the Times, – which I instance as being perhaps <del>the best
