                    nevertheless I will wish you as many as you may be capable of enjoying, &amp;
                    the more the better. Winter is passing on mildly with us, &amp; if &lt;it were
                    not for&gt; our miry soil &amp; bad ways <del>did not</del> I should not wish
                    for pleasanter weather than January has brought with it. Ailments rather than
                    inclination have led me of late to take regular exercise, which I was wont to
                    think I could do without as well as a Turk: so I take two or three of the
                    children with me, &amp; giving them leave to call upon me for their daily walk,
                    their eagerness overcomes my propensities to the chair &amp; the desk. We now go
                    before breakfast, for the sake of getting the first sunshine on the mountains, –
                    which when the snow is on them is more glorious than at any other season.
                    Yesterday I think I heard the Wild Swan; &amp; this morning had the finest sight
                    of wild fowl I ever beheld. There was a cloud of them above the lake,
                        <del>xxxxxxx</del> at such a height that frequently they became invisible;
                    then twinkled into sight again, sometimes spreading like smoke <del>when</del>
                    &lt;as&gt; it ascends, then contracting as if performing some military
                    evolution, once they formed a perfect bow; &amp; thus wheeling &amp; changing
                    &amp; rising &amp; falling they continued to sport as long as I could watch
                    them. They were probably wild ducks.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Your godson</ref> is determined to be a
                    Poet he says; &amp; I was not a little amused by his telling me this morning
                    when we came near a hollow tree which has caught his eye lately, &amp; made him
                    ask me sundry questions about it, – that the first poem which he should make
                    should be about that hollow tree, – I have made some progress in rhyming the
                    Greek accidents for him, – an easier thing than you would perhaps suppose it to
                    be, <del>Xxxxxxxxx</del> it tickles his humour, &amp; lays hold of his memory. </p><p rend="indent1"> This last year has been full of unexpected events, – such indeed
                    as mock all human foresight. The present will bring with it business of
                    importance at home whatever may happen abroad. I do not think we sent Lord
                    Walpole to the right place,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Horatio
                        Walpole, styled Lord Walpole before he succeeded as 3rd Earl of Orford
                        (1783–1858), MP for Kings Lynn 1809–1822. He was a member of the British
                        diplomatic staff in Russia 1813–1815.</note> – for the moment Austria ceases
                    to fear Buonaparte she will incline to support him, – but at Berlin &amp; at
                    Dresden some good might be produced.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                        this paragraph Southey sets out his plan for waging war against France in
                        northern Europe. He hoped to draw Prussia, Saxony and possibly Austria into
                        a new coalition with Russia against the French; and to replace the Duchy of
                        Warsaw, which France had created out of Prussian Poland in 1807, with a new,
                        enlarged Kingdom of Poland, thus reversing the division of the country
                        between Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1792–1795.</note> The <del>great
                        xxxxx</del> best thing which could possibly be done would be for Russia to
                    reestablish Poland, – not piece-meal as France has done, – but fairly restoring
                    her own ill-gained portion, – &amp; claiming the rest for a King of her own
                    appointment – Prince Czartorinsky<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Prince
                        Adam Czartoryski (1770–1861), Polish nobleman and good friend of Alexander I
                        (1777–1825; Tsar of Russia 1801–1825), who he served as Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs 1804–1806.</note> perhaps. Prussia would consent to this if
                    recompensed by the restitution of her other lost dominions. And that the North
                    of Germany would confederate against France, if any new plan were formed for its
                    deliverance is beyond all doubt. I believe also that they could do this
                        <del>xxx</del> more willingly when there was no danger of their aggrandizing
                    Austria by their success. </p><p rend="indent1"> I was pleased to find in Gascoignes poems that the English
                    Officers spoke of the Dutch then, just as they speak of the Spaniards now: –
                    &amp; represented Haarlem as a single &amp; insulated proof of patriotism – as
                    Zaragoza has been instanced: there are the same complaints of them as cold &amp;
                    half-hostile allies, &amp; the same distrust of the issue.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Gascoigne (c. 1535–1577;
                            <title>DNB</title>), ‘The Devises of Sundrie Gentlemen’ (1573), lines
                        284–303; quoted in Robert Southey to John Rickman, 23 March 1814, Letter
                        2396. Southey compares English views of the Dutch as allies in the war
                        against Spain in 1572–1648 with their view of the Spanish as allies in the
                        war against France in 1808–1813; and the effect of Dutch resistance during
                        the siege of Haarlem in 1572–1573 with that of Spanish resistance at the
                        siege of Zaragoza in 1808–1809.</note> There is one point in which most men,
                    however opposite in their judgements – about the affairs of the peninsula have
                    been <del>xxxx xxxxx</del> deceived, – in their expectations from the
                        Cortes.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The representative assembly

                        Constitution of 1812.</note> There is a lamentable want of wisdom in the
                    country, among the peasantry its place is supplied by their love of the soil
                    &amp; that invincible perseverance which so strongly marks the Spanish
                    character: Buonaparte never can subdue them even if his power had received no
                    shock, &amp; his whole attention were exclusively directed toward Spain, <del>it

                        a fanatical and intolerant Muslim.</note> (as great a villain as himself)
                    would not give him time to wear out their perseverance &amp; religious hatred. I
                    have never doubted of the eventual independence of Spain; but concerning the
                    government which may grow out of the struggle my hopes diminish, &amp; I begin
                    to think that Portugal has better prospects than Spain, because the government
                    there may be induced to reform itself; &amp; it is only when reform originates
                    there that, in these days, good can be produced without evil. </p><p rend="indent1"> If <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> prints

                        by Ann (née McHardy, b. c. 1770, d. after 1840), the widow of Richard Parker
                        (1767–1797; <title>DNB</title>) who had been executed for his role in the
                        Nore naval mutiny of 1797. Parker had been hanged from the yardarm on HMS
                            <hi rend="ital">Sandwich</hi>. Ann Parker had witnessed the execution
                        from a small boat and later retrieved her husband’s corpse, which she put on
                        public display in Rochester and then London. Magistrates, in fear of public
                        disorder, intervened and Parker was buried in the vault of St Mary
                        Matefelon, Whitechapel. His widow was still living in 1840, reportedly blind
                        and impoverished.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> What part do you take in the E. Indian question?<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The debate about whether the East India Company
