                    accumulation of more weeks correspondence than I dare remember, makes me at once sensible &amp; ashamed of the long lapse of time
                    since it was received. It would be <del>xxx</del> needless to say that I am much gratified by your general opinion of
                        Roderick.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> To most of your objections I can reply satisfactorily to my own
                    judgement. The eleven syllable lines (by which we <del>now we</del> must here understand <del>them</del> those which have the
                    redundant syllable any where <hi rend="ital">except at the end</hi>,) I justify upon principle &amp; precedent,
                        <del>appealing</del> &lt;referring&gt; to the practise of Shakespere &amp; Milton, as authorities from which there can be no
                    appeal: the blending two short syllables into the time of one is as well known in versification as what are called binding-notes
                    are in music.</p><p rend="indent1"> The descriptive passages are the relief of the poem, – the time in which the action took place <del>x</del> not
                    affording me any costume available for this purpose. And relief was especially required in a work wherein the passion was pitched
                    so high. P 191 you have hit a blot.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 16, lines 61–83.</note> The passage is too long, unless it were
                    better. P 229 does not displease me. – I wanted to indicate that the <del>xxxx</del> Bear &amp; Wild-Ass were found at that time
                    in Spain, – &amp; here they seemed to me characteristically &amp; <del>easily</del> naturally introduced.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 18, lines 267–273.</note> 295–6 The Moors speeches cannot be
                    curtailed without being spoilt: I wished to mark in the one the infidelity which was not uncommon in that age among the Moslems,
                    &amp; in both to <del>xxx</del> notice some Mahommedan superstitions which are well suited for poetry.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 23, lines 145–178.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I cannot abbreviate the <del>scene betw</del> first scene between Julian &amp; Roderick without destroying the

                    with so much effect as in its present place where it is so related as at once to mark the character of Rusilla? </p><p rend="indent1"> Your objection to the manner in which Orpas is dismounted has not occurred to others (that is as far as any
                    objections have reached me) – I thought I had sufficiently mailed force enough, – but however I will endeavour to amend it

                    acknowledge, – &amp; I was tempted to it by the grandiloquence of the <del>xx</del> word: you need not be told how desirable it
                    often is to enrich blank verse with sonorous words. </p><p rend="indent1"> The image of the clouds &amp; the moon<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 21, lines 427–434.</note> I saw from my chamber window at Cintra

                    with all the accompanying earth-scenery.</p><p rend="center"> _____</p><p rend="indent1"> Thus much for Roderick. Shall I ever accomplish another work of equal magnitude? I am an older man in feelings than
                    in years, &amp; the natural bent of my inclinations <del>x</del> would be never again to attempt one.</p><p rend="indent1"> The last Register<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1812</title> (1814). The historical section was written by the Scottish lawyer and writer,
                    James Russell (1790–1861; <title>DNB</title>).</note> was not mine, nor do I know by whom it was written. I have

                            1811</title> (1813). Southey felt that responsibility for non-payment lay with John Ballantyne, whose ‘shuffling’ habits
                        he particularly disliked.</note> I have never been wholly paid, – &amp; have been shuffled out of from 3 to 400£ altogether to
                    me a very serious loss. At present my time is divided at fits between the history of the Spanish war,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s<title> History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> &amp; that of Brazil; the latter is
                    in the press, &amp; will be publishd about the close of the year.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> The second volume of
                        the <title>History of Brazil</title> appeared in 1817 and was followed by a third and final volume in 1819.</note> I shall
                    follow it immediately with the history of Portugal, which will be by far the most interesting of my historical works.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ‘History of Portugal’ was neither completed nor published.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> The prospect of affairs is very unpromising at home. Never did any Ministry stand more in need of reinforcements,
                    &amp; I know not where they are to look for them. You know how much I abhorred the inequality of the Property Tax; – yet assuredly
                    I would have had it continued for one or two years longer, that Government might have had every possible facility in winding up
                    the accounts of so arduous a war: this would have been both just &amp; politick. It has been yielded to a cry produced by a
                    coalition between the mob &amp; the landed-interest.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Government had made an
                        announcement in the House of Commons on 9 February 1815 that income tax would be abolished. In fact, the renewed war with
                        France in 1815 meant the war-time income tax was not finally ended until 1816.</note> And what a scrape have they got
                    themselves into by the Corn Bill!<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Government had introduced its proposal for a
                        sliding scale of duties on imported corn on 1 March 1815. The Bill passed on 23 March 1815, despite much urban
                        opposition.</note> &amp; where was their common sense that they could not foresee the clamour &amp; the consequences? The
                    question is by no means a clear one: but this is perfectly clear that unless the <del>argum</del> reasons for the bill were
                    demonstrable to the plainest capacity, &amp; <del>in</del> the measure itself indispensably necessary, <del>xx</del> any thing so
                    repugnant to the known feeling of the people, &amp; <hi rend="ital">apparently</hi> so injurious to the lower classes ought not to

                            inclosure has not survived; but consisted of two stanzas belonging to ‘The March to Moscow’, a ‘droll ballad’, first
                            published in the <title>Courier</title>, 23 June 1814. One of the stanzas, that satirised William Roscoe, was suppressed
                            (much to Southey’s disgust) in the published version; for the stanza, see Southey to John Rickman, 15 June 1814, Letter
                            2442. Post-publication, Southey had added another stanza which took a swipe at <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref>. It read: ‘And Counsellor Brougham was
                            all in a fume/ At the thought of the march to Moscow:/ The Russians, he said, they were undone,/ And the great
                            Fee-Faw-Fum/ Would presently come/ With a hop, step, and jump unto London./ For as for his conquering Russia,/ However
                            some persons might scoff it,/ Do it he could, and do it he would,/ And from doing it nothing would come but good,/ And
