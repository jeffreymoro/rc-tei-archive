                    that, God willing, we expect this next midsummer to bid you &amp; <ref target="people.html#Cottlefamily">your sister Mary</ref>
                    welcome to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. Heartily – heartily glad shall we be to see you both. It is a long way
                    to come, – but the place is worth the trouble of the journey, &amp; if you went to the worlds end, you would not find a more
                    cordial reception upon the way, nor at the close of the journey.</p><p rend="indent1"> My goings on are as usua<del>lly</del>, – as it was in the beginning, so it is now, &amp; so I trust it will be as
                    long as it please God to continue to me the gifts of health &amp; ability. The first volume of my Hist of Brazil would have been
                    publishd two months ago if the <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Printer</ref> had pleased, – but when it may please him to
                    finish it, he knows better than I do<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">. The first volume of <title>The History of
                            Brazil</title> was published in 1810.</note> My patience is not exhausted, but my charity towards him is, &amp; I would
                    gladly apply cogent motives to him in the shape of a little wholesome flogging at the carts tail. Kehama<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Curse of Kehama</title>, published in 1810.</note> is finished; – a great satisfaction to me on this account, that
                    since I resumed it, it has been wholly written before breakfast, with the exception of the last 100 – or 150 lines which were done
                    at a heat, for the sake of coming in at the end of the race. It <del>x</del> is gone to press &amp; I have corrected the first
                    proof. every body will stare at this poem, &amp; very very few persons will like it, – I think you will be one of the number. It
                    will I doubt not procure for me much immediate abuse &amp; ridicule, &amp; some after reputation. I have begun another poem, of
                    which Pelayo the <del>Spanish</del> founder of the Spanish throne is the hero.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> An early
                        idea for what became <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). Pelayo [Pelagius] (d. 737; reigned 718–737) was
                        the founder of the Kingdom of Asturias. He is credited with beginning the Christian reconquest of the Iberian
                        peninsula.</note> very little is done, – not quite the first section, – but it is to my satisfaction. The metre is regular
                    blank verse. wild measures suit wild subjects, but when the whole interest which is to be excited arises out of human
                        <del>passions</del> &lt;interests&gt; &amp; human sympathies, our blank verse is in my judgement the most dignified form of
                    narration &amp; the best. Of course it is my hope to make this my best poem as a whole, – tho there &lt;are&gt; parts in some of
                    my others which it <del>will</del> is not likely that I shall ever be able to exceed. My hand has not lost its cunning, &amp; it
                    is to be regarded as a proof of improvement rather than otherwise that I write less rapidly than I did fifteen years ago, – being
                    less easily satisfied with myself.</p><p rend="indent1"> Filthy Mammon has me on the hip, – or I should do more in this way. My feelings concerning the lucre of gain are
                    just what they always were, – only that dearer times &amp; increasing expences make a larger income necessary than sufficed me in
                    former years, – &amp; God be praised my means have always hitherto increased with my wants. The Quarterly Review is a great help
                    to me, – they pay ten guineas per sheet, &amp; for the life of Nelson on which I am now at work twenty.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> For Southey’s review of John Charnock (1756–1806; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Biographical Memoirs of Lord
                            Viscount Nelson, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.; with Observations, Critical and Explanatory</title> (1806); James Harrison (d.

                            Nelson</title> (1813).</note> Last year I got from it about 100 guineas, – &amp; this year shall receive considerably
                    more. But <del>my</del> the most advantageous engagement that has ever occurred to me, is with the Edinburgh Annual Register, –
                    for which I have undertaken the historical part at the price of 400£. If this continues a <del>few years</del> year or two longer,
                    my affairs with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> will clear themselves &amp; I shall be above the world.
                    Hitherto I have outrun the Constable<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> To ‘outrun the Constable’ was an old phrase that
                        signified getting into debt.</note> with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> – tho never so as to exceed the
                    value of my share of the current editions in his hands. His language to me has always been ‘draw for what you want,’ – &amp; I
                    verily believe that he has much personal regard for me as he can have for a man whom he personally knows so little.</p><p rend="indent1"> I anticipate great pleasure in showing you my library, &amp; the prospect from its window. I would say my children
                    too, – if on this subject I were not far too sensible of the uncertainty of human life ever to look before me with confidence. We
                    have three living, &amp; at present, thank God, doing well. One we lost in May last at the age of 15 months, – <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">a lovely little girl</ref>.</p><p rend="indent1"> Tell me now something of your goings on, for it is long since I have heard of you. What have you done? what are you

                    &amp; you daily, &amp; met with faces in your shop, so many of which I shall never behold again. My brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> has been marrie[MS cut] almost a year, &amp; is doing well at Durham,
                    whither I take the two Ediths<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">wife</ref>

                    well. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> I think you have a chance of seeing about this time, as he expects to have
                    what he calls a run upon the sod. My <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">younger &lt;brother&gt;</ref> is vagabonding. Heaven
                    knows where. The last news of him was that having – been once more provided for (solely for his names-sake) by persons with whom I
                    had no personal acquaintance whatever, with a commission in a Portugueze regiment – taken from the ranks by them, &amp; fitted out
                    for his rank, – he was turning his equipment into money, throwing up this situation, &amp; preparing to be a vagrant again. It is
                    a case of moral insanity, – a species of madness of which both philosophy &amp; charity may acknowledge the existence.</p><p rend="indent1"> I hope you saw my triumphant vindication of the Baptist Mission in the first number of the Quarterly Review<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">.

                        Review</title>, 1 (February 1809), 193–226.</note> It is most ungraciously acknowledged in the Methodist Magazine, –
