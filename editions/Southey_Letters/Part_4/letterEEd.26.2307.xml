                    in defence of the Spanish cause, &amp; was a very proper person to have it. <del>before this</del><ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson"> Croker</ref> soon afterwards met <ref target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord
                        Liverpool</ref> &amp; told him what had past, &amp; <ref target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord L.</ref> expressed his sorrow
                    that he had not known it a day sooner for he &amp; <ref target="people.html#HertfordLord">Lord Hertford</ref> having consulted
                    together who was the best poet of the day, had in consequence offered it to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter

                    have been consulted before the office was disposed of; it was his pleasure that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey should have it,
                    &amp; therefore have it he should. <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> then observed that <hi rend="ital">he</hi> was <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> friend as well as mine, that <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> &amp; I were friends also, &amp; that for the sake of all <del>xxxx</del>, the

                        September [1813], telling Southey that he had declined the Poet Laureateship and instead recommended him to Croker. He also
                        cautioned ‘I am uncertain if you will like it, for the laurel has certainly been tarnished by some of its wearers, and as at
                        present managed, its duties are inconvenient and somewhat liable to ridicule’, H. C. Grierson (ed.), <title>The Letters of

                    it were understood that I should not be expected to write verses like exercises at stated times &amp; on stated subjects, but left
                    upon great public events to commemorate them or not, just as the spirit might move.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> See

                    appointment will be in the next batch of paper which the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> signs. It is a
                    paltry salary 100£, with 25 more as a <del>xxx</del> commutation for a tierce of Spanish Canary wine. the net income falls short
                    of the hundred; – but to me <del>xxx</del> it will be of very material importance, for I shall appropriate the whole to a life
                    insurance, &amp; it will wholly, or nearly, cover a policy for 3000£. I have never felt any fears about a provision for my family,
                    but this goes so far towards securing one, that it will give me <del>xxx</del> sincere pleasure to see the appointment confirmed,
