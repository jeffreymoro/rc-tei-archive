                    fortnight after that to <ref target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>. I
                    cannot express to you how it has provoked &amp; vexed me. Had I known that you
                    thought of offering Count Julian to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, a word from me would have prevented all this irreparable
                        mischief.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor’s <title>Count
                            Julian</title> had been offered to and rejected by Longman. This led
                        Landor to burn the MS of his unpublished tragedy ‘Ferranti and
                        Giulio’.</note> The people at that house know nothing about books except in
                    the mere detail of trade; – &amp; the only thing which they would think
                        <del>off</del> of was that single plays did not sell, unless they were
                    represented. And because these <ref target="places.html#PaternosterRow">Paternoster-row-men</ref> have acted in the spirit of
                    their vocation, you have burnt a play, which doubtless contained as much pure
                    ore as Julian, &amp; which would have lived as long as the language! Zounds, – I
                    could swear almost as vehemently at you as at them! –</p><p rend="indent1"> It is utterly unaccountable to me why you of all men should care
                    either for good or evil report of your poems, certain as you must be of their
                    sterling value. I look upon Gebir<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    but as containing the finest poetry in the language, – so it is with C Julian,
                    &amp; so no doubt it was with the play which you have so provokingly
                    destroyed.</p><p rend="indent1"> In about three weeks I hope to see you in your turret. We leave
                    London this day week, &amp; I will write from Bristol as soon as I can say when
                    we shall depart from it. I was at Lanthony in 1798, &amp; forded the Hodney on

                        ‘The Fourth Song’, lines 225–230: ‘Where, in an aged Cell, with moss and ivy
                        grown,/ In which to this day the sun hath ever shone,/ That reverend British
                        Saint [David, patron saint of Wales], in zealous ages past,/ To
                        contemplation liv’d; and did so truly fast,/ As he did only drink what
                        crystal Hodney yields,/ And fed upon the Leeks he gather’d in the
                        fields’.</note> places there, &amp; for which I enquired in vain?</p><p rend="indent1"> I am no botanist, but like you, my earliest &amp; deepest
                    recollections are connected with flowers, &amp; they &lt;always&gt; carry me
                    back to other days. Perhaps this is because they are the only things which
                    affect our senses precisely in the same manner as they did in childhood. The
                    sweetness of the violet is always the same, &amp; when you rifle a rose &amp;
                    drink as it were its fragrance, the refreshment is the same to the old man as to
                    the boy. We see with different eyes, in proportion as we learn to discriminate,
                    &amp; therefore this effect is not so certainly produced by visual objects.
                    Sounds recall the past in the same manner, – but do not bring with them
                    individual scenes like the cowslip field, or the bank of violets, or the corner
                    of the garden to which we have transplanted <del>the</del> field flowers. Oh
                    what a happy season is childhood, if our modes of life &amp; education will let
                    it be so! It were enough to make one misanthropical when we consider how great a
                    portion of the evil of this world is mans own making, – if the knowledge of this
                    truth did not imply that <del>therefore</del> the evil is removable, &amp;
                    therefore the prime duty of a good man is by all means in his power to assist in
                    removing it.</p><closer><salute rend="indent3"> God bless you</salute><signed rend="indent5"> RS.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
