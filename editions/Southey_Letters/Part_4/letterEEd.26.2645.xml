                    you will be more ready to excuse in me than I am to excuse in myself. I should blame myself the more if all which I could possibly
                    say upon the subject of your disappointment at Cambridge must not already and often have occurred to your own reflections; as, for
                    instance, that your purpose in going to the University was not to obtain college honours (things in themselves not less
                    mischievously than preposterously overrated), but to qualify yourself for one of the most useful and honourable offices in
                    society, that of a minister of the Church of England; and that this end having been obtained, it is neither right nor reasonable
                    to repine if you have failed in gaining a collateral object of unmeasurably less importance.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> James White graduated in 1815 from Pembroke College, Cambridge, with a BA. He may have been disappointed that
                        he did not win any college prizes, as these would have helped pay his fees and aided his future career prospects in the Church
                        of England.</note> I am sure you have felt and reasoned thus; and you well know that the opinion which I express respecting
                    University distinction is not advanced for the present purpose, but is that which I have uniformly entertained upon the subject.
                    Go cheerfully forward, and when you are settled upon a curacy, look out for some pupils, and live in hope.</p><p rend="indent1"> Mr. Tillbrook<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Tillbrook (c. 1784–1835), Fellow of Peterhouse and
                        later Rector of Freckenham, Suffolk 1829–1835.</note> is in this country, and has brought with him poor <ref target="people.html#DusautoyJames">Dusautoy’s</ref> papers. I need not tell you of what I was reminded while performing the
                    melancholy office of examining these relics. There is nothing among them in any degree approaching to the finish of <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</ref> pieces, some of which were as perfect as he could have made them at any
                    age, and must hold their place in our popular Florilegia<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘Gathering of flowers’; i.e.
                        Southey’s edition of the <title>Remains of Henry Kirke White</title> (1807).</note> as long as the English language endures.
                    But there are abundant proofs of power, and desire, and genius. <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> was
                    with me, and fully agreed with me that there would be ample materials for one volume; popular it cannot be, like the “Remains,”
                    still it will be a monument, and an honourable one, to his memory.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did propose an
                        edition of Dusautoy’s ‘Remains’ to Longmans; see Southey to Longman &amp; Co., 8 March 1816, <title>Part Five</title> of this edition. They accepted, but nothing
                        further came of the project; see Longman &amp; Co. to Southey, 11 March 1816, University of Reading, Longman Archive, Longman
                        I, 99, no. 183.</note> The next step must be to obtain the consent of his parents for this, and to enquire concerning his
                    letters. The parents<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Du Sautoy (1761–1859) who had retired from his post as a
                        Lieutenant in the Royal Marines in 1798. He was barrack-master of the cavalry at Totnes 1803–1822. His wife was Mary (c.
                        1767–1851), daughter of John Hinton (c. 1721–1802), Rector of Chawton, Hampshire.</note> have made no enquiry for his papers;
                    for this there may be two causes, both alike probable: their grief may be as yet too recent, or they may regard them as things of
                    no consequence; for I learn from Tillbrook, that his father used to speak of his fondness for poetry as a trifling or silly
                    pursuit, and express sometimes a hope that he had done with it. It will be better to communicate my wish to the family, and learn
                    what there may be through some person who is well acquainted with them, than to write immediately myself; and as I learn from the
                    fragment of a letter that he had an uncle at Salisbury,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified. Dusautoy had
                        attended Salisbury Cathedral School.</note> I think I have an opportunity of doing this through him by means of one of my own
                    most particular friends.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably John May, whose family had property in the
                    area.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Tillbrook thinks you may perhaps know something of his correspondents. Had he any confidential friend to whom he
                    was in the habit of writing? Tell me anything you know which may direct me in these enquiries. Poor fellow, had he never applied
                    to me for advice, he would not thus have been cut off from all hopes!<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dusautoy had first
                        written to Southey at the beginning of 1813, enclosing some of his poems and asking advice about publishing them. Southey
                        replied (the letter does not survive) and Dusautoy in turn wrote back. For Southey’s reply to this see Southey to James
                        Dusautoy, 12 February 1813, Letter 2220. Southey had also been instrumental in helping Dusautoy gain admission to Cambridge;
                        see Southey to Neville White, 27 February 1813, Letter 2225.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I expect to see <ref target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</ref> in less than three weeks, for I purpose

                    of his friends.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Herbert Southey was standing for the post of Senior Physician at the
                        Middlesex Hospital. Although initially contested, his opponents withdrew and he was elected unopposed on 17 August

                        (c. 1795–1889). A third, Hannah, had died in 1813.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> It is well that you were not in Cambridge during the last calamitous sickness,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ‘Cambridge fever’ of January-April 1815 was probably an outbreak of typhoid and drew attention to public
                        health in the city. James Dusautoy was one of its victims; see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 16 May 1815, Letter
                        2598.</note> and perhaps you might have been there had you been successful in your examination. The fever clearly seems to
                    have differed in some respects from any which had formerly appeared there; and whether it were contagious, or, which is more
                    probable, endemic, I think there is some danger of its breaking out again when the season recurs; for the cause is so little
                    known, or rather so entirely unknown, that all precautions for preventing a recurrence must be mere guess-work. If any friend of
                    mine were about to go to the University I should earnestly recommend him to make Oxford his choice, upon this account. Believe me,
