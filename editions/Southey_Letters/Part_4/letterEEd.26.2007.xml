                        of the British Foreign Office. Published in London, the first number had appeared in May 1810; it ran until 1814.</note> His

                    is indebted to you for shutting one of the channels of calumny which have been opened against him.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Earlier in 1811, Blanco White had been abused in print. For example, he was accused of ‘criminal, immoral, and
                        revolutionary conduct’ in a ‘Reply to the False and Injurious Ideas which the 12th number of the Paper called El Espanol
                        conveys of the Memorable Action of the 5th of March, in the Plains of Chiclana’, published in <title>The Times</title>, 9 May
                        1811. Robinson, who had previously worked for the newspaper, had intervened to prevent any further such publications; see
                        Southey to Joseph Blanco White, 4 November 1811, Letter 1978.</note></p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#WhiteJosephBlanco">Blanco</ref> is not so staunch a hoper as I am. This is occasioned partly by what old
                    writers would have called his complection, – partly by ill usage – partly by his thorough knowledge of all the internal evils with
                    which Spain has to struggle, &amp; most of all by his deep sense of the dreadful &amp; irremediable effects of the Romish
                    religion. The best atmosphere which he breathes in this country, that of <ref target="places.html#HollandHouse">Holland
                        House</ref>, is not likely to strengthen his nerves – the little hope which he finds there is not like yours &amp; mine
                    founded upon what is inward and imperishable. – But he has done good service to the cause, &amp; may perhaps yet do better, if
                    circumstances should ever permit him to return. I found him an interesting man &amp; I think him a very valuable one. It is
                    surprizing how thorough a foreigner he is in appearance, tho the grandson of an Irishman: – rather it would be surprizing if the
                    human species were not so soon varied by circumstances. In Botany Bay<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The convict colony

                    plant Scotchman or Englishman there, the produce is sure to be pure potato.</p><p rend="indent1"> Hope delayed in the peninsula hath not made my heart sick, – because from the commencement my mind was made up to a
                    Guerra de Mouros,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Literally a ‘war of the Moors’; i.e. a conflict that was potentially as
                        long as the struggle for the expulsion of the Moors from the Iberian peninsula, from 712 to 1492.</note> which will last till
                    it ends in the right way, last as long as it will. <ref target="people.html#AbellaManuel">Abella</ref> (who is the most useful

                    they did it to any purpose might be well enough too. There is a lack of vigour in both branches of the Government, &amp; yet far
                    more to praise than to blame in both. There is something Roman in sending out troops to S. America, – would to God that it were in
                    support of a wise policy instead of a weak &amp; mischievous one.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Reports that British
                        military aid to Spain had actually been used to try and preserve Spanish rule in its American colonies were causing some
                        outrage at this time, e.g. <title>The Times</title>, 16 January 1812. They referred in particular to the despatch of 4,000 men
                        to fight revolutionaries in Mexico in November 1811.</note> This is a mournful subject, – &amp; both parties deplorably wrong,

                    English, evidently because they hope it may prove untrue. Just as the Caraccas deputies do not scruple to express their wishes
                    that England would withdraw her troops from Portugal because Spain, they say, would then be subdued, &amp; <del>xx</del>
