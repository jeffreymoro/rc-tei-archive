                        Jesuit missionary, diplomat and writer Antonio Vieira (1608–1697).</note> I am a good deal perplexed about it. The Collection
                    of his letters is very defective for this period of his history. There is indeed but one which relates directly to the war of
                    Pernambuco, &amp; in this which is dated from the Hague Dec. 30. 1647 he says, Concertemos a Armada, estorvemos os mentimentos ao
                    immigo, e en seguro o <hi rend="ital">Cunctando restituit rem</hi>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Cartas do P. Ant. Vieyra da Companhia de Jesu</title>, 3 vols (Lisbon, 1735–46), I, p. 8; ‘Let us organize our forces
                        and hinder the enemy’s victualling and by temporizing he saved the state.’ Southey’s copy was no.
                        3773 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> This is altogether at variance with the Papel Forte, which yet cannot have
                    been written much later.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Vieira’s <title>Papel Forte</title> (1648) urged the cession of
                        Pernambuco to the Dutch as the only means of obtaining peace in the war between Portugal and the Netherlands of
                        1634–1654.</note> Vieira’s wretched biographer<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> André de Barros (1675–1754),
                            <title>Vida do Apostólico Padre António Vieyra</title> (1745). Southey owned an edition of 1746, no. 3313 in the sale
                        catalogue of his library.</note> gives not a gleam of information upon his political life: he says that <del>xxx</del> he had
                    seen several spurious works attributed to him, some of which were in direct opposition to his known sentiments. These I suppose to
                    be the Arte de furtar,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Arte de Furtar</title> (1652). Now attributed to the Jesuit Manuel de Costa (1601–1667), but at this time thought to be
                        by Vieira. Southey’s copy was no. 3772 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> – the Noticias concerning the
                        Inquisition,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Vieira’s report <title>Notícias recônditas do modo de proceder a
                            Inquisição de Portugal com os seus presos</title> led to a papal enquiry and to the suspension of the Inquisition in
                        Portugal for five years, 1676–1681. The <title>Noticias</title> were published in 1821.</note> &amp; &lt;(perhaps)&gt; the
                    Papel Forte. Now it is very easy to understand if he did write the two former works, why he should not acknowledge them, or why
                    the author (if they were not his) should have brought them out under his name. but I cannot perceive why any person should have
                    forged the P. Forte. It seems to be discordant with his character &amp; his opinions. Of the style I do not pretend to judge. the
                    writer certainly does not appear to be el mismissimo Vieira en su mesma mesmedad, as Isla says in Fr. Gerundio,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jose Francisco de Isla y Rojo (1703–1781), <title>Historio del Famoso Predicador Fray Gerundio de

                        cites the fictional Gerundio as a by-word for a user of convoluted and ultimately nonsensical language.</note> but his style
                    like that of every man of genius differs very materially according to the subject. His sermons might be sworn to, &amp; I have
                    little doubt the A. de Furtar is his, but in state papers his peculiarities are not to be expected, &amp; if you do not detect him
                    in the matter it is in vain for a foreigner to seek any clue in the manner.</p><p rend="indent1"> I hear nothing of the Valeroso Lucideno from Mr Stuart<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Stuart,

                    political life. I cannot think that a man of so much more decision than the Kings ministers, &amp; whose political views were all
                    distinguished by their boldness, could be the author of the Papel Forte the character of which is <del>force</del> to deduce
                    cowardly conclusions from petty statistical premises, like a Scotch whig of the present day, or a white-livered Whitbread<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors"> The radical MP Samuel Whitbread (1764–1815; <title>DNB</title>).</note> etc. – I am
                    strengthened in my disbelief by perceiving that when Vieyra sailed for Marahaõ, a notion prevailed that all his missionary zeal
                    was affected, &amp; that the object of his voyage was political, – nothing less than a design upon Potosi. This never could have
                    been surmised of a man who was afraid of prosecuting the recovery of Pernambuco. There seems to have been a Latin life of
                        Vieyra<note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors"> It is not clear which book Southey might be referring to here.</note> written
                    before that provoking book of Andre de Barros. I wish I could discover it, tho like that blockheads, it would probably prove
                        <del>xxxxx</del> a Jesuitical legend! – Few characters have ever interested me so much as this extraordinary man. His genius
                    is not over-rated by his countrymen. that he was a profound statesman is apparent, &amp; his liberality is shown by his conduct
                    about the Jews, &amp; how this genius, this wisdom, &amp; this liberality should have coexisted with his false taste, his Catholic
                    superstitions, &amp; his own individual madness is indeed most curious. He was not indeed quite as mad as <ref target="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna Southcote</ref>, – but he was just in the state of one of her four &amp; twenty
