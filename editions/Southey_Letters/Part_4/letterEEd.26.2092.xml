There at eve</l><l rend="indent3"> Entering an inn, he took his humble seat</l><l rend="indent3"> With other travellers round the crackling hearth</l><l rend="indent3"> Where heath &amp; cistus gave their fragrant flame.</l><l rend="indent3"> That flame no longer as in other times</l><l rend="indent3"> Lit up the countenance of easy mirth</l><l rend="indent3"> And light discourse; the talk which now went round</l><l rend="indent3"> Was of the grief that hung at every heart,</l><l rend="indent3"> Of Spain subdued; the sceptre of the Goths</l><l rend="indent3"> Broken, their nation &amp; their name effaced, –</l><l rend="indent3"> Slaughter &amp; Mourning which had left no house</l><l rend="indent3"> Unvisited, &amp; Shame which set its mark</l><l rend="indent3"> On every Spaniards face. One who had seen</l><l rend="indent3"> His sons fall bravely at his side, bewaild</l><l rend="indent3"> The unhappy chance which rescuing him from death</l><l rend="indent3"> Left him the last of all his family,</l><l rend="indent3"> Yet he rejoiced to think that none who drew</l><l rend="indent3"> Their blood from him, remaind to wear the yoke</l><l rend="indent3"> Be at the miscreants’ beck, &amp; propagate</l><l rend="indent3"> A breed of slaves to serve them.

Even thou, – But here</l><l rend="indent3"> Siverian taking up the word, broke off</l><l rend="indent3"> Unwittingly the incautious speech; Even I</l><l rend="indent3"> Quoth he, who nurst him in his fathers hall</l><l rend="indent3"> Even I can only for that deed of shame</l><l rend="indent3"> Offer in agony my secret prayers</l><l rend="indent3"> But Spain hath witnessd other crimes as foul</l><l rend="indent3"> Have we not seen Favilas shameless wife</l><l rend="indent3"> Thrond in Witiza’s ivory car parade</l><l rend="indent3"> Our towns in regal pageantry, &amp; bid</l><l rend="indent3"> The adulterous tyrant in her husbands blood</l><l rend="indent3"> Dip his accursed hands! Did we not see</l><l rend="indent3"> Pelayo by that bloody kings pursuit,</l><l rend="indent3"> And that unnatural mother, from the land</l><l rend="indent3"> With open outcry like an outward thief</l><l rend="indent3"> Hunted? – And saw ye not Theodofred</l><l rend="indent3"> As through the streets I guided his dark steps</l><l rend="indent3"> Roll mournfully toward the noon-day sun</l><l rend="indent3"> His blank &amp; senseless eye balls! Spain saw this</l><l rend="indent3"> And suffered it. – I seek not to excuse</l><l rend="indent3"> The sins of Roderick, – Jesu who beholds</l><l rend="indent3"> The burning tears I shed in solitude</l><l rend="indent3"> Knows how I plead for them in midnight prayer</l><l rend="indent3"> But if when he victoriously revenged</l><l rend="indent3"> The wrongs of Chindasuinthos house, his sword</l><l rend="indent3"> Had not for mercy turnd aside its edge,</l><l rend="indent3"> Oh what a day of glory had been seen</l><l rend="indent3"> Upon the banks of Chrysus! Curse not him</l><l rend="indent3"> Who in that fatal conflict to the last</l><l rend="indent3"> So valiantly maintaind his countrys cause.</l><l rend="indent3"> But if your sorrow needs will find its vent</l><l rend="indent3"> In curses, let you imprecations strike</l><l rend="indent3"> The caitiffs, who when Rodericks horned helm</l><l rend="indent3"> Rose eminent amid the thickest fight,</l><l rend="indent3"> Betraying him who spar’d &amp; trusted them,</l><l rend="indent3"> Forsook their King, their Country &amp; their God,</l><l rend="indent3"> And gave the Moor his conquest!</l><l rend="indent8"> Aye, they said,</l><l rend="indent3"> These were Witizas hateful progeny,</l><l rend="indent3"> And in an evil hour the unhappy King</l><l rend="indent3"> Had spar d the viperous brood. With that they talkd</l><l rend="indent3"> How Sisibert &amp; Ebba thro the land</l><l rend="indent3"> Guided the foe, &amp; Orpas who had cast</l><l rend="indent3"> The mitre from his renegado brow,</l><l rend="indent3"> Went with the armies of the Infidels.</l><l rend="indent3"> And how in Hispalis, even where his hands</l><l rend="indent3"> Had ministerd so oft the bread of life,</l><l rend="indent3"> The circumcised apostate did now shame</l><l rend="indent3"> To show in open day his turband head.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> But Roderick while they communed this had ceased</l><l rend="indent3"> To hear, such painfullest anxiety</l><l rend="indent3"> The sight of that old venerable man</l><l rend="indent3"> Awoke. A sickening thought came over him, –</l><l rend="indent3"> The hope which led him from his hermitage</l><l rend="indent3"> Seemd now for ever gone; for well he knew</l><l rend="indent3"> Nothing but death might break the ties which bound</l><l rend="indent3"> This faithful servant to his fathers house.</l><l rend="indent3"> She then for whose forgiveness <del>she</del> he had
                        yearned</l><l rend="indent3"> Who in her blessing would have given &amp; found</l><l rend="indent3"> The peace of Heaven, she then was to the grave</l><l rend="indent3"> Gone down disconsolate at last! in this</l><l rend="indent3"> Of all the <del>griefs</del> &lt;woes&gt; of her unhappy
                        life</l><l rend="indent3"> Unhappiest that she did not live to see</l><l rend="indent3"> God had vouchsafd repentance to her child.</l><l rend="indent3"> But then a hope arose, – perchance she lived,</l><l rend="indent3"> The weighty cause which led Siverian here</l><l rend="indent3"> Might draw him from her side: – better to know</l><l rend="indent3"> The worst than fear it. And with that he bent</l><l rend="indent3"> Over the embers, &amp; with a head half-raisd</l><l rend="indent3"> Aslant, &amp; shadowd by his hand, he said,</l><l rend="indent3"> Where is King Rodericks mother, – lives she still?</l><l rend="indent3"> God hath upheld her, the old man replied,</l><l rend="indent3"> She bears this last &amp; heaviest of her griefs</l><l rend="indent3"> Not as she bore her husband wrongs, when hope</l><l rend="indent3"> And her indignant heart supported her,</l><l rend="indent3"> But patiently like one who finds from heaven</l><l rend="indent3"> A comfort which this world can neither give</l><l rend="indent3"> Nor take away, – Roderick enquired no more,</l><l rend="indent3"> His breath a silent prayer in gratitude,</l><l rend="indent3"> Then wrapt his cloak around him, &amp; lay down</l><l rend="indent3"> Where he might weep unseen.</l><l rend="indent8"> When morning came,</l><l rend="indent3"> Earliest of all the travellers he went forth</l><l rend="indent3"> And lingered for Siverian by the way,</l><l rend="indent3"> Beside a fountain where the constant fall</l><l rend="indent3"> Of water its perpetual gurgling made,</l><l rend="indent3"> To the way faring or the musing man</l><l rend="indent3"> Sweetest of all sweet sounds. The Xtian hand</l><l rend="indent3"> Whose general charity for man &amp; beast</l><l rend="indent3"> Built it in better times, had with a cross</l><l rend="indent3"> Of well hewn stone crested the pious work,</l><l rend="indent3"> Which now the misbelievers had cast down</l><l rend="indent3"> And broken in the dust it lay defild.</l><l rend="indent3"> Roderick beheld it lying at his feet,</l><l rend="indent3"> And gathering reverently the fragments up</l><l rend="indent3"> Placed them within the cistern, &amp; restord</l><l rend="indent3"> With careful collocation its dear form,</l><l rend="indent3"> So might the waters like a chrystal shrine</l><l rend="indent3"> Preserve it from pollution. Kneeling then,</l><l rend="indent3"> Oer the memorial of redeeming love</l><l rend="indent3"> He bent, &amp; mingled with the fount his tears</l><l rend="indent3"> And pourd his spirit to the Crucified.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> A Moor came by &amp; seeing him exclaimd</l><l rend="indent3"> Ah Kaffer! Worshipper of wood &amp; stone,</l><l rend="indent3"> God’s curse confound thee! – &amp; as Roderick turned</l><l rend="indent3"> His face, the miscreant spurnd him with his foot</l><l rend="indent3"> Between the eyes. The indignant King arose</l><l rend="indent3"> And felld him to the earth. with that the knave</l><l rend="indent3"> Drew forth his dagger, rising as he cried,</l><l rend="indent3"> What, darest thou thou infidel &amp; slave</l><l rend="indent3"> Strike a believer? And he aimd a blow</l><l rend="indent3"> At Rodericks breast. But Roderick caught his arm</l><l rend="indent3"> And closd &amp; wrenchd the dagger from his hold</l><l rend="indent3"> (Such timely strength did those emaciate limbs</l><l rend="indent3"> From indignation draw) &amp; in his neck</l><l rend="indent3"> With mortal stroke he drove the avenging steel</l><l rend="indent3"> Hilt deep: – then as the thirsty sand drank in</l><l rend="indent3"> The expiring miscreants blood, he lookd around</l><l rend="indent3"> In sudden apprehension lest the Moors</l><l rend="indent3"> Had seen them. But Siverian was in sight</l><l rend="indent3"> The only traveller, &amp; he smote his mule</l><l rend="indent3"> And hastened up. Ah brother, said the old man,</l><l rend="indent3"> Thine is a spirit of the ancient mold,</l><l rend="indent3"> And would to God a thousand man like thee</l><l rend="indent3"> Had fought at Rodericks side on that last day</l><l rend="indent3"> When treason overpowerd him! Now alas</l><l rend="indent3"> A manly Gothic heart doth ill accord</l><l rend="indent3"> With these unhappy times. – Come let us hide</l><l rend="indent3"> This carrion, while the favouring hour permits.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> So saying he alighted. Soon they scoopd</l><l rend="indent3"> Amid loose-lying sand a hasty grave</l><l rend="indent3"> And levelld over it the easy soil.</l><l rend="indent3"> Father, quoth Roderick, as they journeyd on</l><l rend="indent3"> Let this thing be a seal &amp; sacrament</l><l rend="indent3"> Of truth between us. – Wherefore should there be</l><l rend="indent3"> Concealment between two right Gothic hearts</l><l rend="indent3"> In evil days like these? What thou hast seen</l><l rend="indent3"> Is but the first fruit of the sacrifice</l><l rend="indent3"> Which on this injured &amp; polluted soil,</l><l rend="indent3"> As on a bloody altar, I have sworn</l><l rend="indent3"> To offer to insulted Heaven for Spain</l><l rend="indent3"> Her vengeance &amp; her expiation: this</l><l rend="indent3"> Was but a hasty act by sudden wrong</l><l rend="indent3"> Provoked, but I am bound for Cordoba</l><l rend="indent3"> On weighty mission from Visonia sent,</l><l rend="indent3"> To breathe into Pelayo’s ear a voice</l><l rend="indent3"> Of spirit-stirring power, which like the trump</l><l rend="indent3"> Of the Arch-Angel shall awake dead Spain.</l><l rend="indent3"> The northern mountaineers are unsubdued,</l><l rend="indent3"> They call upon Pelayo for their chief.</l><l rend="indent3"> Odoar &amp; Urban tell him that the hour</l><l rend="indent3"> Is come.
