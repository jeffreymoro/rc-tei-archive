                    Florindas exculpation of his master he had never thought of the possibility of his being alive, because he had never wished it:
                    afterwards, the <hi rend="ital">wish</hi> led him to <del>x</del> dream upon the possibility, – but not in any way as connected

                        after his downfall.</note> – The strongest objection which has been, or can be urged against the poem is that Roderick should
                    not be recognized – but the fact is strictly possible. A friend of mine (poor <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Charles
                        Danvers</ref>) after a fortnights absence during which he had been <del>exp</del> very exposed to weather, sleeping out of

                        Unidentified.</note> to escape to America who would have been hanged for high treason if he had been taken) was so altered as
                    literally not to be recognized at the end of that time by an old servant of the family. – Think also what a difference grey hairs
                    will make: &amp; how soon grief will produce this change has often been seen. When the Queen of France was murdered her hair was
                    perfectly white.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Marie Antoinette (1755–1793; Queen of France 1774–1792).</note> This I
                    have carefully marked in Roderick. I have also made his mother recognize him upon the first hint, &amp; Siverian also.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 19, lines 1–24; Book 25, lines 330–333.</note> As for Julian, it
