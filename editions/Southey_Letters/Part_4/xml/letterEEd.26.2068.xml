                        book referred to here is probably Southey&#8217;s <title>The Origin, Nature and
                            Object, of the New System of Education</title> (1812).</note> that of
                    course it never could be intended you were to pay for your own copy of your
                    brothers book, &#8211; &amp; that the book must be accounted for with the Publisher as
                    a presentation copy on the Authors account. &#8211; You will then hear no more of it.
                    The man must be a blockhead not to have understood this.</p>

                    portion of time may be made. And a book upon that subject, if it be what it
                    ought, will do you no harm in your profession. &#8211; not to mention that before it
                    is finished you will have got forward in your medical degree, for it must be a
                    work of several years.</p>
