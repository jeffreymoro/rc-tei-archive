        <p rend="indent1"> I shall not get this bad news out of my intestines, where it has
                    made a lodgement, if I do not give some vent to my vexation. It is very clear to
                    me that <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">M Wellington</ref>
                    committed a gross blunder in besieging 2000 men at Burgos<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wellington and his allies had besieged the Spanish city
                        of Burgos from 19 September&#8211;21 October 1812, but failed to capture
                        it.</note> instead of pursuing a routed army till he had effected its
                    destruction. And it is equally clear that ministers in that cursed spirit of
                    parsimony which is the worst of all wastefulness, have crippled his exertions,
                    &amp; sent out reinforcements, scanty in themselves, &amp; such as they were too
                    late. The tide has turned compleatly, &amp; however unwilling I may be to
                        <del>confess</del> look the evil in its face, I cannot but see that we have
                    lost the opportunity which the Russian war afforded us for delivering Spain; &#8211;
                    lost it, I verily believe, irrecoverably. Buonapartes system may <del>xx</del>
                    receive its death blow in the North, &#8211; this is possible enough; &#8211; but any
                    success in that quarter will come as a God-send to us, &#8211; advantageous it would
                    be in the highest degree, but the country would have no part in the honour.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The loss of reputation sustained in Spain at this time is an evil
                    so great in itself, &amp; so fearful in its consequences that I can hardly bear
                    to think of it. The old game I fear will now be played over again; the next step
                    in retreat will be to the Portugueze frontier, &amp; then for a defensive
                    campaign, which will equally exhaust the blood &amp; the endurance of the
                    Spaniards, <del>&amp;</del> our resources &#8211; &amp; worst of all, our hope.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not like <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">M
                        Wellesley</ref>, &#8211; but if my voice could make him Premier Premier he should
                    be tomorrow. The mere fact of <del>keeping such</del> sending such a fellow as

                        up the post of Ambassador to the Russian court in July 1812. He was actively
                        involved in Russian attempts to resist Bonaparte and sent regular dispatches
                        to the British government.</note> to Petersburgh at this time, is enough to
                        <del>xxxx</del> damn any administration.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It will not surprize me if <del>xxx</del> before Xmas the only
                    remaining advantage of the Victory of Salamanca<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wellington&#8217;s defeat of the French at Salamanca, 22 July
                        1812. This victory forced the French to lift the two-year siege of Cadiz on
                        24 August 1812. The Trocadero peninsula and its three forts was one of the
                        keys to Cadiz.</note> should be &#8211; the cut at Trocadero &#8211; which will prevent

            <title>Genesis</title> 22: 1&#8211;19. God ordered Abraham to
                        sacrifice his son, Isaac, but then countermanded his instruction at the last
                        moment.</note> it is necessary to premise that I do not believe the plenary
                    inspiration of the <del>xxxxxx</del> scriptures: <del>xxxxxx</del> that an
                    opinion <del>which</del> appears to me utterly untenable, &amp; of the most
                    mischievous consequences. I believe therefore in the general truth of
                        <del>the</del> scriptural history, &#8211; as I do in that of any other authentic
                    historical work, &#8211; &amp; of course disbelieve altogether such parts as come to
                    me with a character of incredulity. This is heresy. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The sacrifice of Isaac is said to be typical. There is something
                    very delightful to a fanciful &amp; ingenious mind in <del>the</del> discovering
                    types &amp; symbols every where: but any person who knows how the Romanists have
                    done this will always suspect such <del>xx</del> hidden significations. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not know that I believe the story, nor have I thought it of
                    sufficient importance seriously to ask myself whether I do or not. &#8211; If I did
                    believe it entirely, I should be equally ready to praise Abraham for an act of
                    faith in his obedience, &#8211; or to have praised him for a more
                        <del>enlightened</del> rational piety, if he had suspected the voice which
                    ordered the sacrifice, to be a delusion or a temptation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is however a parallel in the two cases. Thalaba is not
