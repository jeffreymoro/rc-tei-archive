        <p rend="indent1"> I have delayed sending you the volume of Brazil,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume of
                        Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title>, published in 1810.</note> till some books which are designed for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref> were ready to accompany it. They are now on their passage from Edinburgh to
                    London, &amp; as soon as <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> receives them, he will forward your parcel. You
                    will find my historical volume full of curious facts related to the history of savage man.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Here is the passage of which I spoke relating to the <del>practice</del> &lt;art&gt; of making feathers grow of a
                    particular colour.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Indi colorem nativum psittaci sui mutare norunt in alium, quem ipsi optaverint. Oper&#230; pretium est singulare
                    artificium explanare. Plumas naturales radicitus evellunt. Locum unde avuls&#230; fuerunt plum&#230;, manu perfricant, donee rubescat,
                    sanguisque inde scaturiat. Plumarum veterum poris, seu alveolis, succum ejus coloris quem volunt, instillant, imprimuntque. Si
                    alis, si caud&#230;, flavum, si c&#230;ruleum, si purpureum colorem infuderint, penn&#230; flav&#230;, c&#230;rule&#230;, purpureie sensim subnascentur. Id apud
                    Brasilios, Quaranios, et (teste P. J. Sanchez Labrador) apud Mbayas barbaros usu receptum. Sed, ut idem observavit, vere, vel
                    autumno ineunte id pr&#230;sturi ab Indes. Colorem viridem in flavum facillime mutari: plumis flavis si evellantur, non nisi flavas
                    succrescere. H&#230;c illius sunt et monita, et experimenta.</p>
        <p rend="indent5"> Dobrizhoffer de <del>xxxxx</del> Abiponibus. T1. 357.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Martin Dobrizhoffer
                        (1717&#8211;1791), <title>Historia de Abiponibus, Equestri, Bellicosaque Paraquari&#230;</title>, 3 vols (Vienna, 1784), I, p. 357.
                        Translated by Sara Coleridge (with Southey&#8217;s encouragement) as: &#8216;The Indians know how to change the natural colour of the
                        parrot into any other they choose. They pull the feathers up by the roots, and rub the place from which they have been
                        plucked, till it grows red, and blood flows from it; they then instil and press into the pores or sockets of the old feathers,
                        juice of any colour they like. If the wings or tail be imbued with a yellow, red, or blue colour, yellow, red, or blue
                        feathers will grow there. This was practised amonst the Brazilians, Guaranies, and, according to P. Joseph Labrador, amongst
                        the Mbaya savages. The same Father observed that the Indians performed the operation in the beginning of spring or autumn,
                        that green is very easily turned into yellow, and that yellow feathers, if plucked up, will be succeeded by none but yellow
                        ones&#8217;, <title>An Account of the Abipones, An Equestrian People of Paraguay</title>, 3 vols (London, 1822), I, p. 327.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The tendency to <del>the</del> yellow is perhaps the most curious part of this statement. I am always slow to
                    disbelieve a story, in cases where the relator has no apparent motive either for deceiving himself or the reader, &amp; where his
                    general good sense exempts him from the suspicion of over credulity. <del>To more</del> many objections which may be made to this
                    asserted fact occur to me, &amp; probably many others will occur to you; &#8211; all I shall say is that the authority is trust worthy
                    in the highest degree, &#8211; &amp; whether the thing be true or false, &amp; if true whether of any value, you will judge for
                    yourself.</p>

                    presented by poet or painter occurs in this play. It is in a speech of Julians to Rodrigo, after he had defected &amp; taken him
                    prisoner. I will give you the whole speech.</p>
