                    the soldiery had joined him. The next accounts will be of his issuing orders from Paris. Louis<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Louis XVIII (1755–1824; King of France 1814–1824).</note> may find one or two Marshals on whom he could rely,
                    but they could not rely on their men, &amp; it is well that there are troops in Flanders &amp; strong places whither he may look
                    for a retreat, till the Germans can again be brought forward.</p><p rend="indent1"> The first fault was in sparing his life, – this no doubt was Austrias doing,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Napoleon had married Marie Louise of Austria (1791–1847) in March 1810. She was the daughter of Francis II (1768–1835), Holy
                        Roman Emperor 1792–1806, Emperor of Austria 1804–1835.</note> &amp; the Allies <del>xxx</del> had no choice. The second was
                    allowing him to take his own guard,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> When Napoleon was exiled to Elba he was allowed a
                        personal guard of 1,000 men.</note> instead of placing a guard over him: for this all parties are equally to blame. Louis
                    should not have left Massena<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Andre Massena, 1st Duc de Rivoli (1758–1817), one of
                        Napoleon’s Marshals. He retained his command at Marseilles under the Bourbons and was studiously neutral during the Hundred
                        Days.</note> at Toulon, – that place in particular should have been held by a Royalist. Buonaparte has shown more real spirit
                    in this than in any former action of his life, &amp; it is a frightful lesson concerning <hi rend="ital">armies</hi>, which comes
                    strongly in aid of my old doctrine that no country can ever be safe from foreign &amp; domestic enemies till every man in it be
                    trained to the use of arms. But what a world of reforms does this presuppose, for before this can be done, all men must be
                    properly educated, &amp; all men made to feel that their own individual interests are inseparably connected with the continuance
                    &amp; preservation of &lt;the&gt; existing order of things.</p><p rend="indent1"> It is I fear no longer to be doubted that another desperate contest must be waged. And <del>I fear that</del> there
                    are advantages on the side of France which she did not possess twelve months ago. In the first place some 300,000 troops who were
                    then prisoners! Worse than this is the feeling of the Italians &amp; Swiss, – perhaps of the Saxons. Had Italy been made an
                    independent kingdom as it ought to have been, Buonaparte durst not have moved, for on every side Louis would have had allies.</p><p rend="indent1"> However At him Trojan! There is but one course to pursue, the Allies must steer clear of the sin of the Anti
                    Jacobin war; they must stick to Louis, &amp; fight his battles in France, where there is certainly a Bourbon party in some
                    provinces. I could almost persuade myself that the work of retribution was imperfect as long as Paris should be left standing, –
                    that Marshal must fight Marshal, Frenchman kill Frenchman in battle, <del>hang</del> all prisoners on both sides be hanged, &amp;
                    the Accursed City be burnt to the ground, before all is settled.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am, as I dare say you are also, much disquieted at the news. The work is to do over-again, – the Income Tax must
                    be renewed,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Government had made an announcement in the House of Commons on 9 February
                        1815 that income tax would be abolished. In fact, the renewed war with France in 1815 meant the war-time income tax was not
                        finally ended until 1816.</note> – &amp; God knows the people are neither in a humour to bear their burden chearfully, nor are
                    the ministers men on whose vigour or ability there can be any reliance. I wish <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">M.

                        Bread<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Government had introduced its proposal for a sliding scale of duties on
                        imported corn on 1 March 1815. The Bill passed on 23 March 1815, despite much urban opposition.</note> of all imaginable
