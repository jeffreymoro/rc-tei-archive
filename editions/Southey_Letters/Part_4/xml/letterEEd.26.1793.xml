            <l rend="indent3"> When all his brethren with their scholars fled</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Within the gates of ancient Merida.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Romano would not fly, for having servd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Even from his childhood up to ripe old age</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Gods holy altar, it became him now,</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> His life, a willing martyr. So he staid</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Four days &amp; nights he thus had passed alone</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> In such high mood of saintly fortitude</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That hope of Heaven itself was heavenly joy</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And now at evening to the gate he went</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> If he might spy the Moors, for it seem&#8217;d long</l>

            <l rend="indent7"> Before the Cross</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Roderick had thrown himself, his body raisd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Half-kneeling half at length he lay, his arms</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Embraced its foot, &amp; from his lifted face</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Tears streaming down bedewd the senseless stone</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> He had not wept till now, &amp; at the gush</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of these first tears, it seemd as if his heart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> From a long winters icy thrall let loose,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Had opend to the genial influences</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of Heaven. In attitude, but not in act</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of prayer he lay; an agony of tears</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Was all his soul could offer. When the Monk</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Beheld him suffering thus, he raisd him up</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And took him by the arm &amp; led him in,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And there before the altar, in the name</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of him whose bleeding image there was hung,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Spake comfort, &amp; adjurd him in that name</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> There to lay down the burthen of his sins.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Lo! said Romano. I am waiting here</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The coming of the Moors, that from their hands</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> My spirit may receive its purple robe</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of martyrdom, &amp; raise to claim its crown.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That God who willeth not the sinners death</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hath led the hither. Threescore years &amp; five</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Even from the hour when I, a five years child</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Entered the schools, have I continued here</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And servd the Altar; not in all those years</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hath such contrite &amp; a broken heart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Appeard before me. O my brother, Heaven</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hath sent thee for thy comfort &amp; for mine</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That my last earthly act may reconcile</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> [MS torn]nner to his God.</l>
            <l rend="indent6"> Then Roderick knelt</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Before the holy man, &amp; strove to speak</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Thou seest, he cried,.. thou seest &#8211; but memory</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And suffocating pain represt the words,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And shudderings like an ague fit from head</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To foot convuls&#8217;d him. Till at length subduing</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His nature to the effort, he exclaimd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Spreading his hands, &amp; lifting up his face</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> As if resolvd in penitence to bear</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A human eye upon his shame,.. thou seest</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Roderick, the Goth.. that name would have sufficed</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To tell its whole abhorred history, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> He not the less pursued,.. the ravisher</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The cause of all this ruin. Having said</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> In the same posture motionless he knelt</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Arms straitend down, &amp; hands dispread, &amp; eyes</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Raisd to the Monk, like one who from his voice</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Expected life or death</l>
            <l rend="indent6"> All night the old man</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Prayd with his penitent &amp; minister&#8217;d</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Unto the wounded soul, till he infusd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A healing hope of mercy that allayd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Its heat of anguish. But Romano saw</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> What strong temptations of despair beset,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And how he needed in this second birth,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Even like a yearling child, a fosterers care.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Father in Heaven, he cried, thy will be done!</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Surely I hoped that I this day should sing</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hosannahs at thy throne; but thou hast yet</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Work for thy servant here. He girt his loins</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And from her Altar took with reverent hands</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Our Lady&#8217;s image down. In this quoth he</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> We have our guide &amp; guard &amp; comforter,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The best provision for our perilous way.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Fear not but we shall find a resting place,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The Almighty&#8217;s hand is on us.</l>
            <l rend="indent7"> They went forth</l>

        <p rend="indent1"> You have here the first section of Pelayo. It is a fine subject, &amp; my second-sight of what is to follow
                    promises well. I have followed in the opening the <del>l</del> received legend concerning Roderick,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Roderick (d. 711/ 712), Visigothic king of part of Spain from 710. He was defeated and killed by Muslim
                        invaders who went on to conquer most of the Iberian peninsula.</note> &#8211; that fact that he escaped from the battle &amp; died
                    in penitence at Viseu is generally admitted, &amp; as the story is not connected with any miracle-shop (like that of his abode at
                    Nazareth) it is probably true. You will readily see what may be done by bringing him &amp; Florinda &amp; Count Julian<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Julian, Count of Ceuta, a legendary Christian ruler who aided the Islamic conquest of the kingdom
                        of Hispania, 711&#8211;718. In Southey&#8217;s poem, Roderick rapes Julian&#8217;s daughter, Florinda, thus provoking the Count&#8217;s actions.
                        Southey had already dealt with the same subject matter in his monodrama &#8216;Florinda&#8217;, later retitled &#8216;La Caba&#8217;, first published
                        in <title>The Iris</title>, 21 July 1804.</note> together in the course of the poem.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thought to have sent you Kehama<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>The Curse of
                            Kehama</title> (1810).</note> before this time, with his due accompaniment of notes, but tho the poem has been printed
                    these six weeks, I have not yet received the first proof of the notes, &#8211; &amp; six weeks more will probably elapse before they are
                    all printed. There are a good many alterations, &amp; one interpolation of considerable length, &#8211; which does not however in any
                    way affect the story &#8211; it occurs in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> section, &#8211; when Ladurlad &amp; Kalyal are in their <del>x</del>
                    retreat in the woods. The <del>xxst</del> structure of the poem is its main merit. in this point it is far superior to
                        Thalaba,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> &#8211; in most other respects I am afraid I myself do no like it quite so well,
                    &amp; am well assured that most persons will like it even less, &#8211; or in plainer language will dislike it more. About this I am
                    perfectly indifferent. It is a work sui generis,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Of its own kind&#8217;.</note> which like
                    Gebir will find its own admirers, &amp; I have always sincerely echoed your original preface upon that point.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor&#8217;s <title>Gebir</title> (London, 1798). The &#8216;Preface&#8217; ([i]&#8211;ii) had argued that: &#8216;A Poem,
                        like mine, descriptive of men and manners, should never be founded totally on fiction &#8230; I have followed no man closely; nor
                        have I turned from my road because another stood in it: tho&#8217; perhaps I have momentarily &#8230; caught the object that attracted
                        him. I have written in blank verse, because there never was a poem in rhyme that grew not tedious in a thousand lines &#8230; If
                        there are, now, Englishmen of taste and genius who will applaud my Poem, I declare myself fully content.&#8217;</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I dream of many others things, &#8211; of a poem built on the Zendavesta,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey
                        did not write his poem on Zoroastrianism, or on any of the other subjects mentioned in this paragraph; see J. W. Warter (ed.),
                            <title>Southey&#8217;s Common Place Book</title>, 4 vols (1849&#8211;1851), IV, pp. 11&#8211;12, 197 for his notes.</note> wherein the Evil
                    Powers should be leagued against the son of the Great King and by every new calamity which they inflict upon him evolve in time
                    some virtue which his rank had stifled, till it ended in his abandoning Persia, in company with a Greek slave (the philosopher of
                    the story) &amp; becoming a citizen of Athens. &#8211; I have also an ambition of showing that the Greeks &amp; Romans themselves did
                    not know <del>how</del> what use might be made of their own mythology in poetry. Then there are the Runic, &amp; Druidical
                    systems, &#8211; &amp; the Japanese &#8211; of all which I have thought &#8211; years ago, besides some half-dozen historical subjects. Why will not
                    you, with full leisure &amp; <del>p</del> abundant power, leave more behind you for the delight of men like yourself, &#8211; another
                    Gebir only with a happier fable!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> See what I have been doing in the Edinb. Annual Register<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had begun
                        writing for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>. His first contributions, for the volume covering 1808, appeared in
                        1810.</note> &#8211; which ought to be published by this time &#8211; The whole of the history is mine, &#8211; &amp; I have now to sit upon
                    that for the second volume.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8211; I should sooner have replied to you about the family of poor <ref target="people.html#RobertsWilliamIsaac">Roberts</ref>, if I had known how they could have received any thing without wounding their feelings in any other manner than
                    thro the means of the projected publication &#8211; But I could not devise how &#8211; &amp; moreover am ignorant of their direction. <ref target="people.html#JamesPaulMoon">P. M. James</ref> a Banker at Birmingham manages the publication, &#8211; he was one of the two

        <p rend="indent1"> I retain my opinion that Spain is not to be subdued, &#8211; &amp; long to be more advanced in Pelayo for the pleasure of
                    bursting out upon the subject upon the many fit occasions which will occur. Were you at Gijon?<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Port in Asturias. In legends about Pelayo (c. 685&#8211;737) it was the seat of a local Moorish governor, Munuza,
                        who kidnapped and married Pelayo&#8217;s sister, thus provoking his rebellion.</note> &#8211; I am in want of a good description of that
