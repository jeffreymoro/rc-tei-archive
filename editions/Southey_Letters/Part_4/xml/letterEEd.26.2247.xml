                            <title>The Satirist</title>, 2 (1808), 61, had described Southey as guilty of &#8216;perpetual and inimitable

                        amongst the poor. He had compared them to the journalists and revolutionaries Jacques H&#233;bert (1757&#8211;1794), Jean-Paul Marat
                        (1743&#8211;1793) and the radical politician Pierre Gaspard Chaumette (1763&#8211;1794). All three had met violent ends. Southey&#8217;s article
                        had not mentioned Hunt by name, but it did draw clear parallels between revolutionary France and contemporary Britain.</note>

                    Portugal, &amp; the unwise, unjust &amp; unfeeling manner in which he spoke of the Spaniards, I wrote without asperity, or the
                    slightest personal allusion.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was being disingenuous. He had not actually named
                        Hunt, but his target was clear. Southey had quoted and dismissed the <title>Examiner</title>&#8217;s observations on the &#8216;crisis in
                        Portugal&#8217; (<title>Examiner</title>, 9 (20 January 1811), 39), <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813),
                        245&#8211;246. That said, Hunt came off lightly compared to Cobbett, who, in the same chapter was labelled a &#8216;demagogue&#8217; and accused
                        of &#8216;virulent and malicious misrepresentation&#8217;, Ibid., 246.</note>

                        had lamented the Hunts&#8217; recent acquittal for publishing an article condemning military flogging (<title>Examiner</title>, 8 (2
                        September 1810), 557&#8211;558). Although the <title>Examiner</title> did not mention Coleridge by name, the concluding paragraph
                        made it clear that he was the target: &#8216;Retire &#8230; to your patrons and a bottle; and there, calling for white handkerchiefs and

                        is a worthy person, and attribute his bad habits to a vague sort of destiny that besets him, and renders him more to be pitied
                        than blamed. The most didactic and talkative person of the day appears to be one of this description, and wants nothing but
