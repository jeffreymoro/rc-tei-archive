                    only to be learnt from scanty &amp; incidental notices, – except what may be discovered in this volume. Both the other works of P

                        other work by Vasconcellos that Southey possessed was <title>Chronica de Companhia de Jesu do Eastado do Brasil</title>

                    as a Biographer, – yet I have no doubt that his life of Almeida will supply many facts which I shall consider as important,
                    enabling me to improve my first volume, – &amp; some material information towards the completion of the work. He refers to it as
