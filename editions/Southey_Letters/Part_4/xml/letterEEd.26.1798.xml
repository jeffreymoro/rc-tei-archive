                        from whence some curioso cut out the whole collection, and formed them into

        <p rend="indent1"> I transmitted lately an account of my Bottle-letters<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Letters sent in bottles to Southey by his
                        brother Tom during his voyages. For example, see Southey to Thomas Southey,
                        6 March 1810, Letter 1754.</note> to the Admiralty, for the use of the
                    hydographical department. &#8211; being advised so to do by <ref target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry Bedford</ref> who is employed there.

                        Croker</ref> has sent me the thanks of the Lords for the communication. My
                    main object was to get Tom entered on this account in the White Book, which it
                    seems they now keep as well as a Black one.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Admiralty kept Black Books that recorded officers&#8217;
                        misconduct and recommendations that they should not be re-employed. The

        <p rend="indent1"> If it be possible I think of seeing you about the fall of the

                    &#8211; he wishes me much to <del>return xxxxxx</del> travel with him when he returns,

                    Edinburgh Review concerning Spain were base &amp; mischievous, &amp; he answered
                    as I wished him to do. My faith in the ultimate success of the Spaniards has
                    never been abated. I have just got down all the Spanish papers laid before
                    Parliament during the last sessions. &#8211; sent me by <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Percevals</ref> Secretary, <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref>, &#8211; a very able &amp;
