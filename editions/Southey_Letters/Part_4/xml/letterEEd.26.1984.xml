          <salute>My Dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Buenos Ayres papers.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Copies of the <title>Gazeta de
                            Buenos Ayres</title>, which ran from 7 June 1810 to 12 September 1821.</note> You ask my opinion respecting the affairs of
                    that part of the world. I shall be better acquainted with the immediate <hi rend="ital">occasion</hi> of the civil war there, and
                    the characters of the leading individuals, when I receive a journal which Mr. Kinder has promised to lend me, &#8211; kept by himself in
                    that country.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Kinder (c.1781&#8211;1846), a merchant, had spent some time in South
                        America. Southey borrowed Kinder&#8217;s unpublished journal of events in Buenos Ayres in 1808&#8211;1810 that led to the independence
                        of the states of the Rio de la Plata. In 1813 Southey had a copy made of the journal, no. 3162 in the sale catalogue of his
                        library. The copy was published as, Malyn Newitt (ed.), <title>War, Revolution and Society in the Rio de la Plata 1808&#8211;1810.
                            Thomas Kinder&#8217;s Narrative of a Journey to Madeira, Montevideo and Buenos Ayres</title> (2010). For Southey&#8217;s account of
                        the revolution in Buenos Ayres, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 395&#8211;421.</note> But upon the
                    general question no additional knowledge is required to make me form my judgment. All parties are greatly to be blamed, and, from
                    the conduct which both have pursued, nothing but immediate evil can result. The colonies had long been most grievously
                    misgoverned. In that misgovernment, however, they only shared the misfortune of the mother country; and if they did not receive
                    the immediate concessions which they justly expected and required when the revolution took place, they ought to have remembered
                    that this was entirely owing to the undue influence which the city of Cadiz had obtained, &#8211; an influence arising wholly out of the
                    circumstances of the war, which could not be permanent by any possible contingency; for whether Spain were won or lost, Cadiz
                    would not remain the seat of government, and when it ceased to be so the influence of her commercial junta would be at an end. The
                    duty of the colonies, therefore, should have been to have stated to the mother country what the grievances were from which they
                    expected to be relieved; then they should have said, &#8220;We require claiming our part in your deliverance; but we will not discuss
                    this at present, &#8211; we will not appear to bargain with you in your hour of need, as if we were endeavouring to force that from your
                    distress which it ought to be your pride and truest policy to grant us in your prosperity. If you succeed in this dreadful
                    struggle, you will grant it. If you fail, the Spaniards will have no other country than these colonies. We will, therefore, stand
                    by you to the last, and assist you to the utmost of our resources.&#8221; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The <hi rend="ital">fact</hi> is, Neville, that there is a French party in these colonies. To my knowledge, the
                    deputies from the Caraccas have expressed their sorrow that England does not recall her troops from Portugal, because they say,
                    then the contest would be over; the mother country must fall, and there would no longer be any obstacle to a free trade between
                    this country and Venezuela.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> A Congress at Caraccas had declared the independence of
                        Venezuela on 5 July 1811. Southey was deeply hostile to the Venezuelan Revolution, seeing it as a tool of French and American
                        interests, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 367&#8211;394.</note> Thus would these men barter away
                    the birthright of a whole nation, and the independence of the country of their fathers, for a mess of pottage. I have no patience
                    for such sordid selfishness. It is better (supposing the two things incompatible) that Spain should be free, than that the
                    Caraccans should have a free trade; for this is the alternation upon which these men, who call themselves patriots, and talk of
                    liberty and of rights, have thus decided.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is evident to me that the Anglo-Americans separated from the parent state at least a century too soon. They
                    became independent before they had a race of scholars or of gentlemen among them. Their independence is not yet thirty years old,
                    and see what a national character they have obtained and deserved. But the Spanish Americans are even less fitted to form a new
                    state, for they are far more ignorant; and the morals of the worst part of the United States (Virginia and the other southern
                    states) are less depraved than those of the best parts of Spanish America; but the one main cause of inevitable depravity exists
                    in both &#8211; the practice of slavery. The idleness of the Spaniards leads them still more to sensuality, and the Roman Catholic
                    religion demoralises every people among whom it takes root.</p>
