                            <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of the Prince Regent, had written to her husband protesting about the restrictions
                        placed on her access to their daughter, Princess Charlotte Augusta (1796–1817; <title>DNB</title>). In early March a second
                        letter on the same subject was sent to the Speaker of the House of Commons. As it was unsigned its authorship was initially
                        questioned, though it was later attributed to Caroline. After debate, parliament agreed that it was the Regent’s right as a
                        father and ruler to be in charge of his daughter’s education; see <title>Gentleman’s Magazine</title>, 83 (April 1813), 361,
                        363–364, 373–376. Brougham was the Princess’s legal adviser and was indeed the author of the letter.</note> Lewis Goldsmith
