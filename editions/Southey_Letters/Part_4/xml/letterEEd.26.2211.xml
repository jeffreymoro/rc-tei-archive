        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Before I say anything of my own doings, let me rejoice with you
                    over these great events in the North.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        In this paragraph Southey sets out his plan for waging war against France in
                        northern Europe, after the defeat of the French army in Russia in 1812. He
                        hoped to draw Prussia and Saxony (though not Austria) into a new coalition
                        with Russia against the French; and to replace the Duchy of Warsaw, which
                        France had created out of Prussian Poland in 1807, with a new, enlarged
                        Kingdom of Poland, thus reversing the division of the country between
                        Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1792&#8211;1795.</note> Never in civilised Europe
                    had there been so great an army brought together as Bonaparte had there
                    collected, and never was there so total and tremendous a destruction. I verily
                    think that this is the fourth act of the Corsican, and that the catastrophe of
                    the bloody drama is near. May his fall be as awful as his crimes! The siege of
                    Dantzic, and the accession of Prussia to our alliance, will, probably, be our
                    next news. Saxony will be the next government to emancipate itself, for there
                    the government is as well disposed as the people. I wish I could flatter myself
                    that Alexander<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alexander I
                        (1777&#8211;1825; Tsar of Russia 1801&#8211;1825).</note> were great enough to perform
                    an act of true wisdom as well as magnanimity, and re-establish Poland, not after
                    the villanous manner of Bonaparte, but with all its former territory, giving up
                    his own portion of that infamously acquired plunder, and taking Prussia&#8217;s part
                    by agreement, and Austria&#8217;s by force; for Austria will most likely incline
                    towards the side of France, in fear of Russia, and in hatred of the House of
                    Brandenburgh. May this vile power share in his overthrow and destruction, for it
                    has cursed Germany too long!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Was there ever an infatuation like that of the party in this
                    country who are crying out for peace? as if this country had not ample cause to
                    repent of having once before given up the vantage ground of war, at a peace
                    forced upon the state by a faction! Let us remember Utrecht, and not suffer the
                    Whigs of this day to outdo the villany of the Tories of that.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Treaty of Utrecht (1713) at the end of
                        the War of the Spanish Succession. It was concluded by Tory Ministers and
                        was much criticised by their Whig opponents as too lenient to France.</note>
                    There can be no peace with Bonaparte, none with France, that is not dictated at
                    the edge of the sword. Peace, I trust, is now not far distant, and one which
                    France must kneel to receive, not England to ask.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The opening of the Baltic will come seasonably for our
                    manufactures, and, if it set the looms to work again, we may hope that it will
                    suspend the danger which has manifested itself, and give time for measures which
                    may prevent its recurrence. You will see in the next Quarterly a paper upon the
                    State of the Poor, &#8211; or, rather, the populace, &#8211; wherein I have pointed out the
                    causes of this danger, and its tremendous extent, which, I believe, few persons
                    are aware of. I shall be sorry if it be mutilated from any false notions of
                        prudence.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s review of

                    It may often be necessary to keep a patient ignorant of his real state, but
                    public danger ought always to be met boldly, and looked in the face. I impute
                    the danger to the ignorance of the poor, which is the fault of the State, for
                    not having seen to their moral and religious instruction; to the manufacturing
                    system, acting upon persons in this state of ignorance, and vitiating them; and
                    to the Anarchist journalists (<ref target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref>,

            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> goes on
                    slow and sure. Twenty years ago nothing could equal the ardour with which I
                    pursued such employments. I was then impatient to see myself in print: it was
                    not possible to long more eagerly than I did for the honour of authorship. This
                    feeling is quite extinct; and, allowing as much as may be allowed for
                    experience, wiser thoughts, and, if you please, satiety in effecting such a
                    change, I cannot but believe that much must be attributed to a sort of autumnal
                    or evening tone of mind, coming upon me a little earlier than it does upon most
                    men. I am as cheerful as a boy, and retain many youthful or even boyish habits;
                    but I am older in mind than in years, and in years than in appearance; and,
                    though none of the joyousness of youth is lost, there is none of its ardour
                    left. Composition, where any passion is called forth, excites me more than it is
                    desirable to be excited; and, if it were not for the sake of gratifying two or
                    three persons in the world whom I love, and who love me, it is more than
                    probable that I might never write a verse again. God bless you!</p>
