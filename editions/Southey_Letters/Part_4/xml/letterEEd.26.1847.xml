                    have said to you, has been running in my head as if you had received it. &#8211; This

                    by a perpetual apprehension that she was in a far worse state of health than any
                    other person supposed her to be, &#8211; in fact that she [was] wasting away by some
                    species of atrophy. This of course I have not told her. But being exceedingly
                    struck, as you may well conceive, by her whole mind &amp; manner, &#8211; it
                    constantly hung upon me.</p>
