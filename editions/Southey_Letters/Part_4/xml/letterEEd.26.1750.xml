                    immediate object of this present writing. <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has applied to me to write a life of
                        Nelson,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813).</note> &#8211; such a life as would find its way into every officers cabin &amp; every
                    midshipmans hands. &#8211; a five shilling volume &#8211; for which he offers me 100 Guineas. I delay my final answer. &amp; keep the
                    documents till I learn whether you are coming or not, &#8211; because if you are disposed to lend a hand, there is great part of this
                    which can as well be done by you as by me, <del>&amp;</del> some part better, &amp; between us it would be rather a pleasure than
                    a task. If you are not coming I shall repack the books &amp; return them without delay. Not that I want inclination to undertake
                    it, being confident that I could make both a good book &amp; a useful one, &#8211; but I do not like to meddle with sea terms unless you
                    are at my elbow, &amp; moreover to do the whole would occupy more time than I can allow for it.</p>

                    times except on the field of battle! after wasting four months in the most unwholesome part of Spain, he has suffered himself to
                    be led a will-of-the-wisp march into Portugal, &#8211; just out of the way of the French.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Wellington had spent the summer of 1809 in an inconclusive campaign in Spain, though a notable victory was won at Talavera on
                        27 July 1809. In the autumn he retreated into Portugal behind the impregnable Lines of Torres Vedras.</note> &#8211; I have no

          <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Marquis Wellesley was appointed Ambassador to Spain in 1809
                        and arrived in Seville in August 1809 to negotiate with the Supreme Central Junta. Its unwillingness to organise supplies for
                        the British Army while urging a policy of attack led Wellesley (and Southey) to suspect some of the Junta of co-operating with
                        the French, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 756. Wellesley strongly pressed for the Junta to
                        be superseded by a representative Cortes &#8211; an outcome that occurred in January 1810.</note> than of him, &#8211; all he did at
                    Seville was to give information to a set of traitors. that the people were about to deprive them of the means of betraying their
                    country! &#8211; I have long looked on to a siege of Cadiz.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The French army besieged the Spanish
                        port of Cadiz from 5 February 1810 to 24 August 1812.</note> We might do wonders in annoying the enemy <del>x</del> in their

                    destroy us, but that he has infatuated us is sufficiently apparent.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> An adaptation of the
                        proverb, &#8216;He whom Jupiter wishes to destroy, he first makes mad&#8217;.</note>
