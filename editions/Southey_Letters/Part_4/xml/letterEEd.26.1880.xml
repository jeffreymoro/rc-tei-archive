        <p rend="indent1"> You have mistaken my question about the L&#8217;Orient squadron,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> About the
                        movements of the L&#8217;Orient squadron after the Battle of Basque Roads in April 1809; see Southey to Thomas Southey, 2 March
                        1811, Letter 1877.</note> &#8211; I meant the frigates which got out &amp; ran, &#8211; not the ships which joined the Brest squadron
                    &amp; shared its fate. But it is no matter for I have found them at the Saints from whence they ran to Guadeloupe, &#8211; &amp; no
                    doubt there <del>xxx</del> &lt;was&gt; a good account of them at last which I shall <del>xxx</del> come to in good time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of <ref target="people.html#Burdett">Burdett</ref> &amp; his party I think as ill as you can do. It is now just a
                    year since I began to waver in my good opinion of him. His language respecting the H. of Commons, calling it &#8216;<hi rend="ital">this
                        Room</hi>&#8217;, first staggered me, &#8211; &amp; I thought <del>xxx</del> &lt;that&gt; whenever he spoke upon army-matters then was an
                    evident tendency, whether designed or not to inflame the soldiery, &#8211; a game at which <ref target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref> has long been driving. Then came the mischievous business of blockading his house.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> After the House of Commons had voted on 6 April 1810 to commit Burdett to the Tower of London for breach of
                        privilege, he had blockaded himself in his house, an action which caused clashes between troops and the crowd. He was
                        eventually taken to the Tower on 9 April and remained there until the end of the parliamentary session on 21 June.</note>
                    These things with the manner in which he has of late flattered the Crown while he vilified the parliament, leave no doubt whatever
                    on my mind <del>of that dangerous</del> that his conduct is exceedingly dangerous whatever his motives may be. You will see in the
                    Register that I have declared war upon this party, &#8211; &amp; you will see upon what ground I am convinced of the impracticability of
                    Parl: Reform; &#8211; or in other words &lt;that what is so called <del>producing</del> would produce&gt; <del>of it being</del> the

                        brother for information about tides; see Southey to Thomas Southey, 2 March 1811, Letter 1877. It is unclear which of several
                        references to tides in Southey&#8217;s account of the Battle of the Basque Roads in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 364&#8211;379 this refers to.</note> &amp; put in the fact of the ensign<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> A few days before the Battle of the Basque Roads, the French ship <title>Calcutta</title>, which had been

                    yesterday, it pleases me well, &amp; I have taken some pains to prevent the public from confounding Lord Cochrane<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The battle of the Basque Roads had generated considerable public controversy. Although they
                        achieved some success, the British fleet failed to destroy the French navy completely. Captain Thomas Cochrane, later 10th
                        Earl of Dundonald (1775&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of the battle,
                        accused his commanding officer, the evangelical Admiral James Gambier, Baron Gambier (1756&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), of being
                        reluctant to pursue the attack and thus achieve a complete victory. Cochrane was also an MP with a reputation for exposing
                        abuses of office, and, in the weeks after the battle, he pursued his campaign against Gambier via parliamentary speeches.
                        Gambier demanded a court-martial at which he was exonerated and, by implication, Cochrane was convicted of libelling a
                        superior officer. Whilst Gambier received public thanks from parliament for his actions in the battle, Cochrane was not
                        permitted to rejoin his ship for a few months. When he received new orders to serve in the Meditteranean, Cochrane refused and
                        went on half-pay, devoting his time to exposing abuses in the Admiralty.</note> too much with <ref target="people.html#Burdett">Burdetts</ref> party; &#8211; making the broad line of distinction between them about the Spaniards. I
                    believe I understand the affair as well as a landsman can do. I have rather implied than expressed an opinion against Ld Gambier,
                    &#8211; &amp; certainly have so expressed myself as to avoid all possibility of hurting him if he should read the account. You need not
                    send me the proof, &#8211; I shall have one &#8211; correct in yours any blunder of language (tho I think there cannot be any so carefully
                    have I followed the book) &amp; when you think I have erred in opinion or mistaken any matter of fact, set me right by letter, &#8211;
                    the day you receive the proof. I will detain mine mine in expectation of your comments. </p>
