        <p rend="indent1"> I was at one time in good hopes that you &amp; I might have
                    congratulated each other upon the burning of Paris by the Russians, an
                    auta-da-fe which would with great propriety be performed by their hands.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Allied forces had invaded France, but
                        Napoleon was able to inflict a number of defeats on them with greatly
                        inferior forces. Paris was not captured until 30 March 1814.</note> I should
                    have groaned over the books &amp; manuscripts, &amp; been sorry for the
                    pictures, &#8211; but would have sacrificed books pictures &amp; all for the sake of
                    having an example made of this worse than Sodom.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thought the tragedy was in its last act, but it has proved only
                    the second part, &amp; there is perhaps a third to come bloodier than the two
                    former. For to suppose that a peace with Buonaparte can be lasting, is what none
                    but a Morning Chroniclite by party,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        i.e a Whig.</note> or a fool by nature can think. The next war however will
                    be widely different from the present. The hatred of the French in Germany is so
                    strong &amp; so universal that they will never recover their ascendancy there, &#8211;
                    at least in our days, &#8211; &amp; if Austria joins with France, as is likely enough,
                    Bavaria Saxony &amp; the whole North will give Prussia a preponderating weight
                    in the scale.</p>
