        <p rend="indent1"> One reason why you have not for so long time heard from me you
                    will readily have imagined, &#8211; knowing how idly I am disposed to pass my time,
                    &amp; how many employments there are for me, whenever I sit down to the desk.
                    Another has been that I have very long been expecting to see the end of your old
                    acquaintance Kehama,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Hindu romance
                            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>, published in 1810.</note> &amp;
                    telling you when you might look for him in New Cavendish Street. The final proof
                    sheet reached me last week, &amp; unless any accident happens to delay it, it
                    must I think be ready for publication the first week in November.</p>

                        Holcroft (c. 1785&#8211;1844; <title>DNB</title>), author and daughter, by his
                        third marriage, of the writer and radical Thomas Holcroft (1745&#8211;1809;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> for remembering it, &amp; recollecting its
                    owner. The length of time &amp; intervening circumstances since poor Holcroft
                    took it from my lodgings had made me long since consider it as lost, but I shall
                    be truly glad to recover it. If you can find means of conveying it to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref>, it will come down in one
                    of his parcels.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> was delighted at the
                    arrival of his picture, &#8211; a single speck only of paper has stuck to it, but <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lovell</ref> is
                    seriously injured in this manner, paper having clung to the whole of the hair,
                    luckily the other parts of the picture have escaped, &amp; this can be easily
                    washed out &amp; replaced. Had the face sufferd it would have really grieved me,
                    for it is as fine &amp; perfect a likeness as ever was produced. &#8211; Do you know
                    that I have a daughter <ref target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Katharine</ref> &#8211;

                    were you here. I call her my live Doll, she is such a kissable &amp; play-able
                    creature. Last week she had a smart bilious attack which has reduced her a good
                    deal, &#8211; during its continuance there were two <del>others</del> persons who
                    sufferd more than she did, &#8211; <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    is easily alarmed, &amp; my philosophy stands me in less stead than it ought to

        <p rend="indent1"> If you can procure me Dolignons<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Dolignon (1774&#8211;1856), son of <ref target="people.html#DoliognonLouisa">Louisa Dolignon</ref>. He was a
                        clergyman, later Rector of Wimbish in Essex 1816&#8211;1838 and Hilborough in
                        Norfolk 1838&#8211;1856. Southey regularly visited Mrs Dolignon&#8217;s house when he
                        was at school at Westminster and was very close to her son, John, who was at
                        Charterhouse and then Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1797, MA 1800). In 1811
                        John Dolignon married Eliza Yonge (dates unknown), daughter of William
                        Johnson Yonge (1752&#8211;1844), Vicar of Swaffham in Norfolk. This match gave
                        Dolignon&#8217;s hitherto undistinguished ecclesiastical career a significant
                        boost.</note> address I will once more write to him, &#8211; for it is a painful
                    feeling to me that years should pass away without our having any communications,
                    play fellows as we once were, &amp; kind as his excellent mother was to me, &#8211;
                    even with motherly kindness. I <del>frequent</del> dream of her sometimes even
                    now, &#8211; proof enough how deeply the recollections of those <del>days</del>
                    &lt;years&gt; is impressed upon <del>my soul</del> me. Happy will the woman be
                    who marries him, &#8211; for if that mans heart had not proved good I could almost
