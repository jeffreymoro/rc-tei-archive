                    practical work. I can conceive nothing <del>so xx</del> of equal practical
                    importance to the philosophy which pervades it, that <del>an</del> reliance may

                    &lt;since there&gt; is no principle to reply upon, there can be nothing else,
                    but what is as treacherous as a foundation of sand: witness Spain &amp; Austria,
                    &amp; what has past in both countries since that pamphlett was written. The
                    lilly-livered politicians said <del>xx</del> last year that the fate of the
                    Spain was to be decided in Germany, &#8211; affairs in the peninsula were of secondary
                    importance, regular governments &amp; regular armies were what we had to trust
                    to, &#8211; the old cant &amp; nonsense of the Pittites<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Followers of William Pitt (1759&#8211;1806;

                    experiencing the fidelity of a determined people, who have taken arms to deliver

        <p rend="indent1"> This Register proves to me a very profitable concern. I believe I
                    told you that they pay me 400 &#163; for the years&#8217; <del>work</del>, history, &#8211; which
                    is about half a years work. 209 &#163; of this first years payment I have vested in a
                    twelfth part of the property of the work, which has been vacated for the purpose
                    of attaching me more intimately to its interests; &#8211; for this <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames ">Ballantyne</ref> gives me his bill at
                    twelve months for 80 &#163;, &amp; this interest will not diminish as long as the
                    book keeps up its sale, &#8211; which it will do I trust as long as I continue to bear
                    the main part in it. 4000 copies are printed. the outlay has been about 2500 &#163;.
                    &#8211; the net profits you see 960 &#163;. The Ballantynes find their account in their
                    additional profits, one as <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames ">printer</ref>, the other as <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">publisher</ref>, &#8211; or
