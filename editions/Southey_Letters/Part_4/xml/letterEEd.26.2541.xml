        <p rend="indent1"> I beseech you try if you can recover the MSS of Lambs Review, which has been &lt;made&gt; the thing it is by <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> merciless mutilations.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lamb&#8217;s
                        review of Wordsworth&#8217;s <title>The Excursion</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 12 (October 1814), 100&#8211;111. Lamb
                        was extremely upset by the changes Gifford had made to his original; see Charles Lamb to William Wordsworth, [28 December
                        1814] and [7 January 1815], E. W. Marrs Jnr (ed.), <title>The Letters of Charles and Mary Anne Lamb: 1798&#8211;1817</title>, 3 vols
                        (Ithaca, NY, 1975&#8211;1978), III, pp. 125&#8211;6, 128&#8211;30. However, Bedford, who had seen at least part of Lamb&#8217;s MSS, noted it was
                        &#8216;both feeble and affected&#8217; and much in need of revision; see Grosvenor Charles Bedford to Southey, 1 February 1815, Bodleian
                        Library, MS Eng. Lett. d. 52. The fullest discussion of the &#8216;mutilations&#8217; or revisions, depending on your point of view, is

            </ref>.
                        Wordsworth had forwarded Lamb&#8217;s letter of 7 January 1815 to Southey, and asked him to recover the MS of the review from
                        Gifford; see William Wordsworth to Southey, [January 1815], <title>The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth. The Middle
                            Years. Part 2. 1812&#8211;1820</title>, ed. E. De Selincourt, 2nd edn rev. Mary Moorman and Alan G. Hill (Oxford, 1970), pp.
                        185&#8211;186. Southey&#8217;s letter to Bedford is an attempt to do just that. He was unsuccessful.</note> You may remember the old woman
                    at Merida, discovering that we had not drawn the woodcock which was for our supper, &#8211; just like that old woman is <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">G</ref> as a corrector of my <del>xxx</del> reviewals, &amp; so has he proved to <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The comparison is between Gifford and an
                        old woman whom Southey encountered at Merida during his first visit to the Iberian peninsula: &#8216;We had a woodcock for supper,
                        which we trussed ourselves. This did not satisfy the old woman of the house; to our utter disappointment she brought up the
                        poor bird sprawling &#8211; told us we had forgot to cut off the rump and draw it, and then poked her finger in to shew us how clean
                        the inside was&#8217;, Southey, <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (Bristol, 1797), p.
                        237.</note> If there be a logical arrangement, he is sure to dislocate it by pulling out the middle joint of <del>the xx</del>
                    every articulated <del>sentence</del> &lt;paragraph&gt;. If there be a felicitous phrase, &#8211; <del>&amp; xxx xxxx</del> he is sure
                    to gouge the sentence. &#8211; To own the truth I am too angry <del>with him</del> to write to him just now, &amp; shall therefore make
                    my reply thro you. As for his emasculations they must be submitted to, &amp; I have never remonstrated against them; &#8211; but he has
                    no business to insert his own opinions in direct opposition &amp; contradiction to mine. He has said for me that as an Englishman
                    I am proud of the general merits of Pope&#8217;s Homer.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey objected to Gifford&#8217;s insertion
                        of a sentence (&#8216;Of Pope&#8217;s Homer we are, as Englishmen, proud to acknowledge the great and general merits&#8217;) at the start of his
