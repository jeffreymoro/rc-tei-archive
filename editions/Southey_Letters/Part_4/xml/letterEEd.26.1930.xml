                    to see you at all. <hi rend="ital">Going</hi> it cannot be, – for I have promised to stay a day or two with the mother &amp;

She had three daughters; Hannah White (c. 1779–1813); Frances Moriah White (1791–1854); Catherine Bailey White (1795–1889).</note> of poor <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">H. Kirke White</ref> at Nottingham, – as an engagement which I should not have made, had
                    I known that you would be at Teddesley. Then for coming back, I have promised to see <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> either at Bath, or at <ref target="places.html#Llanthony">Llanthony</ref>, – from the latter place my road
                    would be to Ludlow to visit the <ref target="people.html#BrowneWade">Brownes</ref> (some <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> friends of later date than your laking year) – &amp; from thence we were engaged to halt with <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> at Llangedwin. Now just look at the map Senhora &amp; see how provokingly
                    Abergavenny, Ludlow, Oswestry &amp; <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</ref> lie for any person who wants to go to all four places. Ludlow however may be struck
                    out. [Three lines crossed out].</p><p rend="indent1"> Out of this scrape we must trust time to bring us – see you we will if you are at Teddesley on our return – but if
                    I had known your motions only a fortnight sooner, we would have gone straight to Staffordshire &amp; not have included Nottingham
                    in our journey.</p><p rend="indent1"> We set out on Monday next, – &amp; I shall be closely employed till the very day in finishing this almost endless
                    work. Being only two we shall for the sake of expence travel by stage as far as we can, &amp; we expect to be at Leeds on Tuesday
                    night, – then I am afraid we must either lose a day or proceed in chaises, – which will be the least evil of the two.</p><p rend="indent1"> Your verses have not been in the Courier.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Barker’s verses attacking Jeffrey

                    is appropriate as can be. The piece of criticism in question is matchless for self-contradiction &amp; rank rascality of envious
