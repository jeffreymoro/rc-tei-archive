        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your good offices. You will have seen ere this that they were too late, &amp; that M. Dutens having
                    fallen asleep, Stanier Clarke reigneth in his stead.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott had assisted Southey in his
                        campaign for the post of Historiographer Royal, vacated by the death of Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>) on 23 May
                        1812. It did not succeed, and James Stanier Clarke (c. 1765&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>) was appointed instead. For Scott&#8217;s
                        letter in support of Southey; see H. C. Grierson (ed.), <title>The Letters of Walter Scott, 1787&#8211;1832</title>, 12, vols

                    whose quartos certainly weigh down those of any contemporary. &#8211; Had I succeeded in this quest I meant to have proposed to<ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn"> Ballantyne</ref> to write the history of the Spanish Revolution.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Peninsular War of 1808&#8211;1814.</note> No person can be so sensible of the unavoidable defects of that

                    far as they went, it might have been convenient to preserve some of the original workmanship, &#8211; I <del>am certainly
                        acquiring</del> &lt;have acquired so many&gt; additional documents, &amp; have such sources of information opened that I am

                    pleased to give me this title, the speculation might have proved a good one for the publisher. The project however may now take
                    its way &#8216;oer the backside of the world&#8217; into that Paradise where a good many of my projects have gone before it.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A paraphrase of John Milton (1608&#8211;1674; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Paradise Lost</title>

        <p rend="indent1"> I had a very kind letter from <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> upon this business, before it was
                    decided. He hints at other opportunities. For myself I know but one thing which would strongly tempt me to break up my quarters,

                        exploration and encouraged the first party to cross the Blue Mountains into the interior of Australia in May
                        1813.</note> &#8211; I have a strong fancy for that situation, &#8211; but unluckily <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Southey</ref> has as strong an objection to it, &amp; as her objection is sufficiently reasonable, the
                    Inhabitants of that choice colony are never likely to be benefitted by my good intentions, &amp; the honour of crossing the Blue
                    Mountains must be reserved for some more fortunate person. Unless indeed I should find my way there in some <hi rend="ital">deportation</hi>, under the revolution which so many unhappy causes are now cooperating to hasten on.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> None of our political men are sufficiently aware of the danger, they live in such a cloud of their own dust, that
                    they cannot see the signs of the tempest gathering round them. A sense of this danger however is spreading &amp; I will do my best
                    to extend it. It might be crushed, &#8211; but the more I consider how deeply the causes are laid, how widely they are spread, &amp; how
                    long they have been maturing, <del>xxxxxxx</del> the worse does the evil appear; &#8211; &amp; the end which I deprecate seems so

                        down</del> outweigh my hopes. When I was last in Portugal<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1800&#8211;1801.</note> it was
                    that year when the yellow fever first broke out at Cadiz, &amp; we were in daily apprehension of it at Lisbon; &#8211; every person who
                    thought at all upon the matter expected that the disease must be communicated to us, &amp; I had <del>xxxxx</del> in my own mind
                    looked about for a place of retreat, &#8211; yet we all lived as usual, ate, drank &amp; slept, took our evening rides, &amp; went to
                    our evening pe[MS torn] as gaily as if there no pestilence threatening us at the door. So it is now. &amp; God grant that the
                    issue may be as fortunate.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I look forward with great pleasure to seeing you here. <del>x</del> I have all my books about me now, &#8211; venerable
                    company they are, &amp; you will admire my Portugueze &amp; Spanish treasures. The latter end of July I shall be in Durham, &#8211; your
                    journey I hope may be before that time or after it, &#8211; even if it should prove otherwise we may meet on the way, &#8211; your road may be
                    thro Durham, &#8211; &amp; mine on the way home will be by Greta Bridge.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rokeby Hall, home of
