                    I believe there is some curious matter respecting the Book Trade.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. the evidence
                        submitted to the Parliamentary committee examining copyright in 1813. This eventually led to an amendment to the law on
                        copyright in 1814. This extended the copyright authors were entitled to on their works, by making it 28 years in all
                        circumstances, or the life of the author if longer.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> The Spanish Apella<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Apella&#8217; was a name for a person whose stories were not

                        The &#8216;Apella&#8217; in question was Domingo Badia y Leblich (1766&#8211;1818), who Rickman had met in London. He was a Spaniard who had
                        travelled extensively in North Africa and the Middle East under the pseudonym &#8216;Ali Bey al-Abbasi&#8217; and published <title>Travels
                            of Ali Bey: in Morocco, Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey, between the years 1803 and 1807</title> (1816),
                        reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (July 1816), 299&#8211;345. Badia told Rickman there was a huge sea in
                        the interior of Africa, like the Caspian Sea (though he had not actually seen this phenomenon).</note> is likely to be right
                    about his African <del>Ma</del> Caspian; so many accounts speak of one. I think a similar sea will be found in New Holland.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Australia.</note> I never gave a moments credit to the supposed <hi rend="ital">uninhabitability</hi> of the interior of that country, which had become a favourite hypothesis.

                        murdered in Persia in 1813. His cousin was possibly William Browne (1780&#8211;1859) of Orthwaite Hall, north of Keswick.</note> who
                    lives in this country, fancied that if ever the mountain were conquerd, a table land of granite would be found.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first official crossings of the Blue Mountains occurred in 1813, opening up the interior of
                        Australia to explorers from New South Wales.</note> We shall now have much to discover there, &#8211; <del>probably mor</del> it is
