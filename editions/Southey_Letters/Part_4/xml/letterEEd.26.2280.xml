               which may be in my power.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Bowdler (1783&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), a lawyer, religious
                  writer, friend of Wilberforce&#8217;s, prominent member of the Clapham Sect and admirer of Southey&#8217;s poetry. Southey&#8217;s letter is a reply
                  to Wilberforce&#8217;s request (5 July 1813) to extend hospitality to Bowdler on a forthcoming visit to the Lakes, Robert Isaac
                  Wilberforce and Samuel Wilberforce (eds), <title>The Correspondence of William Wilberforce</title>, 2 vols (London, 1840), II, pp.
                  266&#8211;267.</note> I hope he will come before the second week in August, or after the second in September; &#8211; for during that interval I
               shall be in London &amp; its vicinity. If however I may be unlucky enough to be absent, &amp; he should make any stay in <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, (the proper head quarters for seeing this part of the country) I request that he will
               make use of my books when he wants amusement for candle-light or rainy days.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your friend is probably a relation of the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bowdler with whom by mere accident I dined in his
               house at Sevenoaks, two &amp; twenty years ago.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was in Kent in 1791, staying at
                  Hempstead Place, near Cranbrooke, with some relatives of the Lamb family; see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood
                  Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1851), IV, p. 515. The house in Sevenoaks where he dined probably belonged to Bowdler&#8217;s father, John
                  Bowdler (1746&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>), lawyer and religious writer.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The great point respecting India seems to be safe.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wilberforce had initiated
                  the correspondence with Southey on 28 May 1813, when he asked Southey to provide him with &#8216;facts or suggestions which tend to prove
                  either the duty &#8230; practicability, or policy of endeavouring (of course by persuasion only) to christianize the natives of
                  Hindostan&#8217;, Robert Isaac Wilberforce and Samuel Wilberforce (eds), <title>The Correspondence of William Wilberforce</title>, 2 vols
                  (London, 1840), II, pp. 264&#8211;265. The new Charter Act of 1813 governing the East India Company, made it clear that missionaries had
                  permission to go to India to proselytise.</note> The Hindoos were easy proselytes to the Moors; <del>xx</del> the Seiks have grown
               up among them, the Portugueze did much toward <del>x</del> converting the natives, &amp; the Dutch had certainly at one time
               flourishing churches in their Indian possessions. To say then that the Hindoos are inconvertible is a <del>xxxx</del> brow beating
               assertion, advanced by mere ignorance &amp; maintained only by obstinacy &amp; effrontery. &#8220;My yoke is easy &amp; my burthern
                  light&#8221;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Matthew</title> 11: 30.</note> should be the text for the Hindoos; &amp; where you can give that text a direct tangible
               worldly application, the preacher will have an easy triumph. It is otherwise with the Moors; you offer them a stricter morality; &amp;
               a more difficult creed; &amp; they will probably be the last persons to receive Christianity, except the Jews. Their women, thro whom
               they might be won, are not accessible.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am a good hoper by constitution as well as by faith. Notwithstanding the dreadful revolutions of the continent, &amp;
               notwithstanding the earthquake which is fermenting under our own feet, &amp; <del>xxxx</del> which I have the most painful conviction
                  <del>that this country</del> will shake down at no very distant time, all our establishments, &#8211; the world is better than when I came
               into it; &amp; the progress of good has been greater than that of evil. If a spirit of colonization could be excited it would be one of
               the best preventatives of evil &amp; promoters of good. In the wilder parts of the earth this seems to be the best mode of spreading
               the blessings of civilization &amp; true religion. A regular settlement upon one of the S Sea Islands, would in a very few generations
               absorb the indigenous population. What a benefit (for instance) it would have been to Otaheite, if the first Missionaries had erected a
               fort &amp; founded an English town?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first British missionaries to visit Tahiti, from the
                  London Missionary Society, landed in 1797. As there were only eighteen of them and eleven left in 1798 it was perhaps expecting too
                  much for them to build a town.</note> &#8211; No man can abhor all schemes of conquest &amp; aggression more deeply than I do; but it is
               an act of humanity, &amp; even a duty, to assume the guardianship of those who are palpably in a state of moral &amp; intellectual
               infancy. The rights of savages are of infinitely little importance when compared with the temporal &amp; eternal advantages of them
               &amp; their posterity.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My wish is that Government should promote such plans, furnish the means, &amp; leave the Missionary <del>to</del>
               Societies to find men, &amp; direct the execution. At present there is no hope of this, but we are told to cast our bread upon the
                  waters.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
