                                marginal note: &#8216;Tho the dogs are the best people amongst us, the fastidiousness of poetry rejects their names. Homer
                                has given none to the dog of Ulysses &#8211; Ovid has signalized every cur that devoured Acteon.&#8217; Landor is referring to the
                                faithful dog, Argus, in Homer&#8217;s <title>Odyssey</title>, Book 17, lines 290&#8211;327. The elderly Argus recognises Odysseus
                            on his return and then dies. In Southey&#8217;s poem (Book 15, lines 241&#8211;279) &#8216;Whitefoot&#8217; sees through Roderick&#8217;s disguise.
                            Southey later changed the dog&#8217;s name to Theron (after one of Actaeon&#8217;s hound&#8217;s in Ovid&#8217;s <title>Metamorphoses</title>) and
                            reduced the dog&#8217;s role in the poem; for the significance of this see Diego Saglia, &#8216;A Siege, a Dog, and Too Many Women:

        <p rend="indent1"> Your last letter has grieved me.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor had written to Southey on 16 May
                        1814 announcing his resolution to leave England. See John Forster, <title>Walter Savage Landor. A Biography</title>, 2 vols
                        (London, 1869), I, pp. 406&#8211;407. He left the country at the end of the month, travelling first to France and then to
                        Italy.</note> Do not be hasty in disposing of your property. Even if you should pass the rest of your life abroad, it would be
                    wise to have your property vested in England. A few years might pleasantly be passed on the on the continent but not if you went
                    with a purpose of not returning. My own intention is to take my family abroad at the expiration of the first <del>xxx</del> term
                    of my lease, if I can compass the means. The difference of living will probably balance the expence of the journey, &amp; my young
                    ones will pick up languages while I <del>am</del> enjoy a genial climate. But a few years &#8211; a very few would suffice; &#8211; for the
                    older we grow the dearer those old ties become which time has spared. I grant there is vexation enough in our laws, but take it
                    for all in all, there is no country in which a man lives with so little annoyance from the government. &#8211; This &amp; the following
                        book<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Of <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> have been
                    transcribed some time, &#8211; since which I have lost one of my oldest &amp; dearest friends &#8211; <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> at whose lodgings I first saw you.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Danvers had died on 3 May
                        1814.</note> I loved him with my whole heart, &#8211; &amp; scarcely any loss could have wounded me so deeply. &#8211; Go abroad as a
                    guest &amp; a stranger, &#8211; not as an emigrant. &#8211; Perhaps we may meet upon the Rhone or one of the Swiss Lakes.</p>
