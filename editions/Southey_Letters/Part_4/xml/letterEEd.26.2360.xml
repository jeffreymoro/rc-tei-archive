                    manner of &lt;the&gt; direction. They came in a box curiously packed with patterns of printed cottons, enough in quantity to make
                    a patch-work quilt. I neither know who forwarded them to me, nor to whom I am to make payment.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I am rejoiced to see how the Academy<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Portuguese Royal Academy of
                        Sciences, founded in 1779.</note> flourishes in its labours, &#8211; tho the appearance of their books is by no means improved by
                    the frequent apparition of a stamp upon the margin, with causa publica on the top &amp; 5, 10, or 20 &lt;or 40&gt; reis at the
                    bottom. It seems to <del>be</del> occur upon every sheet, &amp; disfigures the books as much as it enhances the price.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have nearly read thro one of the volumes of the Hist. of the French Invasion &amp; the Restoration by Jose

                        in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> So far as I have proceeded, which is to the Emigration, it is as good a
                    book as it possibly could be having been written &amp; published in Portugal, &#8211; perhaps I may not think as favourably of the
                    author when he comes to relate the prowess of his countrymen. But thus far the manner &amp; matter are both exceedingly good,
                    &amp; I shall no doubt find the whole exceedingly useful.</p>
