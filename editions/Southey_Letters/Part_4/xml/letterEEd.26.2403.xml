        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have seldom in the course of my life felt it so painful to answer a letter as on the present occasion.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Cottle had written to Southey on 14 April 1814 soliciting his support for his plan to raise an
                        annuity of &#163;100 for Coleridge via subscription. For Cottle&#8217;s letter see Lynda Pratt, &#8216;The &#8220;sad habits&#8221; of Samuel Taylor
                        Coleridge: Unpublished Letters from Joseph Cottle to Robert Southey, 1813&#8211;1817&#8217;, <title>Review of English Studies</title>, 55
                        (2004), 78&#8211;80.</note> There is however no alternative. I must sincerely express what I think, &#8211; &amp; be thankful that I am
                    writing to one who knows me thoroughly.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of sorrow &amp; humiliation I will say nothing. Let me come at once to the point, &#8211; on what grounds can such a
                    subscription be solicited? &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The annuity to which your intended circular refers was given by the two Wedgewoods, <ref target="people.html#WedgwoodThomas">Thomas</ref> &amp; Josiah<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Josiah Wedgwood II
                        (1769&#8211;1843), brother of Thomas Wedgwood.</note> in equal portions. Thomas, by will, settled his portion on <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> for his life. Josiah withdrew his about three years ago.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wedgwood withdrew his half of the annuity in autumn 1812 on the grounds that he could no longer
                        afford it; see E. L. Griggs (ed.), <title>The Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</title>, 6 vols (Oxford,
                        1956&#8211;1971), III, pp. 421&#8211;422, for Wedgwood&#8217;s letter and Coleridge&#8217;s reply.</note> The half still remaining amounts when the
                    income tax is deducted to 67&#8211;10. That sum <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> receives
                    at present, &amp; it is all that she receives for supporting herself, <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">her
                        daughter</ref>, &amp; two boys<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> and <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent
                            Coleridge</ref>.</note> at school, &#8211; the boys expences amounting to the whole, tho <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartleys</ref> instruction is given him by the Master. No part of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> embarrasments arises from his wife or children, &#8211; except that he has
                    insured his life for 1000&#163; &amp; pays the annual premium. He never writes to them, &amp; never opens a letter from them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In truth <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</ref> his embarrasments &amp; his miseries of body &amp;
                    mind are all owing to one accursed cause: &#8211; excess in opium, <del>xx</del> &lt;of&gt; which he habitually takes more than
                        <del>any</del> was ever known to be taken by any person before him. The Morgans<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#MorganJohnJames">John</ref> and <ref target="people.html#MorganMary">Mary Morgan</ref>.</note> with
                    great effort succeeded in making him wholly leave it off for a time, &amp; he recovered in consequence health &amp; spirits. He
                        <del>now</del> has now taken to it again. Of this indeed I was too sure before I heard that his looks bore testimony of it.
                    Perhaps you <del>were</del> are not aware of the <del>xx</del> costliness of this drug. In the quantity which <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> takes it would consume more than the whole annuity which you propose to
                    raise. A frightful consumption of <del>spr</del> spirits <del>must be added xxxx</del> added to this, &#8211; in this way bodily
                    ailments are produced, &amp; the wonder is that he is still alive.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are but two grounds on which <del>it xx</del> a subscription of this nature can proceed, &#8211; either where the
                    object is disabled from exerting himself, &#8211; or when his exertions are unproductive. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> is in neither of these predicaments. Proposal after proposal has been made
                    to him by the Booksellers, &amp; he has repeatedly closed with them. He is at this moment as capable of exertion as I am, &amp;
                    would be paid as well for whatever he might please to do. There are two Reviews (the Quarterly &amp; the Eclectic) in both of
                    which he might have employment, at ten guineas per sheet, &#8211; in the former I could obtain it for him, &#8211; in the latter they are
                    urgently desirous of his assistance. He promises &amp; does nothing. &#8211; He has poems which have been written many years &amp;
                    repeatedly advertised; &#8211; <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">his wife</ref> would transcribe them for the press &#8211; all that is
                    wanting is he will not take the trouble of overseeing this, or collecting them for her. He has footing in the theatre &amp; might
                    annually bring out a play which would not cost him three months amusing occupation. &#8211; But I need not pursue this subject.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What more can I say? &#8211; He may have new friends who would subscribe to this plan, but they cannot be many, &#8211;
                        <del>&amp; I</del> but among all those persons who know him, his habits are known also.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do you as you think best. My own opinion is that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> ought to
                    come here, &amp; employ himself, &#8211; collecting money on the way by lecturing at Birmingham &amp; Liverpool. Should you proceed in
                        <del>this</del> &lt;your&gt; intention my name must not be mentioned. <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">His wife</ref>
                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">daughter</ref> are living with me, &#8211; &amp; here he may employ himself
                    without any disquietude about immediate subsistences. Nothing is wanting to make him easy in circumstances &amp; happy in himself,
                    but to &lt;leave off opium, &amp;&gt; devote a certain portion of his time to the discharge of his duty. Two hours a day would
                    suffice.</p>
