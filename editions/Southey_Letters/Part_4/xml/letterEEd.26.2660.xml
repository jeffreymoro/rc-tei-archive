        <p rend="indent1"> I have a happy habit of making the best of all things &amp; being just at this time as uncomfortable as the dust
                    &amp; bustle &amp; all the disagreeables of an inn in a larger filthy manufacturing city can make me, I have called for pen ink
                    &amp; paper &amp; am actually writing in the bar, the door open to the yard opposite this unwiped table, the folding doors open to
                    the public room where two men are dining, &amp; talking French, &amp; a woman servant at my elbow lighting a fire for our party.
                    Presently the folding doors are to be shut, the ladies will descend from their chambers, the bar will be kept appropriated to our
                    house, the male part of the company will get into good humour, dinner will be ready &amp; then &#8211; I must lay aside the grey goose
                    quill. As a preliminary to these promised comforts, the servant is now mopping the hearth, which is composed (like a tesselated
                    pavement) of little bricks about two inches long by half an inch wide, set within a broad black stone frame. The fuel is of fire
                    balls, &#8211; a mixture of pulverised coal &amp; clay. I have seen a great deal &amp; heard a great deal more indeed than I can keep
                    pace with in my journal, tho I strive hard to do it: but I minute down short notes in my pencil book with all possible care &amp;
                    hope in the end to lose nothing.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> &amp; his party I know nothing more of them than
                    that they landed at Ostend a week before us &amp; proceeded to Bruges. This we learnt from M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Harrison at
                        Ramsgate.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified.</note> I wrote to him from Ostend; my letter was not lying at
                    the Brussels post office, therefore I conclude he received it. Tomorrow we shall probably learn tidings of them at Spa. Meantime
                    we have joined company with some fellow passengers, <ref target="people.html#VardonMr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Vardon</ref> of
                    Greenwich with his family &amp; <ref target="people.html#NashEdward">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Nash</ref> an artist who has lived
                    many years in India.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Flanders is a most interesting country. &#8211; Bruges the most striking city that I have ever seen: an old city in
                    perfect preservation; &#8211; it seems as if not a house has been built during the last two centuries, &amp; not a house suffered to go
                    to decay. The poorest people seem to be well lodged, &amp; there is a general air of sufficiency, cleanliness, industry &amp;
                    comfort which I have never seen in any other place. The cities have grown worse as we advanced. Ghent (tho very interesting) is
                    less so than Bruges, &#8211; there is more that is modern, more that is vicious, more that is wretched. Brussels has some very fine
                    parts the work of old times. &#8211; The modern parts are fine also but they are French, &amp; the city has the credit (which you &amp;
                    I shall agree in thinking the worst possible character) of being a second Paris. At Namur we reached a dirty city, situated in a
                    romantic country. The Meuse there reminded me of the Thames from your delightful house, an island in size &amp; shape resembling
                    that on which I have often wished for a grove of poplars coming just in the same position. From thence along the river to this
                    abominable place. The country is for the greater part as lovely as can be imagined, &#8211; especially at Huy, where we slept last night
                    &amp; fell in with one of the inhabitants,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francois-Joseph Ouwerx (dates unknown) of Huys,
                        a manufacturer of soap. His father-in-law was Nicolas Delloye (dates unknown), a tin manufacturer.</note> a man of more than
                    ordinary intellect from whom I learnt much of the state of public opinion &amp;c.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our weather hitherto has been delightful: this was especially fortunate at Waterloo &amp; at Ligny where we had
                    much ground to walk over. It would surprize you to see how soon Nature has recovered from the injuries of war. the ground is
                    plowed and sown, &#8211; &amp; grain &amp; flowers &amp; weeds already growing over the field of battle, which is still strewn with
                    vestiges of the slaughter, caps cartridge boxes, hats &amp;c. We picked up some French cards, &amp; some bullets, &amp; we
                    purchased a French pistol, &amp; two of the eagles which the infantry wear upon their caps. What I felt upon this ground, it would
                    be difficult to say, &#8211; what I saw &amp; still more what I heard, there is no time at present for saying. In prose &amp; in verse
                    you shall one day hear the whole.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>,

        <p rend="indent1"> At Les Quartre Bras<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The site of a crucial battle between Anglo-Dutch and
                        French forces on 16 June 1815.</note> I saw two graves which probably the dogs or the swine had opened, &#8211; in the one were the
                    ribs of a human body projecting thro the mould, in the other the whole skeleton exposed. Some of our party told me of a third in
                    which the worms were at work &#8211; but I shrunk from the sight. You will rejoice to hear that the English are as well spoken of for
                    their deportment in peace as in war. It is far otherwise with the Prussians, concerning them there is but one opinion, &#8211; their
                    brutality is said to exceed that of the French, &amp; of their intolerable insolences I have heard but too many proofs. That
                    abominable old Frederick<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Frederick II, the Great (1712&#8211;1786; King of Prussia
                        1740&#8211;1786).</note> made them a military nation, &amp; this is the inevitable consequence. This very day we passed a party on
                    their way toward France &#8211; some hundred or two &#8211; two Gentlemen &amp; two Ladies of the country in a carriage had come up with them,
                    &amp; these ruffians would not allow them to pass, but compelled them to wait &amp; follow the slow pace of foot soldiers! This we
                    ourselves saw. Next to the English the Belgians have the best character for discipline.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have laid out some money in books. &#8211; four or five &amp; twenty pounds. &amp; I have bargained for a set of the

                        volume edition of 1783&#8211;1794, no. 152 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> to be completed &amp; sent after me, the
                    price 500 franks. This is an invaluable acquisition. Neither our time or money will allow us to reach the Rhine, &#8211; we turn back
                    from Aix la Chapelle, &amp; take the route of Maestricht &amp; Louvaine to Antwerp thence to Ghent again, &amp; cross from Calais.
                    I bought at Bruges a French history of Brazil just published by M Alphonse de Beauchamp in three volumes octavo.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alphonse de Beauchamp (1769&#8211;1832), <title>Histoire du Br&#233;sil</title>, 3 vols (Paris, 1815), I, p.
                        x; no. 138 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. This may not be the copy Southey purchased at Bruges, as its pages were
                        uncut.</note> He says in his preface that having finished the first two volumes he thought it advisable to see if any new
                    light had been thrown upon the subject by modern authors. Meantime a compilation upon this history had appeared in England but the
                    English Author M. Southey had brought no new lights. he had promised much for his second volume, &#8211; but the hope of Literary Europe
                    had been again deceived for this second vol. so emphatically promised had not appeared. &#8211; I dare say no person regrets this delay
                    so much as M. Beauchamp himself, he having stolen the whole of his two first vol. &amp; about a third part of the other from the
                    very M Southey whom he abuses. He has copied my references as the best of his own authorities (Manuscript &amp; all!) &amp; he has
                    committed blunders which prove beyond all doubt that he does not even understand Portugueze. I have been much diverted by this
                    fellows impudence. The table is laid &amp; the knives &amp; forks rattling a pleasant note of preparation as the woman waiter
                    arranges them. God bless you. I have hurried thro the sheet, &amp; thus pleasantly beguiled what would else have been a very
                    unpleasant hour. We are all well, &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">your god-daughter</ref> has seen a live Emperor
