                        suffered a miscarriage, or the death of a very young child.</note> &#8211; other
                    sufferings have their natural cure, &amp; when the wound is healed, the loss of
                    those we loved becomes ultimately our gain, connecting us with the world where
                    we shall meet again. If I may reason from my own mind nothing can do this so
                    effectually: all other conceptions of our future state are necessarily vague
                    &amp; doubtful, &#8211; <del>tho the thought is</del> &lt;&amp; in some degree
                    painful&gt; like the contemplation of space or of eternity <del>xxxxxxxx</del>.
                    But the thought of meeting again with our parents &amp; our children, &#8211; the
                    playmates of our nursery &amp; the friends of our riper years, &#8211; this is a
                    definite expectation, &#8211; making &lt;Heaven,&gt; as it were, <del>Heaven</del>
                    tangible &amp; within our reach. I have felt this so strongly that it is led to
                    a project which the Evangelicals no doubt, if it should ever be executed, will
                    exclaim against as impious, &#8211; &amp; which before it is attempted <del>many</del>
                    &lt;most&gt; persons from its exceeding difficulty would in all likelihood
                    dissuade me from attempting. It is that of making our own faith the basis of a
                    poem, &amp; tho to give it the interest of hope &amp; fear, &amp; of good &amp;
                    evil the action must be earthly, yet taking the point of view from our next
                    stage of existence, &amp; laying the scene there.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> This poem was not written.</note> Difficult
                    unquestionably this will be, but to have conceived the thought is to have
                    conquered half the difficulty, &amp; the main doubt is whether I shall ever be
                    able to find time for the undertaking.</p>
