        <p rend="indent1"> I am greatly obliged to you for the trouble you have have taken to discover <ref target="people.html#EvansGreeton">the Welsh phenomenon</ref>, &amp; not a little vexed that it should have proved in vain, &#8211; the more so as my other letter
                    addressed to his friend at Manchester has this evening been returned to me from the General Post Office.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Evans, an aspiring writer, had asked Southey for help. Southey had agreed to read anything Evans sent him; see
                        Southey to Greeton Evans, 19 August 1814 (Letter 2470) and 20 August 1814 (Letter 2472). Southey had involved Wynn in an
                        attempt to ensure that Evans received his reply; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 19 August 1814, Letter
                        2471.</note> That the thing should be a hoax is not very likely, for there is nobody <del>xxxx</del> to enjoy it. However I
                    now send you the original letter to see if you can pick out from it any thing which may lead to a right direction. As for

                        was through think and thin to its party true;/ Its back was buff, and its sides were blue/ Morbleu! Parbleu!/ It served them
