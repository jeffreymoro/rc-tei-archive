                        T Southey</ref> is dead,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey&#8217;s death was reported in his local newspaper
                        the <title>Taunton Courier</title> on 18 April 1811, and had been relayed to Southey by his aunt Mary Southey; see Southey to

                    of a friend of his at Bristol,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly William Oliver (1775&#8211;1830) of Hope Corner,

                        servant Tom (surname and dates unknown).</note> &amp; a few other such objects of his regard. This conduct towards me &amp; my
                    brothers is neither very surprizing nor very blameable &#8211; we lived at a distance from him, &amp; when he did see us, he saw animals
                    of so very different a nature from himself, that the wonder would have been if he had taken any pleasure in their society. But he
                    has a <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">sister</ref>, now advanced in life, &amp; ill provided for; <del>&amp;</del> she kept
                    his house till he turned her out of it for no other reason than that she <del>thought</del> discovered some regret at seeing the
                    footboy Tom preferred to her nephews, &#8211; &amp; he has not left her any thing. This is wicked &amp; unnatural conduct. My account
                    comes from her. she says nothing of herself, &amp; I verily believe thinks nothing <del>of</del> &lt;upon&gt; that score &#8211; but her
                    letter is an affecting one. &#8220;I hope <del>will</del> God will forgive him (these are her concluding words.) <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John</ref> made himself a slave to get this trash, &#8211; he has made himself a fool to give it
                    away. I hope neither you nor yours will ever want it.&#8221; &#8211; The property thus disposed of is about 1000 &#163; a year. An estate of half
                    that value was left by the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">elder brother</ref> to a farmers son, whom the father used to
                    send sometimes with a hare &amp;c &#8211;.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I have another piece of news which did surprize me. <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> has
                    been commissioned to apply to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> for the purpose of discovering
                        <del>if</del> whether I would undertake to translate Lucien Buonapartes poem.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lucien
                        Bonaparte (1775&#8211;1840), brother of Napoleon and author of <title>Charlemagne, ou l&#8217;Eglise D&#233;livr&#233;e</title> (1814).</note>

                        Bristolian-born. Southey&#8217;s comments on Elton&#8217;s lack of cash are surprising, given that he was heir to a baronetcy, a large
                        estate (Clevedon Court) and a mercantile fortune.</note> for the task, who translates well &amp; will, I suspect, be glad of
                        <del>xxx</del> a task which is likely to be so well paid. This has amused me very much, &#8211; but it has rather lowered Lucien in
                    my opinion by the vanity which it implies. If his poem be good for any thing &#8211; he may be sure it will find translators, &#8211; it looks
                    ill to be so impatient for fame as to look about for one &amp; pay him for his work. from whom the application to my worship comes
                    I do not know. &#8211; Lucien has probably applied to some friend to recommend him to the best hand, &#8211; &amp; dispatch being one thing
                    required, the preference has perhaps on this score been given to me over M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Campbell,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poet Thomas Campbell (1777&#8211;1844; <title>DNB</title>). He was a notoriously slow

                    expressing that respect, for I believe him to be a true republican, &amp; any where out of England that is the best thing a man
                    can be. To Grosvenor Bedford I may say that if the poem in question be a bad one it will not be worth translating, &#8211; &amp; if it
                    be otherwise, I humbly conceive that the time which would &lt;be&gt; required to translate it, may quite as worthily be bestowed
                    upon a <del>poem of</del> work of my own.</p>
