        <p rend="indent1"> It is needless to say that I will, with great pleasure, peruse the tales<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Prose tales written by a youthful <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry Kirke White</ref> and not included in
                        Southey&#8217;s <title>Remains</title> (1807). Some of Kirke White&#8217;s prose was later printed as <title>The Prose Remains of Henry
                            Kirke White</title> (1824).</note> you mention, and give you my real opinion as to their fitness for the press. That they
                    would obtain an immediate sale is certain; everything beyond this must depend upon their merit; and I confess I am a little
                    apprehensive upon this score, merely because of <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry&#8217;s</ref> youth. It is one thing to
                    write poems, and another to write a tale. The former requires feeling, fancy, imagination &#8211; things to be found <hi rend="ital">within</hi> &#8211; and a command of language which memory is very soon able to supply; the latter a knowledge of human character
                    and of the human mind, for which experience is necessary. Of course, this fear of mine only applies to <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> to him only on account of his age at which he wrote it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We in the country here are thinking and talking of nothing but these dreadful murders, which seem to bring a
                    stigma, not merely on the police, but on the land we live in, and even our human nature.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The Ratcliffe Highway murders. Two attacks, on 7 and 19 December 1811, in London, which led to the death of seven people. The
                        brutality of the crimes led to public outrage and panic, stoked by sensationalist newspaper reporting. The prime suspect, John
                        Williams (1783/4&#8211;1811; <title>DNB</title>), was arrested on 24 December, but hanged himself in prison on 27 December before a
                        trial could take place. His corpse was dragged through the streets and (according to custom) buried at a crossroads with a
                        stake through the heart. The panic caused by the crimes led to an investigation into the London night watch in 1812.</note> No
                    circumstances which did not concern myself ever disturbed me so much. I have been more affected, more agitated, but never had so
                    mingled a feeling of horror, and indignation, and astonishment, with a sense of insecurity too, which no man in this state of
                    society ever felt before, and a feeling that the national character is disgraced. I have very long felt the necessity of an
                    improved police, and these dreadful events, I hope and trust will lead to the establishment of one as vigilant as that of Paris
                    used to be. The police laws cannot be too rigorous; and the usual objection that a rigorous police is inconsistent with English
                    liberty might easily be shown to be absurd.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am at present reprinting, in a separate and enlarged form, the essay upon the &#8220;New System of Education,&#8221; which
                    appeared in the last &#8220;Quarterly.&#8221;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s defence of <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">Andrew Bell&#8217;s</ref> system over <ref target="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Joseph
                            Lancaster&#8217;s</ref> had appeared in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 6 (August 1811), 264&#8211;304. This formed the basis of
                        his <title>The Origin, Nature, and Object, of the New System of Education</title> (1812).</note> The subject, as connected
                    with the well-being of society, is a very important one, and the dispute in both parts, personal and political, must, I think, be
                    decided by it, in every fair and well-judging mind. A few days ago I received a curious proof of the effect which is produced by
                    writing in the &#8220;Quarterly.&#8221; A circular letter was sent me from Bristol, containing the resolutions of the Bristol Church of
                    England Tract Society, newly established, as it evidently appears, in consequence of the suggestions with which my essay upon the
                    &#8220;Evangelical Poets&#8221; concluded, and the letter itself consisting in great part of my own words.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The object of the Bristol Church of England Tract Society, founded in 1811, was &#8216;to circulate in a cheap form,
