                        seventeenth century, starting with the war against the Dutch in Pernambuco up to 1654, and containing a great deal of material
                        on the Jesuit settlements. The only substantial re-arrangement was to place his material &#8216;de moribus&#8217; (&#8216;on customs&#8217;) into
                        chapters 24 and 30.</note> Then I look back to the Plata &amp; to Paraguay, giving the rise &amp; progress of the Jesuit

                    mind is fully satisfied about the Jesuits. Almost impossible &amp; unimaginable as it appears, their enemies were greater liars

                    press I ought to go in with the history of the Mother Country, of which there are at least two volumes in such a state that they
                    require only to be remodelled in the act of transcription.<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s uncompleted &#8216;History

        <p rend="indent1"> Among the subjects which I have thought of for anther long poem (as I must always have one in hand while the power

                    the story is too much; &amp; it is very difficult, &#8211; perhaps impossible &#8211; where the historical interest is so powerful to blend
                    with it individual &amp; imaginary passion, so as to form a well combined whole. The <del>only</del> &lt;best&gt; way would be to

                    explain with proper skill as much of the previous history as is required. The thought is several years old, &amp; I know not
                    whether it will ever come to any thing. Meantime my New-England fable of Oliver Newman<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    a head &amp; a tail, &amp; the rudiments of the body, &#8211; &amp; if my mind were made up respecting the metre I should probably
                    begin. This choice is always a perplexing one, for however much I may desire to suit the metre to the story, the character of the
                    story derives much of its cast &amp; colouring from the metre.</p>
