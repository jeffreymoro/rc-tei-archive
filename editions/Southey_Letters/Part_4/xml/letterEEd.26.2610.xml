          <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You need not doubt that I should be much gratified by seeing my Hist. of Brazil<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>History of Brazil</title>
                        (1810&#8211;1819). Henry Koster&#8217;s translation was not published.</note> in a Portuguese translation, and much more so by its being your work than if it were that of a stranger: &#8211; but
                    I am altogether incompetent to judge of what you have done, never having written in Portuguese. You are of course aware that it would require something more than verbal correction
                    from a native; a great deal would be to be expunged as heretical, and not a little on the score of its political freedom. Still the general tone of the work is much in favour of
                    the Portuguese, for the long attention which I have given to their history and the whole of their literature has given me a sort of intellectual naturalization among them; &#8211; and
                    when the needful castrations were made, neither the Government nor the people would have cause to be offended with the disposition of the writer.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Should you persevere in this undertaking the only advice I can give you is to refer to the cited authorities wherever any speech or letter or saying is introduced in
                    the text, as you will then find the original expression, and the translation will thus have that native raciness which the English wants. The readiest way of doing this would be to
                    make me a visit when the work was in forwardness, for here the books are, and I could probably turn to any passage in a few minutes. Should you go on with it, the sheets of the
                    second volume shall be sent you as far as they are printed, which in the course of a week or two will be to the end of the Pernambucan War.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Mascate War (or &#8216;War of the Peddlers&#8217;) in Pernambuco, Brazil in 1710&#8211;1711. This passage appeared in <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), III,
                        pp. 85&#8211;107.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> Joam Fernandes Vieira<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Joao Fernandes Vieira (c. 1613&#8211;1681), leader of the Brazilian forces against the Dutch in Pernambuco
                        1645&#8211;1654. He became Captain-General of Paraiba (1655&#8211;1657), Captain-General of Angola (1658&#8211;1661) and finally took command of all fortifications in North Eastern Brazil
                        (1661&#8211;1681). In 1643 he married Mary Caesar (dates unknown), daughter of Francisco Berenguer de Andrada.</note> was married, and when the insurrection began his wife was on the
                    point of lying in. But whether he left children or not I do not know. Angola did not kill him, for he was living in 1678, and dedicated the Castrioto Lusitano<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Raphael de Jesus (1614&#8211;1693), <title>Castrioto Lusitano</title> (1679), no. 3621 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> to the

                    Jesus promised a second part of his history, which was to relate what he did after the war on Pernambuco: but that second part never appeared, and from the documents of Portuguese
                    history may almost be said to end about that time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will probably be able to correct some errors in my work, which no diligence can avoid, when local knowledge is wanting.</p>
