        <p rend="indent1"> At length I have received your packet, with your letter of March 2nd. I thank you for its contents. Robert Hall&#8217;s
                    pamphlet has done its work.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Hall (1764&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>), Baptist Minister.
                        Southey is probably referring to his pamphlet <title>An Address to the Public on an Important Subject Connected with the
                            Renewal of the Charter of the East India Company</title> (1813), which was published by Conder.</note> I trust also that
                    the important object for which Claudius Buchanan has so long pleaded will now be effected, and that there will be a regular Church
                    Establishment formed for India.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Anglican clergyman Claudius Buchanan (1766&#8211;1815;
                            <title>DNB</title>) had campaigned to ensure the East India Company did more to further the spread of Christianity in
                        India. The creation of an episcopate for India, at the time of the renewal of the Company&#8217;s charter in 1813, was mainly due to
                        his efforts. Buchanan&#8217;s publications included <title>Memoir of the Expediency of an Ecclesiastical Establishment for British
                            India</title> (1805) and <title>Colonial Ecclesiastical Establishment, Being a Brief View of the State of the Colonies of
                            Great Britain and of her Asiatic Empire in Respect to Religious Instruction</title> (1813).</note> It will greatly
                    facilitate the progress of the missionaries, and give stability to all which they do. And the missionaries themselves, of whatever
                    persuasion they may be, will feel as Britons of every reformed communion used to feel in Portugal, when Protestant and Papist were
                    the only demarcations which were acknowledged.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The poem<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Gloria in Excelsis Deo: et in terra pax, bona voluntas homnibus. A Poem. Respectfully Inscribed to the British and
                            Foreign Bible Society</title> (1812), republished as &#8216;The Star in the East&#8217; in Josiah Conder, <title>The Star in the East
                            and Other Poems</title> (London, 1824), pp. 1&#8211;28.</note> is spirited, and in a good strain. It happens that the first two
                    lines rhyme, and this leading me to suppose that the poem was in couplets, I felt <hi rend="ital">balked</hi> in the fourth verse,
                    at coming to <hi rend="ital">nigh</hi> instead of <hi rend="ital">near.</hi>

                    like all the other productions from that quarter, succeed admirably in what they aim at. I shall rejoice to see your &#8220;Reverie&#8221;
                    preserved in a proper place.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Conder&#8217;s &#8216;Reverie&#8217; appeared in <title>The Associate
                            Minstrels</title>, 2nd edn (London, 1813), pp.212-219.</note> If the editors of the <title>Ed. An. Register</title> had
                    known what was good from what was good for nothing, they would have found no difficulty in making room for its insertion.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> had rejected &#8216;Reverie&#8217; when it was sent
                        in by Southey, acting on Conder&#8217;s behalf, in 1812; see Southey to Neville White, 27 September 1812, Letter 2151.</note> My
                    influence in that quarter is confined to my own department.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your letter respecting our excellent friend <ref target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</ref>. I
                    have been too much occupied to write to him, and of late my spirits have wanted their usual elasticity. <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">A brother</ref> of <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">my wife&#8217;s</ref>, who came here
                    hoping to enjoy a few weeks of relaxation, is lingering under a complication of obscure and incurable diseases; and how long he
                    may live, or rather how long he may continue dying, is what no medical skill can foresee. I know just enough of nosology to punish
                    me for ever having looked into the science without making it my study. Not an ailment can occur among my children that I cannot in
                    my own mind explain by some alarming cause; and thus little illnesses, which men who lived less with their children would hardly
                    hear of, and men in healthier feelings and happier ignorance would never think of, give me serious disquietude. It seems as if I
                    had as many hopes and fears as the veriest worldling, and that having none with respect to common worldly objects, they had all
                    taken this direction.</p>

          <ref target="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</ref> has not written to me for many months, and I have long intended to tell
                    him so. I see his &#8220;World before the Flood&#8221; advertised, and when next I write to <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>,
                    will take a place in the <title>Quarterly</title> for it.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> For Southey&#8217;s review of
                        Montgomery&#8217;s <title>The World Before the Flood</title> (1813), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 11 (April 1814), 79&#8211;87.</note>
                    Reviews, unluckily, are much more effectual instruments in the hands of an enemy than of a friend; but I will do what I can to
                    procure justice for him, with as much sincerity as good will.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My own poem<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> is but half written. My annual and quarterly avocations<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s work for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813) and
                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> fill up a larger portion of my time than I would spare to them if I were but
                    equally remunerated for better things. However, if no untoward events should impede me, I shall get on rapidly with the poem
                    during the summer, and put the concluding volume of Brazil to the press in the course of six or eight weeks.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The second volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title> was published in 1817, the third,
                        concluding volume in 1819.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> Why did not your cousin<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified.</note> bring you an account of the
                        <hi rend="ital">inside</hi> of my house, as well as of the outside? A line from you would have procured him ready admittance,
                    and such attentions, as a stranger may find useful. Remember this in future.</p>
