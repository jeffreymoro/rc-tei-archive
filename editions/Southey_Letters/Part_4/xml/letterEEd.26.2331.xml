        <p rend="indent1"> I reached home on Sunday afternoon after a twelve weeks absence. Your letter was awaiting my return, &#8211; a former one
                    reached me just before my departure, &amp; with many others remained unanswered, because amid the endless round of occupations
                    &amp; engagements in which I was involved, it was impossible to find time for answering them. Thank God I am once more by my own
                    fire side. My ancles are still somewhat swolen, for I was five &amp; forty hours upon the road; &amp; the sound of the mail coach
                    is not yet out of my ears; but I am safe, sound &amp; at rest.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You would find it easier to write a new comedy than to introduce action &amp; bustle into a plan which was
                    constructed without them.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s comments relate to Landor&#8217;s comedy &#8216;The Charitable
                        Dowager&#8217;. It was never published or performed; see also Robert Southey to Walter Savage Landor, 30 June 1813, Letter
                        2277.</note> This is like pulling a house to pieces for the purpose of making something which formed no part of the original
                    design. There is in the dialogues of this play a peculiar character which it is easier to feel than to analize; &#8211; your prose is
                    like your verse every where terse, condensed &amp; full of thought, &#8211; &amp; with flashes of which the thought &amp; the
                    expression, are so apt, so happy &amp; so original that I know &lt;not&gt; where they are to be paralleled, or where any thing
                    approaching them is to be found. &#8211; I was asked in London whether I were the author of C Julian.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor&#8217;s tragedy <title>Count Julian</title> (1812).</note> The question implied a great compliment to me,
                    &amp; little discernment in those who proposed it. Your notion of tragedy is perhaps too severe, yet I think you could <del>more
                        easily</del> write one which would succeed in representation more easily than you could a comedy. &#8211; Once you talked of a
                    selection of Modern Latin poems<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> This project was not completed.</note> &amp; sent me some
                    specimens of the criticisms which were to accompany it. A Bookseller would find his account in publishing this, for it would have
                    a sale at public schools &amp; in the Universities.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> On my arrival in town I found that <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>, having consulted with
                        <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">an old friend &amp; schoolfellow of mine</ref>, had asked the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> to make me Laureate. The <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> replied that he understood I had written well in defence of the Spanish cause, &amp; therefore I should have the
                    appointment. Presently <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> meets <ref target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord
                        Liverpool</ref> &amp; tells him what had past. <ref target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord L.</ref> expressed his regret that
                    he had <del>x</del> not known it four &amp; twenty hours earlier, for the <ref target="people.html#HertfordLord">M. of
                        Hertford</ref> had consulted with him, &amp; they, agreeing that <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">W Scott</ref> was the
                    fittest person upon whom to bestow the laurel, on the <del>x</del> maxim of detur digniori,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Let it be given to the more worthy&#8217;.</note> &#8211; they had written &amp; offered it to him. The <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> was angry at this: he ought to have been consulted, he said, it was his
                    pleasure that I should have it, <del>&amp; have it</del> he had given it to me, &amp; have it I should. <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> then observed that he was <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> friend as well as mine; that <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> &amp; I were upon the best terms
                    with each other, &#8211; that any thing which could be done upon the subject would be especially unpleasant to all three, &amp;
                    therefore for the sake of all three he requested that the matter might rest where it was. All this I learnt on the morning of my
                    arrival.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As soon as the post could bring it, there came a letter from <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Scott&#8217;s letter of 1 September [1813], telling Southey that he had
                        declined the Poet Laureateship and instead recommended him to Croker. He also cautioned &#8216;I am uncertain if you will like it,
                        for the laurel has certainly been tarnished by some of its wearers, and as at present managed, its duties are inconvenient and
                        somewhat liable to ridicule&#8217;, H. C. Grierson (ed.), <title>The Letters of Walter Scott, 1787&#8211;1832</title>, 12, vols (London,
                        1932&#8211;1937), III, pp. 335&#8211;336. Scott held two legal offices: he was Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire (since 1799); and Principal
                        Clerk of the Court of Session (since 1806). These posts gave him a combined salary of &#163;1600 p.a.</note> telling me that he
                    declined the appointment, because he held two professional offices, &amp; did not think it becoming to accept this which was
                    almost the only thing that could be bestowed on one who was exclusively devoted to literature. He urged me to accept it, if as he
                    hoped, <del>&amp;</del> expected, &amp; had requested it should be offered me, &#8211; &amp; this was couched in terms so frank &amp;
                    ingenuous, that they really reflected more honour upon himself than he yielded to me. &#8211; In me it would have been rank cowardice
                    &amp; therefore rank folly to have refused the appointment, &#8211; which I could only have done <del>for xx of xxxx</del> because I
                    disliked the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Princes</ref> Government, or distrusted my own <del>xxx</del> power of
                    making the office respectable, &#8211; or because I feared to give occasion to the jests of newspaper jokesmiths. The salary was
                    originally 100 marks. It was raised for Ben Jonson<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ben Jonson (1572&#8211;1637;
