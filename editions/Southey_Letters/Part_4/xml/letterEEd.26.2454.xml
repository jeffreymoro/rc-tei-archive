          <salute>My dear Rickman</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am heartily glad to hear of your succession.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rickman had been appointed Second Clerk
                        Assistant at the Table of the House of Commons, taking his place on 23 July
                        1814.</note> If you had your right place in the world, <del>there would be
                        more rewards</del> that imperial observation of which I as well as you have
                    been so often reminded <del>of</del>, would <del>not</del> be somewhat less
                    applicable in these parts of it. You used to notice a sort of entailed longevity
                    belonging to parliamentary offices, may you keep up the custom, &amp; live to a
                    better old age <del>xxxxx</del> than your predecessor.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Ley (1733&#8211;1814), Deputy Clerk of the House of
                        Commons, had died on 13 June 1814 after 47 years service. His death required
                        a rearrangement of offices that included Rickman&#8217;s promotion.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is a portrait of Ferdinand in a vile book by one Walton
                    called the Present State of the Spanish Colonies; <del>there was a</del> the
                    beast has an enormous excrescence of chin, &amp; a correspondent superfluity of
                    forehead, &#8211; which beyond all doubt must be filled with a very pappy substance, &#8211;
                    it being out of the course of nature to provide such a cavity with good
                        brain.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The portrait of Ferdinand
                        VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain, 1808, 1813&#8211;1833) was in William Walton
                        (1783/4&#8211;1857; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Present State of the Spanish
                            Colonies; Including a Particular Report of Hispanola, or the Spanish
                            Part of Santo Domingo</title>, 2 vols (London, 1810), I, frontispiece
                        [unpaginated], no. 2978 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note>
                    Having as yet only seen the <del>very</del> brief &amp; unsatisfactory accounts
                    which appear in the Courier, I am very-ill-informed of what has passed in
                        Spain:<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ferdinand VII had
                        abolished the liberal Constitution of 1812 on 4 May 1814 and arrested the
                        liberal leaders on 10 May.</note> but the main cause of the facility with
                    which the King has overthrown the Cortes is I think certainly to be found in the
                    rooted attachment of the populace to all the follies &amp; all the abominations
                    of their Church Establishment. Under such an Establishment men necessarily
                    either believe every thing, &#8211; or nothing: the possibility that another form of
                    Xtianity may be more reasonable never occurs to the thinking part of the
                    community, &#8211; luckily for them where such an opinion would lead to martyrdom. The
                    Spaniards therefore, as regards their religious feelings &amp; conduct may be
                    considered as divided into three classes: 1. A certain number of bold spirits
                    among the educated classes (the proportion of whom must be much the same in
                    every country) who disbelieved, &amp; would gladly destroy the prevalent
                    superstition. &#8211; 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> those who believed it just as little, &#8211;
                    but were snugly provided for in the establishment; &amp; much more disposed to
                    triumph at an auto-de-fe than to suffer in a revolution. &#8211; 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> an enormous majority in all classes believing all the fables in
                    which they have been brought up, with an intensity of faith which can hardly be

        <p rend="indent1"> I have received this afternoon a packet of B Ayres papers, &#8211;
                    where they go a legislating &amp; revolutionizing in a wild way, &#8211; but always,
                    as in the <del>early</del> days of Jacobinism, with fair professions.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was probably reading the
                            <title>Gazeta de Buenos Ayres</title>, a weekly newspaper than ran 7
                        June 1810 - 12 September 1821. In Argentina the legislature was the
                        &#8216;Assembly of the Year XIII&#8217;, which was called together in October 1812. One
                        of its major achievements was the &#8216;Libertad de vientres&#8217; law (1813), which
                        decreed all children born of slaves would be free. An elected congress met
                        in Paraguay in September 1813 and declared the country a Republic, with
                        executive authority in the hands of a first and a second consul, who were to
                        exchange power every four months. The first two consuls were Jose Gaspar
                        Rodriguez de Francia (1766&#8211;1840) and Fulencia Yegros y Franco de Torres
                        (1780&#8211;1821). Francia became sole consul in 1814 and dictator for life in
                        1816.</note> There are two curious laws &#8211; worthy of notice in the Quakers
                    magazine being <del>very</del> I think the newest improvements in Philanthropy.
                    Among some fair provisions for emancipating at a proper age <del>chi</del> the
                    children of slaves, it is decreed that they shall not be weaned till they are at
                    least twelve months old. &#8211; And by another edict all flogging in schools is
                    prohibited, &#8211; as a crime of leze-liberty in a free country! &#8211; They have a
                    Republic of Paraguay under two Consuls. What will be the end of these things?
                    Ferdinand will send troops, &amp; may very probably get easy possession of B
                    Ayres, &#8211; but the revolutionary Government will remove to some town in the
                    interior, &#8211; &amp; the extent of the country renders it absolutely impossible to
                    conquer it, if the people chuse to continue their present course. But if our own
                    Americans were unfit for independence, how much more unfit are these! There is
                    something radically wrong in the constitution of all modern colonies. The Greeks
                    seem to have understood these things better.</p>
