          <salute>My dear Danvers</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your news of <ref target="people.html#ReidSamuel">S. Reid</ref> made me so uncomfortable about him that I could not
                    rest till I had written to him;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Reid was thinking of becoming a missionary; see Southey to
                        Samuel Reid, 5 December 1812, Letter 2187.</note> &#8211; with little hope indeed of turning him from his purpose, but in the only
                    manner which has any chance of doing it. By showing him that he may do more good by staying at home. I have endeavoured to
                    convince him that for foreign service the Methodists &amp; other such enthusiasts are the men. That if he could be content to do
                    good silently &amp; certainly his surest way would be to act as minister to some congregation &#8211; provided his opinions admit of it
                    &#8211; otherwise to continue his present course of life &amp; contract new duties by marriage. But if, like <ref target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</ref>, he must have some specific object in view &#8211; for which to devote himself, I
                    have asked him if such objects are not to be found in England, &amp; thrown out hints to him of two either of which would give
                    scope enough to his zeal. The one to become the founder of some such institution for women as you may remember was once the
                    subject of much correspondence between <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> &amp; <del>xxxx</del> me<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rickman&#8217;s plan for beguinages, or communities of poor women, who would work and live
                        together.</note> &#8211; the other to form a society for reclaiming the Gypsies. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> R. &amp; his sisters<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rebecca Ford Reid (1765&#8211;1851), Samuel Reid&#8217;s stepmother; and his sisters, Elizabeth
                            Peasley Reid (1779&#8211;1818) and Rebecca Ann Rickards (1785&#8211;1834).</note> will thank me for setting him upon a scheme like this, if it should have the effect of keeping him in England.
                    I think I see you laughing at my notion of setting <ref target="people.html#ReidSamuel">Sam</ref> to preach to the Gypsies &#8211; I
                    laugh too, but it would be really a good thing to set the Evangelicals &amp; the Philanthropicals at them. They are at once a pest
                    to the community &amp; a disgrace to it, &amp; if <ref target="people.html#ReidSamuel">Sam</ref> could be persuaded to <del>xxxxxx
                        xxx</del> fancy this his call, it would take so <del>xx</del> well that funds would not be wanting, for any reasonable plan
                    which might be devised. The other is a worthier object, &amp; blessed will that man be who shall carry it into effect.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">Georges</ref> disappointment has been removed ere this. For I
                    repeated the lost order for his books, as soon as this new edition of Kehama<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The third
                        edition of <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>, published in 1812.</note> was published, &amp; he probably has received them
                    now: if not they are on the way.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Unluckily I do not know a single person in Glasgow, or in any part of its vicinity, &#8211; nor any person connected with
                    that part of Scotland from whom I could procure any introduction for <ref target="people.html#JardineDavid">David</ref> &amp;

                    the accounts you gave me of the Serampore mission. Their setting-to the next day to recast the types is a fine incident worthy of
                    honourable remembrance &amp; sure to meet with it. It is a great consolation that the whole loss is reparable by money.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 11 March 1812 the printing office of the Baptist-run Serampore mission had been gutted by
                        fire. The blaze caused an estimated &#163;7000 of damage, and destroyed &#8216;all the papers and accounts of the mission from its
                        establishment &#8230; fourteen founts in the eastern languages, a large assortment of types lately received from England, and more
                        than twelve hundred reams of paper&#8217;, alongside copies of bibles and completed and draft translations of Indian texts. Work on
                        recasting the types began immediately and &#8216;with a few months the press was in full operation&#8217;. See John Clark Marshman

                    Considered in a mere literary point of view this mission has produced greater fruits in a given time than any other institution
