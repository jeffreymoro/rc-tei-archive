        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have slept upon <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</ref> opinion, because I knew not immediately what
                    to say about it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Turner had been consulted over the advisability of Murray&#8217;s publishing
                        Landor&#8217;s <title>Commentary on Memoirs of Mr Fox</title>; see Southey to John Murray, 7 March 1812, Letter 2055. Although the
                            <title>Commentary</title> was printed, Murray eventually suppressed it, refusing to publish a book that attacked the Tory
                        government and was dedicated to James Madison (1751&#8211;1836), President of the United States (1809&#8211;1817), with whom Britain was
                        about to go to war.</note> Perhaps the better way will be to tell the <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Author</ref> that another publisher is afraid of the book, &#8211; that you have taken the legal opinion of a person in whom you
                    have entire confidence, &#8211; that many booksellers would <del>probably</del> &lt;perhaps&gt; <del>t</del> venture to publish it, but
                    probably none of the more respectable ones, &#8211; &amp; that the best way will be for the <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Author</ref> to take one of those opinions which he formerly proposed, &amp; be guided by it, &#8211; or as a thing of less
                    formality to let any legal friend of his own mark such passages as he would recommend to be expunged.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Some of the parts which I noticed as probably indictable remain unaltered in the copy which you last sent me &#8211; that
                    respecting the nonpayment of taxes in the dedication,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 7, suggested
                        the British people could force the government to change its policies by refusing to pay taxes.</note> &#8211; &amp; that concerning
                    Ld Riversdale.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Tonson, 2nd Lord Riversdale (1775&#8211;1848). His father, William
                        Tonson, 1st Lord Riversdale (1724&#8211;1787), was born William Hull and was probably the illegitimate son of the substantial Irish
                        landowner, Robert Tonson (1695&#8211;1773). Landor had referred to the 1st Lord Riversdale as &#8216;the bastard of a scullion&#8217;;
                            <title>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p.
                        90.</note> The general nature of the book is such that &lt;it&gt; is not likely to be prosecuted, still I think a writer acts
                    very imprudently who renders himself liable to prosecution without any occasion &amp; for no imaginable good. It is a book of
                    extraordinary talent, so full of original thoughts felicitously expressed that I should grieve if it were suppressed, &#8211; but I
                    should be far more grieved if <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">L.</ref> involved himself by it in vexations which it
                    was quite unnecessary to provoke. The good or evil which it would do is <del>pretty small</del> balanced, &#8211; for the author is as
                    often right as he is wrong, &#8211; &amp; almost as <del>almost</del> often wrong as he is right; supposing therefore that it would
                    leave the opinions of men pretty much as it found them, the originality &amp; talent which it displays would be so much clear gain
                    to the public in the way of intellectual pleasure.</p>
