          <salute>My dear G.</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> My only reason for putting the dedication in Latin was that I knew not how to render in English the &#8216;<hi rend="ital">in perpetuam amiciti&#230; memoriam</hi>&#8217;.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;In memory of a perpetual
                        friendship&#8217;. Southey intended to dedicate <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814) to Bedford and had sent him a
                        Latin dedication; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 17 July 1814, Letter 2461.</note> The objection to latinizing
                    Grosvenor is, I think, overstrained.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had Latinized &#8216;Grosvenor&#8217; as &#8216;Grosvenori&#8217;,
                        rather than attempting to translate the name&#8217;s literal meaning &#8216;great hunter&#8217;.</note> Almost every name has some meaning &#8211;
                    Roderick for instance is Rode-rich, &#8211; <hi rend="ital">consilio pollens</hi>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;famously
                        powerful&#8217;.</note> but Rodericus is the proper Latin. If it be in English it must run simply thus</p>
        <p rend="center">To &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="center">G. C. B.</p>

        <p rend="center">R. S.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">&#8211; if it be in Latin I should like after the G. C. B to insert if I were more sure of the Latinity</p>
        <p rend="indent1">olim condiscipulo et semper amico<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Once a schoolfellow and always a

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">Chuse you between them, &#8211; for my own part I prefer the Latin, <del>because</del> it is &lt;only&gt; for things of
                    this kind <del>only</del> that I have <del>felt</del> ever felt our language <del>x</del> ill adapted, &#8211; <del>but my reason for
                        the preference professing it here</del> but the reason of my preference in this instance is the <hi rend="ital">in
                        perpetuam</hi> &amp;c &#8211; a foreign tongue here gives something of the same kind of license as a mask.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The dedication as published was in English and read: &#8216;To/ Grosvenor Charles Bedford,/ This poem is inscribed,/
                        In lasting memorial of a long and uninterrupted friendship,/ By his old school-fellow/ Robert Southey&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Some of your remarks upon these last books have been profitably attended to. About Mahommeds coffin you will find
                    that I have Mohammedan authority.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 23, lines 145&#8211;150. Southey&#8217;s Islamic source for the legend that
                        the Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s (c. 570&#8211;632) coffin in Medina was suspended in mid-air is Jean-Baptiste Labat (1663&#8211;1738),

                        catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> Their notion is that it is supported by angels, &#8211; the vulgar opinion supposed a
                    loadstone, &#8211; I make it a constant miracle of his own working. If there had been need I could easily have shown in a note that
                    infidelity was in fashion among the Moors of this age. &lt;The Ommiade Caliphs<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Umayyad
                        family were Caliphs 661&#8211;750 and rulers of Cordoba 756&#8211;1031.</note> were mostly unbelievers themselves.&gt; The <del>xx</del>
                    tone of the speech cannot be mistaken, &#8211; its use was to introduce some of those appropriate allusions of which the poem stands in
                    need, the time in which it is laid being barren of costume.</p>

                    would no longer delight another. We admire Homer deservedly (&amp; undeservedly too, as might very easily be shown by a good

        <p rend="indent1"> If you say any thing of my stile &amp; &#8216;the school&#8217; as it is called, there would have been a good opportunity if
                    some egregious nonsense upon this subject had not got into the last number of the Quarterly.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s complaint was aimed at the description of the &#8216;Lake Poets&#8217; in an appraisal of the second edition of
                        Coleridge&#8217;s <title>Remorse. A Tragedy</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 11 (April 1814), 183: &#8216;It appears to us
                        that chance or a congenial mode of thinking has brought into intimate connection minds of very distinct powers and
                        peculiarities. Thus a school of poetry has arisen of which all the members agree in some points, but differ in others; and
                        even where they agree in kind they sometimes differ in degree. In examining their writings, therefore, we are to expect a
                        general resemblance in all, which yet shall be neither so strong nor universal as to obliterare a peculiar character in each.
                        Mr. Southey, for instance, appears to us more active and playful than those with whom his name is here associated:
                        metaphysical enough to gratify the vanity, without fatiguing the attention, of the common reader; rather sweetly developing
                        the virtues of the heart, than curiously untwisting the subtleties of the mind; diffusing over his whole picture a colouring
                        more grateful and soothing, but less contrasted with strong light and shade; more delightful and amiable, more curious and
                        excursive, but, on the whole, perhaps possessing less of that touching and irresistible power which incidentally redeems the
                        wilder eccentricities of his friends&#8217;. The review&#8217;s author was Coleridge&#8217;s nephew, John Taylor Coleridge.</note> The history
                    of my style is simply this. In all young poets it is &amp; ever must be, mere imitation. We imitate what we admire, &amp; as we
                    admire (when young) in wholesale, defects become the easiest objects of imitation. Thus they who imitate Milton succeed in writing
                    something very stiff, very pedantic &amp; anti-English. My favourite poet was Spenser but at the age <del>when</del> of what might
                    be termed poetical puberty when the voice of song began to be fixed, I had <ref target="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</ref> by heart. &#8211; Perhaps I have read more poetry than any man living, &#8211; much Italian, much French,
                    &#8211; almost every thing Spanish, Portugueze Latin &amp; English, &amp; in former times a proper share of Greek. But for many years I
                    had entirely laid it aside till within these few months. My mature style aims at nothing but to express in pure English what I
                    have to say: &#8211; <del>xxx</del> I profess nothing but to avoid the barbarisms &amp; nonsense which have so long past current in
                    verse. Briefly, the subject being such as seems good to me, &amp; the manner of treating it my own, I &lt;endeavour to&gt; write
                    &lt;in&gt; such English as would bear the assay of Q Elizabeths<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"> Elizabeth I (1533&#8211;1603;
