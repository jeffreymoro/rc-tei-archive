                        Wordsworth</ref> arrived some days after your letter, in the only parcel which I have for a long time received from <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>. Indeed I have had very little communication with him of any kind for the last
                    six months. Thank you for the volume, it stands fronting me among the magnificos of my library.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I give you joy of the success of your labours, late tho it be &amp; long delayed, &#8211; &amp; of the extension of the
                    New System, which having once taken root must send forth <del>xxx forth</del> its branches &amp; suckers on every side. Yet I
                    confess that I shall never be satisfied till I see it adopted into our political system, &amp; established by the legislature
                    wherever its authority extends. This I think might have been expected from <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Mr
                        Perceval</ref>, &amp; on this account as well as on many others I never call to mind his death without regretting it as a
                    great national calamity.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your <ref target="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</ref>, or rather <ref target="places.html#RydalMount">Rydale</ref> friends as they ought now to be called, are gone pleasuring into Scotland, leaving <ref target="people.html#WordsworthDorothy">Miss Wordsworth</ref> to keep house with the two younger children.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dora (1804&#8211;1847) and William Wordsworth (1810&#8211;1883).</note> They wished me to have accompanied
                    them, but I am for the present fixed to my employments, &amp; as there is a possibility of my travelling into the Bishoprick
                    during the autumn, I could not afford time for both excursions. Your Bishop<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Shute
                        Barrington (1734&#8211;1826; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Durham since 1791. He had promoted both the inter-denominational
                        Religious Tract Society (founded 1799) and the British and Foreign Bible Society (founded 1804).</note> has very kindly
                    repeated his wish of seeing me at Auckland, thro my brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</ref>, who is his neighbour. The Wordsworths<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Wordsworth</ref>.</note> mean to return by the middle of September. Your letter I fear holds out but faint hopes of our seeing
                    you in these parts: &#8211; you will find too much to do in Ireland, &amp; too many persons to see, to have leisure for thinking of our
                    Lakes. Yet if your presence be required at Durham this will be little, if at all, out of your way. The young ones often ask when
                    you are coming; &#8211; whenever, that may be, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">your namesake &amp; god-daughter</ref> is big
                    enough &amp; playful enough to contend for a place upon your knee, &amp; enforce her claims by as shrill a pipe of joy as ever
                    made a room echo.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of late I have been almost exclusively employed in poetry. my great poem,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> which was begun five years ago, &amp; had been meditated for
                    five years before that, is at length compleated, &amp; a few weeks will send it into the world. I had dedicated it in verse to the
                        <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref>, &#8211; but these Sovereigns came over, &amp; feeling that something
                    might be expected from me on such an occasion, I did my devoir to the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> at
                    the same time,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alexander I (1777&#8211;1825; Emperor of Russia 1801&#8211;1825); Frederick William III
                        (1770&#8211;1840; King of Prussia 1797&#8211;1840). Southey&#8217;s official poems celebrating their visit were published in book form as

                            His Majesty the King of Prussia</title> (1814).</note> &#8211; &amp; so spoilt the dedication, &#8211; the purport of which was that I

        <p rend="indent1"> You will smile to hear that the mischievous turn of affairs in the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Princes</ref> family should have produced any effects on me. Relying upon the marriage of the Princess Charlotte with the
                    Prince of Orange, I determined like a good boy at school to be in time with my task, &amp; having formed a plan of some
                    originality much to my own liking, which would have been divided into three parts entitled The Proem, The Dream, &amp; <hi rend="ital">L&#8217;Envoy</hi>, had got <del>xxxx more than half</del> &lt;nearly&gt; thro the second when the match was broken off

                        had been engaged to the Hereditary Prince of Orange, William (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849), the husband
                        selected for her by her father and his advisers. The match had been agreed in December 1813, but the marriage contract was not
                        signed until 10 June 1814. Later that month the engagement was broken off. Southey&#8217;s planned poem formed the basis of
                            <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816), in celebration of Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Leopold of Saxe
