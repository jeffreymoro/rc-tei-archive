        <p rend="indent1"> I trouble you with a packet pro Twopenny &#8211; it contains some papers upon a legacy business,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably connected to the exceptionally complex will of Cannon Southey (d. 1768).</note> which may probably
                    find their way to you once more to solicit frankage to Bristol.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You may have seen in the last Quarterly that I took occasion of D&#8217;Israeli&#8217;s D&#8217;Israelish book to say something about
                    the Wrongs of Authors.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Isaac D&#8217;Israeli (1766&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Calamities of
                            Authors; Including some Inquiries Respecting their Moral and Literary Characters</title> (1812), <title>Quarterly
                        Review</title>, 8 (September 1812), 93&#8211;114. Southey had used the review to attack the existing copyright law, established in
                        1709, that &#8216;an author may retain or dispose of the property of his works for a term of eight and twenty years, after which it
                        becomes common property&#8217; (111). His argument for reform was followed by the proposal that the government establish an academy
                        to provide employment for literary men and benefit individual and national interests (113&#8211;114).</note> I wish some <hi rend="ital">influencial</hi> member (as an American would say) would touch upon this when the foolish demand for copies upon Q
                    Annes Statute comes again before the House.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Statute of Anne (1665&#8211;1714, Queen of Great

                        Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies, during the Times therein mentioned&#8217;. Passed in 1709, it came into
                        force in 1710 and is seen as the origin of copyright law. This law also required nine copies of all books (increased to eleven
                        in 1801) that were listed at Stationers Hall to be donated to public and university libraries. This provision had been much
                        more strictly adhered to since two legal cases in 1812, causing much annoyance to publishers and authors.</note> For if the law
                    is to undergo any revision an opportunity would offer of rendering it a little less unjust to the parties who are most
                    concerned.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your great book<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> It is not clear what Southey is referring to
                        here. Possibly Rickman had sent Southey some material from the 1811 Census, which he had organised.</note> &amp; the <ref target="people.html#BurneyJames">Capitaneus</ref> for the Dutchman.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Alexandre
