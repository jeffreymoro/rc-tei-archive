        <p rend="indent1"> I fear it is a long time since you have heard from me. My days are so filled up that many things are necessarily
                    left undone. Roderick<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). The final poem extended to 25 Books.</note> is now my main business.
                    144 pages are printed, &#8211; which reach the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book, &amp; <del>I know</del> last night I finished the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. I shall put the <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">printer</ref> to work upon the notes most
                    probably while I compleat the poem. The extent will be 20 or 21. You see I am in soundings, &amp; it will not be long before I
                    shall be in sight of land. &#8211; Meantime that I may be ready with my exercise I have laid down the timbers of a poem upon the Young
                    Princess&#8217;s marriage, it will consist of three parts, &#8211; of which the first is written; &amp; the second begun.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey, as Poet Laureate, was expected to write on the forthcoming marriage of the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent&#8217;s</ref> only child Charlotte Augusta (1796&#8211;1817;
                        <title>DNB</title>). In December 1813 she had become engaged to the Hereditary Prince of Orange, William (1792&#8211;1849; King of
                        the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849), the husband selected for her by her father and his advisers. Southey started the required poem
                            (<title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>) but in the event it was not needed as the engagement was broken
                        off in June 1814. The <title>Lay</title> was recycled in 1816 to celebrate Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg
                        (1790&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>).</note> Tis in the six syllable stanza of Gualberto,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The ballad &#8216;St Juan Gualberto&#8217;, <title>Annual Anthology</title> (Bristol, 1800), 1&#8211;19.</note> &#8211; only that the last line is not
                    always an alexandrine. I am pleased with what I have done, &amp; more pleased with the conception of what remains to do, &#8211; the
                    form of the second part is allegorical, &amp; instead of compliment it takes a high moral strain of exhortation delivered by
                    certain personages, real &amp; imaginary, <del>among whom will be</del> Liberty, Religion, Old Ocean (a friend of yours) &amp; a
                    brother of his who wields the sword instead of the trident,<ref target="people.html#ClarksonThomas"> Clarkson</ref>, <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell</ref>, &amp; to bring up the rear Death. &#8211; persons who may without
                    any startling incongruity meet in a dream. &#8211; Should I go on as I have begun it is likely to be a striking poem.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Doctor</ref> is in the press with his book upon Consumption.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Herbert Southey, <title>Observations on Pulmonary Consumption</title> (1814).</note>
                    I had the first proof a few days back. It is very well written, &amp; if the matter be as good as the manner seems to be (of which
                    I have no reason to doubt) it will do him great credit, &amp; probably as much good as he expects from it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The new edition of Thalaba<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The third edition of <title>Thalaba the
                            Destroyer</title> appeared in 1814.</note> is on the way to me. It differs from the last only in having the stanzas (or
                    rather paragraphs) numbered, to prevent the printer from ever again running two into one, &#8211; &amp; in the lapidary arrangement of
                    the lines, like Kehama.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> It will not be difficult to make your history<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Tom Southey&#8217;s
                            <title>Chronological History of the West Indies</title> (1827).</note> as compleat as it ought to be. After having done
                    all that is possible at home, you must pay the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Doctor</ref> a visit in order to make
                    use of the Public Libraries, &amp; I will then obtain access for you to such Government records as may be needful. But instead of
                    confining yourself to the year 1700, the work ought to be carried down to the end of the existing war.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At different periods certain chapters or introductions will be required upon subjects which a chronological
                    arrangement of mere facts cannot include. Thus at the beginning there should be as compleat &lt;an&gt; account <del>of the</del>
                    as can be collected of the state of the inhabitants at the time of the discovery. The negroes will afford matter for another
                    chapter, the slave trade for another &amp; finally a chapter upon the present state &amp; future prospects of these islands. I see
                    very distinctly in what manner the book may be made better than any of its kind, &amp; remain a model for such works. The notes
                    should all be translated; &amp; the original added where there is a neccessity for producing the actual words of an author as
                    authenticated evidence, &#8211; or if it be desirable for any peculiarity of expression.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have suspected that Rochefort is the original of Davis, &#8211; but on the other hand the translation was certainly
                    made from an anonymous work, &amp; I cannot discover that Rochefort ever published an edition without his name.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Davies (1625&#8211;1693; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of Barbadoes, St Christophers,

                    &amp; yet a most entertaining &amp; valuable writer. He is what his portrait represents him; &#8211; a thoroughly sensual Frenchman,
