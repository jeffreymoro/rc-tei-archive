        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter I hope &amp; trust was written in a different tone of
                    mind from what it would have indicated if you had been writing at mid-day
                    instead of day-break. Surely if you are strong enough to travel &lt;to&gt; <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, the best pleasure which it
                    affords you will be able in some degree to enjoy, &#8211; &amp; lie at your ease in
                    the boat, while <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> &amp; I
                    alternately amuse ourselves at the oars. Your disease is certainly not the
                    ordinary liver complaint in which abscess after abscess forms &amp; breaks
                        <del>till</del> till the system can no longer support the discharge. God
                    knows what it is, &#8211; not improbably the effect of that dreadful fall, &#8211; the liver
                    being of all the viscera that which is most likely to be injured by a general
                    concussion of the whole frame. I wish <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> stood higher for you, &#8211; but in this country all towns &amp;
                    villages are built in the vallies, &#8211; with the exception of one little
                        <del>villa</del> hamlet &lt;(Watendlath)&gt; as lonely as it is lovely,
                    about five miles from hence, which is in a valley high among the mountains. To
                    lodge you there however would be almost as impossible as it would be in
                        <del>xxxx</del> one of the mountains of the Moon, &amp; I think here in <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> you will taste the air of all the
                    surrounding heights in sufficient purity whenever the wind blows &#8211; which it does
                    often enough most vociferously. &#8211; Lodgings here are bad &#8211; in size something
                    about your old apartments at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Toon&#8217;s.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified.</note> &#8211; nor are they any of
                    them well-situated &#8211; I shall get the most chearful &amp; airy which are to be
                    had, &#8211; &amp; <del>in whatever</del> whichever that may be it cannot be more than
                    a quarter of a mile from this room of mine, &#8211; provided you make as much use of
                    that as I expect &amp; require, I will answer for my patience in any other trial
                    to which you may think proper to put it. Here are books in super-abundance for
                    every studious mood, &#8211; when you are for conversation you may have as much or as
                    little as you like, &#8211; if you like chess <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> is fond of it, &#8211; &amp; when you are tired of all there
                    is a sort of sofa-bed in the room. <del>on which</del>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If there be any thing in the way of diet beyond the most ordinary
                    articles of consumption which you require it must be brought with you, &#8211; for
                        <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> is a wretched town, &amp;
                    very ill supplied with every thing. The best thing we have is <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">an Apothecary</ref>, for whom I
                    hope in God <del>I</del> you <del>x</del> may feel no occasion, &#8211; but it is a
                    satisfaction to know that <del>he is</del> we have a much more skilful &amp;
                        <del>better infor</del> a better informed practitioner than is usually to be
                    found, or indeed expected, in such a place. &#8211; Bring with you as much hope as you
                    can, &amp; freedom from all business &amp; this pure air may work wonders.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your route will be pleasanter if you make for Leeds instead of
                    Manchester &amp; so to Skipton &amp; Settle, &#8211; by this means you will not
                    &lt;only&gt; avoid much uninteresting country, but also I believe
                        <del>some</del> the detestable paved roads of the south of Lancashire, which
                    are enough to shake a sound man into a liver complaint. If you cannot get from
                    Settle to Lancaster, go on to <del>Kendal &amp; from thence to Ambleside</del>
                    Kirkby Lonsdale, &amp; it will be worth while turning back to Lancaster, for the
                    sake of crossing the sands &amp; entering the Lake country by the best route. If
