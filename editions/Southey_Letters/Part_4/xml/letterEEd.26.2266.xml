                    history civil, political &amp; military, of Spain &amp; Portugal from the commencement of Buonapartes machinations in 1807. I have
                    many Spanish documents, &amp; shall renew my efforts to obtain more, with the best prospects of success. Respecting Aragon &amp;

                    published two parts of an excellent account of the operations in Catalonia, has sent me the third part in manuscript,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francisco Xavier de Cabanes (1781&#8211;1834), <title>Historia de las Operaciones des Exercito de
                            Catalune en la Guerra de la Usurpacion</title> (1809), all three volumes (two printed and one MS) were no. 3816 in the

                        roused the Galicians against the French through his paper, <title>Diario de la Coruna</title>. Southey had met him in
                        1795&#8211;1796, see <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp.
                        22&#8211;23.</note> has been the great instrument in keeping up the spirit of Galicia by his writings, &#8211; to him I shall apply
                    without delay; &#8211; &amp; at Lisbon I have sources of information open, English &amp; Portugueze.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> From the beginning of 1810 I have the Regency Gazettes compleat, &amp; a considerable collection of provincial
