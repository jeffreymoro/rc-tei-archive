        <p rend="indent1"> As I wrote to poor unfortunate <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> you would not be
                    surprized at not receiving an answer in reply to your last letter.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Fricker was accused of an assault on
                        a young woman in Bristol, but the matter seems to have been dropped. Southey
                        certainly believed in George&#8217;s innocence. His letter to George does not seem
                        to have survived.</note> You anticipated its effect truly, &#8211; I was most
                    compleatly astonished, &amp; my astonishment at one time found a very natural
                    vent in the form of laughter, &#8211; but it is a vexatious business; &amp; it
                    affected <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> so much that I was
                    really afraid <del>xx</del> in the course of the night that some serious
                        <del>injuri</del> consequences might have ensued.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edith Southey was heavily pregnant.</note> Many
                    questions occurred to me &#8211; which it was impossible to get answered, &#8211; who should
                    have a key of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lunells<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Peter Lunell (1758&#8211;1840), prominent Bristol
                        merchant, antiquarian and anti-slavery activist, with premises in Brunswick
                        Square. George Fricker was his employee.</note> yard? how was it possible
                    that three men should not succeed in forcing a woman thro an open door? &amp;
                    some other circumstances tending to excite a suspicion that it was a trumped up
                    story by the girl. If however she swears to her story &amp; to him, &amp; the
                    Landlady swears to an alibi, the case must then be decided by character, &amp;
                        <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George</ref> I think is safe enough.
                    Still Juries are so very far from being infallible that I am not without
                    &lt;some&gt; anxiety <del>xx x</del> concerning the court &#8211; for disagreable as
                    it would be to himself to be convicted, I verily believe it would produce more
                    serious evil to me just at this time. &#8211; Who would ever think of drawing such a
                    piece of ill luck as this in the lottery of life? However if <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">Georges</ref> Counsel does his duty,
                    there can be little fear. He must be prepared to prove <del>the history of</del>
                    in what manner he past the evening, &amp; to show that he was sober. If it were
                    not for the unaccountable circumstance of the key, the case could hardly be
                    brought into court. &#8211; Was the door found unlocked the next morning, or is it
                    pretended that he stopt to lock it? I cannot help suspecting roguery. It is so
                    absurd to suppose that he would have chosen a place to commit the crime in which
                    so naturally not only lead to suspicion, but to proof against him, &#8211; &amp; that
                    any stranger should have a key seems inexplicable. &#8211; I wrote to him about money,
                    &amp; wish I could manage better about it. However you will be able to get my
                        <del>draught</del> draft cashed, &amp; the discount is not worth a thought.
                    I used to draw upon <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn  ">Ballantyne</ref>
                    at three days sight, but he has taken advantage of the failure of these Northern
                    banks to make me draw at three months.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Workington Bank, along with other country banks, had failed
                        earlier in 1812. The failure caused much local inconvenience.</note> I
                    suspect this is an excuse, for their brother (the bookseller) deals with me like
                    a shuffling fellow; I have let him know that I perceive this, &amp; if he does
                    not feel it his interest to act honestly there will very soon be a breach
                    between us. This would be <del>x</del> a great present inconvenience, &#8211; that I
