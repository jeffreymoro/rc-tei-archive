        <p rend="indent1"> It was but yesterday that I enquired of Murray whether I might
                    avail myself of your name to frank up copy for the printer. Your friendly letter
                    encourages me to do so now &#8211; without waiting for permission.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John Murray, 25
                        November 1812, Letter 2184.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You would certainly have seen <del>xx</del> me had I been in
                    London; but here I am, &amp; here I shall be quill-driving till the end of
                        April,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey devoted this time
                        to the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813).</note>
                    when I hope to gain leisure for a five weeks run to the South. Twenty years ago
                    I also could write one or two hundred lines a day, &#8211; &amp; even at a later time
                    (1799) 1200 of the best lines which I ever wrote were produced in one week.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> For <title>Thalaba the
                            Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> I am now comparatively a slow writer, &#8211;
                    rejecting more of what occurs, less easily satisfied with what is not rejected,
                    &amp; less ardent in what was once my passionate pursuit. You need not be told
                    that there is no intellectual exertion so delightful as that of composing a
                    great poem: &#8211; but my mind has attained a sort of quietism from which it does not
                    willingly permit itself to be roused, patient historical research is of all
                    employments that which is &lt;now&gt; most <del>delightful</del>
                    &lt;congenial&gt; to me, &amp; if my own inclinations alone were to be consulted
                    I should lay aside all other avocations &amp; devote myself exclusively to the
                    completion of my Portugueze histories.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819) and the unfinished
                        &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217;.</note> Yonder they lie unfinished upon the shelf, &#8211;
                    half-a yards length of manuscripts, the work of many years. Time passes on, grey
                    hairs begin to show themselves, every year brings with it less leisure than the
                    last: I am of a short-lived race, &amp; sometimes regret that any thing should
                    compel me thus to leave undone that which, in all human probability, no other
                    person will ever undertake with half the advantages that I have possessed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The sole temptation which I have for proceeding with the poems
                    which I am perpetually building in the air, is to gratify a few persons who love
                    me, &amp; a few (they are very few) of whose approbation I am ambitious. As for
                    reputation hereafter, if what I have done will not secure me that, it were idle
                    to hope it from any thing which I shall ever do. In other points, I hope, by
                    Gods blessing to continue to learn as long as I live: but as a poet I
                        <del>be</del> am full-grown <del>xxx</del> the quantity of my poems may be
                    increased &#8211; doubled &#8211; quintupled &#8211; decupled, if there were a demand for the
                    article, &#8211; but their value must be determined by assay &#8211; not by weight, &amp;
                    nothing that I can now produce will alter that.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The probable extent of my poem<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    such matters, I am yet very sincerely desirous of hearing criticism while it is
                    possible to profit by it, &amp; if you will do me the favour to look over these
                    papers when you feel inclination &amp; have leisure, with a fault-finding eye, &#8211;

                    not mine. The very nature of the subject prevents me from ever feeling myself
                    upon terra firma. However I have done my best &amp; hope it will answer his
