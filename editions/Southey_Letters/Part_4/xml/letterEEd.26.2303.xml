        <p rend="indent1"> Let me introduce to you a <ref target="people.html#AllstonWashington">New-Englander</ref>, who has travelled in
                    your country,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> King was originally from Switzerland.</note> studied at Rome, &amp; will
                    leave behind him as a painter, even if he should never produce another picture, a reputation higher than any artist of the age. He
                    has been miserably ill (from the effects of white lead I believe) &#8211; &amp; you I am sure for his arts sake as well as for mine,
                    will give him any medical aid of which he may stand in need. He is a man of real worth as well as of high genius.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will write to you more fully when I can find leisure. Of myself all I have to say is that I am in good health
                    &amp; grumbling; &amp; that you will probably soon see me announced as Poet Laureate. You will please to congratulate, &amp; not
                    condole with me, upon this appointment. I take it upon an understanding that no odes are to be expected from me,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John Wilson Croker, [4 September 1813], Letter 2298. Southey was soon to be
                        disabused and, for the first ten years of the Laureateship, found himself writing annual odes.</note> &amp; I mean to employ
                    the whole salary in insuring my life. It will nearly, or perhaps quite, cover an insurance for 3000&#163; &#8211; &amp; thus a thing which is
                    paltry in itself, becomes of importance by enabling me to make this provision for my children.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have become acquainted with M. Stael,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Anne Louise Germaine de
                        Sta&#235;l-Holstein (1766&#8211;1817), the writer and salonni&#232;re, who had been much feted during her 1813 visit to England. She, too, was
                        Swiss.</note> &#8211; I expected only a clever woman, &amp; found a sensible one. &#8211; If she goes to Bristol (which I fear she will
                    not) I will send you an introduction to her.</p>
