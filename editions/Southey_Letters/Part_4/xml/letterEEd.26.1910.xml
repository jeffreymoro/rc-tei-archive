        <p rend="indent1"> I heard of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> T Southeys</ref> death from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref> two or three days ago.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey&#8217;s
                        death was reported in his local newspaper the <title>Taunton Courier</title> on 18 April 1811. Southey received word from his
                        aunt Mary on the evening of 20 April; see Southey to Herbert Hill [begun before and continued on 20 April 1811], Letter
                        1905.</note> Oliver<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly William Oliver (1775&#8211;1830) of Hope Corner,
                        Taunton.</note> has not all the property, a good portion is gone to his man Tom.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Thomas Southey&#8217;s manservant, surname and dates unknown. Thomas Southey also left a bequest to Taunton hospital, reported in
                        the <title>Taunton Courier</title> (5 September 1811).</note> It was always my opinion that he would leave most of what he had
                    to the Olivers, with which &lt;family&gt; he has been on the closest terms of card-playing intimacy ever since I can recollect.
                    The person in question he knew much better than any of his nephews; &amp; therefore I do not think him very unreasonable in
                    preferring him to them. Of any injustice I fully acquit him. Had it had been an old family property the case would have
                    &lt;been&gt; different, &#8211; it would then have been a wrong to those from whom he received it, &amp; to those for whom he held it in
                    trust, &#8211; but as it was the matter is very different. &#8220;<ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John</ref>, says <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref>, made himself a slave to get this trash, &#8211; he has made himself a fool to give
                    it away.&#8221; &#8211; On our part he deserves no <del>further</del> &lt;heavier&gt; censure than this. But towards <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref> his conduct has been cruel &amp; unnatural to a degree which nothing but
                    insanity can account for &#8211; unfortunately it is not that sort of insanity of which the law takes cognizance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Charles</ref> if <del>xxxx</del> &lt;Lawyer&gt; Nicholas<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. The devil (Old Nick).</note>
