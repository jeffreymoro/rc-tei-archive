        <p rend="indent1"> It appears to me that Perrin<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Perring (c. 1767&#8211;1839), Clerk of the
                        Cheque at the Royal Dockyards in Plymouth. Perring was best-known for improving the design of anchors. His pamphlet was
                            <title>A Brief Inquiry into the Causes of Premature Decay in our Wooden Bulwarks, with an Examination of the means best
                            calculated to prolong their duration</title> (1812). Southey commended his plans for &#8216;laying up our ships in ordinary&#8217;
                            (<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 12 (October 1814), 187) and in 1815 offered an article on them to the <title>Eclectic
                            Review</title>; see Southey to Josiah Conder, 28 January 1815, Letter 2546.</note> says what he has to say as well as it
                    can be said, &#8211; for matters of this kind can derive no advantage from any ornaments of composition. If the Quarterly Review were
                    open to me, I might perhaps be able to serve him, &#8211; but there the ground is occupied by Barrow.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Barrow (1764&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>), promoter of exploration, author and Second Secretary of the
                        Admiralty, 1804&#8211;1806, 1807&#8211;1845.</note> If it would be of any use to him to have the substance of his pamphlett stated as
                    briefly &amp; clearly as possible in the newspapers (the Times or Courier) this I could do, &amp; to this assistance he is very
                    welcome, tho as you well know the subject is little in my way, &amp; I have but too many demands upon my time. However I would do
                    it, if it were wished because I fully acknowledge the importance of his suggestions. The good that I can do will be only to make
                    the thing more public, by putting it within sight of some 15 or 20,000 persons on the same day, &#8211; &amp; in return Mr Perrin I dare
                    say will take the trouble of showing me the docks, if ever I should happen to call upon him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I believe Oliver Goffe will be my next poem,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The early name for &#8216;Oliver
                        Newman&#8217;, left incomplete at Southey&#8217;s death. In the poem, Newman was the godson of Oliver Cromwell (1599&#8211;1658;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and the son of William Goffe (d. 1679?; <title>DNB</title>), Puritan, regicide and major general, who
                        fled to New England in 1660 after he was excluded from the Act of Indemnity after the Restoration.</note> but the arrangement
                    &amp; developement of the story puzzles me very much. The beginning will need your help. On the way from England being bound to
                    Plymouth in New England, he is driven into the harbour at Cape Cod. Now my Lord Admiral please to tell me what wind would compell
                    him to put into this harbour, &amp; be pleased also to navigate the ship for me from the time that the wind makes them seek
                    shelter till she is safe at anchor. The time is 1675, the season September, the ship a Bristolman of from 2 to 300 tons.</p>

                        Bedford a draft dedication; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, [30 April-1 May 1814], Letter 2412. He changed his
                        plans, instead incorporating a tribute in <title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, His

        <p rend="indent1"> I have a note from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> this afternoon saying it is likely he
                    may get a lift into your county about the middle of this month. It would not be possible for me to join him before the beginning
                    of next. His book will soon be out, &#8211; there is but one sheet more to compleat it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I threaten to convert the head of my broken bust into a scare-crow by setting it upon a mop-stick &amp;
                    accommodating it with one of my hats, any one of which may without much degradation be applied to this useful purpose. The
                    difference between the two sides of the face is not exaggerated; &amp; that which is <del>xx xxxxx</del> not seen where life &amp;
                    motion vary the <del>xx</del> countenance is brought into full view in the dead but faithful resemblance. The immediate cause of
                    the difference is that only the left side of my face is moved in laughter, &amp; as my risible muscles are pretty much exercised
                    (heaven be praised for having made me of laughter-loving complection!) <del>xxxx</del> the one side has had so much more wear
                    &amp; tear than the other. I know not why the face does not appear leaner, all its proportions being made by actual
                    measurement.</p>
