          <salute>My dear James,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was glad to hear from <ref target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</ref> that you were comfortably settled, and
                    growing attached to college; and glad to hear afterwards from yourself that you begin to feel your ground. There is no part of my
                    own life which I remember with so little pleasure as that which was passed at the university; not that it has left behind it any
                    cause of self-reproach, but I had many causes of disquietude and unhappiness, &#8212; some imaginary, and some, God knows, real enough.
                    And I cannot think of the place without pain, because of the men with whom I there lived in the closest intimacy of daily and
                    almost hourly intercourse; those whom I loved best are dead, and there are some whom I never have seen since we parted there, and
                    possibly never shall see more. It is with this feeling I believe, more or less, that every man who has any feeling always
                    remembers college. Seven years ago I walked through Oxford on a fine summer morning, just after sunrise, while the stage was
                    changing horses: I went under the windows of what had formerly been my own rooms; the majesty of the place was heightened by the
                    perfect silence of the streets, and it had never before appeared to me half so majestic or half so beautiful. But I would rather
                    go a day&#8217;s journey round than pass through that city again, especially in the day-time, when the streets are full. Other places in
                    which I have been an inhabitant would not make the same impression; there is an enduring sameness in a university like that of the
                    sea and mountains. It is the same in our age that it was in our youth; the same figures fill the streets, and the knowledge that
                    they are not the same persons brings home the sense of change which is of all things the most mournful.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I see your name to the Bible Society, concerning which I have read Herbert Marsh&#8217;s pamphlet and Dr. Clarke&#8217;s
                        reply.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Herbert Marsh (1757&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>), cleric and biblical critic. He
                        had preached a sermon at St Paul&#8217;s on 13 June 1811 that was critical of the interdenominational British and Foreign Bible
                        Society (founded 1804) and urged that Anglicans should found their own Bible society. Southey had read the pamphlet form of
                        the sermon, <title>The National Religion the Foundation of National Education: A Sermon Preached in the Cathedral Church of
                            St. Paul, London</title> (1811). Its arguments were rebutted by Edward Daniel Clarke (1769&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>),
                            <title>A Letter to Herbert Marsh, D.D., F.R.S. &#8230; in Reply to Certain Observations Contained in His Pamphlet Relative to
                            the British and Foreign Bible Society</title> (1812). In late 1811 the dispute spread to Cambridge, where students
                        proposed forming an auxiliary group of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Marsh publicly opposed this in his
                            <title>Address to the Members of the Senate of the University of Cambridge</title> (1811). The students gained support
                        from Lord Hardwick (1757&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>) and the Duke of Gloucester (1776&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), Chancellor of
                        the University. The first meeting of their new society was a great success, and Marsh backed down. James White had clearly
                        joined this new Cambridge bible society.</note> Marsh may possibly be fond of controversy, because he knows his strength. He
                    is a clear logical writer, and in these days a little logic goes a great way, for of all things it is that in which the writers of
                    this generation are most deficient. His reasoning is to me completely satisfactory as to these two points, &#8211; that where Christians
                    of all denominations combine for the purpose either of spreading Christianity or distributing Bibles in other countries, the cause
                    of the general church is promoted thereby; but that when they combine together at home, as that condition can only be effected by
                    a concession on the part of the churchmen, by that concession the Church of England is proportionally weakened. Nothing can be
                    clearer. But though the Margaret Professor<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. Marsh, who had been appointed of Lady
                        Margaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge in 1807.</note> is perfectly right in his views, and his antagonists are mere
                    children when compared to him, I think he has been injudicious in exciting the controversy, because upon that statement of the
                    case which his opponents will make, and which appears at first sight to be a perfectly fair one, everybody must conclude him to be
                    in the wrong, and very few persons will take the trouble of looking farther. And I think his object might have been effected by a
                    little management without much difficulty, &#8212; by an arrangement among the Church members of the Society that the Liturgy should be
                    appended to the Bibles which they distributed at home, or by a Prayer-book Society.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> A
                        group of evangelical Anglicans went on to found the Prayer Book and Homily Society in 1812 to distribute specifically Anglican
                        material.</note> A man should be very careful how he engages in a controversy, in which, however right he may be, he is
                    certain to appear wrong to the multitude; and he ought to be especially careful, when he thus exposes not his own character alone
                    but that of the body to which he belongs. Besides, the mischief which Marsh perceives is not very great, because I apprehend that
                    at least nine tenths of the business of B. Society relates to foreign countries. But I agree with him entirely as to the mischief
                    that lurks under the name of liberality; by which is meant not an indulgence to the opinions of other communities, but an
                    indifference to your own.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do you attend the Divinity Lectures? Herbert Marsh is likely to be a good lecturer, being a thorough master of his
                    subject, and a reasoner of the old school.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Marsh gave his first set of professorial
                        lectures in 1809, following up with further series in 1810, 1813, 1816, 1822 and 1823. He did not lecture in 1812. Marsh set a
                        precedent by lecturing in English (not the customary Latin) and in the church of Great St Mary (rather than the divinity
                        schools).</note>
