        <p rend="indent1"> Some of our Reformers whose dunghill spirits look to nothing but economy &amp; found their whole principles of
                    policy upon the rule of Profit &amp; Loss have recommended that the privilege of franking should be abolished.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Since the creation of the Post Office in 1660, all MPs had the privilege of sending their mail
                        free of charge (&#8216;franked&#8217;). It was a privilege that was much abused as they often sent letters for friends (like Southey). The
                        matter was raised periodically in the Commons (e.g. on 14 December 1812, by the Whig, Thomas Creevey (1768&#8211;1838;
                            <title>DNB</title>)).</note> Now if it were left to me to determine coolly &amp; conscientiously whether it should be
                    abolished or whether those persons who <del>would vote</del> &lt;call out&gt; for its abolishment should be hanged, I should send
                    an order to his Majestys Halter-Maker to prepare a greater number of hempen necklaces than he is usually in the habit of
                    manufacturing. &#8211; Perhaps you do not know that the ropes used on such occasions are manufactured for the purpose, the noose &lt;or
                    rather noose-hole&gt; being being made in them, like the eye of a needle, ready to be threaded with the other end. &#8211; Franking is
                    almost the only instance in which an act of government contributes directly to keep up kindly feelings &amp; promote the real
                    comforts of intellectual life. I could write a long chapter upon this subject, &#8211; but I was led to it by thinking <del>that</del>
                    it was one of the comforts of a frank that it removed all scruples at writing a short letter, &#8211; for a few lines I was resolved
                    upon writing to you only to say that you promised to see us this summer, that we have not forgotten the promise, &amp; are looking
                    forward with great pleasure to its performance.</p>

                        become estranged in October 1810. The quarrel was prompted by Basil Montagu, who travelled with Coleridge from the Lakes to
                        London, and told him that Wordsworth had called him a &#8216;rotten drunkard&#8217; and an &#8216;ABSOLUTE NUISANCE&#8217;. For a detailed account see
                        E. L. Griggs (ed.), <title>Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</title>, 6 vols (1956&#8211;1971), III, p. 389.</note> My
                    own opinion which you may perhaps like to know upon this provoking business is, that <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">Montague</ref> has acted with a degree of folly which would be absolutely incredible in any other person; &#8211; that <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">W.</ref> is no otherwise blameable than in having said any thing to such a man which he
                    would have felt any dislike to seeing in the Morning Post, that I do not wonder at <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C&#8217;s</ref> resentment, that I heartily wish the business would be made up, but very much fear that it never will.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coleridge and Wordsworth were largely reconciled in spring 1812 thanks to the mediation of <ref target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Henry Crabb Robinson</ref>.</note>
