        <p>Wordsworth Trust,WL MS A Southey.  Previously  published: Kenneth Curry (ed.), New
                            Letters of Robert Southey, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), II, pp. 32&#8211;34 [text in Curry taken from a copy of
                        the MS made by Ernest de Selincourt].Dating note: Curry dates [April 1812] claiming that this is &#8216;one move in the final
                        complicated efforts&#8217; of friends of Coleridge and Wordsworth&#8217;s to reconcile them. The reconcilation was achieved in mid May
                        1812. Compare with Robert Southey to Mary Matilda Betham, 25 April 1812, Letter 2083, which deals with the same
                        subject.</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> It is needless to say that this provoking business of <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">Montagues</ref> &amp;
                    the way in which it is resented vexes me greatly.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> This letter deals with the quarrel
                        between Wordsworth and Coleridge, which had started in October 1810 when Montagu told Coleridge he had been authorised by
                        Wordsworth to say that his friends had &#8216;no hope&#8217; for him.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> avoided the subject when he was in my company, as he does every
                    unpleasant subject,&#8212;nor was it mentioned before me till about an hour before his departure.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coleridge had left Keswick in March 1812. He was never to return.</note> I then <del>contradicted more</del> denied most
                    peremptorily that you had ever commissioned <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">M.</ref> to <del>speak</del> say you had no
                    hopes of him&#8212;on your own word then&#8212;as I had before done at Richmond, as positively, on the common sense of the thing. But he lays
                    little stress upon this,&#8212;the gravamen is that all his habits should have been made the subject of complaint to <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">M.</ref> &amp; especially that you should have said &#8216;in short he has been a perfect nuisance
                    in this house for more than twelvemonths&#8217;.&#8212;How he says can I ever feel towards a man when I know that he has felt this concerning
                    me?&#8212;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> From <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C&#8217;s</ref> manner I cannot but give full credit to his
                    representation of the conversation with <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">M.</ref> I never saw him so much affected as when
                    he entered into the detail at Richmond. This however <del>he</del> only shows that <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">M.</ref>
                    has acted just as he did to Lady Rush<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lady Laura Rush (d. 1822), wife of Sir William
                        Beaumaris Rush (d. 1833). Their eldest daughter, also named Laura (d. 1806), had married Basil Montagu in 1801, and died in
                        childbirth.</note> &amp; ought to make no difference in any persons opinion respecting him. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> thinks of him with too much
                    contempt to feel any anger but he has taken a mortal dislike to <ref target="people.html#MontaguAnna">his wife</ref> from a
                    variety of circumstances all too much like tea-table talk to be repeated, &amp; of that kind that two persons differently disposed
                    might have seen them with different eyes &amp; heard them with different ears the things themselves being the same.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My own feeling is that it is absurd to suppose a man is not fully justified in <del>saying</del> speaking <hi rend="ital">to</hi> one friend <hi rend="ital">of</hi> another with perfect freedom upon every part of his conduct &amp; every
                    thing relating to him, except such things as are confidential. But if we were to search the world thro we should hardly find two
                    men to whom this could be so unhappily applied,&#8212;when of the one &lt;almost&gt; every part of his conduct is matter of grief &amp;
                    shame, &amp; the other is a cracked pitcher, spoiled in the making, &amp; treacherous because of the flaw.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you see <ref target="people.html#DeQuinceyThomas">De Quincey</ref> in London tell him I did not receive his note
                    till it was too late to answer it. I have a favour to ask of him,&#8212;which is that he would spare me his copy of Pyrard de Lavals
