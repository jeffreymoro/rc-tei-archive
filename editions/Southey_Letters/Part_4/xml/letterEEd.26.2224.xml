                        letter.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 14 January 1813, Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenb&#252;ttel (1768&#8211;1821;
                            <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of the Prince Regent, had written to her husband protesting about the restrictions
                        placed on her access to their daughter, Princess Charlotte Augusta (1796&#8211;1817; <term>DNB</term>). In early March a second
                        letter on the same subject was sent to the Speaker of the House of Commons. As it was unsigned its authorship was initially
                        questioned, though it was later attributed to Caroline. After debate, parliament agreed that it was the Regent&#8217;s right as a
                        father and ruler to be in charge of his daughter&#8217;s education; see <title>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</title>, 83 (April 1813), 361,
                        363&#8211;364, 373&#8211;376. Brougham was her legal adviser and did indeed draft these letters.</note> I suspected this, because it was
                    so exceedingly mischievous, so exceedingly imprudent &amp; so impudently hypocritical. The real case &lt;as&gt; I understood some
                    time ago why it was wished that the Princess of Wales should not be much with her daughter, was because she had compleatly given
                    herself up to a party, &amp; was raving about the Catholic question, &#8211; upon which subject she was using all her endeavours to
                    prejudice the child. With regard to the Delicate Investigation<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> A commission of enquiry
                        set up in 1806 to investigate claims that Caroline was the mother of an illegitimate child (William Austen). Although these
                        were found to be false, her conduct was censured.</note> I suppose the simple truth is that the Princess is a coarse woman who
                    brought over with her the manners of a German Court. But probably nothing can be proved against her more offensive to that decorum
                    which she of all women ought, for her own sake &amp; that of the country to preserve, than her publicly visiting &amp; that too at
