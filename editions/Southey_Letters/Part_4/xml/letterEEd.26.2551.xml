                        12 (January 1815), 317&#8211;368. This issue of the <title>Quarterly</title> was published on 23 March 1815.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I received duly your letter respecting the life of <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellington</ref>, &amp; the parcel soon followed it. The
                    materials are good, &amp; I have no reason to distrust my own skill in putting them together.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey reviewed George Elliott (dates

                    showing that I bear <del>it</del> &lt;in&gt; mind both what is due to those of whom I am speaking, &amp; to myself. &#8211; For my great work, I have access to <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">Marquis Wellesley</ref> thro <ref target="people.html#Hatherton">his son-in-law M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Littleton</ref>, with

                    materials are in such readiness, &amp; such progress made, that when the introductory chapter shall be fairly put together, I care not how soon it goes to press. This first chapter
                    gives a moral &amp; political view of the Peninsula, &amp; of the two great nations who were about to fight their battles <del>there</del> upon that ground. This of course requires
                    much longer elaboration than any other part of the work, &#8211; but great part of it is done, &amp; to my own satisfaction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This Egyptian expedition will make an article of the best kind. I scarcely know any subject so picturesque<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jacques

                        (1764&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (July 1815), 309&#8211;340. Campbell was a Congregationalist minister and a director of the London Missionary
                        Society, but Southey tended to refer to all evangelicals as &#8216;Methodists&#8217;.</note> Most probably Barrow will take him in hand, &amp; then he will fare but scurvily, &#8211; for Barrow
                    who writes so admirably as a traveller himself, is not tolerant enough toward his inferiors. I can however steer clear of him by making a history of the Mission in South Africa, &#8211;
                    of which indeed the beginning has lain several years in my desk.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> This was not written.</note>
