                    subject, &amp; give wings to his work? &#8211; I should like to enlarge a little upon the subject of Literary Property, on which he has
                    touched, in my opinion, with proper feeling. Certainly I am a party concerned, &#8211; I should like to say something upon the absurd
                    purposes of the Literary Fund<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Royal Literary Fund, a benevolent society for authors,
                        set up in 1790.</note>
          <del>xxx</del> with its despicable ostentation of patronage; &amp; to build a sort of National Academy in the air, in the hope
                    that <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> might one day lay its foundations in a more solid manner. &#8211; And I could say
                    something on the other side of the picture, showing, that altho literature in almost all cases is the worst trade to which a man
                    can possibly betake himself, it is the best &amp; wisest of all pursuits for those whose provision is already made, &amp; of all
                    amusements for those who have leisure to amuse themselves. It has long been my intention to leave behind me my own Memoirs, as a
                    post obit for my family, &#8211; a wise intention no doubt &amp; one which it is not very prudent to procrastinate.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not write his &#8216;Memoirs&#8217;.</note> Should this ever be compleated it would <del>be
                        a</del> exhibit a case directly in contrast to D&#8217;Israelis view of the subject. I chose literature for my own profession, &#8211;
                    with every advantage of education it is true, but under more disadvantages perhaps of every other kind than any of the persons in
                    his catalogue. I have never regretted the choice. The usual censure ridicule &amp; even calumnies which it has drawn upon me never
                    gave me a moments pain, &#8211; but on the other hand literature has given me friends among the best &amp; wisest &amp; most celebrated
                    of my contemporaries it has given me distinction, &#8211; if I live twenty years longer I do not doubt that it will give me fortune,
                    &amp; if it pleases God to take me before my family are provided for, I doubt as little that in my name<del>s</del> &amp; in my
                    works they will find a provision.</p>
