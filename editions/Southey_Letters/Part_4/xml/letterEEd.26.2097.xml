        <p rend="indent1"> I have laid the first stone of an article<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A review of <title>Biographie Moderne: Lives of Remarkable
                     Characters who have Distinguished themselves from the Commencement of the
                     French Revolution to the Present Time</title> (1811), <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 7 (June 1812), 412&#8211;438.</note> for our next number upon the
               French Revolution, a subject most mournfully well-timed. The direful state of the
               populace which this late deplorable event<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                  Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, was assassinated on 11 May 1812.</note> has
               disclosed, tho it may have surprized me less than it has done most people, has
               alarmed me more deeply, because I have long distinctly seen the causes which were at
               work to produce it. The counteracting causes on which my hopes were founded have not
               kept pace with them. At this moment nothing but the army preserves us from the most
               dreadful of all imaginable calamities, &#8211; an insurrection of the poor against the
               rich, &#8211; &amp; <del>whether</del> how long the army may be depended upon is a question
               which I scarcely dare ask myself. Of this I feel certain, that unless the most
               vigorous measures be speedily taken against those <del>x</del> who by their speeches
               &amp; writings are instigating the mob to rebellion, &#8211; it will be too late, &amp;
               they who may survive the coming horrors, will see that the abuse of liberty is
               uniformly &amp; inevitably punished by the loss of liberty. &#8211; The danger, I will show
               in the Quarterly, &#8211; but I believe the best means of stirring up the public mind is
               thro the newspapers, &amp; there I shall not fear to recommend measures, which would
                  <del>bring an</del> raise an outcry against the review.</p>
