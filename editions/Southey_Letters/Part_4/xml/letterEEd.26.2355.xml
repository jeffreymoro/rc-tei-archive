        <p rend="indent1"> When my Carmen comes to you in its hot pressed state you will be pleased in the first instance to scratch out the
                    word <hi rend="ital">Triumphale</hi>, &amp; substitute for <del>eit</del> it either <hi rend="ital">Castratum</hi>, or <hi rend="ital">Damnatum</hi>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s first Laureate poem, <title>Carmen
                            Triumphale</title>. Five stanzas were considered by Croker and Rickman to be inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and
                        deleted them from the version published as <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He
                        incorporated the deleted stanzas into an &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte&#8217;, published in the
                            <title>Courier</title>, 3 February 1814.</note> &#8211; whichever you like best; &#8211; <del>&amp; then</del> in the second place
                    please to efface the words Robert Southey, that the line in which &lt;so little to their credit&gt; they are <del>unworthily</del>
                    introduced, may run thus by &#8216;Squire Poet-Laureat&#8217;, &amp; in the third place, <del>slit</del> &lt;separate&gt; the leaves by

        <p rend="indent1"> I believe if your letter had come sooner I should have followed my own inclination, &#8211; it came only in time to make
                    me doubt whether I had not unnecessarily given <del>away</del> way to a needless scruple. All would have been well if I had at
                    first desired you to take <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> opinion upon the temper of the verses. <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> has written me three sheets of criticism good &amp; bad; &#8211; he advised the

                        of exploration, author and contributor to the <title>Quarterly Review</title>. He worked with Croker at the Admiralty, where
                        he was Second Secretary 1804&#8211;1806, 1807&#8211;1845.</note> upon the case, &#8211; you may guess the result, &#8211; it is no wonder that an
                    attempt to cut <del>down</del> a good base voice <del>so as to make it</del> into a treble<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        i.e. to castrate the poem.</note> should spoil it in the operation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My <del>sole consolation is</del> comfort is that the castrations <del>will</del> with a little additional trouble
                    will make a good ode by themselves.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the notes you will &lt;see&gt; one, or two, choice passages from the Edinburgh Review I have <del>them</del> him
