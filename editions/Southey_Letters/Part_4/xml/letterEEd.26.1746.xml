                    in this respect, that it has not the slightest foundation in truth. It not only <hi rend="ital">is</hi> not true, but could not by

                    Robert Allen poor fellow, by letter from Bristol. They must be much at a loss for recollections of me, to invent so clumsy a
                        <del>story</del> tale. As for beating people it has never been my habit on any occasion. The only approximation to a quarrel

                    metaphysical conversation which he heard me carry on with somebody else, reported it about that I &lt;talked blasphemy, &amp;&gt;
                    avowd myself an Atheist. &#8211; Rogers who had a great regard for me came to tell me this, his Welsh blood boiling with indignation,
                    &amp; luckily we met Freke almost directly. After a lecture which <del>xxxx</del> my Gentleman most probably will remember as long
                    as he lives upon the fitness of understanding &lt;another persons&gt; opinions, before he ventured to represent them. I concluded
                    by first requiring him to go &amp; contradict what he had said, &amp; then Sir, said I, I have to desire that in future you will

                    that his opinions, or more accurately speaking, his professions are altered. As for his political notions, the main difference is
                    not in the end &amp; aim of them, but in the way of coming to those conclusions. In the conclusions themselves he will be found to

                    did ten years ago is certain. he rambles now as much in his writings as in his conversation, &#8211; beginning at Dan &amp; wandering on
