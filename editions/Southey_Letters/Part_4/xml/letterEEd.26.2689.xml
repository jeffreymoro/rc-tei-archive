          <salute>My dear Koster,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter gives me the greatest pleasure, far greater than if it had told me of the accomplishment of your
                    military schemes. In that case a secret upbraiding would have accompanied you thro life, for no man ever yet sacrificed his duty
                    to his inclinations without paying the penalty of repentance, unless his nature were compleatly brutalized and perverted. I am
                    sure you will be a happier man than if you wore a red coat, I think you will be both a wiser and a better one. You will have
                    enough leisure, and you know how to employ it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If your journal<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Koster&#8217;s Journal was the basis of his <title>Travels in
                            Brazil</title> (1816).</note> had arrived at any other time six hours would not have elapsed before I should have read it
                    with avidity. It came on Christmas Day when we had a house full of company, for the Wordsworths<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">William Wordsworth</ref> and his family.</note> and <ref target="people.html#PembertonSophia">Mrs. Lloyd</ref> and Miss Alne<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Miss Alne (dates
                        unknown) was a close friend of Sophia Lloyd in the Lake District.</note> made their appearance among us most unexpectedly. The
                    next day came my three tea chests from London, and I have not yet stowed away their contents, nor had my room recovered from the
                    litter into which it has been thrown. I have read about half your journal with very great pleasure, more than is to be ascribed to
                    the deep interest which I naturally take in the subject. I think it very probable, more than probable that you might make it into
                    a book which could be generally interesting, but upon this subject I will write to you fully when I have finished that portion
                    which you have sent me. The only objection to publication arises from the necessity of suppressing anything which reflects upon
                    the personal character of individuals, or could give them pain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We reached home just in time before the snow began. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>
                    appeared to recover strength and spirits as she drew nearer the mountains, and her native air and usual habits of life have
                    produced all the amendment we could expect or wish. We found all well, and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>
                    had gone on as diligently with his German testament<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A German translation of the New

        <p rend="indent1"> Two packages of my books have reached London. The one <ref target="people.html#VardonMrs">Mrs. Vardon</ref> tells
                    me is from Ghent, and the other has the Acta Sanctorum.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey thought he had bought a
                        complete set of the <title>Acta Sanctorum</title> but received instead the 6 volume edition of 1783&#8211;1794, no. 152 in the sale
                        catalogue of his library. He acquired the 52 volume edition, no. 207 in the sale catalogue of his library, in 1818.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#VardonMr">Mr. V.</ref> having inspected them. I wish I were quite certain that he had not been mistaken
                    in this, but I can hardly think that the Acta Sanctorum (52 folios of large Size) could be contained in the same package with my
                    other purchases from Ver Beyst,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean-Baptiste Ver Beyst (1770&#8211;1849) was a famous
                        bookseller in Brussels whom Southey had dealt with on his tour to the Netherlands in autumn 1815.</note> which amounts to
                    above 100 volumes, many of them of large size. Another circumstance which makes me doubt is that Verbeyst was to have drawn on me
                    for payment for this work (500 francs) and I have received no notice of the bill. Be this as it may. I suppose the books are at

                    your maps, and whatever else of yours may be in the package. Concerning the third package, I have requested <ref target="people.html#VardonMr">Mr. V</ref>. would write to Mr. Werth.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Engelbert Werth

        <p rend="indent1"> There is an impudent interpolation in the last Quarterly,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s review
                        of a number of books on Wellington, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (July 1815), 448&#8211;526. He particularly objected to the
                        interpolation on p. 476, which defended the Convention of Cintra (1808) as &#8216;giving a presage of the extraordinary military
                        foresight of Wellington&#8217;. For the fullest account of events, Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 15 December 1815, Letter
                        2682.</note> offering a shallow vindication of the Convention of Cintra, which I have resented as it deserves. It occurs in
                    those sheets which I did not see before the number was published, and for this I take some blame to myself, especially as the
                    circumstances which interested me so warmly in the latter part of the article, might have given me cause for jealousy respecting
                    the beginning. My comfort is that the passage must appear like an interpolation from its inconsistency to every thinking reader;
                    and that at no very distant time. I shall have the satisfaction of exposing its fallacy when I write the history of that
                    Convention and stigmatize it as it deserves.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> In Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular
