                        Gonne.</note> I have endeavoured, not very successfully, to express what I recollect in myself &amp; have observed in others,
                    &#8211; that men suffer themselves to form a purpose before they acknowledge it to themselves. This seems to be your case, &#8211; &amp; I
                    have nothing more to say, except to wish that you may have <del>as</del> little anxiety in the pursuit, &amp; all happiness in the
                    attainment. <del>Except</del> &lt;Were it not&gt; for the double danger of health &#8211; (consumption being so certainly in the family)
                    &#8211; every thing is as I should wish it. For we were born Sir Harry, you &amp; I, to make our fortunes &amp; not to have them thrown
                    in our way. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The latter books have not been written more rapidly or carelessly than the former, &#8211; the sight of the original Mss
                    would convince you of this, &#8211; from the commencement the day when every portion was written has been set down, &#8211; &amp; the whole is
                    so full of corrections &amp;c &#8211; as to be nearly if not wholly illegible to any person except myself. As for changing the name of
                        Whitefoot<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The name Southey originally gave to a faithful dog in MS drafts of
                            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). He later changed it to Theron (after one of Actaeon&#8217;s hound&#8217;s in
                        Ovid&#8217;s <title>Metamorphoses</title>) and reduced the dog&#8217;s role in the poem; for the significance of this see Diego Saglia, &#8216;A
                        Siege, a Dog, and Too Many Women: Refiguring the Epic in <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title>&#8217;,
                            <title>Romanticism</title> 17.1 (2011), 52&#8211;62.</note> I have not the slightest objection so to do, if any body will give
                    me one that they like better. But in the first place I never knew the name of a Spanish dog in my life, &amp; in the next
                    &lt;the&gt; Spanish &lt;language&gt; was not <del>of</del> in existence in Rodericks days. for example, he called himself Ruderic
                    &amp; not Rodrigo. Of the Wise &#8211; Gothic of that age I do not know that any specimen is to be found. So that if I <del>would</del>
                    &lt;wished to&gt; translate a canine name I cannot. &#8211; I might indeed pick out one from the hunt of Act&#230;on, &#8211; &amp; suppose the
                    Romans had left it there.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Just now I am called off from the poem by a piece of P&#279;&#279;llery. In order, like a good boy, to have my exercise ready
                    in time, I have begun upon the hopeful subject of the Princess&#8217;s marriage.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey, as
                        Poet Laureate, was expected to write on the forthcoming marriage of the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince

                        the Hereditary Prince of Orange, William (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849), the husband selected for her by her
                        father and his advisers. Southey started the required poem (<title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>) but in
                        the event it was not needed as the engagement was broken off in June 1814. The <title>Lay</title> was recycled in 1816 to
                        celebrate Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>).</note> The measure is the six lined

                        since 1808. On 11 December 1813 he signed the Treaty of Valencay with the French government. Under its terms, the French
                        agreed to release Ferdinand (though this did not happen until 24 March 1814), and both sides agreed to an armistice, which did
                        not occur. The Cortes elected in October 1813 refused to accept the Treaty or to recognise Ferdinand unless he agreed to
                        endorse the liberal Constitution of 1812.</note> I fear the Cortes will be felo-de-se &#8211; &amp; that their works will go before
