        <p rend="indent1"> You will be expecting to see me instead of one of my scrawling epistles, &#8211; &amp; in truth I am on the verge of departing, tho not sufficiently certain of my
                    movements as yet to say when the day will be. I finish my work tomorrow, &#8211; or perhaps to night &#8211; but I have not secured seats in the mail because there is a good hope of avoiding
                    the purgatory of that conveyance. <ref target="people.html#KosterHenry">Henry Koster</ref> is going with me, &#8211; not merely to town but to Waterloo. Now there is a certain D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stanger<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The physician Christopher Stanger (1759&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>). He was a member of a family that owned
                        estates near Keswick.</note> in this neighbourhood, tho unluckily not upon the spot, he is bound for London about this time, &amp; will I know be as glad to join me in a post
                    chaise, as we shall be to catch him. &#8211; He has been written to about it, &amp; his answer or his appearance is <del>hour</del> daily looked for. I think he will hasten his departure
                    a day or two to accommodate us, &amp; it would be folly not to delay ours as much to accommodate him. If you see the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Docstor</ref> tell him this &#8211; or say it to him by a note.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letters<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly Grosvenor Bedford&#8217;s record of his journey to the Continent in 1814&#8211;1815.</note> interested me much &#8211;

        <p rend="indent1"> I look to you for my supplier for the journey. My bank like that of the Sinner Saved (whose works in 20 volumes are on yonder table expecting judgement) is the Bank
                    of Faith,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The preacher and religious writer William Huntington (1745&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>), whose <title>God the Guardian of the Poor
                            and the Bank of Faith</title> (1785&#8211;1802), describes how Providence assisted his early preaching career by supplying him with food, clothing and all else he needed,
                        including (pp. 70&#8211;72) a pair of leather breeches. <title>The Works of the Reverend William Huntington</title> (1811) extended to 20 volumes. They were finally reviewed by
                        Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24 (January 1821), 462&#8211;510, where he condemned Huntington&#8217;s work as unparalleled &#8216;in the whole bibliotheca of knavery and
                        fanaticism&#8217; (482).</note> as you will know &amp; you are my Banker. Yet certainly I could not live without works also.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Can you guess what I look to with most satisfaction on this journey? &#8211; the probability of getting the Acta Sanctorum, &#8211; which of all imaginable acquisitions would to
                    me be the greatest.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was to meet with mixed success on his book-buying expedition in Belgium and France. For a while, he hoped he
                        had bought the complete set of the rare, 53 volume <title>Acta Sanctorum</title> (Brussels, 1643&#8211;1794), no. 207 in the sale catalogue of his library. In fact he received from
                        the bookseller a 6 volume edition of 1783&#8211;1794, no. 152 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I heartily hope you may join us, &#8211; you would even enjoy the second journey more than the first. For there would be the pleasure of recollection, &amp; comparisons
