        <p rend="indent1"> About an hour ago came a parcel to me from <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, containing among
                    other things an unfinished Commentary upon Trotters book.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor&#8217;s <title>Commentary on
                            Memoirs of Mr Fox</title>, which was ostensibly a response to John Bernard Trotter&#8217;s (1775&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>)
                        laudatory account of his erstwhile employer Charles James Fox. Although the
                            <title>Commentary</title> was printed, Murray eventually suppressed its publication, refusing to issue a book that
                        attacked the Tory government and was dedicated to James Madison (1751&#8211;1836), President of the United States 1809&#8211;1817, with
                        whom Britain was about to go to war.</note> &#8211; Aut Landor aut Diabolus.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Either Landor

                    even before I fell upon the passage respecting Spain<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly Landor&#8217;s account of what he

                            Character</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), pp. 181&#8211;182.</note> which proved that it was yours. &#8211; I could not
                    lie down this night with an easy conscience if I did not beseech you to suspend the publication till you have cancelled some
                    passages: <del>for</del> that attack upon Fellowes<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> In a tirade against &#8216;Reviewers and
                        magazine-men, the linkboys and scavengers of literature&#8217; Landor singled out Robert Fellowes (1770&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>):
                        &#8216;Of late years, if any one had paid any attention to such people [reviewers] &#8230; one would imagine &#8230; that Aristotle only kept a
                        box for Mr. Fellowes.// This reverent gentleman having settled religion to his mind, but unhappily &#8230; driven out from the
                        poets, is retaliating on them as their judge. He writes, or did write, for I know not whether the work survives his hand, in
                            <title>The Critical Review</title>; strange successor to the gentle, but high-minded Southey&#8217;, Landor, <title>Charles
                            James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 146. Landor&#8217;s dislike of
                        Fellowes had undoubtedly been fuelled by learning (from Southey) of the latter&#8217;s views on his poetry. Fellowes had observed in
                        a letter to Seward of 1803 that: &#8216;The author of Gebir &#8230; has lately made another attempt to convey the waters of Helicon by
                        leaden pipes, and many dark subterranean ways &#8230; having trod the dark profound of Gebir, I feel no inclination to begin another
                        journey, which promises so little pleasure, and probably where only a few occasional flashes will enlighten the road&#8217;,
