          <salute>My dear Sir, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> It was no little mortification to me on my arrival in town to learn that you had left it, though indeed, from the
                    long delay of my journey, it was reasonable to expect that this would be the case. Had I however been certain of this, and
                    received your friendly invitation before my departure from home, it would have been easy for us to have seen you at Coleorton, &#8211; a
                    pleasure which on our return was not within our reach. On the way up we were so near as Nottingham, where we passed two or three
                    days. Our way home was by <ref target="places.html#Llanthony">Llanthony Abbey</ref>, Ludlow, Llangedwyn, and Llangollen,
                    where we passed a day very pleasantly with <ref target="people.html#LlangollenLadies">the ladies</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> was the last person whom I saw in the neighbourhood of London. He
                    told me at parting that he should be at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> before me. Here, however, I am, and there
                    are no tidings of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>. I found him in better health than usual, and,
                    better still, in better habits; and while I see him so well employed as he has lately been in the <title>Courier</title>, I shall
                    not urge him to leave town. Well employed must be said rather in reference to his no-employment than to the manner in which such
                    talents ought to be directed. The way in which they would be most beneficial would be if he held a confidential situation with
                    some man in power, either at home or abroad. I do not know that man in the world whose wisdom would then appear so practical.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been fortunate enough at last to obtain <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother&#8217;s</ref> promotion to
                    the rank of commander.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Herbert Hill, 12 May 1811 (Letter 1921), and Southey
                        to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 4 August [1811] (Letter 1943).</note> It was done for me in a very flattering manner by <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Mr. Percival</ref>, through the intervention of his late secretary, <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Mr. Herries</ref>, at present Commissary-General, a very able as well as excellent
                    man, with whom I have been acquainted many years. The promotion, which it has given me the greatest pleasure to have obtained, I
                    mention because I feel assured, from the kindness with which you formerly endeavoured to obtain it for me, that you will rejoice
                    to hear we have now been more successful.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My literary concerns, though upon the whole more prosperous than they have heretofore been, afford a curious proof
                    of the humour of the times, I am best paid for what is worth least; and if I consulted merely my own interest, should leave
                    nothing for posterity, but employ myself wholly in writing such desultory essays as come within the limits of a review, and
                    therefore do not trespass too much upon the leisure of a modern reader. For the last two years my chief and indeed favourite
                    employment has been writing the annals of these most interesting times for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810)<title> and Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>
                        (1811).</note> Those of 1809 happen to exceed those of the preceding year considerably in bulk, because the events are far
                    more numerous. Nevertheless the public, who were well pleased with the length of the first volume, complain grievously because the
                    second is longer, and <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">the booksellers</ref> represent this to me as a serious evil.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ballantyne was concerned enough about the length of the historical section to insist that
                        Southey explained himself to the readers in a prefatory note; see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
                         [v]&#8211;vi.</note> It is needless to say that, should the work continue, these representations will have no effect whatever
                    upon me. In a history of this kind it is the business of the annalist not so much to regard the amusement of his own age as the
                    information of those who are to come after him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am advancing with a poem in blank verse,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> which I wish were finished, because its whole spirit is
                    applicable to the present state of Spain, and it might have some effect in making others feel as I do upon that subject.</p>
