        <p rend="indent1"> Since last you heard from me I have been suffering both grief &amp; anxiety. I have lost <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">one of my oldest, nearest &amp; dearest friends</ref>, whose death has thrown a gloom over
                    the recollections of half my life,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Danvers had died on 3 May 1814.</note> &#8211; &amp; here is
                    household illness enough to disquiet me very seriously on that score. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> has been
                    out of health &amp; spirits, with a little lurking fever for these three months past, &amp; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara Coleridge</ref> is in a most alarming state. She is dropsical, &amp;
                        <del>so is</del> the kidney <del>is</del> so relaxed that her urine is deeply discoloured with blood. <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> expects to set her up, &amp; has certainly reduced the swelling, &#8211; but I very
                    much fear that she has death in her system as well as in her face. But I began to write to you partly for the sake of escaping
                    from these thoughts.</p>

                    different turn, &#8211; &amp; I think you are as entirely wrong about the rest; the structure of the verse is that of the Miltonic

                        lines.</note> It is not however worth defending, &#8211; perhaps I <del>may</del> could write another as easily as I could alter
                    this, &amp; perhaps I may throw it behind the fire, &amp; let the book go into the world without any such introduction. It is very
                    possible that such a thing may in some degree be expected, &#8211; but I have no stomach for gracious permissions &amp; most devoteds
                    most obedients &amp;c, &amp; these can only be escaped by writing in verse. &#8211; Whenever my history appears it is my full intention
