        <p rend="indent1"> This is the Age of Collectors, &#8211; &amp; on my way down having plenty of leisure for idle thought, I determined to
                    form a Collection in which I think you will take an interest in assisting me. It will be an interesting thing <del>for</del> to
                        <del>form a collection of</del> &lt;get together&gt; all the reviews which have been written upon my operas, &#8211; to arrange them
                    chronologically, &amp; preface a blank leaf before each wherein <del>xxxxxxx</del> the name &amp; date of the journal in which it
                    appeared &lt;may be written&gt;, &amp; when I can learn it the name of the author. The collection will make a curious harmony of
                    criticisms, &#8211; &amp; will supply good &amp; appropriate matter for the prolegomena to my collected works, &#8211; if it should ever be
                    your office to edite them, as in case of survivorship I trust it will.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey published a
                        collected edition of his poems in 1837&#8211;1838. A collected edition of his prose never appeared. Bedford did not outlive Southey,
                        dying in 1839.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It must be done by picking up odd numbers, which will diminish the expence, &amp; to felicitate the search we must
                    make out, from compleat sets when they come in our way, a list of such numbers as contain the articles we want. They may then be
                    sought for as opportunity occurs in catalogues or in booksellers shops. <del>But</del> The merit of a collection consists in the
                    difficulty of forming it, &#8211; &amp; in this case the difficulty will be greater than you may perhaps at first imagine, many reviews
                    having <del>been b</del> appeared &amp; vanished since I became an author. Of <del>such</del> defunct journals the following occur

        <p rend="indent1"> Herewith you have my memorial, with a blank address which you may fill up, as I know not how to do it. I have
                    received advice that part of my books are shipped for London, &amp; probably they have arrived by this time. The sooner therefore

                    application, even if they should not have the wisdom to grant it.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> A memorial to request
                        that the import duty on the books Southey had bought on his recent travels be waived or reduced; see Southey to Charles Watkin
