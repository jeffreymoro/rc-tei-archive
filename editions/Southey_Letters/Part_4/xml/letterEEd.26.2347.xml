                    making this first announcement from the author alone. &#8211; Of course I care for this no otherwise than as such an announcement may
                    give publicity to the design, &#8211; &amp; if there be any possible objection to it, however slight it may be it will overweigh any
                    desire I can have upon the subject.</p>

                    as much of England as she does of Germany, she will rank as high in the moral, but low in the intellectual scale. I could say much
