          <l rend="indent3"> Repaying the support they found, upheld</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The bank secure. Here bending to the stream</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The birch fantastic stretchd its rugged trunk</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Tall &amp; erect from whence as from a base</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Each like a tree its silver branches grew</l>

        <p rend="indent1"> So the curtain has fallen after a tragedy of five &amp; twenty years! In two respects the catastrophe is as it
                    should be. Buonapartes degradation is compleat, even his military reputation is lost, &amp; he is suffered to live more because he
                    may safely be despised than because of his Austrian marriage.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Napoleon had married
                        Marie-Louise of Austria (1791&#8211;1847) in March 1810.</note> And the French in baseness &amp; impudence have contrived to outdo
                    their former masterpieces in this kind. Amiable people, &#8211; they <del>are</del> have been rather the victims of the Tyrant than his
                    agents! It will pass current at Paris, &#8211; but I would advise Jean F. to <del>offer</del> &lt;trust&gt; himself with no better
                    security than such an excuse <del>could</del> &lt;can&gt; afford <del>him</del> among my friends the Portugueze, &#8211; nor in any part
                    of peninsula. Then the patriotism of the rascals, the Municipality can no longer reconcile it to their conscience to keep silence!
                    &#8211; Wretches! If Buonapartes last order concerning his good city of Paris had been executed, I could with little difficulty have
                    brought myself to believe that the powder could not have been more fitly expended.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> A
                        reference to the rumour that Napoleon had ordered Paris to be destroyed if it fell to the allies in March 1814.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> Your remark about the participles<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor had written to Southey: &#8216;In one
                        place you have written <hi rend="ital">forsook</hi> as the participle. Now I am very jealous of the participles. I would not
                        write &#8216;it was held,&#8217; but &#8216;it was holden:&#8217; although custom authorises both, and rather (in late years) had preferred the
                        former. I wish to see our language perfect in your works: it is very far from perfect in any other of our poets&#8217;; see John

                    where I have written incorrectly it has been virtue of a <del>liberty</del> &lt;privilege&gt; &#8211; which in spite of all precedent,
                    is <del>better</del> best honourd in the disuse. This book explains the scene of the final action, &#8211; which justifies a description
                    otherwise too diffuse.</p>
