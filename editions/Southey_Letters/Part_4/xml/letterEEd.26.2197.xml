          <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Many happy new years to you, and may those which are to come
                    prove more favourable to you in worldly concerns than those which are past! I
                    have been somewhat unwell this Christmas; first with a cold, then with a sudden
                    and unaccountable sickness, which, however, has not returned, and I now hope I
                    have been physicked into tolerable order. The young ones are going on well:
                    little <ref target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref> thrives, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">your god-daughter</ref> is
                    old enough to figure at a Christmas dance, and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> will very soon be perfect
                    in the regular Greek verb. A Testament is to come for him in my next parcel, and
                    we shall begin upon it as soon as it arrives. No child ever promised better,
                    morally and intellectually. He is very quick of comprehension, retentive,
                    observant, diligent, and as fond of a book and as impatient of idleness as I am.
                    Would that I were as well satisfied with his bodily health; but in spite of
                    activity and bodily hilarity, he is pale and puny: just that kind of child of
                    whom old women would say that he is too clever to live. Old women&#8217;s notions are
                    not often so well founded as this; and having this apprehension before my eyes,
                    the uncertainty of human happiness never comes home to my heart so deeply as
                    when I look at him. God&#8217;s will be done! I must sow the seed as carefully as if I
                    were sure that the harvest would ripen. My two others are the most perfect
                    contrast you ever saw. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>,
                    whom I call Queen Henry the Eighth, from her likeness to King Bluebeard,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry VIII (1491&#8211;1547; King of England
                        1509&#8211;1547; DNB), who had six wives (executing two of them) and who Southey
                        likens to the legendary French wife-murderer, Bluebeard, created by Charles
                        Perrault (1628&#8211;1703) in <title>Histoires ou Contes du Temps Pass&#233;</title>

                            <title>Jonah</title> 4: 6. However, the biblical parallel was not one
                        Southey chose to pursue too hard as Jonah&#8217;s gourd was short-lived,
                            <title>Jonah</title> 4: 6&#8211;8.</note> and is the very picture of robust
                    health; and little <ref target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> hardly seems
                    to grow at all, though perfectly well, &#8211; she is round as a mushroom-button. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, the bluff queen, is just as
                    grave as <ref target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> is garrulous; they are
                    inseparable play-fellows, and go about the house hand in hand. Shall I never
                    show you this little flock of mine? I have seen almost every one of my friends
                    here except you, than whom none would be more joyfully welcomed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall have two interesting chapters in this volume for 1811,
                    upon Sicily and S. America.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813),
                        395&#8211;437.</note> My Life of Nelson,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Life of Nelson</title> (1813). Southey was wrong, the
                            <title>Life</title> sold well and went into a second edition in
                        1814.</note> by a miscalculation, which lies between <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> and the printer,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Moyes (d. 1839), of Greville St,
                        Hatton Garden, London.</note> will appear in two volumes instead of one,
                    which will materially, beyond all doubt, injure the sale. <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has most probably ordered a
                    large impression, calculating upon its going off as a midshipman&#8217;s manual, which
                    design is thus prevented. If, however, this impression can pass off, I shall
                    have no fear of its answering his purpose when printed in a suitable form; for
                    though the subject was not of my own choice, and might be reasonably thought to
                    be out of my proper line, I have satisfied myself in the execution far more than
                    I could have expected to do. The second sheet of the second volume is now before
                    me. I have just finished the battle of Copenhagen,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Life of Nelson</title>, 2 vols (London, 1813),
                        II, pp. 90&#8211;153.</note> which makes an impressive narrative. Two chapters
                    more will complete it, and I hope to send you the book by the beginning of
                    March. My labour with it will be completed much before that time, probably in
                    ten days or a fortnight; and then the time which it now occupies will be devoted
                    to the <hi rend="ital">indigesta moles</hi> of Mr. Walpole&#8217;s papers.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Indigestible mass&#8217;. With May&#8217;s
                        encouragement, Southey was considering writing a life of the diplomat Robert
                        Walpole (1736&#8211;1810), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to
                        Portugal, 1771&#8211;1800. He did not do so.</note> I find the day too short for
                    the employment which it brings; however, if I cannot always get through what is
                    before me as soon as could be wished, in process of time I get through it all.
                    My poem<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of
                            the Goths</title> (1814).</note> comes on well; about 2700 lines are
                    written; the probable extent is 5000; but the last half is like going down hill,
                    &#8211; the difficulty is over, and your progress accelerates itself. The poem is of a
                    perfectly original character. What its success may be I cannot guess. </p>
