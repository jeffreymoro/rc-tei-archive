        <p rend="indent1"> Have you noticed some notable advertisement about Seilis, implying that he did not kill himself?<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 31 May 1810 Joseph Sellis, valet to Prince Ernest Augustus (1771&#8211;1851; <title>DNB</title>),
                        Duke of Cumberland, fifth son of George III and later King of Hanover 1837&#8211;1851, was found with his throat cut in the Duke&#8217;s
                        apartment at St James&#8217;s Palace. It was widely believed that the Duke had murdered Sellis to prevent him revealing scandalous
                        details about Cumberland&#8217;s private life &#8211; both incest and homosexuality were rumoured.</note> There is a damnable story about
                    this mystery, &#8211; which is believed &amp; very believable, &#8211; &amp; a still more damnable one invented for obvious purposes of
                    mischief. The key to this dark affair is said to be that Seilis (an <hi rend="ital">Italian</hi>) was <hi rend="ital">jealous</hi>
