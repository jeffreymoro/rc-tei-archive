                    which has hitherto been attached to the Table, as well as of its other advantages.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John
                        Ley (1733&#8211;1814), Deputy Clerk of the House of Commons, had died on 13 June 1814 after 47 years service. His death required a
                        rearrangement of offices that included Rickman&#8217;s promotion.</note>

The Reformers must now make terms with the old King, &amp; play off Carlos against Fernando.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles IV (1748&#8211;1819; King of Spain 1788&#8211;1808), who had abdicated on 19 March 1808, and

                        Ferdinand had suppressed the Constitution of 1812 on 4 May 1814 and had become absolute ruler of Spain.</note> The game would
                    then be in their favour. Meantime the colonies are left to themselves, &amp; cruelties &amp; excesses of every kind are laying
