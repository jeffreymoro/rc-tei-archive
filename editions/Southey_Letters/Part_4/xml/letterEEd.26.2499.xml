          <salute>My dear James,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am grieved to learn from <ref target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</ref> that you are distressing yourself about what I could
                    find in my heart to call these cursed examinations. There are few things of
                    which I am more thoroughly convinced, than that the system of feeding-up young
                    men like so many game cocks for a sort of intellectual <hi rend="ital">long-main</hi> is every way pernicious.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The comparison is between the educational system at
                        Cambridge, where White was an undergraduate, and the Long Main. The latter
                        was a famous week-long cock-fight that coincided with Newcastle races in the
                        last week of April or first week of May. Southey witnessed it during a visit
                        to Durham in 1810, with the intention of including it in his unexecuted
                        continuation to <title>Letters from England</title> (1807).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> University honours are like provincial tokens, not current beyond
                    the narrow limits of the district in which they are coined; and even where they
                    pass current they are not the only currency, nor the best. Doubtless there are
                    many men at Cambridge in high repute, who have taken no honours and gained no
                    prizes: and should you yourself stand for a fellowship or take pupils, you will
                    find the opinion of what you <hi rend="ital">might have done</hi>, will act as
                    well in your favour as if your acquirements had received the seal and stamp of
                    approbation in the Senate House. Content yourself with graduating among the
                    many; and remember that the first duty which you have to perform is that of
                    keeping yourself, as far as it can depend upon yourself, in sound health of body
                    and mind, both for your own sake and for the sake of those who are most dear to
                    you. If I were near you I would rid you of these blue devils. When I was about
                    eighteen I made Epictetus<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Stoic
                        philosopher, Epictetus (c. AD 60&#8211;after 100), author of the
                            <title>Encheiridion</title>.</note> literally my manual for some
                    twelvemonths, and by that wholesome course of stoicism counteracted the mischief
                    which I might else have incurred from a passionate admiration of Werter<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Johann von Goethe (1749&#8211;1832),
                            <title>Die Leiden des Jungen Werther</title> (1774).</note> and
                        Rousseau.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean Jacques Rousseau
                        (1712&#8211;1778), in particular his <title>Julie, ou la nouvelle Heloise</title>
                        (1761).</note> His tonics agreed with me; and if the old Grecian could know
                    how impassible I have ever since felt myself to the &#964;&#8048;
                    &#959;&#8016;&#967; &#941;&#966;&#8217; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957;,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;The things not in our power&#8217;; Epictetus
                        distinguishes between &#8216;things in our power&#8217; and &#8216;things not in our power&#8217;
                        and argues that we should concern ourselves only with the former.</note> he
                    would be well satisfied with the effect of his lessons. It is not your fault
                    that these university distinctions have a local and temporary value, but it is
                    your fault if you do not consider how local and how temporary that value is; and
                    if you suffer yourself to be agitated by any losses and fears concerning what is
                    worth so little. My dear James, in this matter, follow, in the strict
