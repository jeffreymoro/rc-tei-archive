                    1803 they existed at Breda &amp; at Antwerp – It is not likely that they should
                    have been abolished since that time, &amp; as they existed in those two cities,
                    – it is probable that thr[MS torn] other establishments existed also. I should
                    think that there would be a full account of their Institutes in Helyots ‘Ordres
