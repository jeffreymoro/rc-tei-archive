        <p rend="indent1"> In the Basque Roads business,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The opening paragraphs deal with the
                        controversy surrounding the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809. Although they achieved some success, the British fleet
                        failed to destroy the French navy completely. Captain Thomas Cochrane, later 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775&#8211;1860;
                            <title>DNB</title>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of the battle, accused his commanding
                        officer, the evangelical Admiral James Gambier, Baron Gambier (1756&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), of being reluctant to pursue
                        the attack and thus achieve a complete victory. Cochrane was also an MP with a reputation for exposing abuses of office, and,
                        in the weeks after the battle, he pursued his campaign against Gambier via parliamentary speeches. Gambier demanded a
                        court-martial at which he was exonerated and, by implication, Cochrane was convicted of libelling a superior officer. Whilst
                        Gambier received public thanks from parliament for his actions in the battle, Cochrane was not permitted to rejoin his ship
                        for a few months. When he received new orders to serve in the Mediterranean, Cochrane refused and went on half-pay, devoting
                        his time to exposing abuses in the Admiralty. For Southey&#8217;s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1
                        (1811), 364&#8211;379.</note> &#8211; when a good deal [MS obscured]beers defence turns upon the state of the batteries on Isle d Aix
                    would it not have been a good <del>x</del> way to have begun by taking the Isle &amp; so securing the passage? &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Tell me also another thing &#8211; where did the L&#8217;Orient squadron under Tronde<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Captain Tronde of the French Navy.</note> go when this unlucky Brest fleet liberated it, &#8211; for this was boasted of by the

            <title>Le Moniteur Universel</title> (1789&#8211;1868), the French official newspaper.</note> It was the squadron seen by the

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Tell me too what you believe the rise of the tide to be in the B. Roads &#8211; for on this point Cochrane &amp; Gambiers
                    witnesses differ a good deal. &#8211; the former stating it at about 10 or 12 feet &#8211; The latter speaking only of spring tides which they
                    state at 21. &#8211; I wish the Trial had arrived when you were here, for I do not like writing the account <del>xx</del> without you.
                    If you are at Durham when it is in the press (which I suppose you will) I will have a proof sent to you. It will be printed within
                    a fortnight probably.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Henceforth I have undertaken the scissars part of the business &#8211; that is the newspaper selections forming what is
                    called the Chronicle.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had been corresponding with Robert Lundie, who had compiled

                        Lundie, 14 October 1810 (Letter 1817), and 19 May 1811 (Letter 1925).</note> You remember that I had two unreasonable letters
                    from the <del>Home D</del> to show this was [MS obscured] for 1809. He however has put [MS obscured] much of which the whole
                    essence has necessarily been extracted by me in the Annals, that it is just as ill managed this year as the last. So I have
                    consented to do it for the future. The trouble in fact is none, &#8211; merely cutting out &amp; dating at the time for the convenience
                    of arrangement. &#8211; The pay three guineas per sheet &#8211; amounting to about 50 guineas on the fair average. Now Tom comes the beauty of
                    this arrangement. Such a job of course is best done regularly as the papers come in &#8211; but where was I to put the scraps that they
                    might be safely &amp; at the same time commodiously kept. I have had a box made for the nonce, &#8211; such a box Tom &#8211; O Tom such a
                    box!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Mawson<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Presumably a carpenter in Keswick.</note> made it. It is of yew,
                    the size of my desk &amp; opening like a desk &#8211; <del>xxxx</del> &lt;but&gt; when open <del>the part</del> &lt;it&gt; is flat &#8211; not
                        <del>xxxx xxx</del> an inclined plane. Then too it is yew, &amp; when you lift up the inner cover, as in a desk, one on each
                    side, are twelve partitions, for the twelve months, the breadth of a newspaper column, &amp; of reasonable length. Cellarage for
                    two years, &#8211; the one for the printing volume, the other <del>xx</del> &lt;for&gt; the current year. This is an invention of my
                    own, &#8211; &amp; a very ingenious invention it is. I regret that you &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Sarah</ref> are not
                    here to admire it, &amp; rejoice over it with me, &#8211; as I do her the justice to believe she would do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Being thus led to cut up the newspapers I have fallen upon the plan of <del>xx</del> cutting out all those parts
                    which are the materials for the Annals, &amp; pasting them in thin books, under proper arrangement. This will <del>be of</del>
                    much facilitate the composition &amp; save much time as <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> makes the books. Here
                    too I have <del>xx</del> introduced an invention worthy of a patent, or a gold medal. Some columns would occasionally occur that
                    could not be pasted down, &#8211; because the matter continued to the other side of the page. What then was to be done? Mark my
                    contrivance. I pasted into the blue book a slip of blank paper folded in three folds, the lower fold being fastened to the page.
                    On the <del>xxx</del> upper I pasted (this too <del>by</del> &lt;in&gt; a most ingenious manner) about 2 or 2 &#189; inches of
                    tape. The other end of this <del>xxx</del> tape (with like ingenuity) is secured to the top of the column, which then folds up to
                    the <del>shape</del> &lt;height&gt; of the page. And then when required the tape permits the column to be turned, &amp; read on
                    either side. An admirable contrivance, verily most excellent, &amp; invented wholly by me Robert Southey, Author of Kehama &amp;
                    the History of Brazil.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    1810.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In describing the above contrivance I forgot to explain wherefor the paper is in those folds, it is for the
                    purpose, by means of the middle fold of allowing play, like the elastic worn in bracers &#8211; lest by an incautious handling the tape
                    should be torn off. On the least pull the folds open, &amp; prevent this effectually.</p>
