                        1779), brother of Mary Matilda. Southey had been responsible for introducing Betham and Landor, see his letter to Mary Matilda
                        Betham, 30 October 1811, Letter 1974. Charles had rented one of Landor&#8217;s largest farms at Llanthony. Unfortunately, Landor was
                        not to share Southey&#8217;s opinion of his new tenant. Betham and Landor were soon in dispute over the rent and the use of the
                        land. The final straw was when Betham&#8217;s brother, Frederick (b. 1789/1790), dug up trees Landor had planted. Landor denounced
                        Frederick in a handbill that he personally posted up in Monmouth during the assizes. Betham sued for libel, Landor lost and
                        had to pay &#163;100 in damages. For Betham&#8217;s version of events, see Ernest Betham, <title>A House of Letters</title> (London,

                    little expecting that I should direct him where to find one, as I was of such an enquiry from her. He has probably to learn
