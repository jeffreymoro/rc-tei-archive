        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As for any such possibilities as those at which you hint, they are so very like impossibilities that I do not know
                    how to distinguish them. For in the first place you may be sure that if the men in power were ever so well disposed toward me,
                    they would think me &lt;already&gt; liberally <del>x</del> remunerated for my literary merits: &#8211; they cannot know that by gaining
                    a pension of &#163;200. I was actually a loser of 20 &#163; a year;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey received a government
                        pension in 1807 in place of the annual sum of &#163;160 that Wynn had granted him. But as the pension was taxed, Southey was
                        actually worse off.</note> they, if they thought about it at all, <del>n</del> would needs suppose that it was a clear
                    addition to my former means, &amp; that if I lived decently before, the addition would enable me to live with ease &amp; comfort.
                    Secondly they are never likely to think about me farther than as I may in pursuing my own principles happen to fall in with their
                    view of things. This happened in the Spanish war, &amp; would have happened in the Catholic question, if the Quarterly had not
                    been under <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Cannings</ref> influence.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. Southey
                        supported the Peninsular War of 1808&#8211;14 and opposed Catholic Emancipation &#8211; though Canning, who supported the latter cause,
                        prevented Southey&#8217;s views appearing in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> Thirdly I am neither enthusiast nor
                    hypocrite, but a man deeply &amp; habitually religious in <del>my</del> all my feelings, according to my own views of religion;
                    which views differ from those of the Church which I defend, in material points; &#8211; otherwise I should be in that church.
                        <del>But</del> I am too old to bring my own opinions upon this subject into discussion unnecessarily; but when I am conversing
                    with persons in whose zeal I can sympathize I take scrupulous care that they may <del>more</del> &lt;not&gt; misunderstand me,
                    &amp; imagine that because we agree in feeling we agree also in points of faith: But there is no occasion to do this in public. I
                    write religiously because I write as I feel. <hi rend="ital">Not</hi> being of the Church I hold the Church Establishment one of

                    by referring to a former letter, &#8211; except the <del>essential</del> indispensableness of rhyme, &#8211; which certainly never by any
