Perhaps I am the only person
                    who by this royal marriage shall get a good deal of trouble &amp; nothing else, – for if such things pay for the printing it is
                    the most they will do. There will be three parts, in six lined stanzas, – the first is an introduction, or proem as it may more
                    fitly be called &lt;that the antiquated word may&gt; to put the reader in tune; – the second will be a sort of allegorical vision;
                    – &amp; the third a high strain of exhortation to the young Princess touching her public duties, ending with a very sincere wish
                    that it may be long before she is called upon to exercise them. The proem is what I ought to have written for the C.

                    &amp; it passes neatly enough to the present subject by a first-view of its unfitness. You shall have it on its way to the press,
                    in time to comment upon it, – &amp; this will save me the trouble of making a second transcript. The whole extent may be some 300
                    lines, – hardly more.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The paragraph deals with the poem Southey, as Poet Laureate, was
                        expected to write on the forthcoming marriage of the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent’s</ref> only
                        child Charlotte Augusta (1796–1817; <title>DNB</title>). In December 1813 she had become engaged to the Hereditary Prince of
                        Orange, William (1792–1849; King of the Netherlands 1840–1849), the husband selected for her by her father and his advisers.
                        Southey started the required poem (<title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>), but in the event it was not
                        needed as the engagement was broken off in June 1814. The <title>Lay</title> was recycled in 1816 to celebrate Charlotte’s
                        marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790–1865; <title>DNB</title>).</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Am I not a dutiful<del> xxx</del> Pe-el to begin my task in such good time? but if Peace be made I shall be a very

                        managed to win a decisive victory at Laon (9–10 March 1814). Meanwhile, the Austrian Army of Bohemia was notably

                        Robert Townsend Farquhar (1776–1830; <title>DNB</title>) was a near contemporary of Southey’s at Westminster School. He had
                        entered the East India Company’s service in 1793. Farquhar served as governor and commander-in-chief in Mauritius from
                        1810–1817 and 1820–1823. During this time he attempted to abolish the local slave trade, and encouraged the development of
                        trade with Madagascar, Muscat, Mozambique and East Africa. He was created a Baronet in 1821.</note> He has seen <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref> at Madras, &amp; the manner in which he spoke of him convinced me that he
