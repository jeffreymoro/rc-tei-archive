                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>Biographical Memoirs of Lord Viscount Nelson, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.; with Observations,

                        Churchill (fl. 1800&#8211;1823), <title>The Life of Lord Viscount Nelson, Duke of Bront&#233;, &amp;c</title> (1808); and James Stanier

                            Nelson, K.B. from his Lordship&#8217;s Manuscripts</title> (1809), see <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 3 (February 1810),
                        218&#8211;262. It was later expanded into a full-scale <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813).</note>
          <del>Xx</del> I undertook to review Stanier Clarkes book with little predeliction for the subject; double pay was offered me for
                    it before hand, &amp; my own opinion when the article was sent off, <del>xxx</del> was that I never earned any money so easily, or
                    deserved it so little. The thing however was praised by <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>, &amp; some of those men
                    whose opinions have a current value, &amp; <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> then offered me a hundred guineas to
                    enlarge it into a volume which he could sell for a dollar,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Five shillings.</note> as a
                    midshipmans manual. By a blunder between him &amp; the Printer,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Moyes (d. 1839), of
                        Greville St, Hatton Garden, London.</note> in which I had no concern, they <hi rend="ital">cast</hi> or rather mis-cast the
                    ms. so that when <del>they</del> the printing was about half finished, they discovered that it would be too thick if
                        <del>xxx</del> the whole were comprized in one volume. I did not enlarge the latter part a single paragraph or sentence on
                    this account, &#8211; but perhaps if the division had not been determined on I should have felt it advisable to curtail it, &#8211; which
                    would have been the worse for the book, because it would have injured its proportions. <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has sent me the sum originally agreed upon me, &amp; voluntarily engaged to make a similar payment when he
                    prints a second edition. This is handsome enough on his part, because I had no claim upon him; &#8211; &amp; I am well contented, tho
                    not overpaid. &#8211; We are at present planning a work of great extent, of which you shall hear more as soon as it assumes any thing
                    like a substantial form.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly Southey and Murray&#8217;s plan for &#8216;A View of the World&#8217;;

                    &amp; I have a very great &lt;disposable&gt; capital of the requisite knowledge. </p>

                    well for her that she has new ties. Whether there be any other void or not, it is certainly not according to the order of nature
