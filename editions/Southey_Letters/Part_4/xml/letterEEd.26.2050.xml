                        for Wareham 1807–1812.</note> authority that the thing was to be done. The hint was given by the Edinburgh Review, &amp; very
                    well should I have been pleased if it had been taken, – the only unpleasant consequence would have been that my journey &lt;to
                    London&gt; would have taken place in January instead of November.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A long aside in the
                            <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 18 (August 1811), 420–423n, had questioned whether the ‘virulent personal abuse …
                        levelled at the most respectable members of the Legislature’ in the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> was in breach of
                        Parliamentary privilege and hinted that action against the author and publishers might be taken. In the event, the
                            <title>Edinburgh Review</title>’s suggestion was not acted on.</note> My intention was to have written &amp; read what,
                    with all due respect to the House of Commons, would have been a justificaiton of the freedom which as an Englishman &amp; an
                    Historian I had lawfully, as I conceived, – fearlessly &amp; conscienciously used. A very few sentences would have sufficed: I
                    should not have wanted friends in the House, &amp; the discussion would have given to the Register a greater sale <del>than</del>
                    &lt;at&gt; once than it will make by its own merits in ten years. The party knew this, &amp; they knew likewise that it would not
                    be very creditable to make an attack upon what &lt;may&gt; truly be called the freedom of the press, in the person of a man whose
                    principles were so clearly declared, <del>&amp; who xxxxx xxxx</del> whose name would have exercised the attention of the public
                    &amp; who would have been so well able to have vindicated himself. So they wisely gave up their intention but that the thing
                    should have been intended is a fine proof of their regard for the liberty of the press. I think it very likely that <ref target="people.html#FoxHenryRichard">Lord Holland</ref> prevented them from exposing themselves to the certain shame which must
                    have recoiled upon them. Many reasons would induce him to this; he feels as I do respecting Spain &amp; if his hopes are not as
                    strong as mine, it is, if I may be allowed to say so, because he is more of a professional politician, &amp; less of a philosopher
                    – because he confines <del>xx</del> his views to the tangible resources of a country, &amp; does not take national character into
                    the account.</p><p rend="indent1"> Of the various administrations which we have seen in Spain, &amp; of the majority of the higher orders I think
                    precisely as you do, but I cannot think that the sacrifices which the people have made are unavailing. Four years have now
                    elapsed, &amp; in spite of all this gross misconduct, of all these hopes, of all this treachery, – the country is unsubdued &amp;
                    the spirit of the people unbroken. No human foresight can see any termination to the struggle – but while <del>it</del> it is
                    prolonged whatever cause the chapter of incidents may produce, must be in favour of Spain. A war in the North <del>xx</del> may
                    operate as a diversion, the French Peninsular may at last be unable longer to bear this dreadful &amp; continual waste of men in a
                    contest not merely inglorious, but infamous; – &amp; the hand of God or of man may at any moment rid the world of Buonaparte. For
                    we must never forget that the enormous military power of France is held by the tenure of his single life. Look too at the relative
                    reputation of the British &amp; French troops compared to what <del>things were</del> &lt;it was&gt; before the struggle. – The
                    new regency has two men in it from whom I expect much, the Duke del Infantado<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pedro de
                        Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado (1768–1841), who had been in London on a mission to the British
                        government. He returned to Spain in 1812 and, although Wellington proposed he should be given command of the 4th Army, his
                        opponents vetoed this and he just had command of his own regiment.</note> – &amp; O’Donnell.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish commander Henry Joseph O’Donnell y Mareschal, 1st Count of la Bisbal (1789–1834), who had been
                        ennobled and raised to the rank of field-marshal for his exploits in the Catalonian campaign of 1810. From January 1812–March
                        1813 he was a member of the Council of Regency.</note> But even if the same wretched imbecillity should predominate in the
                    Spanish Government, while the people carry on their war by night &amp; day, they enable us to fight our battles in Portugal
                    instead of in Ireland: upon that ground we have baffled the greatest effort which &lt;the enemy&gt; could <del>be</del> made
                    against us, &amp; there we shall continue to baffle them. My hearts desire is that the Ministry would attempt more, – that they
                    would double <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Earl Wellingtons</ref> force, &amp; enable him to attack the
                    French wherever find them. A year of vigorous war would decide the contest.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#SpeddingJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Spedding</ref> I have no doubt would
