        <p rend="indent1"> I have something to say which your friends &amp; neighbours may find it useful to know. <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> whose estate at <ref target="places.html#Llanthony">Lanthony</ref> is
                    very extensive has several hundred acres to let at this time, for 20/ an acre, tythe free, the parochial rates extremely small,
                    &amp; he will grant leases of 21 years, stipulating an advance of 4/ per acre after the first ten. He has also many thousand acres
                    to let for inclosing for the same term, at 3/ for the first ten years, 6/ for the remainder. a rail road is now forming within a
                    mile of the estate, along a level to the market town (Abergavenny) lime &amp; marl are on the estate, &amp; underwood
                    &lt;sufficient&gt; for all the new inclosures will be given. He hopes to get a scientific tenant for about 1600 acres, to whom he
                    would give every encouragement, but who ought to have about 6, or 7000 &#163; at command. The Taylors<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Taylor (1772&#8211;1851), gentleman farmer, classicist and occasional contributor to the <title>Quarterly
                            Review</title>: father of Southey&#8217;s future friend, Sir Henry Taylor. Tom Southey was renting a house from Taylor. William
                        Taylor (dates unknown), George Taylor&#8217;s brother, was also a farmer with literary interests.</note> must so frequently know
                    persons who are in want of farms, that I know no person where a man who wants to have his estate improved can so properly make
                        <del>up</del> his wants known. They probably know the nature of that part of the country, that land is very low, because the
                    roads are bad, the farming slovenly, &amp; there is a want of large towns to take off the produce. <ref target="places.html#Llanthony">Lanthony</ref> however has fewer of these disadvantages than most other parts of the adjoining
                    country. It is nine miles from Abergavenny, which is the best market in that neighbourhood, &#8211; there is at present a good road of
                        <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor&#8217;s</ref> making, &amp; the rail road will be as good as a canal. As for the
                    soil it is the finest possible, a rich, deep, red mould.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We spent three nights &amp; two days with <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref>, sleeping in
                    one of the towers of the ruin, where he has three habitable rooms while his house is building. The house will be a good one, very
                    much resembling the front of that at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Helens, from the form of its roof. When we left them, they took us as
                    far as Hereford, &amp; from thence we reached the <ref target="people.html#BrowneWade">Brownes</ref> at Ludlow to supper. There we
                    past four days very pleasantly, in the course of which I saw Ludlow itself &amp; the Castle, which is of its kind the finest
                    &lt;thing&gt; I ever saw, &#8211; Croft Castle with its beautiful grounds, &#8211; the present proprietor a M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Davis<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Somerset Davies (c. 1755&#8211;1817).</note> showed them to us himself with the greatest
                    politeness. I saw this place with the more interest, because our mother&#8217;s grandmother,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Margaret Croft (dates unknown), Southey&#8217;s great-grandmother.</note> or her father, (I am not certain which) was born there.
                    Another day I walked to the Boney Well, which is enumerated in Guthries Grammar among the wonders of England.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Guthrie (1708?&#8211;1770; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A New Geographical, Historical and
                            Commercial Grammar</title>, 2 vols (London, 1771), I, p. 281, described the &#8216;remarkable fountain near Richard&#8217;s castle in
                        Herefordshire, commonly called Bone-well, which is generally full of small bones, like those of frogs or fish, though often
                        cleared out&#8217;. Southey at some point acquired an 1808 edition of Guthrie, no. 1256 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note>
