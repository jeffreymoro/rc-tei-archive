        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the half notes.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Half-banknotes &#8211; a secure way of sending
                        money in the post, by tearing banknotes in half and sending the two halves separately.</note> &#8211; They leave me till that cursed

        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your news, &amp; pray present my thanks to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rosenhagen<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Anthony Rosenhagen (1778&#8211;1854), Treasury official and friend of Landor. He was Private Secretary to the
                        Chancellor of the Exchequer, 1811&#8211;1815.</note> for the Gazette.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>London Gazette</title>, 11 November 1812.</note> It is very good as far as it goes, &#8211; &amp; it goes a good way; &#8211; but
                    it leads me to expect a murderous engagement of greater import, &amp; to fear that there will be a numerical superiority on the
                    &lt;part of the&gt; French. For Kutosows victory over Murat will not prevent the junction with Victor.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Gazette</title> reported that Mikhail Kutuzov (1745&#8211;1813), Marshal of the Russian Army, had
                        defeated Joachim Murat (1767&#8211;1815), King of Naples 1808&#8211;1815, and commander of the advance guard of the French army, in an
                        engagement outside Moscow on 18 October 1812. Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno (1764&#8211;1841) commanded the French forces in
                        Smolensk and was reported to be on his way to join the main French army.</note> Where is the Incarnate Devil<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bonaparte.</note> himself? &#8211; I do not believe the Swedish story that he was on his way home.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Nevertheless, it was true.</note> That Lord Cathcart<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Schaw Cathcart (1755&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>), army officer and politician. He had taken up the post of Ambassador
                        to the Russian court in July 1812. He was actively involved in Russian attempts to resist Bonaparte and sent regular
                        dispatches to the British government. Southey was being cutting about his despatch of 27 October 1812, which appeared in the
                            <title>London Gazette</title>, 11 November 1812.</note> seems to have a miserable talent for writing dispatches, &#8211;
                        <del>xxxx</del> he tells me that the enemy have left Moscow, &amp; does ever by any hint or collateral circumstances enable us
                    to guess where they are, nor in what direction they have marched. It is disgraceful to see such compositions.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The recapture of Polotsk<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Polotsk had been retaken by the Russians after the
                        battle of 18&#8211;20 October 1812.</note> seems the most consequential of these affairs. That of Moscow is a mere matter of
                    occupancy. But that the French should have left it after declaring their intention of wintering there, proves that they must be
                    dreadfully distressed.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The French army had left Moscow on 18&#8211;19 October 1812.</note> The
                    winter by their own account has begun &amp; they are in the field. Will they push for Petersburgh? 500 miles even for a French
                    army is at least three weeks march; &#8211; with roads so easily destroyed, &#8211; with winter for their ally, with such armies on foot,
                    &amp; with a nation in arms, the Russians must be dotards if they suffer him to reach it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I see no signal success, &#8211; no decisive advantages gained, &#8211; but certainly I see the right spirit, advantages in
                    detail, &amp; ground of hope. &amp; I cannot help thinking it every day more &amp; more likely that the Devil is at this time
                    stirring up the fire for the purpose of giving his Viceregent a warm reception, &amp; in expectation of his speedy arrival.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Gazette disappointed me at first. I hoped it had been a victory over Soult.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Nicolas Jean-de-Dieu Soult, 1st Duke of Dalmatia (1769&#8211;1851), overall commander of the French forces in Spain
