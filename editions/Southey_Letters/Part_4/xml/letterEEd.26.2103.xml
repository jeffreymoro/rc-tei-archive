        <p rend="indent1"> I write to you with an especial ill grace, because having left undone that which I ought to have done, I have now
                    to do that which of all things there is the most discomfort in doing.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> M. Dutens,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>), who had held the
                        post of Historiographer Royal. He died on 23 May 1812. Southey&#8217;s campaign for the post proved unsuccessful and it went to one
                        of his particular b&#234;tes noires, James Stanier Clarke (c. 1765&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>).</note> his Majesty&#8217;s historiographer,
                    is dead. This appointment I have long desired to hold. I am ambitious of the title, which would be honourable at home and useful
                    abroad; and the salary would enable me while in health to make some provision for my family, and secure me a moderate competence
                    in case of infirmities from which no man is secure. It is the gift of the <ref target="people.html#HertfordLord">Lord
                        Chamberlain</ref>. <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Mr. Percival</ref> honoured me with his good opinion, and I have
                    every reason to believe that I might have relied upon him, had he not been taken from us by this dreadful blow.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Perceval was assassinated on 11 May 1812.</note> God grant that it may not prove a fatal one to
                    the best interests of Great Britain and of Europe. But I confess that now for the first time I look forward almost without hope,
                    so many and so imminent are the perils which surround us.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At any other time I should have been sure of <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Mr. Canning&#8217;s</ref> good offices. It
                    is now so little likely that he can have a minute to bestow upon me, that I shall send the letter I have written to him to his
                    friend <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, to be delivered or thrown into the fire at his discretion. I have
                    written also to <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref>. The readiness with which he endeavoured to serve me
                    on a former occasion, and the friendliness with which he would have urged his application, &#8211; if I had not discovered its
                    unfitness, &#8211; made this as much a matter of due respect in the present case, as of self-interest. My friend <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Williams Wynn</ref> gave me the first information of the vacancy, and will omit no means
                    within his reach. And when I have requested you to befriend me, if it be in your power so to do, I shall have no omission for
                    which to reproach myself, in case the office should again be conferred upon a Frenchman, or any other person equally unfit.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It would be too much like castle-building to say with what pride and diligence I would discharge the duties which
                    ought to be annexed to the office. As much as possible I will now put it out of mind, and the state of affairs as well as my own
                    occupations give me matter enough for thought.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You know that I am no desponding politician. My disposition is naturally as joyous as a skylark in spring. I have
                    carried a boy&#8217;s heart into middle age; and besides this unbroken cheerfulness, my philosophy and my faith teach me always to look
                    on to the best. But I very much dread that we are on the brink of one of those ages of calamity, the good of which is not
                    perceived till generations have passed by. The sinking down of Jacobinism into the lowest class, who have been prepared for it by
                    the inevitable effects of the manufacturing system, is an evil of which I have long been aware, but its progress has been more
                    rapid than I apprehended, and the whole extent of the danger now stares us in the face. Nothing but the army at this moment
                    preserves us from a war of the poor against the rich, and God knows how long the army may be depended upon. The abuse of liberty
                    has always been punished by the loss of liberty. Whether we shall see ours endangered (at least) to prevent a civil war, or
                    forfeited as the cost of one, seems to me the alternative which we have to apprehend. Of this I feel certain, that the present
                    state of the press is sufficient to overthrow the Government, and must overthrow it, without some speedy remedy be applied.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If these will be averted, I am one of those persons who believe that the Church of England would be most seriously
                    endangered by what is called Catholic Emancipation. To a Catholic Establishment in Ireland (the inevitable consequence) I could
                    almost consent from utter hopelessness respecting that unhappy country; but in England, the downfall of the Church would prove
                    fatal to the whole system upon which our prosperity has been built. I think I can even see the process by which it would be
                    brought down. The State will want money. <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">M. Wellesley</ref> will do as in India &#8211; carry
                    on the war to a triumphant and decisive conclusion, &#8211; but he will be careless at what expense. The tithes offer a ready resource.
                    The Catholic members (under the next Duke of Norfolk England will have many such),<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bernard
                        Edward Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk (1765&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>). Unlike his cousin and predecessor, Charles Howard, 11th
                        Duke of Norfolk (1765&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), he was a Catholic. Charles Howard controlled at least eight Parliamentary

                    philosophists, and the country gentlemen will joyfully combine against them; and it would even be a popular measure to sell them,
                    in which case Government funds the money, and the clergy become stipendiaries of the Crown. A very easy step then puts up the
                    Establishment for sale to the lowest bidder, and the Methodists step in. England cannot be said to have recovered from the
                    Reformation till William the Third&#8217;s reign.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William III (1650&#8211;1702; King of Great Britain

                    can have nothing to gain, and have everything to lose. The more I contemplate this subject, the more I am convinced of our
