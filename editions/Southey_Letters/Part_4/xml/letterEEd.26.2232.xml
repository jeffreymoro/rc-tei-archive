        <p rend="indent1"> Being in a coffee house one day last week, he read in one of the morning papers what certainly must have been more
                    suprizing to him than to any body else: &#8211; that a stout &amp; well dressed man had been found hanging in the park, no papers were
                    found upon him <del>to xxxxxx</del> which could lead to a discovery who he was, &#8211; but his shirt was marked <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">S.T. Coleridge</ref> at full length: &#8211; &amp; the paper went on to represent him as
                    the author of the late Tragedy Remorse.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Remorse</title> was staged at Drury Lane, London, 23 January-12 February 1813.</note> &#8211; To hear of a lost shirt in this
                    way is an accident that probably never happened to any man before. &#8211; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clarke the Gardener<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Clark, owner of a nursery and seed business at Lime Potts, Crosthwaite.</note> came with

                    well fifteen years ago with good acting, as it has now in spite of very bad: &#8211; &amp; if it had been brought out then, it is more

                    English literature, than to the advantage of his family. It is even not unlikely that success &amp; popular applause, of which he

                    the subject in its numerous bearings. There were also some things which I should have said, if I had been writing directly in my
                    own name, or in a work for which I alone was responsible. But there was no other channel thro which it would have been possible to
                    have obtained the same attention to a most momentous topic.</p>

                    in the snow: snow collects under them in two &lt;rounded&gt; balls upon each foot &amp; then to be sure a man in clogs is like a

        <p rend="indent1"> What an affair is this Delicate Investigation!<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1806 a secret committee
                        of enquiry (the &#8216;Delicate Investigation&#8217;) had been set up to look into the conduct of Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenb&#252;ttel
                        (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent</ref>.
                        Southey is here probably expressing distaste at the publication of a detailed account of the committee&#8217;s activities in
                            <title>The Genuine Book. An Inquiry, or Delicate Investigation into the Conduct of Her Royal Highness the Princess of
                            Wales</title> (1813), seen through the press by <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Spencer Perceval</ref>. In
                        addition to the publicity garnered by this, Caroline&#8217;s behaviour and treatment had generated renewed public interest. On 14
                        January 1813, Caroline had written to her husband protesting about the restrictions placed on her access to their daughter,
                        Princess Charlotte Augusta (1796&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>). In early March a second letter on the same subject was sent to the
                        Speaker of the House of Commons. As it was unsigned its authorship was initially questioned, though it was later attributed to
                        Caroline. After debate, parliament agreed that it was the Regent&#8217;s right as a father and ruler to be in charge of his
                        daughter&#8217;s education; see <title>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</title>, 83 (April 1813), 361, 363&#8211;364, 373&#8211;376.</note> &amp; what a
