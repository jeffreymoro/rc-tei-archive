          <salute>My dear Sir </salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I know not how to express my thanks for your very friendly letter, &amp; for the important channels of
                    communication which you have opened to me. To <ref target="people.html#AbellaManuel">Abella</ref> I wrote immediately, confining
                    my questions to the affairs of Zaragoza<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Manuel Abella, 7 November 1810,
                        Letter 1824. The Spanish city of Zaragoza had been besieged in 1808 and 1809. It fell to the French on 20 February 1809 after
                        an outbreak of disease. For Southey&#8217;s accounts of the first and second sieges, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 306&#8211;321; and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 508&#8211;527.</note> &#8211;
                    when his answer arrives I shall address to him some specific queries respecting those operations in which the Duke de

                        Alburquerque (1774&#8211;1811). The Duke was in London as an Ambassador from the Spanish Junta, and Abella was acting as his
                        assistant. For Southey&#8217;s praise of the Duke&#8217;s military actions in 1809, see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                        1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 557.</note> was concerned in La Mancha when acting under Urbinos<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jos&#233; de Urbina y Urbina, 3rd Conde de Cartaojal (1761&#8211;1833), commander of the Spanish Army defeated at the

                    obliged to <ref target="people.html#AmyotThomas">Mr Amyot</ref> for the permission he has given me to apply thro him to Col.

                        Spanish forces. Later promoted to Major-General and Field Marshal in the Spanish Army.</note> &#8211; I am preparing some questions
                    concerning Romanas movements from the time when Sir John Moore<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809;

                    information will come too late for my present use, for the publishers, tho they are considerate enough never to hurry me, are
                    nevertheless, tradesmen like, exceedingly anxious to make as much haste as possible. But I shall omit no means of acquiring
                    intelligence which may enable me to rectify mistakes, &amp; supply deficiencies, so that I may leave a corrected copy with as few
                    errors as possible. This Spanish contest will be of an everlasting interest, like the war of Greece against Xerxes.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The invasion of Greece in 480&#8211;479 BC by Xerxes I (519&#8211;465 BC; King of Persia 486&#8211;465 BC). It

        <p rend="indent1"> How do you understand the conduct of the M. de Palacios?<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Domingo Mariano
                        de Traggia y Urribarri, Marquis del Palacio (1744&#8211;1816) had been invited by the Spanish Cortes in October 1810 to take a
                        temporary seat on the Council of Regency. But he had quibbled about the oath of loyalty to the Cortes and its possible
                        conflict with his oaths of loyalty to the monarchy. The Cortes removed him from the Regency and briefly imprisoned him. See
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title>, 3.1 (1812), 495&#8211;497.</note> Is it that he thinks the Cortes are
                    entrenching upon the prerogatives, and wishes to have the Monarchy, when reestablished, as unlimited as before? That Spain will
                    work out its regeneration &amp; redemption I cannot doubt, &#8211; however long and dreadful the struggle may be. There are two possible
                    terminations, either of which would accomplish the great object of uniting the whole peninsula under one government &#8211; first &amp;
                    least likely (however devoutly to be wished for) the establishment of a federal Republic, but I have little hope of living to sing
