        <p rend="indent1"> The little parcel which your letter announced did not arrive till a day later than it ought to have done, according
                    to its date &amp; it came with a charge for carriage, tho&#8217; <hi rend="ital">carriage paid</hi> is written upon it, &amp; there is
                    also what appears to <del>me</del> be the coach office mark to the same purport. Upon my remonstrating here I <del>was</del>
                    &lt;am&gt; told that there <del>was</del> &lt;is&gt; an apparent fraud upon the face of the charge, but that my only way
                        <del>was</del> &lt;must be&gt; to write to London, ascertain that the carriage had been paid, &amp; then deliver the wrapper
                    to the people here, who <del>would</del> &lt;will&gt; return me the overcharge, &amp; detect the fraud. <del>M</del> I beg the
                    favour of a line from you upon this subject; it is the more desirable that the matter should be traced, as it is not the first
                    time that I have been imposed upon in the same manner.</p>
