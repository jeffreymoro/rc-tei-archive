                    attention would deprive me of sleep. It is only by doing many things at once
                    that I am enabled to do much of any thing. The Inscriptions are postponed<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> In early 1814, Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Inscriptions

                        Junius was the pseudonym used by the author &#8211; or authors &#8211; of a series of
                        letters published in the <title>Public Advertiser</title> between 21 January
                        1769 and 21 January 1772. The letters took a high Whig line. They opposed
                        the policies of the government and the king and were generally supportive of
                        those of the ex-Prime Minister George Grenville (1712&#8211;1770;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and of the radical politician John Wilkes
                        (1725&#8211;1797; <title>DNB</title>). There was, from the outset, much debate as
                        to the identity of their author or authors. In 1813 Duppa&#8217;s <title>Memoirs
                            by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</title> (i.e. the poet
                        and politician Richard Glover (1712&#8211;1785; <title>DNB</title>)) had attempted
                        to prove the latter was the author of Junius&#8217;s letters. Duppa defended
                        himself against his critics in an anonymous pamphlet, <title>An Inquiry
                            Concerning the Author of the Letters of Junius, with Reference to the
                            Memoirs by a Celebrated Literary and Political Character</title> (1814).
                        Southey was asking Murray to send him a copy of the latter.</note>
