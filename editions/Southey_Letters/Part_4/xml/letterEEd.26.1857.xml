        <p rend="indent1"> I have heard the scheme proposed of prosecuting Itinerancy,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Addington,
                  Viscount Sidmouth (1757&#8211;1844; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1801&#8211;1804, Home Secretary 1812&#8211;1822, introduced a Bill into the
                  House of Lords in May 1811 to outlaw itinerant preaching, unless the preacher had been licensed. It provoked an avalanche of
                  evangelical protest and was dropped.</note> &#8211; but the thing is totally impracticable, without establishing a principle of violence
               which would make the remedy far worse than the disease. You cannot God be thanked, in this country, prevent a man from going where he
               pleases, &amp; preaching in any place where he can do it peaceably, &#8211; that is in any place where he does not interrupt any body else,
               or trespass upon any person&#8217;s property. No Tom, both with religious &amp; political revolutions, when the age for them is come there in
               no way but the recourse of the traveller in the <del>wilds</del> &lt;savannahs&gt; of America, &#8211; when the grass is on fire behind him,
               to set fire to it before. <del>Direct</del> &lt;Kindle&gt; the combustible materials yourself &amp; direct them to your own purpose, or
               you will be consumed with them. I am never weary of repeating that faith is an appetite of the mind: our establishment starves it the
               Catholicks gorge it even to surfeiting &amp; sickness. The most practicable (I fear the only practicable) remedy is by setting up a new
               system, an Eclectic church, continuing all that is good in each, yet so philosophically framed that as the world grew wiser it would be
               adapted for a Catholick &#8211; i-e- a universal faith. If I had had the slightest crack in the upper story I should have done this long ago,
               &#8211; &amp; perhaps it is only the multiplicity of my employments &amp; the interest which I take in them &amp; the importance that I have
               persuaded myself attaches to them, &#8211; that has prevented me from being ten times more conspicuous in the world than I ever possibly was
               by any other means. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Establishment has been an infinite blessing to England, &#8211; in proof of this [MS obscured] have only to look at
               Popery &amp; Calvinism from both of which it has preserved us. It still is a blessing because it saves us from persecution; &#8211; but its
               creed will not stand the test of sound criticism. The story of the Fall, the plenary inspiration of the scriptures, &amp; the miracles
               must be given up, &#8211; abandon these, insist upon a diseased moral nature, the necessity &amp; all-sufficiency of grace effecting a moral
               redemption, &#8211; preach the doctrine of a perpetual revelation, appeal to the heart of man for the truth of these doctrines, &#8211; &amp;
               Christianity becomes invincible. The nature of the Fall, &amp; the questions of the Trinity &amp; the super-human nature of Christ may
               safely be left undefined, for every person to understand according to his judgement. But I have begun upon a subject which it would
               require a volume to explain.</p>
