                        commanded the army of Portuguese levies that was formed to meet the French at the Battle of Braga, 20 March 1809. Aware that
                        the position was hopeless, but that if he ordered a retreat he would be murdered by his troops, Freire attempted to slip away
                        to Oporto, but was captured, imprisoned at Braga and then murdered.</note> Was he released on his way by the French? &#8211; &#8211; was

                        them were captives in France and without children &#8211; then the heir to the Spanish throne would be their eldest sister,

                        scenario, their son, Prince Francisco Antonio Pio (1795&#8211;1801) would be heir to the Crowns of both Spain and Portugal. Southey
                        had forgotten that the Prince had died in 1801 and been succeeded as Prince of Beira (second in line to the Portuguese throne)
                        by his younger brother, Prince Pedro (1798&#8211;1834; King of Portugal 1826; Emperor of Brazil 1822&#8211;1834).</note>
