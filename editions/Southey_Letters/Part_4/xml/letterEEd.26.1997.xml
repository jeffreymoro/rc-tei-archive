        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for that beautiful volume upon Iceland.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir George Steuart
                        Mackenzie (1780&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Travels in the Island of Iceland, in the Summer of the Year 1810</title>
                        (1811); reviewed by Southey alongside Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Journal of a Tour in
                            Iceland, in the Summer of 1809</title> (1811), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 7 (March 1812), 48&#8211;92. Southey&#8217;s copy of
                        Mackenzie &#8211; which had some coloured plates and marbled leaves &#8211; was no. 1654 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> It
                    arrived on Wednesday, &amp; the larger parcel has made its appearance this evening. You can never send me too many books upon any
                    subject on which I am to write, respecting the Poor however, it seems that you have been forming one plan &amp; I another. My
                    original intention was to take the Reports of the Bettering Society for the text, &amp; show what actually had been done &amp; was
                    doing towards lessening the evils of humanity in this country. &#8211; a set off on the part of the true reformers against those who
                    ought to be called refor<hi rend="ital">mists</hi>. The subject is certainly, as you have felt it to be, materially connected with
                    the general state of the Poor, &#8211; but I am inclined to think it may be better to treat it distinctly, &amp; form two essays.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first of a series of Southeyan articles on the poor, which appeared in the <title>Quarterly
                            Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319&#8211;356, was intended as &#8216;an attack upon Malthus&#8217;, amongst others; see Southey to
                        Charles Danvers, 5 January 1813, Letter 2199. It was republished in an expanded, retitled form as &#8216;On the State of the Poor,
                        the Principle of Mr. Malthus&#8217; Essay on Population, and the Manufacturing System&#8217; in Southey&#8217;s <title>Essays, Moral and
                            Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), I, pp. 75&#8211;155.</note> This however I shall see by the time I have gone thro Sir
                    F. M. Edens work.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir Frederick Morton Eden, 2nd Baronet (1766&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>),

        <p rend="indent1"> Respecting school-books, &#8211; for those which are merely initiatory, not a thought concerning them ever past across my
                    mind, &#8211; but I have thought of a work, &amp; talked about it with <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                        priesthood, but converted to Protestantism and became a Church of Ireland clergyman. He had been a well-known Whig, but by
                        1811 he was increasingly conservative and a defender of the Church of Ireland.</note> which if it were executed according to
                    my second sight, might bid fair for admission into schools. The plan is this, to describe first the religions of our British,
                    Roman &amp; Saxon ancestors, &amp; the consequences resulting from their respective systems, &#8211; being the &lt;temporal&gt; evils
