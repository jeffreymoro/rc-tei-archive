        <p rend="indent1"> Your death of Adam is what it should be, &amp; the apparition at
                    the close brings with it all the comfort &amp; light &amp; glory that is wanted.
                    Eves departure is admirably conceived, &#8211; I did not expect it, &#8211; because I was
                    chained too much as I went on to expect any thing, &#8211; but the event follows so
                    naturally that it produces an affect like historical truth.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s comments relate to &#8216;a portion of
                        the manuscript&#8217; of Montgomery&#8217;s epic <title>The World Before the
                            Flood</title> (1813); see John Holland and James Everett, <title>Memoirs
                            of the Life and Writings of James Montgomery</title>, 7 vols (London,
                        1854&#8211;1856), II, p. 295. Montgomery deleted &#8216;unreturning&#8217;, but retained
                        &#8216;congenial side&#8217; in Canto IV.</note> &#8211; I should never have objected to the
                    couplet if it had often been written as you write it, with that full &amp; yet
                    unwearying harmony, &#8211; well varied but never interrupted. &#8211; There are but two
                    expressions which struck me as blemishes, &#8211; concerning the one you will agree
                    with me, about the other perhaps you will not. &#8211; the first is the epithet &#8220;<hi rend="ital">unreturning</hi>&#8217; in the last line of the first paragraph. The
                    other is this <hi rend="ital">congenial side</hi>. the direct reference to the
                    rib is perfectly proper, &amp; yet I wish the word <hi rend="ital">breast</hi>
                    could have been used instead of <hi rend="ital">side</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> No man who looks into his own heart when he is capable of
                    understanding it can doubt that there is a disease in human nature, for which
                    the grace of God is the only remedy. With this belief, &#8211; or rather with this <hi rend="ital">sense</hi> &amp; this <hi rend="ital">conviction</hi>, there can
                    be no presumption in saying that I regard the first chapter of Genesis not as an
                    historical narrative but as an allegorical tale invented for this mystery, &#8211; a
                    mystery which has been universally acknowledged among mankind, because it has
                    been universally felt. If I understood the <del>litera</del> story literally,
                    then I should read this line in the feeling with which you have written it: &#8211;
                    but that the &lt;formation of Eve&gt; is the only part of this very beautiful
                    narration which has not the solemnity of the rest is apparent from the
                    numberless light allusions to which it has given rise, from men who had no
                    irreverent thought or intention.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have passed thro many changes of belief as is likely to be the
                    case with every man of ardent mind who is not early gifted with humility.

                    applicable against the Socinian scheme. He remained three or four weeks at
                    Oxford, &amp; we planned a Utopia of our own, to be founded in the wilds of
                    America upon the basis of common property, &#8211; each labouring for all, &#8211; a
                    Pantisocracy, &#8211; a republic of reason &amp; virtue.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> For this dream I gave up every other prospect. How painfully
                    &amp; slowly I was awakened from it, this is not the time to say, for my purpose
                    is but to show you where I have been upon my Pilgrims Progress, &amp; how far I
                    have advanced upon the way. I became a Socinian from the reasonableness of the
                    scheme, &amp; still more so because I was shocked by the consequences of
                    irreligion, such as they were seen in my daily intercourse with sceptics,
                    unbelievers &amp; atheists. I remained in it till I learnt &amp; felt
                        <del>that</del> how vain it is to build up a religion wholly upon historical
                    proofs, &#8211; I learnt that religion could never be a living &amp; quickening
                    principle, if <del>it was</del> &lt;we only assented to it as&gt; a mere act of
                    the understanding. Something more was necessary, &#8211; an operation of Grace &#8211; a
                    manifestation of the Spirit &#8211; an inward revelation, &#8211; a recognition of revealed
                    truth. This drew me towards Quakerism, &#8211; yet with too clear a perception of the
                    errors &amp; follies of the Quakers to be wholly in union with them. &#8211; In what
                    has <del>it</del> &lt;all this&gt; ended <del>xx</del> you will ask? &#8211; that I am

                    without a fold, but not without a Shepherd; &#8211; clinging to all that Christ has
                    clearly taught, &#8211; but shrinking from all attempts at defining by articles of
                    faith those points which the Gospels have left indefinite. I am of no visible
                    Church, &#8211; but assuredly I feel myself in the communion of Saints.</p>
