        <p rend="indent1"> Well, my dear Edith, some of my business is got thro, thank Heaven, &amp; the rest is in a fair train. My
                    appointment is compleated, &amp; I have only to take the oaths &amp; pay the fees. &#8211; for the first of such operations I must wait
                    till Saturday, Mash<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Mash (1767&#8211;1840), First Clerk to the Lord Chamberlain and a
                        Gentleman Usher.</note> being out of town till that day. Yesterday I presented myself at the Insurance Office, <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edmondson</ref> will receive a letter enquiring my character as to
                    health, by this days post I believe, &amp; when his answer is returned, the policy will be compleated, &amp; I shall have secured
                    a provision of 4000&#163;, which will increase according to the length of my own life. My movements depend upon the Levee, I shall
                    figure there one day, &amp; set off for <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> the next.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
          <ref target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Littleton</ref> has been very civil, he has called twice, &amp; invited me to dinner
                    on Tuesday last, &#8211; unluckily however we have never yet met. I shall call again at his door this morning (for I am writing before
                    breakfast.) The bust<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> A bust of Southey was being sculpted by James Smith
                        (1775&#8211;1815).</note> will probably be finished this week, &amp; admirably like it will be: the little modelling master means to
                    send the <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora</ref> one. Where will you find a place for one? The likeness is infinitely
                    more striking that that of any portrait which has yet been made of me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will not much wonder to hear that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> has turned up in the
                    world again. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> recognized him among a company of strollers at Welsh Pool by his
                        <del>xx</del> resemblance to me, &amp; one more effort in consequence will be made to save him. It seems he is married,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Southey had a female companion (a Miss Lack), but on making further enquiries into
                        her background and visiting her grandfather, Southey discovered that they were not married.</note> but has no children living.
                    In what way he can be benefitted, or rather in what way it will be proper to attempt to benefit him, depends very much upon the
                    circumstance of his marriage, &amp; I can decide nothing till I know something about his wife. If there is nothing amiss about the
                    match but its imprudence, it offers the best chance of steadying him, &amp; in that case <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> &amp; I &amp; <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> agree that
                    he had better continue in the vocation which he has chosen, &amp; endeavour to get an engagement at some respectable theatre. This
                    or the Spanish Service is the alternative, &amp; if he takes the latter he must leave his wife to live by the stage as she can. He
                    says she is known to Kemble,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The actor and theatrical manager John Philip Kemble
                        (1757&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &amp; that 50&#163; a year has been settled upon her &amp; her children after the death of
                    an Uncle<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Lack (1739&#8211;1824), Secretary to Charles Jenkinson, 1st Lord Liverpool
                        (1729&#8211;1808; <title>DNB</title>), President of the Board of Trade 1786&#8211;1803.</note> who lives at Chelsea. I have a letter from
                    him, written in a manly &amp; proper style &amp; spirit. My first business must be, as soon as I learn who his wife was, to make
                    enquiry into her history &amp; conduct &amp; if this turns out well, I shall have good hopes &amp; expectations for the rest. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> offers to assist in fitting him out for the Spanish service, &amp; we could
                    easily get him a commission. But I am unwilling that this plan should be followed, from a fear that if it be, he will again return
                    to the stage: &amp; indeed if he found his wife in &lt;a&gt; reputable <del>xxx</del> way of life, I will never be instrumental in
                    separating them, unless it be at her express desire, &amp; for the manifest &amp; undoubted welfare of both.</p>
