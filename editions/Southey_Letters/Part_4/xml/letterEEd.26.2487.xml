                    recovery of Pernambuco. I follow it with a chapter De Moribus,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;of customs&#8217;.</note> for
                    which my Collectanea are curious &amp; abundant: &#8211; Then glance rapidly at the affairs of Paraguay &amp; the Plata, &amp; enter

                        and occupies the first two thirds of the second volume (roughly up to Chapter 26). The order is the same, except for the &#8216;de
                        Moribus&#8217; material, which appeared in Chapters 24 and 30.</note> The restoration of the Jesuits excites less attention in
                    England than a murder or a new novel. What effect will it produce in Portugal? they begin to pride themselves there on being more
                    enlightened than their neighbours, &amp; it is not impossible that this Bull may embroil them with the Pope.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pius VII (1742&#8211;1823), pontiff since 1800, restored the Society of Jesus (which had been suppressed
                        in 1773), in a Bull of 7 August 1814. However, Portugal did not ask the Jesuits to return until 1829.</note>
