                    who average at Four commissioned officers &amp; six serjeants to every 100 men, that is Ten per Cent: total Regular Cavalry
                    therefore 30,131. Regular Infantry 183,768, add one Tenth as before, 202,144: Artillery Horse &amp; Foot 24,304, add for
                    commissioned officers (for in this branch of our force only these are reckoned seperately) 941, in all 25,245. Marines 31,400, add
                    one Tenth, 34,520. Total Regular Cavalry &amp; Infantry 291,940, or in round numbers 290,000. And this number is now about to be
                    augmented largely from the Old Militia which amounts to 84,300 men, &amp; adding the Tenth, 92,730, so that we maintain 384,670
                    men, entirely dedicated to military pursuits, in the Army.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Sailors voted by Parliament this year (exclusive of Marines) are 113,600, but it is understood rather more are
                    on the ships books. Add <del>4,600</del> &lt;4,400&gt; Commissioned Naval Officers (the last Navy List enumerates 4,661) the
