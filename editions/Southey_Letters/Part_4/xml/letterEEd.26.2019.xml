        <p rend="indent1"> I shall be very glad to act as gentleman-usher to your remarks on Humboldt,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#8211;1859), naturalist and explorer. Possibly Burney was seeking to write a review or an article on
                        Humboldt&#8217;s works. As Southey disclaimed any knowledge of the subject, Burney might have been proposing to write on one of
                        Humboldt&#8217;s works of natural history, for instance <title>Recueil d&#8217;observations de zoologie et d&#8217;anatomie comparee</title>
                        (1811&#8211;1813).</note> &#8722; that branch of the subject being one upon which I am wholly incompetent to form a judgement. That
                    Humboldt is a good deal of a Quack is pretty evident. The two newly translated volumes I have not yet seen, &#8722; they are probably
                    now upon the road to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>: &#8722; the two former did not altogether answer the opinion which
                    had been raised of them.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain</title> (1811&#8211;1812), translated by John Black (1783&#8211;1855;
                            <title>DNB</title>). Two volumes (&#8216;the two former&#8217;) of this work appeared in 1811 and the final two (the &#8216;two newly
                        translated volumes&#8217;) in 1812.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My reviewal of his work is designed for N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 14 of the Quarterly,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the end, Southey did not review Humboldt for the <title>Quarterly</title>.</note> N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 12
                    being that which is on the eve of publication. &#8211; so that it will be full three <del>mot</del> months before your papers will be
                    needed. It is only a feeling of what the Spaniards call <hi rend="ital">pundonor</hi>
          <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        &#8216;Self-respect&#8217;.</note> which has made me undertake it. But having been very well used by all persons concerned in the Q. it
                    did not sit easy upon my conscience to let the Edinburgh gain credit for its knowledge of <del>South</del> &lt;Spanish&gt;
                        America,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> For example, in reviews of Humboldt&#8217;s works, <title>Edinburgh Review</title>,
                        16 (April 1810), 62&#8211;102; 223&#8211;253.</note> when I know more about it, in all likelihood, than any, or perhaps than all, other
