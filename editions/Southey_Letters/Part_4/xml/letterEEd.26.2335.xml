        <p rend="indent1"> When your World before the Flood<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Montgomery&#8217;s religious epic <title>The
                            World Before the Flood</title> (1813).</note>). reached me I read it thro before I slept, &amp; intended after the second
                    perusal to have thanked you for it &amp; told you how it had delighted me. Some interruption prevented me from fulfilling this
                    determination, &#8211; business prest upon me, &#8211; circumstances hurried me to London in such haste, that instead of accomplishing a
                    secret intention of going thro Sheffield I was obliged to take the mail at Penrith, &amp; perform the journey at one stretch. You
                    know what the distractions of London are, even to a man <del>who</del> like me, who take no part in its public amusements, &#8211; I
                    could find time to write to none except my own family, &amp; after a whole three months absence, losing not a single day after I
                    was at liberty, took my seat in the mail again, &amp; returned by the same straight road on Sunday week last. &#8211; Forgive me a long
                    neglect which proceeded from no unkindness or diminished regard.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of your poem I will say little, because I am about to say much elsewhere,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        In a review of <title>The World Before the Flood</title>, in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 11 (April 1814), 79&#8211;87.</note> &#8211;
                    in this instance also performing a long delayed <del>inten</del> duty. You will have reason to be satisfied with its reception,
                    &amp; the rank which it is destined to hold. I could distinctly perceive that it was gaining ground. They who did not find at
                    first that excitement of extraordinary story which the title perhaps might lead them to expect, find afterwards the tenderness
                    which soothes, the piety which ennobles, feeling which is ever present, &amp; beauties which they recur to again &amp; again with
                    delight. What are you meditating next? &#8211; <ref target="people.html#ConderJosiah">Josiah Conder</ref> told me of a projected Life of

                        introductory essay by Montgomery was published in 1824. Southey&#8217;s fifteen-volume life and works of Cowper appeared in
                        1835&#8211;1837.</note> which may be executed by you best of all men. Hayley<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Hayley

                    the subject. To you it is peculiarly suited, &amp; I doubt not but that you will <del>xxx</del> supply one <del>proof more</del>

                    it should be given me. When it appeared that it had already been offered to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>, he
                    was offended; his pleasure he said ought to have been consulted, he had given it to me, &amp; have it I should. <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Croker</ref> then represented that he was upon terms of friendly
                    intercourse with <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> as well as with me, that <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> &amp; I were friends also, &amp; that for the sake of all three he must request the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref> to suffer things to remain as they were &amp; take their course. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> declined <del>to</del> acceptance, upon the ground that it would be unbecoming in
                    him who was amply provided for in his legal profession, to take an office which seemed exclusively to belong to one who had no
                    other profession than literature. This he did without knowing what had past, &amp; at the same time he urged that it should be
                    offered to me. You would love him if you saw the letter which he wrote to me upon the occasion.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott&#8217;s letter of 1 September [1813], telling Southey that he had declined the Poet Laureateship and instead
                        recommended him to Croker. He also cautioned &#8216;I am uncertain if you will like it, for the laurel has certainly been tarnished
                        by some of its wearers, and as at present managed, its duties are inconvenient and somewhat liable to ridicule&#8217;, H. C.

        <p rend="indent1"> Upon this I wrote to <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Croker</ref> stating how
                    little likely it was that I could, school boy like, write verses at stated times upon stated subjects, in a manner which could
                    either be creditable to the office or to myself.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John Wilson Croker, [4

                    write, or to be silent, as the spirit might move, in that case the office would become an honourable distinction which I should
                    gladly accept. Accordingly I accepted it, upon an understanding that tho it was not for me to make terms with the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref>, it would be suggested to him that it would be for his honour &amp; for
                    mine to make this desirable reform.</p>

                    &amp; other such persons I fear who stand in the way of it, &amp; luckily for myself I have become very indifferent whether it be
                        <del>xxx</del> placed upon this footing or not, partly from pride, &amp; partly from a deeper feeling. From pride, because I
                    am not <del>unwilling</del> displeased to show how possible it to <del>render</del> derive honour from the office by making it
                    honourable; &amp; substituting in the place of adulatory common place, high moral strains of exhortation: &amp; from a deeper
                    feeling because, having converted the salary (&lt;which&gt; all deductions made, <del>90 &#163;</del> amounts to only 90 &#163;) by an
                    annual addition of some 12 &#163;, into a <del>pr</del> life insurance for &#163;3000, the thought of having made this provision for my
                    family would sweeten a more irksome employment. &#8211; So I am at present <del>at</del> working upon an Ode, the burden of which is
                    &#8216;Glory to God &#8211; deliverance for mankind!&#8221; &#8211; &amp; thanks be to God, the present state of public affairs gives ample cause for such
                    a strain of thanksgiving. I think also of prefacing this ode with something which will effectually put those persons to shame; who
                    judging of me by themselves, have thought that I should dishonour myself.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s first
                        official poem as Poet Laureate was extremely controversial and much altered prior to publication. The final five stanzas were
                        considered by Croker and Rickman to be inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and deleted them from the version published as
                            <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the deleted stanzas into an
                        &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte&#8217;, published in the <title>Courier</title> 3 February 1814. &#8216;Glory to God,
                        Deliverance for mankind!&#8217; was a repeated line in the &#8216;Ode&#8217;, often used to conclude verses.</note>
