          <salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your note of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> was quite a relief to me, &#8211; for I had been dreaming disturbedly <del>every
                        night</del> of you &amp; <ref target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">your father</ref> for the last two nights.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> First about the Carmen Annuum,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s first official poem as Poet
                        Laureate was extremely controversial and much altered prior to publication. Five stanzas were considered by Croker
                        and Rickman to be inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and deleted them from the version published as <title>Carmen
                            Triumphale</title>
                        in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the deleted stanzas into an &#8216;Ode Written During the
                        Negotiations with Bonaparte&#8217;, published in the <title>Courier</title> 3 February 1814.</note> &#8211; I recollected while
                    transcribing it for the press that there was no such adjective as <hi rend="ital">Annualis</hi>, &#8211; which was lucky; as the <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmen</ref> are not scholars enough to have set me right, &amp; the blunder would have
                    looked ill in <del>the</del> an Advertisement. The copy which you have was made for your pleasure, &amp; for nothing else. I have
                    inserted five stanzas in place of the first half of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &#8211; relating to Spain. They are in keeping with the
                    rest, &amp; contain a wipe at some of our lilly-livered politicians, which will serve to bring in an extract &lt;or two&gt; from
                    the Edinburgh Review in the notes. As for the poem it is necessarily rather an oration in verse than an ode, &#8211; for which reason I
                    have given it a <hi rend="ital">generic</hi> name, &#8211; Carmen being any kind of poem.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Many of your criticisms on these books<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> are well founded, &amp; shall have all the attention which I am
                    capable of giving them. I shall alter the arrangement of the first ten lines, &amp; endeavour to get rid of the &#8220;feudal Power&#8221;
                    which so awkwardly supplies the original &#8216;Royalty.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey re-wrote this section totally
                        for <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> &#8211; The second book would be too long if I were writing a poem
                    upon <del>one of</del> the plan of the &#198;neid, &#8211; but I must make the plan suit the subject, &amp; excite not only compassion for
                    Roderic but a disposition to excuse him. &#8211; The inconsistency of being shocked at the thought of leaving his body to the birds is
                    perfectly natural.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    the story of the poem is built. That Image is Our Lady of Nazareth, &#8211; a personage who once put me in bodily <del>danger</del>
                    &lt;fear&gt;, &#8211; for I happened to be upon the Tagus when she &amp; the Prince<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> John VI
