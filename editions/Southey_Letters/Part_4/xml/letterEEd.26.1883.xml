                    any other living writer, &amp; in very few of those who are <del>xxxxxx</del> immortal.</p>

                    &#8211; &amp; by accompanying it with a note to Kemble I may possibly at least excite his attention to it. As for his understanding the
                    power &amp; might &amp; majesty that the tragedy manifests it is not to be expected from a man who can act in such trash as

                        (1713); one of the &#8216;Roman&#8217; roles with which Kemble was most closely identified.</note> &amp; the Revenge,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Young (bap. 1683, d. 1765; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Revenge: A Tragedy</title>
                        (1721). A version revised by Kemble was staged at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, with the actor in the lead role of the
                        vengeful Moor Zanga. Southey&#8217;s disgust was not shared by all his contemporaries. See, for example, the appraisal of the 1801
                        revival of <title>The Revenge</title>, the production Southey had seen, in the <title>European Magazine</title>, 40 (December
                        1801), 440: &#8216;The part of Zanga we have always ranked among the best performances of Mr. Kemble; and we scarcely ever witnessed
                        a more powerful impression than was made on the audience in the present instance. His whole soul seemed absorbed in the one
                        passion of revenge &#8230; In the last scene, when to satiate his appetite, he informed <title>Alonzo</title> that his dying wife
                        and murdered friend were both innocent &#8230; his savage triumph was truly impassioned, and excited in every breast at once horror
                        for his crimes, and a degree of admiration for his mistaken magnanimity&#8217;.</note> &#8211; after Shakespere. This last play so turned
                    my stomach nine years ago that I verily believe I shall never set foot in a theatre again</p>

          <del>The</del> Cato has only been endured, because having originally escaped the damnation which it deserved, it would have been
                    against all precedent to have damned it now. &#8211; I very much doubt the success of C. Julian, less from its want of pageantry, than
                    because of its excellencies. Long experience has made me think as meanly of the public taste as you did when you wrote the preface
                    to Gebir:<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor&#8217;s <title>Gebir</title> (London, 1798). The &#8216;Preface&#8217; ([i]&#8211;ii) had argued
                        that: &#8216;A Poem, like mine, descriptive of men and manners, should never be founded totally on fiction &#8230; I have followed no man
                        closely; nor have I turned from my road because another stood in it: tho&#8217; perhaps I have momentarily &#8230; caught the object that
                        attracted him. I have written in blank verse, because there never was a poem in rhyme that grew not tedious in a thousand
                        lines &#8230; If there are, now, Englishmen of taste and genius who will applaud my Poem, I declare myself fully content.&#8217;</note>
                    the effect of this settled opinion is that I write without remorse because a printed book finds its way to the few who can rightly
                    appreciate it, but I do not think I could submit a production which had cost me thought &amp; passion, flushes of cheek &amp;
                    throbs of head, &amp; <del>quit</del> quiet tears &#8211; to be decided upon by such a crew as the dramatic critics of London. God help
                    me what a crew they are! fellows whose habitual profligacy absolutely incapacitates them from understanding any thing
                        <del>of</del> which refers to the principles of goodness in human nature.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> However if you wish it I will consign your play to Kemble, <del>take all the man</del> &amp; manage all the
                    correspondence between him &amp; you as to alterations, &#8211; if the business should proceed so far. And should this attempt fail I
                    can submit it to the Edinburgh theatre thro <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref>.</p>
