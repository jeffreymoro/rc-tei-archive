        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot be easy in mind unless I write to you on yr plan for leaving England; under this feeling it would be folly
                    to apologize to any man for discharging a duty, &amp; least of all can it be needful to you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The stuff of which Martyrs &amp; ordinary Saints are made is sufficiently common, the supply of these will be
                    always equal to the demand; but you are the only man within my knowledge who without a &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
                    &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Space left by
                        copyist.</note> of religious fanaticism could not possibly have escaped canonization had you been born in the right age &amp;
                    the right country for it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I believe that you will find no man who will understand yr feelings better than I do &#8211; or who will sympathize in
                    them so far. Were it yr belief that all who do not die in the profession of a particular faith are everlastingly lost, &amp; in
                    that belief you should chuse to go &amp; preach the gospel to the most cruel of the negro nations, or even in Japan itself, I
                    might perhaps set forth to you the certain &amp; inevitable danger, but I should hardly dissuade you from it, with such a belief
                    the object is tantamount to the sacrifice &amp; the means would seem adequate to the object. In some degree indeed they would
                    actually be so. He who offers Hell on the one hand, &amp; redemption by the blood of Jesus on the other will make his preaching
                    felt wherever he can make it understood.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But what object do you propose which can counterbalance &#8211; I will not say danger to yourself (a thing not to be
                    considered if the call of duty were clear, &amp; hardly to be urged even in this case) but the pain which yr departure would cause
                    to your nearest &amp; dearest friends? Is it to Botany Bay that you would go? what could you do there? there are already schools
                    missionaries &amp; preachers. It is becoming a favourite station of the London Missionary Society.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> A non-denominational (but mainly Congregationalist) missionary society founded in 1795.</note> Marsden<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Marsden (1765&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>). In July 1793 he had taken up the post of
                        assistant to the chaplain of New South Wales. He was, however, frustrated by lack of success in reclaiming the souls of
                        transported convicts and native peoples. He also acquired a reputation for severity, particularly in his duties as a
                        magistrate, where he was a great advocate of flogging. In 1804 he became agent for London Missionary Society operations in the
                        Pacific and visited England in 1807&#8211;1809 to lay the foundations of a mission to the Maori and to recruit new chaplains for the

                    men, good as their intentions may be, &amp; useful<del>ly</del> as (in the main) their labours must be when the foundation of
                    their faith is so different from your own, &amp; when the points of difference are precisely those upon which they all insist the
                    most; the true methodist will think you in more need of conversion than the wildest savage of the woods; what is there you would
                    do for which these men are not better qualified? Opinions &amp; principles pure as yours are the dish on which children should be
                    fed &#8211; the strong drugs &amp; counterpoisons of Methodism &amp; Popery are the only medicines which will reach desperate cases;
                    they who have lived always under the influence of their passions must by their passions be worked upon, repentance &amp;
                    redemption they all understand &#8211; they are intelligible things they are cauteries which reach the causes of the soul.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you propose then to act as a Preceptor to carry knowledge where it may be wanted &#8211; for the good which may in
                    this way be effected, you have a better field at home. England is at this moment the place where the seed of good principles will
                    produce the best fruit, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
