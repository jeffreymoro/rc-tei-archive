                    to it a full account of the late battle, &amp; let him publish it within three weeks in one volume, like the Life of Nelson as a
                    Life of Wellington &amp; with my name.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Elliott (dates unknown), <title>The Life of

                        did not expand this into a biography along the lines of his<title> Life of Nelson</title> (1813). He was, however,
                        commissioned by Murray to review the following: Eustache-Auguste Carel (1788&#8211;1836), <title>Pr&#233;cis Historique de la Guerre

                    with good reason have considered it as a derogatory offer. But because thro my <del>hab</del> principle of doing things of this
                    kind as well as I can without any reference to <del>bargain</del> price or quantity, he got from me a fair Life of Nelson instead
                    of a mere expansion of a paper in his review, &amp; thereby (tho he paid me 200 &#163; instead of 100 &#163; which was the original offer
                    for one volume got from me for 200 &#163; what I <del>cou</del> certainly would not have sold to him for five had the thing been a
                    straight forward business from the beginning, &#8211; because he has dealt so thoroughly in one instance he wanted to trepan me into
                    this kind of <del>sale</del> bargain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am not very quick sighted in such things, &amp; might possibly enough have been taken in if other &amp; weightier
                    objections had not instantly occurred to me, &#8211; such as the unfitness of writing the life of a man before he was dead, &#8211; &amp; the
