                    did not dare begin upon them, for fear of never getting to the end. Your note,

                        Marquis Wellesley had been governor-general of Bengal (1797&#8211;1805). After his
                        return to England, a controversy broke out about his government in India and
                        he was denounced in parliament by a coalition of radicals and personal
                        opponents. Wellesley was accused of ruining trade in Oudh and undermining
                        the authority of its ruler, Saadat Ali Kan II (c. 1752&#8211;1814; Nawab of Oudh
                        1798&#8211;1814). The motion to censure Wellesley was defeated by 182 votes to 31
                        on 15 March 1808. Southey summarised the debates in the <title>Edinburgh
                            Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 133&#8211;137. Dr Knighton had
