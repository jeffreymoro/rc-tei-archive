        <p rend="indent1"> I am exceedingly rejoiced to hear of an authentic account of the French proceedings in Portugal.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Observador Portuguez, Historico e Politico de Lisboa</title> (1809), no. 3556 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
                        library. Southey reviewed the book in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (August 1810), 1&#8211;24.</note> If you will send it to

                        <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Perceval</ref>. You may remember some Catholick Legends how great sinners have been
                    saved from <del>&amp;</del> utter perdition, &amp; let either into Purgatory, or sometimes &lt;into&gt; Heaven at once, for a
                    stray act of goodness, &#8211; a chance alms, or an Ave Maria said in some lucky minute when it seemed to be the most inappropriate
                    thing in the world. In <del>a</del> like manner I hope this precious <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Prime
                        Minister</ref> may have <del>th</del> his franking services to me imparted to him as good works, &#8211; for I really do not see any
                    other set off against the black account of his administration. &#8211; These people you know can frank any thing capable of being put
                    under cover &amp; seal, &#8211; &amp; the book in question cannot possibly be too large for this most expeditious mode of conveyance. It
                    will come just in time for my next chapter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Upon looking over the printed sheets of the Register when they arrived the other day, I discovered an interpolation
                    of the Editor (<ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames ">Ballantyne</ref>) by which he had made me subscribe to an eulogium upon
                        M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pitt.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ballantyne had possibly altered Southey&#8217;s observations on
                            a speech praising William Pitt, the Younger (1759&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>) as a &#8216;&#8220;great man&#8221;&#8217;. As published, they read:
                        &#8216;unless it were admitted as a principle that Mr Pitt could do no wrong!&#8217;, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>,
                        1.1 (1810), 97.</note> You would have been well pleased with the letter which I wrote in consequence, requiring him to cancel
                    the leaf. &#8211; a requisition which was immediately complied with &amp; in a way to atone as much as possible for the liberty which
                    had been taken. It is rather a melancholy thing to perceive by what an accident the political character of this book (which will
                    have a circulation beyond any thing of the kind that has ever yet appeared) has been determined. The person engaged for the
                    historical part was a downright courtling &amp; Pittite. I suspect it to have been young Rose,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Either the poet and translator William Steward Rose (1775&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>) or his brother, the
                        diplomatist George Henry Rose (1770&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>). Their father was the Pittite loyalist MP George Rose
                        (1744&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; &amp; indeed am almost certain. His first chapter happened to be so very dull that
                    it frightened the Ballantynes,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>&#8217;s publisher
