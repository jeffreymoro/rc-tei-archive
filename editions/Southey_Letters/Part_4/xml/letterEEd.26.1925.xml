          <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> My influence with the Quarterly Review is not what you seem to suppose it. I have no personal knowledge either of
                    the <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">publisher</ref> or <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">editor</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had not met either man, but he had corresponded with them.</note> never having seen
                    either of them. But were it otherwise, an article designed for that work would not derive any advantage from passing thro my
                    hands. If it be sent up to the publisher, it will be delivered over to the editor, &amp; he will insert it, or not, according to
                    his own judgement. That the article in question should appear in the next number is probably impossible, &#8211; for the arrangements
                    for it must have been compleated by this time. The best method which I can advise is, that the MS should be sent to <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> thro <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John
                        Ballantyne</ref>, who no doubt must have frequent opportunities of sending it, &amp; when I see him, as I shall do soon after
                    my arrival in London, I will repeat your statement, which will certainly have the effect of making him wish to insert a reviewal
                    written for such motives.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lundie did contribute to the <title>Quarterly Review</title>,
                        but not until later. An article on Savings Banks appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816),
                        89&#8211;116.</note> &#8211; I am obliged by your offer of the volume &amp; shall gladly accept it; <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John Ballantyne</ref> will have the goodness to forward it to me
                    with the Register, if it be delivered into his care.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have scarcely had leisiure to cut open the leaves of the Chronicle,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Lundie produced the &#8216;Chronicle&#8217; section of the second volume of the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>.</note> but that
                    cursory inspection makes me incline to think that it will be better for the future to omit every thing of which the substance is
                    to be found in the Annals: it is quite impossible for any person <del>xx</del> but the annalist to do this, &amp; therefore
                    neither you nor I are to blame for any repetitions which may <del>at present</del> be found in these volumes. My task<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title> (1811).</note> has been a very heavy one, &#8211; it has cost me at least three
                    months more than the preceding year, &amp; it is not yet concluded. It is however executed in a manner more satisfactory to myself
                    than that of the preceding year, because I have had ampler materials, especially for the Spanish part &amp; the public must be
                    very unreasonable if they do not perceive that its great increase of length is attributable to the greater number of events to be
                    recorded, not to any prolixity in the writer.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Pray remember me to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Douglas.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dr James Douglas (1775&#8211;1846) of Kelso, an old friend of Southey&#8217;s from Balliol College, Oxford. He had married Frances, daughter of James Robson of Samieston, in
                    Edinburgh, on 10 December 1810. They visited Southey at Keswick in December 1810, shortly after their marriage.</note> It was a very great &amp; unexpected
                    pleasure to me to meet him after an interval of so many years.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I look with much pleasure for <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scotts</ref> poem,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott&#8217;s <title>Vision of Don Roderick</title> (1811), which covered similar territory to that in
                        Southey&#8217;s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> &amp; hope he will be as good a prophet as a poet, for
                    I know he will prophesy of good things. He like myself has had faith in the worst times. &#8211; The recovery of Figueiras,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The fortress of Figueiras had been recaptured by the Spanish on 10 April 1811.</note> which this
                    days paper announces, is the most important event that has happened since the surrender of Dupont;<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pierre-Antoine, Comte Dupont de l&#8217;Etang (1765&#8211;1840), French general, who was defeated by Spanish forces at the
                        Battle of Bailen, 16&#8211;19 July 1808, so ensuring that France would not easily achieve control of Spain.</note> &#8211; except the
                    deliverance of Barcelona it is the most important success which the Spaniards could have obtained.</p>
