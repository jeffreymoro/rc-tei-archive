        <p rend="indent1"> Have you see the Portugueze Magazine set up (as I suppose) in opposition to the Correio?<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Correio Braziliense</title> (also known as the &#8216;Literary Warehouse&#8217;) was a journal in Portuguese.
                        Edited by Hipolito Jose da Costa (1774&#8211;1823), it was printed in London and ran from 1808&#8211;1822. It was critical of the
                        Portuguese monarchy and advocated liberal ideas. Southey possessed a complete set, no. 3203 in the Sale catalogue of his
                        Library. The opposing journal Southey refers to is probably <title>O Investigador Portuguese em Inglaterra</title> (1811&#8211;19),
                        no. 3409 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> I have ordered both.</p>

                    right in playing for a high stake, &amp; I have little doubt of his success. Whether he will be a happier man for succeeding is a
                    very different question. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> begins to talk of wanting a ship when the winter is over.
