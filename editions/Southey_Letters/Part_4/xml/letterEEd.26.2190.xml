        <p rend="indent1"> About the Black Empire<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey had suggested a section on Haiti in the <title>Edinburgh Annual
                            Register, for 1811</title> (1813). It was a &#8216;Black Empire&#8217; because part
                        of it was ruled by Henri I (1767&#8211;1820; King of Haiti 1811&#8211;1820). Haiti was
                        only briefly mentioned in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                        1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 192&#8211;196.</note> I entirely agree with you that it
                    must not find place in the History, as we have not to cut our coat according to
                    our cloth, &#8211; but our cloth according to our coat. There is no room for any work
                    of supererogation. For such works the second volume would be a very fit place,
                    &amp; in those volumes I should be very well disposed to give a series of papers
                    upon the great changes which are going on in the different parts of the world, &#8211;
                    their operating causes, &amp; their probable results. The Black Empire, &#8211; Serra
                    Leona, &#8211; Spanish America, the United States, &#8211; New Holland, &#8211; &amp;c &#8211; would
                    furnish each materials for most interesting speculation &amp; historical review.
                    But I must curtail my projects, instead of extending them, &#8211; for my own
                    historical works upon which so many years of labour have been bestowed, &amp; on
                    which I am fully sensible my future reputation will rest, are standing still. I
                    have promised to prepare a Memoir of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walpoles Life, our
                    envoy for above thirty years at Lisbon:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Walpole (1736&#8211;1810), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
                        Plenipotentiary to Portugal, 1771&#8211;1800. Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Memoir&#8217; was not
                        written.</note> &amp; this will be all I can do for the second volume. I
                    have the whole of his correspondence here, &amp; tremble at the sight of it.
                    However I must have perused it for another purpose. This Memoir will include
                    some interesting matter about Portugal, &amp; will certainly have the effect of
                    selling some copies of the book.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> told me when I was last in
                    town, &amp; all his partners confirmed the opinion, that the sale of the
                    Register would not be diminished a single copy in England by raising the price.
                    I merely tell you this &#8211; because if you have no fear<del>s</del> in Scotland,
                    &amp; they have none in England, I do not see what there is to fear. My own
                    opinion of course is of no weight, as I can have nothing but mere opinion to go
                    by.</p>
