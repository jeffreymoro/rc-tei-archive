                        (November 1809), 319&#8211;337. King Philip&#8217;s War, or Metacom&#8217;s Rebellion, 1675&#8211;1676, was an armed conflict between English

                    more than it is apt to do in these things, I expect to produce something very striking out of the materials. &#8211; Concerning the
