        <p>the letter survives only in a partial transcript in the hand of Henry Crabb
                        Robinson and made by him in &#8216;July 1858&#8217;, Dr Williams&#8217;s Library, London, Crabb Robinson MSS. The letter was possibly amongst
                        the letters from Southey to Duppa that Robinson was given by Duppa&#8217;s niece, Mrs Stone, in January 1844, see Henry Crabb

                            Illustrating the History of Jacobinism</title>, 4 vols (London, 1797&#8211;1798), II, pp. 398&#8211;413, claimed that the cause of the
                        French Revolution lay in a vast international conspiracy by, amongst others, Freemasons; and that the origins of Freemasonry
                        lay in the dualist Manichean religion. The founder of this religion was Mani or Manes (216&#8211;274/7) and Barruel repeated the
                        tradition that Manes had been flayed alive for falsely claiming he could cure the son of Bahram I, Emperor of Persia 273&#8211;276
                        (p. 405). Manes was, in Barruel&#8217;s opinion, &#8216;justly punished for his impostures&#8217; (p. 411).</note>
        </p>
        <p>Among all his proofs as he calls them of a conspiracy there is nothing so like a conspiracy as the journey of my old acquaintance
                    Bryant to Avignon. <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The copperplate engraver and religious visionary William Bryan (dates
                        unknown), at one time a follower of the self-proclaimed prophet Richard Brothers (1757&#8211;1824; <title>DNB</title>). Bryan was
                        probably introduced to Southey in 1794. At this time he may have told Southey of his visit to the occultist Soci&#233;t&#233; des
                        Illumin&#233;s d&#8217;Avignon in 1789, an occasion that Southey related in <title>Letters from England</title>, 3 vols (London, 1807),
                        III, pp. 225&#8211;253.</note> A fact which proves that they had agents in different countries with &lt;xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxx x&gt;
                    funds at their disposal.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">His notion about the Sophisters I cannot believe. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Barruel&#8217;s term for
                        Enlightenment philosophers; he claimed they were another of the key forces in the conspiracy that led to the French
                        Revolution.</note> That about the Manicheans is a little more xxxxable. The total disappearance of their religion is a curious
                    phenomenon in human history. And as their mythology is a very beautiful one and their principles not a whit more absurd than
                    Popery &amp; less so than Calvinism I own that I should not be sorry to see it start up again in some country where <del>is</del>
                    &lt;there was&gt; nothing better. M Baruel thinks it was very right that Manes should be flead alive I am also a little intolerant
                    upon principle as well as the Abbe and my intolerance is of this nature that I would condemn the Abbe for allowing this opinion to
                    have the skin taken off one square inch of his xxxxxxxx</p>
