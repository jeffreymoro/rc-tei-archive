        <p rend="indent1"> First will you intimate to <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> that a reviewal of the
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Docstors</ref> book has been sent to <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref>, &#8211; that it is likely to be very well done &amp; by no means

                    hardly need say that its insertion <del>in</del> would be very gratifying to me,
                    inasmuch as it would be serving the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Docstor</ref>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> No review of Henry

        <p rend="indent1"> Thirdly this delay gives me an opportunity of cancelling the

                    annunciation under the great seal of the Academy &#8211; I have deserved this &amp; am
                    gratified by it accordingly. In due time the Portugueze Academy will probably do
                    the same thing.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Neither the

        <p rend="indent1"> Fourthly, by reason that we are not well served with tea in this
                    place, &amp; that London is a better market for that said, I request you as my

                        was all in a fume/ At the thought of the march to Moscow:/ The Russians, he
                        said, they were undone,/ And the great Fee-Faw-Fum/ Would presently come/
                        With a hop, step, and jump unto London./ For as for his conquering Russia,/
                        However some persons might scoff it,/ Do it he could, and do it he would,/
                        And from doing it nothing would come but good,/ And nothing could call him
                        off it./ Mr. Jeffrey said so, who must certainly know,/ For he was the
                        Edinburgh Prophet./ They all of them knew Mr. Jeffrey&#8217;s Review,/ Which with
                        Holy Writ ought to be reckon&#8217;d:/ It was through think and thin to its party
                        true;/ Its back was buff, and its sides were blue/ Morbleu! Parbleu!/ It
