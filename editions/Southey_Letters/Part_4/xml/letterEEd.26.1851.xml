                    amusement of young &amp; old. They are to be taken such care of, that my grandchildrens grandchildren have a fair chance of having
                    them handed down in high preservation among the other treasures of the family. &#8211; The half binding is very neat &amp; to my taste,
                    &#8211; only my black letter S was understood a little too literally, or rather misunderstood. I did not mean that a common S should be
                    stamped in black, but that a black letter S should be stamped in gilding, &#8211; however this is of no consequence &#8211; &amp; I am
                    exceedingly well pleased with my cargo.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Charles Danvers, 13 November 1810,

        <p rend="indent1"> On the very day that the box came, I received two parcels, &#8211; this was rather vexatious, inasmuch as three pleasures
                    in one day are something like a grand dinner after a public breakfast, &amp; then again a great supper after the dinner, &#8211; more
                    than one has room for. &#8211; The booksellers as I grow more useful to them become more attentive to me in the way of presents, &#8211; which
                    I approve greatly. I have just had Weber&#8217;s Metrical Romances<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Weber (1783&#8211;1818;

                    to something of more consequence than the exposure of his sophistry, &amp; impudent misstatements, whole pages might have been
                    filled upon this topic, for in my life I never perused a controversial book so thoroughly disgraceful to its author. &#8211; Of course
                    you will not like what I have said of Socinianism; &#8211; but I think you will not dislike the manner in which it is said, <del>x</del>
                    &amp; for all that follows respecting Methodism I think you will agree with me. A few passages have been cut out, &#8211; one was of
                    some importance &#8211; as it recommended an approximation to the Methodist system, by restoring the old order of Cathechists,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the Catholic Church, lay people who help instruct children in the basics of the Church&#8217;s
                        teachings.</note> hinted at the adoption of Lay-preachers, &amp; advised that the Clerk<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Parish Clerk, who provided assistance to Anglican clergymen. The Clerk could be full or part-time and duties varied
                        enormously from parish to parish. They might include reading lessons in church, organising the choir, serving at the altar and
                        leading the responses, opening the church, ringing the bell and even digging graves if there was no sexton.</note> should be

                        opposition politicians. After a prolonged controversy the Regency Bill was passed on 5 February 1811, appointing the Prince of
