                    with cut steel buttons, &amp; a sword, administered an oath in which I swore to reveal all treasons which might come to my
                    knowledge, &amp; to obey the Ld Chamberlain upon the Kings service, &amp; in his stead the Vice Chamberlain.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francis Charles Seymour-Conway (1777&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), who, as heir to the Marquessate

                    there is <del>danger</del> &lt;a chance&gt; of delay from a circumstance over which I have no controul. You must know that there

                    engagement is allowed to interfere with such an invitation. I do not think this will happen, &amp; heartily hope that it may not,
                    but it has been suggested by one or two persons that it may, &amp; therefore I cannot venture to take my place in the mail, while
                    there is this possibility of being compelled to lose it. At the worst it will be but a day or two delay, &#8211; bad enough.
                        <del>Xx</del> At the best it exposes me to the chance of not finding a place in the mail when I go to take one after the
                    Levee.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Upon this chance therefore you will give me a few lines by return of post to acknowledge the halfnotes. After
