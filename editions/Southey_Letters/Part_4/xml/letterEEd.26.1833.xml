                        2.1 (1811), 575&#8211;659, relating the defeat of Austria by France in 1809.</note> &#8211; here there is a natural division of the

                    Upon this plan I have kept the press waiting for the last fortnight in hope of obtaining some details respecting the second siege
                    of Zaragoza.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish city of Zaragoza had been twice besieged by in 1808&#8211;1809,
                        falling to the French on 20 February 1809. For Southey&#8217;s account of the second siege, which was noted for its brutality; see
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 508&#8211;527.</note> The four first chapters (all parliamentary
                    matter) are printed as far as they would go without the commencement of the fifth which took up the <del>xx</del> war in Spain.
                    Luckily there was not copy enough in <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames ">Ballantynes</ref> hands to go farther, &amp; by
                    throwing the whole of the peninsular history together at the end of the volume, I shall gain from six to eight or ten weeks, &#8211; in
                    which time information may reach me from Spain &amp; Lisbon.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In this time <del>xxxxxx</del> you could <del>xxxxxxxxxxx</del> learn for me, if you do not already know, whether
                    Gen. Freire was indeed a traitor, or only a weak irresolute man, having neither confidence in his troops nor in himself.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bernardino Freire de Andrade e Castro (1759&#8211;1809), Portuguese general, who commanded the
                        army of Portuguese levies that was formed to meet the French at the Battle of Braga, 20 March 1809. Aware that the position
                        was hopeless, but that if he ordered a retreat he would be murdered by his troops, Freire attempted to slip away to Oporto,
                        but was captured, imprisoned at Braga and then murdered.</note> The stories of his having buried the ammunition, &amp; of
                    papers being found containing his agreement with the French are palpably absurd: but I do not find <del>xxx</del> any intimation
                    that the Regency supposed him innocent, nor can I discern that any steps were taken against the M. de Loule &amp; the other nobles
                    who were sent prisoners to Lisbon<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> Agostinho Domingos Jose de Mendoca Rolim de Moura
                        Barreto (1780&#8211;1824), 1st Marquess of Loul&#233;, was one of a number of officers who were arrested at Braga for being too close to
                        General Freire. He was lucky to escape with his life &#8211; some of his fellow officers were murdered by their troops.</note> when
                    he was put to death, &#8211; so that their guilt remains <del>xx</del> a matter of doubt. What is become of these people? are they,
                    after the old custom, in confinement, &amp; forgotten there? Is it possible to procure a set of the Gazetas<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"> At this time Southey laid the foundation of his 24 volumes of Spanish <title>Gazetas</title>,

                    regularly if they could be sent in parcels two or three times a year &#8211; to get them by way of the post office is too expensive. I
                    have ordered a Spanish paper to the Register&#8217;s account, &amp; it will cost six guineas a year. How full of vaunts the Gazeta will
                    be I am well aware, &#8211; but it must necessarily contain some details &amp; individual facts which would assist me &amp; I am

                        charges were found to be unproven. It had, however, become apparent that his former mistress Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852;

                        himself had known of her actions. For Southey&#8217;s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
