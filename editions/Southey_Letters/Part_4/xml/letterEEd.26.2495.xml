                        Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 30 October 1814, Letter 2494. Southey
                        had enrolled in Gray&#8217;s Inn on 7 February 1797 with the intention of
                        qualifying as a lawyer, but had abandoned his legal studies on his return
                        from Portugal in 1801. Presumably, he had forgotten to inform Gray&#8217;s Inn and
                        was still registered as &#8216;absent&#8217;. The last term he attempted to keep was
                        probably in May 1799.</note> which I will beg you to &lt;correct if needful,
                    &amp; then to&gt; seal &amp; forward it. I do not believe that I was indebted
                    for any Term at Grays Inn; <del>to the best of my recollection</del> the last
                    time I was in the Hall I kept no term, &amp; for this reason, &#8211; a new regulation
                    had been made that three dinners must be eaten instead of one. In intended
                    conformity to this rule I had laid out my time, &amp; secured my place for
                    Bristol in the mail; on the third night <del>of</del> from the commencement of
                    the term. But on going into the Hall the first day I was informed that the three
                    dinners must be eaten in as many half weeks. It did not suit me to alter my
                    arrangements &#8211; &amp; lose my place &#8211; I preferred losing the term, &amp;
                    especially enquired at the time whether any expences would be acquired, &#8211; as I
                    had not yet committed the act of eating, when I was assured not. And I therefore
                    left the Hall, with a distinct understanding that that term was not kept, &amp;
                    not chargeable. &#8211; I do not think this could have been later than May, &#8211; &amp;
                    perhaps could ascertain the point by reference to some letters, &#8211; but 1&#8211;15&#8211;8 &#8211;
                    is not worth the trouble of a dispute.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The sooner you can let me have some money the better, for it is
                    low water with me. &#8211; I am a little uneasy at what you say about <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>. A portion of the article

                    &amp; the concluding portion thro the same channel would be with him today.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s article on Alexander

                    no one else to know) that thro <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C&#8217;s</ref> conduct I have had for some time a serious increase of
                    expense thrown upon me, &#8211; the rent &amp; taxes of his part of the house, &amp;
                    the support of part of his family, &#8211; the whole of what <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref>
