        <p rend="indent1"> You as well as myself have so little leisure for correspondence, that I should not address a letter to you without
                    good &amp; sufficient cause. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George Fricker</ref> you know is here, &#8211; &amp; I dare say

                        died at Greta Hall on 24 June 1813; see Southey to Charles Danvers, 28 June 1813, Letter 2274.</note> He is indeed miserably
                    ill, &amp; has every symptom of pulmonary consumption, except what the expectoration might be expected to furnish: but no matter
                    has yet been expectorated. <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edmondson</ref>, who in the healing art is

                    reach, wishes to know what your opinion was of the primary liver affection; &#8211; your ideas of the case <del>xxxxxxxx</del>, he says,
                    might assist him in forming a more correct opinion of it. He thinks it a very bad case, tho not yet absolutely hopeless. To me it
                    appears desperate. A little while since he had the most violent night sweats, but these &lt;have&gt; been entirely subdued by
                    bleeding. Twice there has been a considerable expectoration of blood since the first h&#230;morrhage, &amp; from the state of his
                    respiration, &amp; the perpetual sense of stricture &amp; fulness of which he complains, more of this is to be apprehended. The
                    lungs are now the chief seat of disease, &#8211; but if this disease should be palliated or suspended, the original affection of the
                    liver remains. Give me I pray you a letter, the first part of which may be for the Doctor upon this subject, &#8211; &amp; the rest for
                    myself. &#8211; He suspects an adhesion.</p>

                    old enough to accompany me. This I have done since Christmas, when a sudden sickness in the midst of dinner without any assignable
                    cause, &#8211; brought on some old feelings <del>xxxxxxxx</del> which I did not like to be reminded of. &#8211; Probably I am the better for
                    this regular exercise, &#8211; in my digestion certainly, which was becoming torpid, &#8211; I am well at present thank God, &#8211; &amp; having
                    learnt at Lisbon to consider pulmonary disease as in some degree infectious I keep as much as possible out of poor <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">Georges</ref> atmosphere; &#8211; indeed it is such as warns one to keep at a distance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In one thing only do I find the effect of years, &#8211; that I can no longer read for the mere amusement of the hour

                    &amp; how much <del>xx</del> there is to be done before night. On this account I should be glad, if it were practicable, to
                    emancipate myself from all periodical work: as that however cannot yet be, I take it in good part &amp; go to it with good will. &#8211;

                    of the characters are got over, &amp; there are parts in it which I am confident you would prefer to any thing of mine. But of its
