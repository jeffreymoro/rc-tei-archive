          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. which I have this evening received offers so fair a prospect of a
                    desirable establishment for <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref>, that it is not necessary for me to say
                    any thing respecting the two former plans which were proposed. Nothing can be more satisfactory than the present arrangement
                    seems. The only inconvenience is that of leaving College during the Vacations, &amp; this we shall find means of obviating. Your
                    opinion respecting the time of his entering &amp; his intermediate studies is perfectly judicious, &amp; shall of course be
                    followed. No youth can promise better, &amp; I have well-founded hopes that he will do honour to his name.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Concerning <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</ref> I have heard that he is writing a book
                    against Unitarianism;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> This is possibly connected to the magnum opus Coleridge announced to
                        Daniel Stuart on 12 September 1814: &#8216;my most important Work, which is printing at Bristol, two of my friends having taken upon
                        them the risk ... The Title is: Christianity the one true Philosophy - or 5 Treatises on the Logos, or communicative

                        (Oxford, 1956&#8211;1971), III, p. 533 and n 2.</note> &amp; that a considerable portion of the manuscript has been seen, which is
                    better proof that he is in earnest about it, than the fact that the Printer<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Gutch</ref>, Bristol printer. In 1817 he was closely involved in the publication of Coleridge&#8217;s <title>Biographia
                            Literaria</title>.</note> has laid in paper for the work. You may perhaps have seen in the Courier, at long intervals from
                    each other, a few letters to Judge Fletcher, under the signature of an Irish Protestant.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The letters &#8216;To Mr. Justice Fletcher&#8217; appeared in the <title>Courier</title> between 20 September and 10 December 1814. They
                        were written in response to <title>The Charge of Judge Fletcher to the Grand Jury of the County of Wexford, at the Summer
                            Assizes, August 5, 1814</title> (1814), by William Fletcher (d. 1823), Fourth Justice of Common Pleas in Ireland. Fletcher
                        had strongly criticised the <title>Courier</title>&#8217;s account of affairs in Ireland and in particular accused them of inventing
                        an attack on him by a mob.</note> These letters are certainly his. Impossible as it is to depend upon him, I never
                        <del>lose</del> wholly give up the hope that in some fit of exertion he may produce something worthy of the powers with which
                    he has been gifted, &#8211; powers which considering their variety as well as their extent, exceed those of any person whom it has ever
                    been my fortune to meet with. &#8211; I do not mean to extenuate his total disregard of all duties, &#8211; but it must be some consolation to
                    you to know that those persons who have been most intimately connected with him during the last twenty years, who best know his
                    conduct &amp; have most <del>reason</del> cause to deplore &amp; to condemn it, retain for him thro all a degree of affection
                    which it is not easy to express.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I need not say that <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> S. Coleridge</ref> is sincerely
                    thankful for your brotherly kindness. She unites with me &amp; <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
