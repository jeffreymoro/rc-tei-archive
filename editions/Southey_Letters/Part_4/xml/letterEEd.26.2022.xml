                        Galloway Kirkpatrick, &#8216;The Letters of Robert Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826&#8217; (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp.

        <p rend="indent1"> I suppose Senhora your letter has given me some vexation, if the utter astonishment into which it has thrown me
                    would as yet let me feel it. &#8212; but you know when a man is knocked down in battle, the blow prevents him from feeling the wound. If
                    you fancied in any expression of mine that you perceived the language of wounded pride &amp; wounded feeling, &#8212; in your fancy
                    alone could it possibly have existed. Nature has given me enough of both, but time has taught me not to make a fool&#8217;s use of the
                    one, &amp; the other being of the right kind, has never been in any danger of being misdirected. What I said, I do not remember; &#8212;
                    for it was in perfect good-humour &amp; forgotten as soon as said; &#8212; but whatever it was, the Devil take to, I say now, &amp; no
                    farther comment will I make upon it. You ought to have known that I neither could have been offended myself or have intended to
                    hurt you, &#8212; &amp; you ought to be cart&#8217;s-tailed for not knowing it, &amp; waggon&#8217;s-tailed for chewing the cud of your anger for
                    ten days. Enough, &amp; too much of this.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The nature of this disagreement is not
                        clear.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot tell what you mean about Ennerdale<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ennerdale, a small lake
                        southwest of Derwentwater. The identity of the estate at Ennerdale being discussed is unclear.</note> &#8212; all I know is that it
                    was sold for 7000&#163;, which was thought a good bargain, &amp; that if I had been rich I would have bought it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is a criticism upon <ref target="people.html#SewardAnna">Miss Seward&#8217;s</ref> letters in the British Review
                    which undervalues both them &amp; her. Perhaps you have not seen this journal, which is one from the <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Long-Man&#8217;s</ref> manufactory.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
