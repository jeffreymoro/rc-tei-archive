        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter gave me no little pleasure, for tho I have the happy faculty of caring nothing for any thing that can
                    be said against me in prose or rhyme, I am exceedingly gratified when those whom I esteem are satisfied with my works. Doubtless
                    it would have been a great advantage to me if while I was employed upon the Annals for 1808,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810).</note> I could have <del>been</del> had opportunities of conversing
                    with you, &amp; other persons <del>who</del> capable of giving me authentic information &amp; correcting those erroneous opinions
                    into which it is so easy to fall when <del>your</del> ones judgement is formed upon partial or imperfect statements. In many
                    instances I am sure I should have derived this benefit from you. You have now shown me that the subordinate changes made by the
                    last Administration were not unprecedented,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 5, had alleged that the Ministry of 1806&#8211;1807 (of which Wynn
                        had been a member) had undertaken a wholesale change in public appointments, to make room for &#8216;a set of hungry
                        partizans&#8217;.</note> &#8211; which the newspapers &amp; common report had taught me to believe. I <del>xxxxxxxxx</del> &lt;do not
                    think&gt; that the precedent justifies the measure, &#8211; but assuredly had this been known to me I would have taken care that the
                        <del>assertion</del> &lt;statement&gt; should have been correct. With regard to Egypt &amp; the Dardanelles I do not perceive
                    any difference between us in reality. Both expeditions failed, &amp; both from misconduct, which misconduct never was investigated
                    &amp; fixed upon the right person. I was always of opinion that Egypt ought to have been occupied &#8211; not Alexandria alone. But for
                    Constantinople the project itself seems not to have been well considered, &amp; with such an Admiral &amp; such an Ambassador to
                    put it in execution, &#8211; little else was to have been expected.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Britain was at war with the
                        Ottoman Empire, 1807&#8211;1809, and the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 54&#8211;58 dealt with the
                        parliamentary debates on the heavily criticised British naval expedition to the Dardenelles in 1806&#8211;1807. The Fleet was under
                        the command of Admiral Sir John Duckworth (1747&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>), though he had to co-operate with Charles Arbuthnot
                        (1767&#8211;1850; <title>DNB</title>), British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire 1804&#8211;1807. Although part of the Ottoman Fleet was
                        destroyed, the British force was unable to compel the Empire to end its alliance with France. In March&#8211;September 1807 British
                        troops occupied Alexandria in the hope of putting further pressure on the Ottomans, to no avail. Southey only mentioned this
                        expedition in passing, labelling it &#8216;disgraceful and disastrous&#8217;, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1
                        (1810), 3.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> These however are topics which I have done with. Give me any information respecting 1809 &amp; passing events,
                    &amp; you shall perceive that your views &amp; opinions will always have great weight with me, whether they accord with my own or
                    not. My Spanish fever as you call it continues unabated, &#8211; &amp; is I flatter myself, a much more hopeful disease than the French
                    ague with which so large a part of the opposition were seized when Buonaparte entered Spain. I am in the midst of Spanish affairs,
                    &amp; greatly distressed for details of the second siege of Zaragoza<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish city of
                        Zaragoza was twice besieged by the French in 1808&#8211;1809. The death toll was over 54,000 before it finally fell on 20 February
                        1809.</note> &amp; <del>for</del> of that of Gerona.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The city of Gerona had fallen to

                        as commander-in-chief of the British army in the wake of allegations that he had profited from office trafficking. After a
                        lengthy investigation, the charges were found to be unproven. It had, however, become apparent that his former mistress Mary
                        Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>) had received money from individuals keen for her to use her influence with the
