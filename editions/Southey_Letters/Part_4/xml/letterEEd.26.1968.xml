            <title>Matthew</title>, 6: 13.</note> &#8211; To live in London would be to me so great &lt;an&gt; evil, <del>xxxx</del> that
                    &lt;it&gt; would taint all my enjoyments; &#8211; &amp; to have the usufruct of the Museum Library is the greatest temptation which
                    could possibly have been offered to me.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francis Douce (1757&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>) had
                        resigned as Keeper of Manuscripts at the British Museum in April 1811. The post was in the gift of the Archbishop of
                        Canterbury, The Speaker and the Lord Chancellor. Southey considered applying for the post, but did not do so.</note> You have
                    seen my letter to <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The letter to

I should else have said something more about the office of Historiographer<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>), a French Protestant, held the post of
                        Historiographer Royal until his death on 23 May 1812. Southey&#8217;s campaign for the post proved unsuccessful and it went to one
                        of his particular b&#234;tes noires, James Stanier Clarke (c. 1765&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>).</note> on which
                    I have fixed my eye. It is not to be supposed that I could have that &amp; the Mus. at the same time, &amp; it cannot be doubted
                    that that is the best thing of the two, for tho the salary is the same &amp; there are no &amp;cs, there is likewise no duty
                    expected, &amp; no confinement. Besides the title would be of direct advantage to me. Now of this I think myself tolerably secure
                    whenever M. Dutens furnishes a conclusion to his Memoirs.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. when Dutens died.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref> will ask it for me, &#8211; which is enough if things remain as they are.
                    On the other side <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> would obtain it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> 400&#163; a year, if liable to the same deductions as my pension, which I suppose it is, is frittered down to 280. the
                    labour of three hours a day, required for cataloguing, if given to the booksellers, would produce twice that sum. It is not that
                    cataloguing would be unpleasant work. &#8211; far from it, &#8211; <del>xxx</del> that kind of desultory employment <del>which</del> is as
                    good as idleness: but considering the objects which I have before me I ought not to allow time for any such (comparatively)
                    unworthy employment. Even now I find it necessary to abstain from reading many things because there is not time for it. Did my
                    ways &amp; means afford it, I would give up the Quarterly for the same reason, tho <hi rend="ital">there</hi> it is that I am best
                    paid &amp; that I obtain most reputation. &#8211; so ill are these rewards apportioned in our present state of things! &#8211; But it cannot
                    be doubted that it is better to write even such miscellanies as these, than to employ the same time in cataloguing, &amp; three
                    hours a day throughout the year, is nearly if not entirely as much as the Review &amp; the Register cost me. Granted that a few
                    years would get thro the Catalogue I have not a few years to spare. &#8211; You know what a series of historical <del>work</del>
                    &lt;labour&gt; lies before me, &#8211; if it be compleated it will place me far above all the historians whom this country has produced,
                    &amp; I must not let any thing which can be avoided impede the completion, from this time forward.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am of course strongly attached to this place of residence, &#8211; which you would not wonder at if you had seen it.
                    Nevertheless a less lovely country would satisfy me, but it must be country, for my own sake &amp; that of the children. I cannot
                    bear to confine either them or myself within the walls of London. As for the Mus. Gardens &amp; such other places they would be to
                    us like a sod to <del>xxx</del> &lt;a&gt; Lark in a cage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I would willingly come nearer to you, so as to be within an easy days distance, &amp; to this I look forward. The
                    first term of my lease expires in five years. perhaps by that time it may be in my power to remove. Meantime however a yearly
                    journey for myself is nothing. A month in town &amp; a week in travelling I can well spare.</p>
