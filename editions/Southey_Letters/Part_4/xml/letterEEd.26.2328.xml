        <p rend="indent1"> Here I am thank God, by my own fire side, &amp; at my own desk
                    once more. I left as I expected my cold in the coach, in confirmation of an old
                    theory of <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref> that such
                    complaints are to be cured by abstraction of heat.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Thomas Beddoes, <title>Hygeia: or Essays Moral and
                            Medical, on the Causes Affecting the Personal State of Our Middling and
                            Affluent Classes</title>, 3 vols (London, 1802&#8211;1803), II, pp.
                        72&#8211;75.</note> The first night the weather was severe, the coach had plenty
                    of crannies giving free ingress to the freezing atmosphere, &amp; a stupid old
                    woman bound for Doncaster was my only companion. In spire of my <hi rend="ital">body clothes</hi> I was colder than I liked, at breakfast however I got a
                    good warming, &amp; continued to keep it up the rest of the journey, the coach
                    filling as it advanced on its journey. I found all at home as well as could be
                    wished, &#8211; &amp; even <ref target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref> had not forgotten me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Among the things which were left undone on Friday after we
                    parted, in consequence of the rain, were two easy commissions which you can
                    execute on my behalf. The first is to purchase two little-childrens volumes by
                    the title of Original Poems for Infant Minds,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ann (1782&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>) and Jane Taylor

                            Minds</title> (1804&#8211;1805).</note> which you may remember I did <hi rend="ital">not</hi> buy in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Martins Lane because the
                    volumes were not uniformly bound, &#8211; &amp; <del>go</del> &lt;leave&gt; them in my
                    name at Rickmans for &#8216;Little Anne&#8217;.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Ann Rickman (b. 1808).</note> &#8211; The other is to send to the same house a box
                    of the cedar bricks for her sister Frances,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ann&#8217;s younger sister, Frances (dates unknown).</note>
                    &amp; tell <ref target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
                        Rickman</ref> that Frances must learn with those bricks to build a house for

                    see her next.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> And when you pay the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Docstor</ref> the 15 &#163;
