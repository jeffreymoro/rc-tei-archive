        <p rend="indent1"> I am one of those lucky people who find their business their amusement, &amp; contrive to do more by having half a
                    dozen things in hand at once, than if <del>any</del> employed upon any single one of them. It is the <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Printers</ref> fault that you have not &lt;ere this&gt; seen the best of my labours in a
                    &#8216;tangible shape,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The phrase had been used by Charles Philip Yorke (1764&#8211;1834;
                            <title>DNB</title>) in a Commons debate on 27 January 1809 about the accusations of corruption brought against Frederick,
                        Duke of York (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>), Commander-in-Chief of the Army 1798&#8211;1810, 1811&#8211;1827, and soon became a political
                        joke.</note> &#8211; such however are his delays, that more proof sheets are likely to visit you, before you receive the collected
                        volume<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title>

                    which I have collected a considerable quantity of materials, have pretty well mapped out the arrangement, &amp; am proceeding with
                    the straight forward narration. There are a few books still wanting which are of more importance to one chapter, &amp; for these I
                    have advertised at the end of my Preface.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey, <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3
                        vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), I, p. [vi].</note> So many offers have been made me of books which I did not want, that this method
                    may very probably bring in some of those which I do. &#8211; They have printed only five sheets of the Register, &amp; have about five
                    more in their hands, &#8211; my part of <del>that</del> &lt;the&gt; labour is half done, &#8211; when they jog me with another proof, I, shall
                    take another heat, &amp; without hurrying myself <del>wr</del> can write a sheet a week <del>that</del> &lt;which&gt; is as fast
                    as they will print it, leaving my evenings (the best portion of the writers day) for other calls. You will like what I have said
                    concerning the Catholick Question,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. the question of Catholic emancipation. For
                        Southey&#8217;s anti-emancipation views, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), esp. 131&#8211;133.</note> &amp;
                    not dislike the way in which I have <del>xx</del> discharged a little of my gall upon the Foxites, the Peace-mongers, &amp; Mr

                    engagement. They give me 400 &#163; &#8211; for it, &amp; if it continues two or three years (which I believe rests wholly with myself) it
                    will <del>set me y</del> make me altogether at ease in circumstances, for by that time my property in <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> hands will have <del>cle right</del> cleared itself, &#8211; the Constable will
