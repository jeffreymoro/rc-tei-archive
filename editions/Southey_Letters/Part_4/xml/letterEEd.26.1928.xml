                    Nicolson,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Mr Nicholson (dates unknown), a Keswick resident who handled
                    Peachy&#8217;s affairs in the locality.</note> &amp; your message to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                    Clarke.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Mr Clarke. Unidentified.</note> The former continues much in the same state
                    as when you last heard from me; there is no immediate danger of his being worse,
                    &amp; I fear no probability of his ever being better. I was upon the island a
                    few weeks ago, &amp; so seldom have I been there that the growth of the trees
                    seemed to alter the place almost as much to my eyes, as it would do to yours. I
                    told Rhodes<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rhodes. Unidentified.</note> you might perhaps come down &amp; that you
                    hoped to find it in order, &#8211; &amp; this produced an expression of regret from
                    him that the grass was growing for hay, because it would require two or three
                    mowings, he said, to make it look well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will have seen by the newspapers that we have lost poor <ref target="people.html#BunburyHenryWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                        Bunbury</ref>, who seems to have died of premature old age at 61. He is
                    buried in the church here. This melancholy occasion, brought down <ref target="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">his
                    son</ref>, whom I had not seen for nineteen years, since we
                    slept in the same room at Westminster. I cannot <del>now</del> conceive the boy
                    whom I knew then, &amp; the man whom I met <del>to</del> now to be the same
                    individual, so total is the change &#8211; he was then about four years my junior, a
                    beautiful boy, precisely the ideal of a Queens page, as he was. He now looked as
                    if he was several years my elder, with at least as many grey hairs, &amp; a
                    countenance on which the cares of business had left stronger furrows, &#8211; than I
                    ever discovered in the operation of shaving. But I have seldom met with a man
                    whose conversation was more delightful. His official situation gives him, of
                    course, great means of information, <del>of</del> which his strong understanding
                    enables him to display to the best advantage. He means to finish <del>x</del>
                    the house which his father was building, &amp; let it for the present, &#8211; telling
                    me when he went away, that it would not surprize him if he found himself in the
                    course of a [MS illegible] my neighbour. A very desirable one indeed he would
                    prove.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The reason why I have not replied sooner to your last favour has
                    been that I waited till I could speak with as much certainty as this uncertain
                    world allows of my movements southwards. This I can now do. &#8211; If no untoward
                    circumstances should prevent <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Southey</ref> &amp; myself purpose to set off on

                    expedition over the Bridges.</p>

                        <title>Taunton Courier</title> on 18 April 1811. His main heir was William
                    Oliver (1775&#8211;1830) of Hope Corner, Taunton, while much of the remainder went to
                    his servant Tom (dates and surname unknown).</note> The acquisition cannot sit easier

                    [MS illegible] has been unnatural &amp; cruel towards her. I shall go to Taunton

                    perfectly decisive upon the subject.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Theodore Koster, <title>A Short

                    incapable of being kept at a fixed price, but that its value must depend upon
                    the proportion between the consumption &amp; supply; &#8211; thus, to my judgement,
