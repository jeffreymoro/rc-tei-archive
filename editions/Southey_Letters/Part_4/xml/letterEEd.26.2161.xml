                    it not in reply to the most important part of that which I have just received.
                    The <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora</ref> says it is
                    useless for her to write, unless she could <del>encourage you</del> &lt;explain

                    will without delay transmit the case to him &amp; procure for you the
                    prescription.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have begun a transcript of Pelayo<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The early name for <title>Roderick, the Last of the

                    but I begin it now that it may serve your honour, &amp; as soon as you can open
                    a channel of franking, you shall have the first two books, &amp; the rest in
                    sequence with as little delay as possible. I have begun the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book. The <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora</ref> who is my touch-stone, commends the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> much. <del>The</del> My progress <del>x</del> &lt;in&gt; a poem
                    like this, as far as plan is concerned, is very much like <del>that of the</del>
                    what I had many opportunities of seeing in Spain, &#8211; the opening of <del>a xx

                    a dim outline is all, &#8211; &amp; objects for some time appear just as imagination
                    shapes them, &#8211; their forms change as the dawn advances, till at last
                        <del>every</del> &lt;all&gt; things <del>appear as</del> &lt;settle into&gt;

        <p rend="indent1"> It is now in that state that it would be easy for me to finish it
                    during the winter, if other things <del>of</del> which weigh heavier <del>in
                        the</del> among the Ways &amp; Means could be laid aside. However I look
                    forward with good hope, &amp; think it may go to press in twelve months from
                    this time, &#8211; if I live &amp; do well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Shall I call it Roderick the Last of the Goths, &#8211; or, Spain
