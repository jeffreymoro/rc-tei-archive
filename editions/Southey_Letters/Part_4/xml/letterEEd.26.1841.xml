          <l rend="indent3"> Twelve months they sojournd in their solitude,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And then beneath the burthen of old age</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Romano sunk. No brethren were there here</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To spread the sackcloth, &amp; with ashes strew</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That penitential bed, &amp; stand around</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To sing his requiem, &amp; with prayer &amp; psalm</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Assist him in his hour of agony.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> On the bare earth he lay, which long had been</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His only couch, beside him Roderick knelt,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Moistend from time to time his feverish lips,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Receivd a blessing in his latest breath.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Then closd his eyes, &amp; by the nameless grave</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of the fore tenant of that holy place,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Consignd him earth to earth.</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> Two graves are here</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And Roderick transverse at their feet begins</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To break the third. In all his intervals</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of prayer, save only when he searchd the woods</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And filld the watercruise, he labourd there,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And when the work was done, &amp; he had laid</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Himself at length within its narrow sides,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And measured it, he shook his head to think</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> There was no other business for him;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Poor wretch! thy bed is ready, he exclaim&#8217;d</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And would that night would come! . It was a task</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> All gloomy as it was, which had beguild</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The sense of solitude; but now he felt</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The burthen of the solitary hours;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The silence of that lonely hermitage</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Lay on him like a spell, &amp; at the voice</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of his own prayers, he started half-aghast.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Then too as on Romano&#8217;s grave he sate</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And pored upon his own, a painful thought</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Arose within him, &#8211; well might he have spard</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That useless toil! the sepulchre would be</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> No hiding place for him; no christian hands</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Were here who should compose his decent corps,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And cover it with earth; &#8211; there he might drag</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His wretched body its passing hour</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And there the sea birds of her heritage</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Would rob the worm, &#8211; or peradventure seize</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Ere death had done its work, their helpless prey</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Even now they did not fear him; if he walked</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Beside them on the beach, regardlessly</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> They saw his coming, &amp; their whirring wings</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Upon the height had sometimes fannd his cheek,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> As if, being thus alone, humanity</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had lost its rank, &amp; the prerogative</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of man was done away.</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> For his last crown</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And sceptre, never had he felt a thought</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of pain, &#8211; repentance had no pangs to spare</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For trifles such as these, &#8211; the loss of these</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Was a cheap penalty, that he had fallen</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Down to the lowest depth of wretchedness,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His hope &amp; consolation. But to lose</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His human station in the scale of things, &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To see brute nature scorn him &amp; renounce</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Which never from the hour when to the grave</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Rusilla laid aside, but in her face</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> She broke her bonds, &amp; lo her form was</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Radiant in arms she stood; a bloody cross</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Gleamd on her breast-plate, in her shield displayed</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A Lion seemd to ramp; her helmed head</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> With towers, &amp; in her dreadful hand the sword</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Red as a fire brand blazed. Anon the tramp</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of horsemen &amp; the din of multitudes</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Moving to mortal conflict rung around,</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> War-cries &amp; tumult, strife &amp; hate &amp; rage</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Blasphemous prayers, confusion, agony,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Rout &amp; pursuit &amp; death, &amp; over all</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The shout of victory, Spain &amp; Victory</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Roderick, for the strong vision mastered him</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Rushd to the fight rejoicing; starting then</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> As his own effort burst the charm of sleep</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He found himself upon that lonely grave</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In moonlight &amp; in silence.</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> But the dream</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Worked in him still, for still he felt his heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Pant, &amp; his withered arm was trembling still</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And still that voice was in his ears which called</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Jesus for his sake. Oh might he hear</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That actual voice!. &amp; if Rusilla lived</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> If shame &amp; anguish for his crimes, not yet</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had brought her to the grave, sure she would bless</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her penitent child, &amp; pour with his heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Prayers &amp; forgiveness which like precious balm</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Would heal the wounded soul. Nor to herself</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Less precious or less feeling, would the voice</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That spake forgiveness flow; she wept her son</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For ever lost, cut off with all the weight</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of unrepented sin upon his head,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sin that had weighd a nation down, &#8211; what joy</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To know that righteous Heaven had in its wrath</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Remembered mercy, &amp; she yet might meet</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The child, whom she had borne, redeemd in heaven!</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The sudden impulse of this thought confirmd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His unacknowledged purpose, which till then</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Vainly had sought its end. He girt his loins,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Laid blessed Marys image in a cleft</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of the rock, where sheltered from the element</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> It might abide, till happier days came on,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> From all defilement safe; &#8211; pourd his last prayer</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Upon Romanos grave, &amp; kissd the earth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which coverd his remains, &#8211; &amp; wept as if</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> At long leave-taking, then began his way.</l>
