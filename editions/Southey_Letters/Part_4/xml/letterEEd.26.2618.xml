        <p rend="indent1"> You cannot think of me more frequently, nor more affectionately than I do of you. These recollections begin to have
                    an autumnal shade of feeling, &amp; habitually joyous as my spirits are, I believe, that if we were now too meet, my first impulse
                    would be to burst into tears. I was not twenty when we parted, &amp; one &amp; twenty years have elapsed since that time. Of the
                    men with whom I lived at Oxford <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> &amp; yourself are all that are left. <ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Seward</ref> is in heaven. <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Charles Collins</ref> is dead, <ref target="people.html#AllenRobert">Robert Allen</ref> is
                    dead, <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> is dead. I have lost sight of all the rest: And chance that throws
                    strangers in my way by scores every summer, has never yet brought a single person whom I knew at College, except Douglas, who
                    having succeeded to his patrimony at Kelso, &amp; settled there as a physician, brought a bride here for two days, some three or
                    four years ago.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dr James Douglas (1775&#8211;1846) of Kelso, an old friend of Southey&#8217;s from Balliol College, Oxford. He had married Frances,
                        daughter of James Robson of Samieston, in Edinburgh, on 10 December 1810 and visited Southey shortly afterwards; see Southey
                        to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 14 December 1810, Letter 1839.</note> The elder Moncrieffe is dead in consequence of hard
                    drinking. He had an official situation at Malta, &amp; having destroyed his constitution embarked for England as a last hope,
                    about two years since. Before he arrived there came tidings that the plague was at Malta, &#8211; his ship was put in quarantine, &amp;
                    he died in consequence, literally dying in sight of land where his life might certainly have been prolonged, &amp; possibly saved
                    if he <del>coul</del> could have landed.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Wellwood Moncrieff had died on 5
                        September 1813. The eldest son of Sir Henry Wellwood Moncrieff, 8th Baronet (1750&#8211;1826; <title>DNB</title>), he had been His
                        Majesty&#8217;s Advocate in the Admiralty Court at Malta.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My family continues in number the same as when you heard from me last. I am <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">my sons</ref> schoolmaster, &amp; in the process am recovering my Greek, which I had begun
                    to forget at Balliol. How long I may continue to abide here is uncertain; the first term of my lease will expire in the spring of
                    1817, &#8211; if I do not <del>go</del> remove then I must remain for another seven years, &amp; I am far too sensible of the insecurity
                    of life to look beyond that time. Having many inducements to remove nearer London, &amp; many to remain where I am, the trouble
                    &amp; enormous expense of moving (for I have not less than 5000 books) will very probably turn the scale, &#8211; certainly they will
                    weigh heavy in it. It is not that I have any business in London as Poet Laureate; &#8211; that office imposes upon me no such necessity;
                    &#8211; it only requires as a matter of decorum that when I happen to be there I should sometimes attend a Levee, &#8211; especially on the
                        birth-day.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Prince Regent&#8217;s birthday, 12 August.</note> But it is not expected that
                    I should make a journey for this purpose, &amp; accordingly I have never been at Court since I kissed hands upon my
                        appointment.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> This event occurred on 11 November 1813.</note>

                    you may have a clear month to enjoy yourself among these Lakes &amp; Mountains? You would bear away with you recollections which
                    would always give you pleasure, &#8211; for you have never seen any thing like this country, &#8211; the finest parts of Devonshire bear no
                    resemblance to it. The stages are Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester &amp; Kendal, each an easy days journey for one who may not
                    prefer night-travelling. And a <del>coach</del> daily coach from Kendal arrives in <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>
                    at twelve in the noon. &#8211; I who think expedition the best economy, have come from Bristol to this house always in 43 hours. Make me
                    a visit &#8211; &amp; I will faithfully return it hereafter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have just been reading the Ludus Literarius of my friend <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell</ref>, &#8211; happy is the schoolmaster who profits by it, &amp; reforms his school upon the Madras system.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Andrew Bell, <title>Elements of Tuition, Part III: Ludus Literarius, the Classical and
                            Grammar School</title> (1815), a Madras system (i.e. one in which advanced students were used to instruct more junior
                        pupils) for teaching the classical languages, originally formulated by Bell in 1808.</note> I pray you give the subject a
                    serious consideration. The only real obstacle is the want of initiatory books, but they would be very easily made, &amp; I believe
                    that very few pieces of literary labour would be so largely repaid. It is <hi rend="ital">quite certain</hi> that his system
                    removes 99 parts in 100 of the miseries both of the schoolboys &amp; the schoolmaster.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My chief literary employment at present is in finishing the History of Brazil, the last volume of which is about

        <p rend="indent1"> Thus Lightfoot my life passes, as uniformly &amp; as laboriously as yours, there is one difference in your favour,
                    &#8211; you perhaps look on to an end of your labour, &#8211; which I never must do till my right hand forget its cunning. But I am very
                    happy, &amp; I dare say so are you. The chearful man&#8217;s a King,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Isaac Bickerstaff

                    King, &amp; if this be true, both you &amp; I are royal by nature. If you had a large round hole opposite your door, &amp; I lived
                    near you, I should be as much inclined to throw stones thro that hole for the sake of hearing them rattle against the door as I
