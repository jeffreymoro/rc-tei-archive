        <p rend="indent1"> You once told me a most interesting story of two Welshmen who endeavoured to effect La Fayettes release.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was mistaken as to the would-be rescuers identity. The story that was published was of a
                        Hanoverian and an American who in 1794 had attempted to free Marie-Paul-Joseph-Roch-Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette
                        (1757&#8211;1834) from his imprisonment at Olmutz; see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.2 (1811),
                        514&#8211;525.</note> I wish you would give me the particulars of that story, for I have an opportunity of introducing it where it
                    would have a striking effect &#8211; suppressing the names of the parties or not as you may think proper. It is a circumstance so truly
                    honourable to British feeling that it would do my heart good to record it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Register sells well in Scotland &amp; in consequence <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref>
                    has offered me a twelfth share in it for &#163;209. &#8211; the profits upon which are &#163;80. By means of this work &amp; of the Quarterly I am
                    beginning to see fair weather. My books in <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> hands I can now leave to clear
                    off some long arrears there; &#8211; &amp; I have paid <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> 100&#163; in part of a debt
                    contracted &lt;chiefly&gt; for my brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry&#8217;s</ref> education.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John May, 9 August 1810, Letter 1799.</note> This arrangement with <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref> was too favourable to be let pass, &#8211; &amp; by postponing my journey to
                    London for six months I am enabled to conclude it. The other proprietors attribute the success of the work in great measure to me,
                    &amp; this offer of theirs is evidently meant to tie me to its continuance by involving my own interests in it. <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</ref> it seems served it greatly, by calling upon <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn  ">Ballantyne</ref> (for the first time in his life) to pronounce a formal approbation of
                    the historical part, tho he differed from most of the opinions expressed in it. This that Gog-minimus would never have done had he
                    suspected me to be the author, but <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn  ">B.</ref> tells me it is amusing to hear how vaguely
                    &amp; absurdly the author is guest. I wonder at this, &#8211; because I make no secret of that &#8211; or of any thing else which I write,
                    &amp; because it bears pretty strong marks of its father.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am busy upon the second volume. The D of Yorks business will occupy a long chapter.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>) had been forced to resign
                        as commander-in-chief of the British army in the wake of allegations that he had profitted from office trafficking. After a
                        lengthy investigation, the charges were found to be unproven. It had, however, become apparent that his former mistress Mary
                        Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>) had received money from individuals keen for her to use her influence with the
                        Duke, and that the Duke himself had known of her actions. For Southey&#8217;s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 109&#8211;301.</note> You must know something of Wardles<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle (c. 1761&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), MP for Okehampton 1807&#8211;1812, had played a central role in exposing
                        the Duke of York and Mary Anne Clarke&#8217;s alleged involvement in office trafficking. However, his own reputation was quickly
                        sullied by counter-charges from Clarke, alleging corruption and conspiracy. Wynn&#8217;s elder brother, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn
                        (1772&#8211;1840), knew Wardle as they had served together in Ireland in 1797&#8211;1798 in the &#8216;Ancient British Fencibles&#8217;. On 30 August
                        1810 Charles Watkin Williams Wynn replied to Southey: &#8216;until last year I had no doubt of his [Wardle&#8217;s] honour or integrity.
                        He had lived certainly rather a debauched life but not more so than many others &#8230; Of the falsehood of many of Mrs Clarke&#8217;s
                        allegations &#8230; I have not a particle of doubt, but enough remains to have altered my opinion respecting him &#8230; Wardle may be a
                        rogue but I am sure he is also an enthusiast and blinds himself to his own misconduct&#8217;, NLW MS 4814D.</note> prior history &#8211;
                    tell me whether it justifies me in thinking ill of him &#8211; as I am strongly inclined to do. Is he <hi rend="ital">the</hi> Wardle
                    who ran a poney against the Exeter mail in 1807 &#8211; or the year before?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In one of the more

                        Exeter, the pony winning by 45 minutes. Readers were informed that the pony was &#8216;accustomed to drink ale and beer, and frequently drank a
