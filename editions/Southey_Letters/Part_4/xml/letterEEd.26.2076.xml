          <salute>My Dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I lose no time in replying to your letter, though the point upon
                    which you consult me is one upon which your own opinion is sufficient. In
                    matters of business nothing is so desirable as to deal with persons of whom we
                    think well. I, myself, have full confidence in <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans&#8217;</ref> house, as is, indeed,
                    apparent by my long connection with them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We were, indeed, improvident in ever adding to the &#8220;Remains,&#8221; but
                    it was a very excusable error, arising from a desire to make the work as
                    complete as possible.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Corrected,
                        expanded 4th and 5th editions of the <title>Remains of Henry Kirke
                            White</title> had appeared in 1810 and 1811.</note> However, something
                    no doubt may yet be gleaned, and this letter<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> What the letter contained is unknown.</note> of which
                    you speak is an earnest one. There is no danger of incurring the charge of
                    book-making; &#8220;Illustrations&#8221; being the title, the purchaser knows that he is
                    buying embellishments for the &#8220;Remains,&#8221; and the additional pieces which he may
                    find there are so much clear gain. It would be needless to send me the
                    &#8220;Illustrations of Scott,&#8221; of which you speak. I have seen some, and perhaps the
                    one which you may mean, and I know the nature of such publications.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Neville White seems to have proposed a
                        volume of prints of places celebrated in his brother&#8217;s poems. This was
                        intended to complement and capitalise on the popularity of Henry Kirke
                        White&#8217;s <title>Remains</title>. Neville White&#8217;s model was probably
                            <title>Illustrations of Walter Scott&#8217;s Lay of the Last Minstrel:
                            Consisting of Twelve Views on the Rivers Bothwick, Ettrick, Yarrow,
                            Tiviot, and Tweed: with Anecdotes and Descriptions</title> (1810). This
                        had been published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, which in turn might
                        explain Neville White&#8217;s determination to move publication of future editions
                        of the <title>Remains</title> away from the congerie headed by Vernor, Hood
                        and Sharpe. See also Robert Southey to Neville White, 18 March 1812, Letter
                        2062.</note> Nothing need be done to the new edition.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The sixth edition of the <title>Remains</title>,
                        published in 1813, contained no new material, though the order of contents
                        in the first volume changed slightly.</note> The fortune of the book is
                    made, and I am not surprised at the price for which the share sold.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Presumably, the share in the
                            <title>Remains</title> owned by Vernor, Hood and Sharpe and sold to
                        Longman.</note> No doubt the value will rise, and become equal to any of our
                    standard books.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have no time to reply to the other parts of your letter, save
                    only to congratulate you on <ref target="people.html#WhiteJames">James&#8217;s</ref> progress.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> James
                        White was an undergraduate at Cambridge; see Southey to James White,
                        16 February 1812, Letter 2040.</note> I never doubted that he would do well,
                    if he only hoped <hi rend="ital">enough,</hi> and did not work too <hi rend="ital">much.</hi> Two hours a day to mathematics is as much as he ever
                    ought to give it. My advice to a young collegian would always be, &#8220;Do not be too
                    ambitious of University honours;&#8221; they are like provincial tokens, which pass
                    current only upon the spot, and have only a temporary value there. Even there a
                    man makes his way by the weight of his general character for conduct, ability,
                    and acquirements. But this would lead me further than I have leisure to follow
                    it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am disappointed at your change of resolution. But it depends
                    wholly upon circumstances, and no doubt will change again as they brighten upon
                    you. God bless you,</p>

          <salute rend="indent1"> Yours affectionately,</salute>

                            On 18 March, Southey had asked Neville White if Conder could supply him
                            with another copy of James Montgomery&#8217;s &#8216;Verses, Written on a Blank Leaf
                            in the &#8220;Hymns for Infant Minds&#8221;&#8217;, which appeared in <title>Edinburgh
                                Annual Register, for 1810</title>, 3.1 (1812), xcii&#8211;xciii; see
                            Robert Southey to Neville White, 18 March 1812, Letter 2062. Conder&#8217;s
                            own verses were rejected and did not appear; see Southey to
                            Neville White, 27 September 1812, Letter 2151.</note> Will he not send
                        some communication of his own as he gave me reason to hope?</p>
