                    which can not be experienced in any other. It has its anxieties, its trials, and its sufferings also: may few of these be
                    dispensed to your lot! Present my congratulations to Mrs. Conder. We have long known each other in print; and one of the pleasures
                    which I look forward to in my next visit to London, is that of becoming personally acquainted with one whom I so sincerely
                    respect.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Had I known you were about to visit Bristol, I would have directed you to some of my favourite haunts in former
                    times, and would have introduced you to my old friend <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Joseph Cottle</ref>, who, though he
                    has mistaken the bent of his powers most deplorably, is nevertheless a man of no common powers, and of most exemplary goodness in
                    all relations of life that he has been called to fill. I put the review of the &#8220;Excursion&#8221;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    the criticism is written. Your articles on the &#8220;Velvet Cushion&#8221;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    both the manner and spirit. My attachment to the Established Church, in preference to any other existing form of Christianity, is
                    not founded in bigotry or in prejudice; for, though I conform to it, I do not subscribe to its articles, and am thereby precluded
                    from being (what otherwise I should most ardently desire to be) one of its ministers. You are wrong in thinking that our cathedral
                    service is inferior to that of the mass-book. The cathedral service you feel to be solemn; who indeed can fail to feel it so? But
                    it would be impossible for you not to see that the mass is a mummery, and not to feel, if you reflected upon what was going on,
                    that it is gross and monstrous idolatry. I have seen it performed before the Court of Portugal, and the only thing which I could

                    There is frequently a fine conception of the old chivalrous character, and almost always a strength and vividness in the outline
                    which he offers you. Lord Byron&#8217;s faults are to me far worse than Scott&#8217;s, and they are likely to produce a much worse effect upon
                    the herd of imitative writers. It is a clumsy mode of narration to give you the characters of men by describing them, instead of
                    letting the character describe itself in the course of the story; but strip one of Lord Byron&#8217;s poems of these descriptions, and
                    what remains? The fable is a mere nothing; and the characters themselves are incongruous even to absurdity.</p>

                    instrument of drawing upon France those evils which she has so long and so mercilessly inflicted upon other countries; that the
                    generation which he has bred up in blood and blasphemy are to perish by the sword; and that Paris, which I verily believe to be a
                    guiltier city than even Rome or Constantinople, will be made a signal example of the vengeance of God and man. I wish I could feel
                    the same confidence respecting the state of things at home; but the more I reflect upon the changes that have taken place within
                    my own remembrance, and upon the principles which are at work, the more reason there appears to me for apprehending a dreadful
                    overthrow of all established institutions.</p>
