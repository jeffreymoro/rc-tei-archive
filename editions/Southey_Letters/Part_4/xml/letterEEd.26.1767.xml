                        asked the Commons to pronounce on whether Burdett had breached parliamentary privilege by denouncing the House&#8217;s decision to
                        exclude reporters during its debates on the disastrous Walcheren expedition of 1809. Burdett particularly condemned the
                        Commons&#8217;s decision to imprison the radical John Gale Jones (1769&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>) for his criticism of its

                        a central role in exposing Frederick, Duke of York (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>) and Mary Anne Clarke&#8217;s (1776?&#8211;1852;

                        counter-allegations from Clarke, alleging corruption and conspiracy. He was the author of <title>The Trial of Colonel

                    is the want of talent &amp; want of principle in the parliament which will bring it about. If you ask me which I despise the most
                    the Ins or the Outs, I cannot reply to the question, believing both to be equally weak &amp; equally profligate. All I am anxious
                    for is to keep the peace-party out, &amp; Pitt himself (I was about to say the Devil, but this is from me a still stronger
