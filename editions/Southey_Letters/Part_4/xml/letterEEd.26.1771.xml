                    keep <del>their</del> &lt;his&gt; attention upon the subject, &amp; yet lead it from the author, &#8211; for sorry am I to say that his

                        missions was not written. It might have been inspired by accounts of the Moravians&#8217; and London Missionary Society&#8217;s work in
                        the Cape of Good Hope.</note> &#8211; for both of which I have collected copious &amp; good materials.</p>

                        1798, it had gone into four editions by 1807. A fifth edition was published by Murray in 1817.</note> I can speak without the
                    slightest doubt or hesitation. The book is as worthless as it is mischievous, as much to be despised as it is to be detested. The
                    subject <del>will</del> &lt;may&gt; naturally be introduced at the close of the Missionary Papers, &#8211; but should there be a new
                    edition <del>of</del> published before that time &#8211; I will take the opportunity, &amp; give a death blow to the philosophist, or
                    philosophicide, &#8211; the most mischievous of all the breed; &#8211; not for his abilities, &#8211; but because his system accords so well with
