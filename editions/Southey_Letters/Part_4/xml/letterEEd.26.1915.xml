                        physician. His wife was Dorothea Sophia Des Champs (d. 1819), translator of the <title>Letters of Madame de S&#233;vign&#233;</title>
                        into English. The Mackies had a daughter, Anna Sophia, and a son.</note> made his appearance with his daughter last night just
                    as our tea-equipage was removed. They would not tea-ify here having left M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> M. at Janson&#8217;s.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Jansons were the proprietors of the Royal Oak, Keswick.</note> So we walked with the young
                    Lady to the Crag, &#8211; returned with her to the Inn and there made our second tea-ification at 8 o clock. This morning the father
                    &amp; daughter breakfasted here, &#8211; according to their own arrangement for all advice &amp; invitation on my part proved of no

                    enable me, &#8211; but why he should have gone out of his way for the purpose of not seeing any thing upon the road I cannot divine. If
                    it was for the sake of seeing <hi rend="ital">me</hi> quasi a Lion, I am obliged to him. See me he certainly did, &#8211; but as for
                    seeing any thing of me beyond what the outward eye can take in &#8211; &#924;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#965;

                    distinction should be made between its occasional &amp; its regular contributors. From the former it has sometimes received
                    articles of great value &amp; unexceptionable tendency. Its execrable opinions in morals &amp; politics, its utter ignorance in
                    matters of taste, &amp; above all its characteristic insolence, must be imputed to some of the latter, &amp; more especially to
                    the Editor.&#8221;<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
