                    which reply states that a previous arrangement had been made for the office of
                        Historiographer.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was
                        campaigning for the post of Historiographer Royal, vacant because of the
                        death of Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>) on 23 May 1812. He was
                            unsuccessful and it went to one of his particular b&#234;tes noires, James
                        Stanier Clarke (c. 1765&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; Thinking you
                    would be likely to know this as soon as myself I did not write to you. &#8211; My
                    interest was better than I expected. &#8211; upon <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref> I had reckoned, &#8211;
                    but <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> wrote for me to Lord

                        2nd Viscount Melville (1771&#8211;1851; <title>DNB</title>), who had become First
                        Lord of the Admiralty earlier in 1812.</note> &amp; seemed to depend upon
                    success. If Courtenay be the successful applicant I shall be
                        <del>malicious</del> splenetic enough to wish <del>you</del> some friend
                    would show him my historical labours in one scale &amp; his pamphlett in
                    another, &#8211; &amp; then congratulate him upon his appointment.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The politician and author Thomas Peregrine

                        notorious accumulator of offices and a staunch ministerialist. The pamphlet
                        was possibly his <title>A View of the State of the Nation, and of the
                            Measures of the Last Five Years</title> (1811).</note> I have now done
                    with the State Lottery. Of all <del>the</del> &lt;things&gt; possible I most
                    desired an appointment at Lisbon, &#8211; if it had been given me when it was desired,
                    &amp; when it would have been honourable in Fox<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles James Fox (1749&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>).
                        Southey is referring to the period when Fox was Foreign Secretary in
                        1806.</note> so to have given it, knowing as he did my motive for wishing
                    it, it would have involved me (owing to the subsequent troubles) in pecuniary
                    difficulties which <del>xxx</del> perhaps I should never have surmounted. That
                    hope having failed I looked to that good ship the Historiographer believing

                    more &lt;than&gt; any &lt;other&gt; man, ambitious of fulfilling its duties, &#8211;
                    but that good ship it seems is still <del>condemned</del> &lt;destined&gt; to be
                    so ill-manned as to be perfectly useless.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This evening I have a <del>very</del> letter from <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> couched in the most handsome
                    &amp; friendly terms. He does not know that the office is disposed of, but hints
                    at difficulties in the way of his obtaining it, (even supposing he were in
