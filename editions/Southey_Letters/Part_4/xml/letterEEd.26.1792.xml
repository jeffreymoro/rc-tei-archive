        <p rend="indent1"> I shall be ready for you with the Portugueze article<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s review of <title>Observador
                            Portuguez</title> (1809), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (August
                        1810), 1&#8211;24.</note> by the beginning of August, &#8211; had the book reached me in
                    time it should have formed a chapter in the Register,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>
                        (1810).</note> but I waited for it till the latest moment in vain. Its want
                    however will not be perceived there by any person so much as myself, &amp; it
                    will give me an opportunity of saying something about Portugal in the Review. I
                    shall finish this first in preference to the Methodist-article,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s review of <title>Hints to the

                            Review</title>, 4 (November 1810), 480&#8211;514.</note> because it requires
                    far less time, the subject furnishing its own arrangement.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With respect to New Spain<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Viceroyalty of New Spain included Mexico, Central America and much
                        of the western part of the United States.</note> I hardly know how to reply
                    to you &#8211; <del>With respect</del> As to its history few men, if any, can be
                    better versed in it, &#8211; but of its present state I know nothing. The articles in
                    the Edinburgh have probably taken Humboldts publications for their text.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#8211;1859).</note> I have seen a list of these for
                    the first time in todays newspaper, &#8211; &amp; a most unpromising catalogue it is.
                    The only books among them which would be within my sphere of knowledge
                        <del>would be</del> &lt;are&gt; the Tableau de la Nature 2 vols 12mo. the
                    Essai sur la Geographie des Plantes 1. 4to. &amp; the four numbers with their

                        for the <title>Quarterly</title>.</note> If these should supply me with any
                    adequate information of the present state of Mexico, I shall have no fear of
                    writing upon the subject. There is one book connected with it which I should be
                    glad to possess, &amp; which it would probably be easy to find in <del>the</del>

                        Southey eventually obtained an edition of 1655, no. 1191 in the sale
                        catalogue of his library.</note> I detected this author in plagiarizing even
                    to the very printers blunders from an old translation of Gomara.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had claimed in a note to
