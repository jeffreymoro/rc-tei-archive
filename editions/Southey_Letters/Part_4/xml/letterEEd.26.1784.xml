                    exercises) that these have done, &#8211; &amp; after all I doubt whether they will please any body more than they do myself, &#8211; which
                    Gods knows is little enough. The structure of the poem is good, &#8211; &amp; that is all I can say in its praise. If you throw it
                    behind the fire my present feelings about it are such as to render it very little likely that I shall ever make it rise again from
                    its ashes. Believe me however I have laboured very anxiously to do something which might gratify you, &#8211; &amp; the worse the verses
                    are the more do they evince this, &#8211; since in spite of fear &amp; foresight I have chosen rather to <del>do</del> &lt;write&gt; ill
                    than to <del>do</del> write nothing.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had been asked by Wynn to write a poem
                        commemorating <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleThomas">Grenville&#8217;s</ref> (Wynn&#8217;s uncle) installation as Chancellor of Oxford University. It was published as &#8216;Verses. Spoken

                        needed for Southey&#8217;s work for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>. He had, at this time, just completed the proofs
                        for the volume covering events in 1808 and had started work on that for 1809.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I send off this evening the last proof of the Register. Many of my friends will think that I have written very
                    imprudently, &#8211; it will however answer to the booksellers, &#8211; so that if I looked to my own direct worldly interest they will not be
                    injured by the perfect <del>liberty</del> &lt;freedom&gt; with which I have censured all parties in their turn.</p>
