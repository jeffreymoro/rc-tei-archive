          <salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The thing of most import which you object to is Adosindas exclamation,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> This
                        letter contains Southey&#8217;s response to Bedford&#8217;s critique of a draft of what became Book 3, &#8216;Adosinda&#8217;, of <title>Roderick, the
                            Last of the Goths</title> (1814), starting with lines 299&#8211;321.</note> &#8211; I do not know what other words would be strong
                    enough to convey the shrieking-shuddering <del>emotion</del> &lt;passion&gt; which is represented. They prepare you for what
                    follows, &#8211; they in some degree withdraw your attention for it. then let me observe that the passage which immediately succeeds <hi rend="ital">is</hi> natural, &#8211; because the speaker is seeking while telling of her own feelings to run out of them, &#8211; &amp; it
                    is peculiarly proper, because it calls away the reader from an image almost too shocking to be held up even for a moment. The
                    phrase which you dislike that <del>x</del> of shrivelling like a scroll<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Revelation</title> 6: 14. The phrase was retained in <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3,
                        line 316.</note>&#8211; is scriptural, &#8211; &amp; to my mind perfectly sublime.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> And so Grosvenor you seriously advise me to make this poem the principal object of my time. Why man you might as
                    well advise me to set up a carriage, buy an estate &amp; build a house upon it. I can afford for it no other time than what it at
                    present has, &#8211; an hour or half-hour before breakfast at which it may probably be finished in about eighteen months, six more will
                    be required for printing it, &#8211; &amp; then I shall truly rejoice to see it consigned into your critical hands, &#8211; but how much of
                    uncertainty is there in all this!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Once more to your criticisms, &#8211; premising however that the old story of the painter who invited connoisseurs first
                    to find fault with his piece &amp; then to praise it, applies more to verbal criticism than to any thing else; &#8211; premising also
                    that if you suppose I spare labour you are as much mistaken as the Gentleman<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Unidentified.</note> who addressed me &#8211; with &#8216;Sir I expected to have found you a man of threescore, in a great wig.&#8217; &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The grey of the morning<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not retained in <title>Roderick, the Last of the
                            Goths</title> (1814).</note> is not like the cool of the evening, &#8211; because the one phrase is trivial &amp; the other is
                    not, &#8211; people not rising early enough to make it so. As for the redundant syllable, it is allowable wherever there is any occasion
                    for it; &#8211; it is better any where than at the beginning of a book, because <hi rend="ital">there</hi> the variety which it gives is
                    not required. The expression in se<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;in itself&#8217;. It was not used in <title>Roderick, the
                            Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> is remarkably happy because of its truth, &#8211; but as I have it in Thalaba<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), Book 6, line 51.</note>
          <del>I x</del> it may be dismissed from hence, provided any phrase as little objectionable can be found to supply it. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The image which the word &#8216;floor&#8217;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3, line 6.</note> fixes, <del>refer</del> was noticed on the very
                    spot where this part of the scene is laid, &#8211; for from thence to Coimbra I know the ground.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Surely your next objection is unfounded &#8211; <hi rend="ital">worn down</hi> relates to his bodily weakness, &#8211; &amp;
                    the <hi rend="ital">brighter thoughts</hi> are those on which he is <hi rend="ital">musing</hi> as he goes.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3, line 12 (slightly amended).</note> &#8211; One &amp; the same state
                    of mind, not three. &#8211; The twice<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not retained in <title>Roderick, the Last of the
