                        letter contains Southey’s response to Bedford’s critique of a draft of what became Book 3, ‘Adosinda’, of <title>Roderick, the
                            Last of the Goths</title> (1814), starting with lines 299–321.</note> – I do not know what other words would be strong
                    enough to convey the shrieking-shuddering <del>emotion</del> &lt;passion&gt; which is represented. They prepare you for what
                    follows, – they in some degree withdraw your attention for it. then let me observe that the passage which immediately succeeds <hi rend="ital">is</hi> natural, – because the speaker is seeking while telling of her own feelings to run out of them, – &amp; it
                    is peculiarly proper, because it calls away the reader from an image almost too shocking to be held up even for a moment. The
                    phrase which you dislike that <del>x</del> of shrivelling like a scroll<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Revelation</title> 6: 14. The phrase was retained in <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3,
                        line 316.</note>– is scriptural, – &amp; to my mind perfectly sublime.</p><p rend="indent1"> And so Grosvenor you seriously advise me to make this poem the principal object of my time. Why man you might as
                    well advise me to set up a carriage, buy an estate &amp; build a house upon it. I can afford for it no other time than what it at
                    present has, – an hour or half-hour before breakfast at which it may probably be finished in about eighteen months, six more will
                    be required for printing it, – &amp; then I shall truly rejoice to see it consigned into your critical hands, – but how much of
                    uncertainty is there in all this!</p><p rend="indent1"> Once more to your criticisms, – premising however that the old story of the painter who invited connoisseurs first
                    to find fault with his piece &amp; then to praise it, applies more to verbal criticism than to any thing else; – premising also
                    that if you suppose I spare labour you are as much mistaken as the Gentleman<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Unidentified.</note> who addressed me – with ‘Sir I expected to have found you a man of threescore, in a great wig.’ – </p><p rend="indent1"> The grey of the morning<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not retained in <title>Roderick, the Last of the
                            Goths</title> (1814).</note> is not like the cool of the evening, – because the one phrase is trivial &amp; the other is
                    not, – people not rising early enough to make it so. As for the redundant syllable, it is allowable wherever there is any occasion
                    for it; – it is better any where than at the beginning of a book, because <hi rend="ital">there</hi> the variety which it gives is
                    not required. The expression in se<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘in itself’. It was not used in <title>Roderick, the
                            Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> is remarkably happy because of its truth, – but as I have it in Thalaba<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), Book 6, line 51.</note><del>I x</del> it may be dismissed from hence, provided any phrase as little objectionable can be found to supply it. </p><p rend="indent1"> The image which the word ‘floor’<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3, line 6.</note> fixes, <del>refer</del> was noticed on the very
                    spot where this part of the scene is laid, – for from thence to Coimbra I know the ground.</p><p rend="indent1"> Surely your next objection is unfounded – <hi rend="ital">worn down</hi> relates to his bodily weakness, – &amp;
                    the <hi rend="ital">brighter thoughts</hi> are those on which he is <hi rend="ital">musing</hi> as he goes.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3, line 12 (slightly amended).</note> – One &amp; the same state

                    nothing else.</p><p rend="indent1"> As for thereof &amp; aforesaid<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘Thereof’ only occurs in <title>Roderick,
                            the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3, line 20; ‘aforesaid’ is not used once.</note> – I take it for granted you
                    will find the one used by Shakespear &amp; Milton, &amp; the other not.</p><p rend="indent1"><hi rend="ital">Pieci</hi><note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not retained in <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> I grant

                    words happen to be highly poetical, – but in the line to which you liken it are ridiculously &amp; designedly otherwise.</p><p rend="indent1"><hi rend="ital">Smouldering</hi><note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not retained in <title>Roderick, the Last of the

                    light favoured her. It is the nature of <del>such</del> &lt;strong&gt; passion to feel thus, – <del>there</del> you remember Hans
                        Stade,<note n="29" place="foot" resp="editors"> Hans Staden (1525–1579), German soldier and mariner, who described his
                        captivity in Brazil in <title>Warhaftige Historia und Beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der wilden, nacketen, grimmigen
                            Menschfresser Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen</title> (1557). Southey had related Staden’s delusion that the moon
                        was angry with him in <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810–1819), I, p. 193, and noted similar feelings by
                        those in distress in a note at pp. 635–636. Southey read Hans Staden’s story in Theodore de Bry’s (1528–1598)
                            <title>Peregrinationes</title> (1590–1592), no. 717 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s Library.</note> – &amp; if you have
                    not noticed a note upon that passage pray turn to it, for it is a striking &amp; affecting instance how the imagination becomes as

                    inconsistency, – which the speakers state of mind may well excuse, or even render necessary. I shall bear in mind your
