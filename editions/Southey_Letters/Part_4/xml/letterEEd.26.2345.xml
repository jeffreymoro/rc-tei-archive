          <salute>My Dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I meant to have seen you in the morning before my departure from town, and also to have answered in person a note
                    from <ref target="people.html#ConderJosiah">Josiah Conder</ref>; but the day proved rainy, and prevented me. The day we met at New
                        Inn<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A fifteenth-century Inn of Chancery attached to Middle Temple. The buildings were
                        pulled down in 1902.</note> I caught a violent cold, which lasted me during the remainder of my stay in London; and perhaps I
                    should have thought any other person imprudent in setting out with such a companion for a two-nights&#8217; journey in the mail. But I
                    persuaded myself that five-and-forty hours&#8217; travelling would shake it out of my system; and though the theory certainly was
                    founded upon inclination, or rather made to suit it, it was confirmed by the result: for I reached home with little cold left, and
                    with no other symptom of fatigue than that my ankles remained swollen for two or three days. All at home were well, and I was as
                    happy and as thankful as it became me to be, at finding them so after so long an absence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Since my return I have paid off some long epistolary arrears, and got through a good deal of miscellaneous
                    preparatory work; but my chief employment has been that which has grown out of my new situation. You will see my New Year&#8217;s Ode
                    announced for separate publication under the title of &#8220;Carmen Annuum.&#8221;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s first
                        official Laureate poem was extremely controversial. Five stanzas were considered by Croker and Rickman to be
                        particularly inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and deleted them from the version published as <title>Carmen
                            Triumphale</title> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the deleted stanzas into an &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations
                        with Bonaparte&#8217;, published in the <title>Courier</title>, 3 February 1814.</note> I have given it this Latin name to avoid calling it an ode, partly because it is longer than
                    such compositions usually are, and partly because the poem is of a peculiar character; I was glad to find a general name for it,
                    rather than one which might convey an erroneous expectation of its manner. It is an oration in verse, rather than a poem: &#8212; but
                    whether it be worth the trouble and the time which it has cost me, must be left to others to determine. <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> will send it you as soon as it is ready. It must appear on New Year&#8217;s Day;
                    and an extract from it serves the purpose of the Ode in ordinary.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. the annual New
                        Year's ode that was set to music by the Master of the King&#8217;s Musick.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My intention was to have accompanied it with a sort of dedicatory epistle to the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref>; but I have not yet been able to strike off a beginning, and must
                    therefore, I fear, delay this.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> This &#8216;epistle&#8217; was not written.</note> It will not be very long before there will be another,
                    and in some respects a better opportunity for it. I purpose to write a series of inscriptions, recording the achievements of our
                    army in the Peninsula, &#8212; triumphal for the battles won and fortresses taken, and monumental for the more distinguished persons who
                    have fallen.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Only 18 of the proposed 30 inscriptions were written. The idea of publishing
                        them as a separate volume did not materialise.</note> You see I am disposed to do all that is in my power to render the office
                    honourable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The burden of my poem is, &#8220;Glory to God, Deliverance for Mankind;&#8221;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> A
                        repeated line in the first draft of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title>, often used to conclude verses.</note> the concluding strain is &#8220;Down with the
                        Tyrant.&#8221;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Down with the Tyrant&#8217; was removed from <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> and was included
                        in the last line of &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations with Buonaparte&#8217;.</note> And here you have my feelings as to the
                    events which have taken place since we met, and the course which it becomes the victorious allies to pursue. It will be their own
                    fault if they do not dictate peace at Paris; there and thus peace ought to be made, and no otherwise, unless this event be
                    prevented, as it so easily may, by the recall of the Bourbons. Whether in my own individual mind I wish to see them re-established
                    is a question which I am really unable to answer; for if on the one hand the immediate benefits would be great, on the other they
                    are a bad race, and I never can forget, whatever have been the crimes of the French Revolution in its course, and the incalculable
                    evils of its consequences, that the feelings which occasioned their expulsion were far nobler than those which would bring about
                    their restoration.</p>

                    answers any expectation which I could have formed, highly as I thought of her acquirements and intellectual powers from conversing
                    with her. I differ from her only in this, &#8212; that I go with Schlegel the whole length of reprobating French taste in its
                    master-pieces, as false in its essential principles, and pernicious in its inevitable consequences.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767&#8211;1845), who had been tutor to Madame de Sta&#235;l&#8217;s sons. His views were expressed in
