                        heavily censored by <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>

                    been time, it should have passed under your eye; but it has occupied me much
                    longer than I expected, because I have been very solicitous to strike as hard a
                    blow as possible: it is so hard, that you will see your desire upon your
                    enemies.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have manged better about the passage, which has been the
                    occasion of so much false accusation, than the British reviewer did; for I have
                    admitted its inconsistency, shown in what manner your very zeal for the
                    furtherance of your great object has betrayed you into it, and then made a
                    thundering charge of malice and calumny, against those who argue, from this
                    single passage, in direct contradiction to the whole tenor of the book.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The passage in question was: &#8216;It is
                        not proposed that the children of the poor be educated in an expensive
                        manner, or even taught to write and to cypher. Utopian schemes for the
                        universal diffusion of general knowledge would soon realize the fable of the
                        belly and the other members of the body, and confound that distinction of
                        ranks and classes of society, on which the general welfare hinges, and the
                        happiness of the lower orders, no less than that of the higher, depends.
                        Parents will always be found to educate, at their own expense, children enow
                        to fill the stations which require higher qualifications; and there is a
                        risk of elevating by an indiscriminate education, the minds of those doomed
                        to the drudgery of daily labour above their condition, and thereby rendering
                        them discontented and unhappy in their lot. It may suffice to teach the
                        generality, on an economical plan, to read their bible, and understand the
                        doctrine of our holy religion&#8217;, <title>An Experiment in Education</title>,
                        2nd edn (London, 1805), p. 62. Much criticised by Bell&#8217;s opponents, Southey
                        quoted it in full and excused it as the product of Bell&#8217;s &#8216;deepest desire&#8217;

                        (August 1811), 292. He also attacked Bell&#8217;s critics for their
                        misappropriation of this one paragraph, Ibid., 299. In so doing, he thought
                        he was more effective at defending Bell than the reviewer in the
