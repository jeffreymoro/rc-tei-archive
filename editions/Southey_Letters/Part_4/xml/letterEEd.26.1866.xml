        <p rend="indent1"> I will willingly find fault with your play<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A play by Elliott of which no
                        record has survived; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, [before 14 December 1811], Letter 1998.</note> when you can
                    find means of sending it me. &#8211; that is, I will gladly, if it be in my power, point out in what manner it may be fitted for
                    representation, should it require alteration &amp; appear capable of being so altered. Of managers &amp; green rooms I know
                    nothing. Old Cumberland<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The playwright and novelist Richard Cumberland (1732&#8211;1811;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> once said to me in his characteristic way &#8211; &#8220;whatever you do Sir, never write a play! the
                    torments of the damned are nothing to it.&#8221; &#8211; I myself suspect that if a man suffers any thing like purgatory <del>from</del>
                    &lt;in&gt; a green room, it must be his own fault. I would send my play then, &#8211; if it were accepted, they might mutilate it as
                    they pleased, &#8211; because the actors (generally speaking) must be the best judge of what will <hi rend="ital">tell</hi> on the
                    stage, &#8211; &amp; because the author can always restore the piece to its original state when he prints it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry you should have suspected any thing like a reproach upon <del>female</del> &#8220;single-blessedness&#8217; in
                    women, &#8211; in what is said of Lorrinite. Nothing could be farther from my thoughts. The passage has nothing beyond <del>in</del> an
                    individual reference to the Witch herself, therein described as a &#8216;<hi rend="ital">cankerd</hi> rose&#8217;.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Elliott had interpreted the following description of the enchantress Lorrinite as an attack upon unmarried
                        women: &#8216;She was a woman whose unlovely youth,/ Even like a cankered rose, which none will cull,/ Had withered on the stalk;
                        her heart was full/ Of passions which had found no natural scope,/ Feelings which there had grown but ripened not;/ Desires
                        unsatisfied, abortive hope/ Repinings which provoke vindictive thought,/ Those restless elements for ever wrought,/ Fermenting
                        in her with perpetual stir,/ And thus her spirit to all evil mov&#8217;d&#8217;, <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), Book 11, lines
                        27&#8211;36.</note> You may find abundant proofs in my writings, &#8211; &amp; would require none if you knew me, &#8211; that no man can be
                    more innocent of such opinions as you seem to have suspected, &#8211; So far &lt;am I&gt; from not regarding continence as a virtue.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Those unaccountable clinks, as you call them, in the middle of the lines, are as you must have seen too frequent to
                    be accidental.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The paragraph deals with the metre of <title>Kehama</title>.</note> I went
                    upon the system of rhyming to the ear, regardless of the [MS obscured] have throughout the poem availed myself of the power which
                    this gave me. The verse was no bondage to me. If I do not greatly deceive myself it unites the advantages of rhyme with the
                    strength &amp; freedom of blank verse &#8211; in a manner peculiar to itself. &#8211; As far as I can judge (which is of course must be from
                    very imperfect &amp; partial means) the story seems not to have shocked people as much as I expected; <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> tells me he has reviewed it for the next Quarterly<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 5 (February 1811), 40&#8211;61.</note> &#8211; this will have some effect upon its sale &amp; immediate
                    estimation, but that it should become popular is impossible. Many years must elapse before the opinion of the few can become the
                    law of the many.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have fallen in love with the American subject which did not strike your fancy &#8211; &amp; have half moulded it into a
                    story of which a primitive Quaker is the hero, &#8211; a curious character you will say for heroic poetry, &#8211; certainly an original

          <p rend="indent1"> &#8211; Respecting Jornandes<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jornandes (c. mid 6th century), a Roman
                            bureaucrat who wrote two Latin histories: <title>De Getarum (Gothorum) Origine et Rebus Gestis</title> (c. 551) and
                                <title>De Regnorum ac Temporum Successione</title> (c. 551&#8211;552) . Both were widely used by later historians. Elliott
                            had expressed interest in writing an epic poem that drew on events described by Jornandes, possibly the death of Decius
                            (201&#8211;251; Emperor of Rome 249&#8211;251) in battle with the Goths. For Southey&#8217;s advice see Southey to Ebenezer Elliott, 7

                        unsatisfactory, that it could not possibly be the employment of more than half an hour to translate every thing relating to
                        this point of history in that author, &#8211; if he were at hand. Nothing (I am sure) would be to be found but the naked fact
