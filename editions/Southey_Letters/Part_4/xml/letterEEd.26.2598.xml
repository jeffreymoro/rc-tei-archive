        <p rend="indent1"> It would not surprize me if we were to have some fresh pestilence in Europe. The Influenza is perhaps some old
                    pestilence in a mitigated form, &#8211; worn out as diseases sometimes seem to be. Doubtless our habits preserve us from some of those
                    maladies which were of old so fatal, &#8211; but they may perhaps predispose us to others, &#8211; &amp; the fever at Gibralter<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> There had been a serious outbreak of an infectious fever at Gibraltar in 1814.</note> has shown
                    that we are no more able to overcome these general scourges when they reach us than our forefathers were.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am in good hopes respecting the war. Buonaparte must be very weak, &#8211; or he would not court the Jacobines &amp;

                        respect. During the &#8216;Hundred Days&#8217; he was Minister of the Interior, 20 March-22 June 1815.</note> &amp;c must be actuated by
                    personal hatred towards the Bourbons, not by principle, or they would never take part with Buonaparte. I am in fear for the
                    pictures &amp; statues, &amp; yet it is my deliberate opinion that it would be far better they should all be destroyed than
                    suffered to remain as trophies of the French at Paris.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> Under the terms of the Treaty of

        <p rend="indent1"> Have you seen some capital political squibs in the Courier lately?<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> Two
                        spoof letters allegedly written by a Quaker from Pennsylvania, Ezekial Grubb, to his friend in the American government, Tobias
                        Brande of Bigmuddy in Maryland, published in the <title>Courier</title> (14 April and 13 May 1814). These described the
                        political situation in Britain and were extremely hostile to the Whig opposition. They were widely reprinted, e.g. in
                            <title>The New Whig Guide</title> (1819).</note> I should like to know whose they are, for they are some of the best
                    things of their kind. &#8211; Have you got another house yet?</p>
