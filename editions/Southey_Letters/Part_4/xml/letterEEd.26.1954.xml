        <p rend="indent1"> We concluded our long journey with remarkable good fortune, having in the course of twelve weeks &amp; nearly nine
                    hundred miles met with only two days of wet weather, &amp; neither let, hindrance, accident or inconvenience of any kind. I was
                    much pleased with Ludlow Castle, the only ruin of the kind I ever yet saw which bears evident marks that it has formerly been the
                    seat of comfort. One of my walks was to the Boney Well near Richards Castle, it is one of the wonders of Guthries Grammar, &amp;
                    had wonderfully impressed my imagination when a boy.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Guthrie (1708?&#8211;1770;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>A New Geographical, Historical and Commercial Grammar</title>, 2 vols (London, 1771), I, p.
                        281, described the &#8216;remarkable fountain near Richard&#8217;s castle in Herefordshire, commonly called Bone-well, which is generally
                        full of small bones, like those of frogs or fish, though often cleared out&#8217;. Southey at some point acquired an 1808 edition of
                        Guthrie, no. 1256 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> The description made me suppose a deep well, &amp; I was well
                    enough read in the legends even then to dream of caverns &amp; pigmy people. When I came to the spot I found a beautiful spring,
                    no where a foot in depth, &amp; for all I could hear about the bones the wonder seemed to be that there should ever have been any
                    wonder about them. The old Naiad of the spring told me that March was the time when they were to be found, &amp; I vehemently
                    suspect that if I were to go in March she would then recommend October.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Crossing from <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Teddesley</ref> to Shrewsbury we past thro the iron country near
                    Wellington. There is something very striking in that sort of Hell above ground, &#8211; hills of scoria, an atmosphere of smoke, &amp;
                    huge black piles, consisting chiefly of chimneys &amp; furnaces, grouped together in <del>what x</del> the finest style of the
                    damnable picturesque. The things are too mean in themselves <del>ever to be a</del> ever to acquire <del>a</del> sublimity, to
                    whatever <del>xxxx</del> &lt;magnitude&gt; they may attain, but they have a hideousness which almost produces the same effect.
                    They are more hideous than horrid, &#8211; there should be an obscurity about horror, <del>hid</del> whatever is hideous is
                    definite.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We saw a prodigious work of art of very different character, &#8211; the aqueduct over the Dee near Llangollen. It is
                        <del>little</del> &lt;not&gt; more than <del>half</del> &lt;two thirds&gt; the height of the aqueduct at Lisbon, but the
                    effect is far more dizzying. At Lisbon you walk between the covered gallery where the water runs, &amp; a parapet wall breast
                    high, so that you feel your security. The iron rails of the Welsh bridge by giving sight of the depth immediately under your feet,
                    make it an effort of reason to imagine yourself safe, &amp; the effect of looking across a narrow canal upon a precipice, from
                    which <del>as it appears</del> nothing but a two inch plank seems to seperate it, gave birth to the &#8216;toys of desperation&#8217;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Hamlet</title>, Act I, Scene 4, line 75.</note> in a greater degree than I had ever before felt them. My knees were
                    loosened, tho I did not stop to allow them to shake, &amp; I felt an absolute longing for wings that I might have launched myself
                    into the air. This sort of feeling explains how animals are fascinated by the eye of a snake or a beast of prey.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have written to Durham &amp; hope it may prove to some effect. The Taylors must so frequently know persons who
                    are in want of farms &amp; qualified to improve them, that it will be unlucky if this is not the case now.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Taylor (1772&#8211;1851), gentleman farmer, classicist and father of Sir Henry Taylor (1800&#8211;1886; DNB),
                        Southey&#8217;s future friend. George Taylor&#8217;s brother, William Taylor (dates unknown) was also a farmer with literary interests.
