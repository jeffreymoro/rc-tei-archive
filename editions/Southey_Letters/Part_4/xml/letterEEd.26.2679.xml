        <p rend="indent1"> Thank God I am once more by my own fire side, surrounded indeed with books &amp; papers, &amp; at work once again! &#8211; It requires a little time to take up the thread
                    of broken occupations. &#8211; I have however been among the tribes of Brazil, &amp; shall tomorrow be as busy among Guaranies &amp; Chanas as if they were the only people in the world.
                    My manuscript for the <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">printer</ref> is now in smaller portions, such as may travel under cover of your privilege.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had resumed work on the second and third volumes of the <title>History of Brazil</title>, published in 1817 and 1819.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Before I left town I heard of my books from abroad, tho I know not which division of them. The inclosed letter to <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> contains a memorial petitioning to be exempted from the duty, which is 15 pence per pound weight! &#8211; one of the most absurd &amp; oppressive imposts that ever
                    graced a civilized country.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 8 December 1815, Letter 2678. Southey was protesting about import
                        duties on the books he had bought in the Netherlands.</note> It is not likely that the applica[MS torn] will succeed, but there can be no harm in making it, especially as
                    Artists are allowed an exemption from the duty upon works of art which they import for their own collections.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I breakfasted with <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> the day before I left town, &amp; dined in company with Mina,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Either Francisco Javier de Mina (1789&#8211;1817), guerrilla leader in Navarre 1808&#8211;1810; or his uncle, General Espoz de Mina (1781&#8211;1836). Both had fled Spain
                        after a failed rising in Pamplona on 25&#8211;26 September 1814</note>. who will give me a sketch of his own history. Both these meals were highly interesting &amp; useful. <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> is a man of singular ability. Of course he has much <del>to</del> information to communicate; &#8211; but it was very satisfactory
                    to find that in almost every point my own conclusions were strengthened by the knowledge which he gave me.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Frere had been Minister
                        Plenipotentiary to the Central Junta in 1808&#8211;1809 and advised Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>) to advance on Madrid, or, if necessary, to retreat through Galicia
                        rather than Portugal&#8211; advice that led to the disastrous retreat to Corunna. Southey had defended Frere in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
                        86&#8211;108.</note> He attributes as much to Sir Robert Wilsons movement at the time of Moores retreat as I had done.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> General Sir Robert
                        Thomas Wilson (1777&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>). In January 1809 he had refused to comply with the British retreat, led by Sir John Moore, redeployed his forces and continued to
                        harass the French. For Southey&#8217;s commendation of &#8216;the Excellent Conduct of Sir Robert Wilson&#8217;; see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
                        498&#8211;500.</note> Roach<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Keating Roche (d. 1829), Irish soldier who in 1815 was in command of a division of
                        Spanish soldiers in British pay.</note> (now a General in the Sp. service) fled from Ciudad Rodrigo before Wilson advanced there, &amp; told <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> that Wilson would never escape from it with his life.
