        <p rend="indent1"> I have a letter this evening from <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref> in which he tells me
                    that the Proprietors of the Register, attributing much of its success to me, offer me 1/12 share in it. The outlay on each twelfth
                    has been &#163;209 &#8211; the profit for this vol. &#163;80 &#8211; nearly 40 per cent, to be paid immediately by bills at a year. The outlay remains
                    to go on with the succeeding volumes, as stock, &amp; when any proprietor chuses to retire his share is purchased by the remaining
                    partners at the original &#163;209. &#8211; Nature never meant me to have anything to do with financial accounts, either of my own or the
                    publics. I see plainly enough that the interest is not quite so great as is here represented, &#8211; but it is also true that the sale
                    of a second edition would make it much greater. <del>xx</del> I have &#163;150 in <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref> hands, &#8211; it will put me to my shifts to do without it for the next six months, but so I can shift, &#8211;
