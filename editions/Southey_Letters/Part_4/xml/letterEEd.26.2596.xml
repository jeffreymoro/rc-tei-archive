          <salute>My Dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had resolved upon writing to you this evening, and, alas! my thoughts are drawn towards you very mournfully by a
                    letter which this post has brought, informing me of poor <ref target="people.html#DusautoyJame">Dusautoy&#8217;s</ref> death. The fever
                    at Cambridge has proved fatal to him, and he, too, like <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref>, rests in the
                    cloister of his own college!<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dusautoy had written to Southey for advice in 1813; see
                        Southey to James Dusautoy, 12 February 1813, Letter 2220. Southey told him to go to University, sought the advice of friends,
                        including Neville White, and helped secure the young man&#8217;s admission to Emmanuel College, Cambridge.</note> You may well
                    suppose that this very much affects me. The poor lad originally wrote to me in consequence of reading <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry&#8217;s</ref> &#8220;Remains.&#8221;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>Remains
                            of Henry Kirke White</title> (1807).</note> I advised him to a course which, to all human foresight, might have seemed
                    most conducive to his welfare, and that course has led him to an early grave. It would be worse than weakness to feel anything
                    like self-reproach, but it is impossible not to feel something more than an ordinary regret. <ref target="people.html#WhiteJames">James</ref> will be shocked at this event. I thank God that <hi rend="ital">he</hi> has escaped this danger, and I pray God
                    the pestilence (for so it may be called) may not spread. My letter (which is from Tillbrooke<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly Samuel Tillbrook (c. 1784&#8211;1835), Fellow of Peterhouse and later Rector of Freckenham, Suffolk
                        1829&#8211;1835.</note>) says that &#8220;in three days Cambridge, with respect to its colleges, will become an uninhabited desert!&#8221; God
                    be merciful to us! How frail a thing is human life! And if this life were all, how unsupportable it would be!</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> is by this time at Oxford, and probably settled at Merton. What will
                    his fate be? I hardly dare ask myself the question. He goes with the invaluable advantage of having a <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeWilliamHart">cousin</ref>
          <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Hart Coleridge had taken his MA in 1814.</note> in the University old enough to be his adviser, and not too old to be
                    his friend; he takes with him a larger stock of Greek than is often carried to college, a powerful intellect, good principles, and
                    good feelings. But with these he has some dangerous accompaniments; for he is headstrong, violent, perilously disposed to justify
                    whatever he may wish to do, eccentric in all his ways, and willing to persuade himself that there is a merit in eccentricity. But
                    his greatest danger arises from a mournful cause, against which it is impossible to protect, or even to caution him, &#8211; it arises
                    from <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</ref>. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> is able to comprehend the powers of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father&#8217;s</ref> mind,
                    and has for it all that veneration which it is both natural and proper that he should feel. The conduct of the father is, of
                    course, a subject on which no one would speak to the son; and <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref>, I
                    believe, contrives to keep it out of his own sight; but if <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> should
                    take it in his head to send for the boy to pass any of his vacations with him, there is the most imminent danger of his unsettling
                    his mind upon the most important subjects, and the end would be utter and irremediable ruin. For <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>, totally regardless of all consequences, will lead him into all the
                    depths and mazes of metaphysics: he would root up from his mind, without intending it, all established principles; and if he
                    should succeed in establishing others in their place, with one of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley&#8217;s</ref>
                    ardour and sincerity, they would never serve for the practical purposes of society, and he would be thrown out from the only
                    profession or way of life for which he is qualified. This you see it is absolutely impossible to prevent. I know but too well, and
