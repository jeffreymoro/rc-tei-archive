        <p rend="indent1"> You have here the second book of Pelayo, or as I must learn to call it, Roderick, the Last of the Goths.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> I have more pleasure in thus transcribing it for you than I
                    shall have in throwing it before the world, for tho I cast my bread upon the waters in full assurance that it will be found after
                    many days, it is with a feeling something like what I should have in setting acorns. In all these prospects the churchyard enters
                    into the foreground. There is another thought connected with publication which tends as much to humiliation as it may seem to
                    savour of pride &#8211; of the thousands who will read my poem, some for the pleasure of finding fault with it, but far very far more
                    undoubtedly for the pleasure which it will give them, &#8211; how <hi rend="ital">very few</hi> are there who will really be
                        <del>at</del> competent to appreciate it, &#8211; &amp; how frequently have I had occasion to remember the point of Yriarte&#8217;s fable
                    &#8216;Bad is the censure of the wise &#8211; The blockheads praise is worse&#8221;.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Tomas de Iriarte y
                        Oropesa (1750&#8211;1791), &#8216;El Burro Flautista&#8217;, <title>Fabulas Literarias</title> (Madrid, 1782), pp. 19&#8211;20. Southey had published
                        his own translation, <title>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp.
                        50&#8211;51.</note> But in sending to you what has been produced with passion, &amp; elaborated with thought, I know that you will
                    recognize whatever is true to nature, &amp; that thus I shall have my reward. &#8211; The figure of Spain may require a note to point
                    out what a Spanish reader would instantly perceive, &#8211; the badge of the military orders, the castles &amp; lions of <del>Leon
                        &amp;</del> Castille &amp; Leon, &amp; the sword of my Cid.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly the book that
                        Southey had transcribed for Montgomery was illustrated with a &#8216;figure of Spain&#8217;, including a depiction of the sword of the
                        legendary hero Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (1043&#8211;1099). He was the central figure in Southey&#8217;s translation, <title>The Chronicle of
                            the Cid</title>
                        (1808).</note>

                        in August, 1812&#8217;. It was included in Montgomery&#8217;s <title>The World before the Flood</title> (London, 1813), pp.
                        203&#8211;212.</note> make me <del>wish</del> repine that you did not come <del>to me to find</del> where you would have found
                    subjects as much superior in <del>beauty</del> &lt;loveliness&gt; as in grandeur. You have managed a very difficult stanza with
                    great skill. The <del>last</del> two last lines are both equal to one alexandrine, &#8211; therefore objectionable. You have been aware
                    of this, &amp; so managed your <del>xxx</del> accents that they very seldom read as one. <del>Xxx xxxx</del>
          <del>alexandrine is so exquisitely harmonious</del>. The poem is in own your true strain, &#8211; it has the passion, the melancholy

            <l rend="indent3"> Romano sunk. No brethren were there here </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To spread the sackcloth, &amp; with ashes strew</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That penitential bed, &amp; gather round</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> On the bare earth he lay, which long had been</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> All gloomy as it was, which had beguild </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The sense of solitude, but now he felt</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The burthen of the solitary hours:</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The silence of that lonely hermitage</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Lay on him like a spell, &amp; at the voice</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of his own prayers, he started half aghast.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Then too as on Romano&#8217;s grave he sate</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And pored upon his own, a natural thought</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> That useless toil, &#8211; the sepulchre would be</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> No hiding place for him, &#8211; no Christian hands</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Were here who should compose his decent corpse</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And cover it with earth: there he might drag</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Had lost its rank, &amp; the prerogative</l>

            <l rend="indent7"> For his lost crown</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And sceptre, never had he felt a thought</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of pain. Repentance had no pangs to spare</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For trifles such as these, &#8211; the loss of these</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Was a cheap penalty, &#8211; that he had fallen</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> His hope &amp; consolation. &#8211; But to lose</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His human station in the scale of things, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To see brute nature scorn him, &amp; renounce</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Its homage to the human form divine, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Had then almighty vengeance thus reveal&#8217;d</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His punishment, &amp; was he fallen indeed</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> The dream assail&#8217;d him still.</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Flames oer the broad Atlantic, on the verge</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of glowing Ocean rests, retiring then</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Draws with it all its rays, &amp; sudden night</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Fills the whole cope of Heaven. The penitent </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Knelt by Romano&#8217;s grave, &amp; falling prone</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Claspt with extended arms the funeral mould.</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> When all beside was lost! &#8211; thou too art gone.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And the poor sinner whom from utter death</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Thy providential hand preserved, once more</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Totters upon the gulph. I am too weak</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For solitude, too vile a wretch to bear</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> This everlasting commune with myself;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The Tempter hath assail&#8217;d me; my own heart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Is leagued with him; Despair hath spread his nets</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To take my soul, &amp; memory like a Ghost</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Haunts me &amp; drives me to the toils. O Saint</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> While I was blest with thee, the hermitage</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Was my sure haven. Look upon me, still,</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Is there no other way for penitence!</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> I ask not martyrdom, &#8211; for what am I </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That I should pray for triumphs, the fit meed</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of a long life of holy works like thine, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Or how should I presumptuously aspire</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Thine were a voice of comfort.</l>
            <l rend="indent8"> Thus he cried,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Easing the pressure of his burthened heart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With passionate prayer, &#8211; thus pourd his spirit forth,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Till the long effort had exhausted him </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His spirit fail&#8217;d, &amp; laying in the grave</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His weary head, as on a pillow, sleep</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Fell on him. He had pray&#8217;d to hear a voice</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of consolation, &amp; in dreams a voice</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of consolation came. Roderick! it said, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Roderick, my poor unhappy sinful child,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Jesus have mercy on thee. &#8211; Not if Heaven </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Had opened, &amp; Romano visible</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> In his beatitude had breath&#8217;d that prayer,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Not if the Grave had spoken, had it pierced</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> So deeply in his soul, nor thrilld his heart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With such compunctious visitings, nor given</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Withal so keen a joy. It was the voice</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Which sung his fretful infancy to sleep</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> So patiently, which sooth&#8217;d his childish griefs,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Counsell&#8217;d with anguish &amp; prophetic tears</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His headstrong youth. And lo! his mother stood</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Before him in the vision: in those weeds</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Which never from the hour when to the grave</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> She followed her dear Lord Theodofred</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Rusilla laid aside, but in her face</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A sorrow that bespake a heavier load</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> And prayed the while for patience for herself</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And him, &amp; prayed for vengeance too, &amp; found</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Best comfort in her curses. In his dream</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Groaning he knelt before her to beseech</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Her blessing, &amp; she rais&#8217;d her hands to lay</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A benediction on him. But those hands</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Were chain&#8217;d, &amp; casting a wild look around,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With a wild voice she cried, Will no one break</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> These shameful fetters? &#8211; Pedro! Theudemir!</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Athanagild! where are ye? &#8211; Rodericks arm</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Is withered; Chiefs of Spain, but where are ye?</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And thou Pelayo, thou our surest hope</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Dost thou too sleep? &#8211; up &#8211; up &#8211; Pelayo! up!</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Why tarriest thou, Deliverer? &#8211; But with that</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> She broke her bonds; &amp; lo! her form was changed,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Radiant in arms she stood: a bloody Cross </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Gleam&#8217;d on her breast-plate, in her shield display&#8217;d</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A Lion seem&#8217;d to ramp, her helmed head</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Rose like the Berecynthian Goddess crownd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With towers, &amp; in her dreadful hand the sword</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Red as a fire-brand blazed. Anon the tramp</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of horsemen, &amp; the din of multitudes</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Moving to mortal conflict, rung around,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The battle-song, the clang of swords &amp; shield,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> War-cries &amp; tumult, strife &amp; hate &amp; rage,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Blasphemous prayers, confusion, agony,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Rout, &amp; pursuit &amp; death, &amp; over all</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The shout of Victory, Spain &amp; Victory!</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Roderick, as the strong vision mastered him,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Rush&#8217;d to the fight rejoicing; starting then</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> As his own effort burst the charm of sleep,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> He found himself upon that lonely grave</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> In moonlight &amp; in silence. But the dream</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Work&#8217;d in him still, for still he felt his heart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Pant, &amp; his withered arm was trembling still,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And still that voice was in his ears, which call&#8217;d</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> On Jesus for his sake.</l>
            <l rend="indent7"> Oh might he hear</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That actual voice! &amp; if Rusilla lived,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> If shame &amp; anguish for his crimes not yet</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Had brought her to the grave, sure she would bless</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Her penitent child, &amp; pour into his heart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Prayers &amp; forgiveness which like precious balm</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Would heal the wounded soul. Nor to herself</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Less precious or less healing, would the voice</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That spake forgiveness flow: she wept her son</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For ever lost, &#8211; cut off with all the weight </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of unrepented sin upon his head, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Sin which had weigh&#8217;d a nation down: what joy</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To know that righteous Heaven had in its wrath</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Remembered mercy, &amp; she yet might meet</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The child whom she had borne, redeemd, in bliss.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The sudden impulse of such thoughts confirmd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His unacknowledged purpose which till now</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Vainly had sought its end. He girt his loins,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Laid blessed Mary&#8217;s image in a cleft</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of the rock, where sheltered from the elements</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> It might abide till happier days came on,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> From all defilement safe; &#8211; pourd his last prayers</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Upon Romano&#8217;s grave, &amp; kissd the earth</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That covered his remains, &amp; wept as if</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> At long leave-taking; &#8211; then began his way.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> From all defilement &#8230;
