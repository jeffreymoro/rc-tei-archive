          <salute>My dear Tom, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your box has not made its appearance, &#8211; nevertheless I write, not waiting another day, because a letter may perhaps
                    be longer in reaching S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Helens, than in travelling to London. My reason for writing is to protest against the
                    horse, because as we have no stable establishment the keep of that four-footed fellow would be reckoned at <del>xxxx</del> so much
                    a day paid while you staid, &amp; thereby become a reason for your &lt;not&gt; staying so long as otherwise you might.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am not surprized at your feeling about <del>the Spanish</del> sending troops to S America, &#8211; considering the
                    character of the struggle in that country when <del>xx</del> both parties are so much in the right &amp; so much in the wong, &#8211;
                    the natural feeling is sorrow, contemplate it how you will. But the Regency (however wrong they as well as their predecessors may
                    have been in not preventing the troubles) have done wisely in sending out troops, &amp; in fact could not act otherwise.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Reports that British military aid to Spain had actually been used to try and preserve
                        Spanish rule in its American colonies were causing some outrage at this time, e.g. <title>The Times</title>, 16 January 1812.
                        They referred in particular to the despatch of 4,000 men to fight revolutionaries in Mexico in November 1811.</note> You are
                    <del>the</del> to remember that their main resource in money comes from thence, &#8211; in fact they have no money but what the colonies supply,
                    except what little may be raised in Cadiz. If it be considered only in this direct political point of view you will not I think
                    condemn them, &#8211; but there is another &amp; higher <del>point of view</del> consideration. My first feeling was sorrow, &amp; yet
                    in that first feeling I could not but feel that there was more of the old Roman spirit in this than in any act of modern times.
                    The enemy is at the gates, &#8211; &amp; yet they send out troops to secure their remotest dependencies.</p>
