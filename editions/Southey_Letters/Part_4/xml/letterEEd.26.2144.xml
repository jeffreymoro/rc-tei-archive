          <l rend="indent3"> The gospel tidings, &#8211; &amp; in health &amp; youth</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Was smitten, &amp; the tyrant at her prayer</l>

        <p rend="indent1"> I know nothing like this book in poetry, but there is something
                    like it in Romance. Gyron le Courtoys,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> A French Arthurian romance, which formed part of the
                            <title>Palamades</title> cycle. Its putative, probably pseudonymous,
                        author was Helie de Boron, who may have lived in the thirteenth
                        century.</note> a book which has some of the best &amp; some of the worst
                    things of chivalrous romance, has something which is so far like that great part
                    of the hero&#8217;s <del>formd his</del> former history is related to himself. It has
                    a very good effect there, tho there is no passion connected with it, &amp; I was
                    led to the mode of back-narrative by the natural &amp; necessary course of my
                    own story, &#8211; not by imitation. Least of all things am I an imitator; &#8211; tho you
                    will see that I have borrowed something from Count Julian.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor&#8217;s <title>Count Julian: A

        <p rend="indent1"> The next book is nearly finished. I believe I must go back to the
                    fifth, &amp; interpolate a passage, introductory of Egilona,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Egilona was introduced into Book 5, but not
                        Book 8. In legend she was the wife of Roderick.</note> whose death I think
                    of bringing forward in Book 8, in whose character I must seek for such
                    palliation of the rape of Florinda, as may make Rodericks crime not so
                    absolutely incompatible with his heroic qualities as it now appears. The truth
                    is that in consequence of having begun the story with Roderick I have
                    imperceptibly &lt;been&gt; led to make him the prominent personage of the
                        poem,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s original plan had
                        been to centre the poem on Pelayo (c. 685&#8211;737), founder of the Kingdom of
                        Asturias, who is credited with beginning the Christian reconquest of the
                        Iberian peninsula from the Moors.</note> &amp; have given him virtues which
                    it will be very difficult to make consistent with his fall.</p>
