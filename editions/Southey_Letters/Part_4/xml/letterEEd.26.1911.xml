        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to the Register Books the fact is that since you were here I have received very few, my collection for
                    1809 having been formed before you left <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, &amp; that for the year ensuing not yet
                    begun. Except Pasley<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir Charles William Pasley (1780&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>),

                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 5 (May 1811), 403&#8211;457.</note> &amp; Jacob&#8217;s Travels<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Jacob (1761/2&#8211;1851; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Travels in the South of Spain</title> (1811).</note> I
                    recollect no addition to the stock, but a stray pamphlett or two, Jacob will not be done with, till I am some way advanced into
                    the third volume,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title> (1812).</note> &#8211; &amp; if it were these few volumes would not be worth
                    carriage. The case would have been different if you had not already overhauled the years assortment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You heard I believe that Stuart the Envoy at Lisbon was to lend me one of the books for which I advertised.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Stuart, Baron Stuart de Rothesay (1779&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), envoy at Lisbon
                        1810&#8211;1814, had sent a copy of Manuel Calado (1584&#8211;1654), <title>Valeroso Lucideno e o Triunfo da Liberdade</title> (1648), a
                        first-hand account of Brazil during the period of Dutch rule. It had been on the list of books wanted in Southey,
                            <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), I, p. [vi].</note> He contrived to send it by the
                    packet-mail, &#8211; &amp; it reached <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> with a charge of sixteen guineas for
                    postage. <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">L.</ref> applied to <ref target="people.html#FreelingFrancis">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Freeling</ref> who stretched his authority to the utmost &amp; reduced the charge to one guinea, &#8211; a price
                        <del>xx</del> which I must think myself well-off to pay for the loan of a book, of which the original cost would not exceed a
                    quarter of a moidore.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The moidore was a Portuguese gold coin. One quarter of a moidore was
                        worth between three and four shillings.</note> I hope our Envoy manages the affairs of the two nations better than he did
                    this.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you go to town in June we shall certainly meet then. I expect to set out the last week in May, &amp; we shall be
                    about a week on the road, taking it leisurely, &amp; stopping a couple of days at Nottingham. I have yet a months work at this
