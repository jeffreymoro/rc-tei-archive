            <l rend="indent3"> Had turned his casual eye, exclaimd, the Moors!</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For from the forest verge a troop were seen</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hastening toward Pedro&#8217;s hall. Their forward speed</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Was checkd when they beheld his banner spread,</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Of power &amp; insolence of long command</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Pricked on their chief presumptuous. We are come</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Late for prevention, cried the haughty Moor</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> But never time more fit for punishment!</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Buckler &amp; spear &amp; scymitar they dropt</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> As in precipitate rout they fled before</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The Asturian sword. The vales &amp; hills &amp; rocks</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Received their blood, &amp; where they fell the wolves</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> At evening found them.</l>
            <l rend="indent7"> From the fight apart</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Two Africans had stood who held in charge</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Count Eudon. When they saw their countrymen</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Falter, give way &amp; fly before the foe,</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> And saying, Infidel thou shalt not live</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To join their triumph, aim d against his neck</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The moony falchions point. His comrade rais&#8217;d</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A hasty hand, &amp; turn d its edge aside,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Yet so that oer the shoulder glancing down</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> It scarrd him as it past. The murderous Moor</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Not tarrying to secure his vengeance fled,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> While he of milder mood at Eudons feet</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Fell &amp; embraced his knees. The conqueror</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Who found them thus withheld at Eudons voice</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His wrathful hand, &amp; led them to his Lord</l>
            <lb />
            <l rend="indent3"> Count Pedro &amp; Alphonso &amp; the Prince</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Stood on a little rocky eminence</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Which overlooked the vale. Pedro had put</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His helmet off, &amp; with sonorous horn</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Blew the recall, &#8211; for well he knew what thoughts</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Calm as the Prince appeard &amp; undisturbed;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Lay underneath his silent fortitude,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And that at this eventful juncture speed</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Imported more than vengeance. Thrice he sent</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The long-resounding signal forth, which rung</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> From hill to hill, reechoing far &amp; wide.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Slow &amp; unwillingly his men obeyed,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The swelling horns reiterated call,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Repining that a single foe escaped</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The retribution of that righteous hour.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With lingering step reluctant from the chase</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> They turn d, &#8211; their veins full swoln, their sinews strung</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For battle still, their hearts unsatisfied;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Their swords were dripping still with Moorish gore,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And where they wiped their reeking brows, the stain</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of Moorish blood was left. But when they came</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Where Pedro with Alphonso at his side</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Stood to behold their coming, then they prest</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> All emulous with gratulation round,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Extolling for his deeds that day display d</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The noble boy. Oh when had Heaven, they said</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With such especial favour manifest</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Illustrated a first essay in arms!</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> They blest the father from whose loins he sprung</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The mother at whose happy breast he fed;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And prayed that their young heros fields might be</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Many, &amp; all like this.</l>
            <l rend="indent7"> Thus they indulged</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The honest heart, exuberant of love,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> When that loquacious joy at once was checkd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For Eudon &amp; the Moor were led before</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Count Pedro. Both came fearfully &amp; pale,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> But with a different fear; the African</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Felt at this crisis of his destiny</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Such apprehension as without reproach</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Might blanch a soldiers cheek, when life &amp; death</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hang on anothers will, &amp; helplessly</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> He must abide the issue. But the thoughts</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Which quaild Count Eudons heart &amp; made his limbs</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Quiver, were of his own unworthiness,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Old enmity, &amp; that he stood in power</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of hated &amp; hereditary foes.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> I came not with them willingly, &#8211; he cried, </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Addressing Pedro &amp; the Prince at once,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Rolling from each to each his restless eyes</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Aghast, &#8211; the Moor can tell I had no choice,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> They forced me from my Castle; &#8211; in the fight</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> They would have slain me, &#8211; see I bleed &#8211; the Moor</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Can witness that a Moorish scymitar</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Inflicted this; &#8211; he saved me from worse hurt, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> I did come in arms, &#8211; he knows it all, &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Speak man, &amp; let the truth be known to clear</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> My innocence.</l>
            <l rend="indent6"> Thus as he ceased with fear</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And rapid utterance panting open mouthd,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Count Pedro half represt a mournful smile</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Wherein compassion seemed to mitigate</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> His deep contempt. Methinks, said he, the Moor</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Might with more reason look himself to find</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> An intercessor, than be called upon</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To play the pleaders part. Didst thou then save</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The Baron from thy comrades?</l>
            <l rend="indent8"> Let my Lord</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Shew mercy to me, said the Musselman</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> As I am free from falsehood. We were left,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> I &amp; another, holding him in charge; &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> My fellow would have slain him when he saw</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> How the fight fard, &#8211; I turn&#8217;d the scymitar</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Aside, &amp; trust that life will be the meed</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For life by me preserved.</l>
            <l rend="indent7"> Nor shall thy trust</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Rejoind the Count, be vain. Say farther now</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> From whence ye came, &#8211; your orders what, &#8211; what force</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> In Gegio, &amp; if others like yourselves</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Are in the field.</l>
            <l rend="indent6"> The African replied,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> We came from Gegio, ordered to secure</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> This Baron on the way, &amp; seek thee here</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To bear thee hence in bonds. A messenger</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> From Cordoba, whose speed denoted well</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> He came with urgent tidings, was the cause</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of this our sudden movement. We went forth</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Three hundred men; an equal force was sent</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> To Cangas, on like errand as I ween:</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Four hundred in the city then were left.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> If other force be moving from the south</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> I know not, &#8211; save that all appearances</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Denote alarm &amp; vigilance.</l>
            <l rend="indent8"> The Prince</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Fix&#8217;d upon Eudon then his eye severe.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Baron, he said, the die of war is cast.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> What part art thou prepared to take &#8211; against</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Or with the oppressor?</l>
            <l rend="indent7"> Not against my friends,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Not against you, the irresolute wretch replied</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hasty, yet faltering in his fearful speech</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> But have ye weighed it well? &#8211; it is not yet</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Too late, &#8211; their numbers, &#8211; their victorious force</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> The Sceptre of the Goths: &#8211; the throne destroyed</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Our towns subdued, &#8211; our country over-run</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Were it not better thro my agency</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> That dastard speech, &amp; checking ere it grew</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Too powerful for restraint the incipient rage</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Which in indignant murmurs breathing round</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> The cup which we have pledged; she claims from none</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The dauntless fortitude, the mind resolved</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Envy &amp; inward consciousness, &amp; fear,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Predominant, which stifled in his heart</l>

                        France at least be stripped of all territory acquired since the French Revolution. The <title>Letters</title> were modelled on
                        Junius&#8217;s. Landor had originally sent 3 of the letters to the <title>Courier</title>. He then prepared them for separate
                        publication, adding a fourth letter. The <title>Courier</title> eventually published part of this fourth letter on 12 January

                        particular, five stanzas were considered by Croker and Rickman to be inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and
                        deleted them from the version published as <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated
                        the deleted stanzas into an &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte&#8217; (&#8216;Who counsels peace&#8217;), published in the

                        1788&#8211;1808), who had just abdicated as King of Spain, and his son Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833), to
                        Bayonne, allegedly to mediate between them. In fact he persuaded Ferdinand to abdicate in favour of his father and Charles to
                        abdicate in favour of Napoleon&#8217;s elder brother, who thus became Joseph I (1768&#8211;1844; King of Spain 1808&#8211;1813).</note> was
                    fresh in the feelings of the public, I believe that the Emperor <del>xxxx</del> of Austria, wretch as he is, could never have

                    &#8211; be that as it may Spain &amp; Portugal would have joined us in the declaration, the terms of our alliance would have been never
                    to make peace with him, &amp; France knowing this would ere then have delivered herself from him. My present hope is, that he will
                    require terms of peace to which the allies will not consent, &#8211; a little success is likely enough to inflate him, &#8211; for the wretch
                    is equally incapable of bearing prosperous or adverse fortune. As for the Bourbons I do not wish to see them restored, &#8211; unless
                    there was no other means of effecting his overthrow. Restorations are bad things, when the expulsion has taken place from internal
                    causes, &amp; not by foreign force. They have been a detestable race, &amp; the adversity which they have undergone is not of that
                    kind which renovates the intellect or calls <del>xx</del> into life the virtues which royalty has stiffled. I used to think that
                    the Revolution would not have done its work till the houses of Austria &amp; Bourbon were both destroyed, a consummation the
                    history of both houses has taught me devoutly to wish for. Did I ever tell you Hofer<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The

                    or the halter there will be a lack of justice in this world, which will require some expence of brimstone in the next to balance
                    the account. The fact is one of the most damnable in human history, &#8211; but a fact it is, tho it has not got abroad. Adair<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The politician and diplomat Sir Robert Adair (1763&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>), who had been
