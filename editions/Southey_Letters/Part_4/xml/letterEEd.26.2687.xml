        <p rend="indent1"> I can send you <del>xx</del> no article but that upon Alfieri &amp; Italian Tragedy for your next number, &amp;
                    this will not be a long one.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Lloyd&#8217;s translation of <title>The Tragedies of
                            Vittorio Alfieri</title> (1815); reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 14 (January 1816),
                        333&#8211;368.</note> A long paper is with me a full months work &#8211; I do not mean to say <distinct>dogged</distinct> work, for what
                    is done doggedly can never be done well &#8211; but is the main business of a month, &amp; whatever else can be done <del>xx</del>
                    &lt;during&gt; that time is only as recreation by means of change. At this time my poem gives me full employment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have read Sir J Malcolms book, the first volume with disappointment, the second with much pleasure &amp;
                    instruction. It is as a traveller &amp; not as an historian that the author excels, &amp; he would have done better to have formed
                    his materials into a &#8220;View of the present state of Persia with researches into the history of that country.&#8221; In the historical
                    part the information is <del>xxx</del> almost exclusively oriental, &#8211; when Roman &amp; Byzantine writers might have supplied some
                    interesting detail: &amp; <del>xxxx</del> there is that want of detail &amp; circumstance the absence of which is as much the
                    fault of <del>xxx</del> modern historians, as the redundance of them is that of the middle-age chroniclers. There can be no better
                    book for a Reviewers purpose. It is a principle with me &lt;in reviewing&gt; to say nothing more of the defects of a book which
                    adds to our store of knowledge, than just suffices <del>xx</del> for making the understanding reader perceive that I perceive
                    them. I happen to be well read respecting Persia, &amp; can draw up an article which will be attractive in itself, &amp; likewise
                    serve the book, &#8211; some such assistance I should apprehend it is likely to want.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir John

                        Southey&#8217;s library. The review of Malcolm in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (April 1816), 236&#8211;292, was by Reginald
                        Heber, not Southey.</note>

                    certainly suggests something which might with much propriety form the subject of a prior essay.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> This new article was on recent accounts by foreign visitors of tours of Britain; it was published in

                        Bell in 1808. Southey clearly intended to compare Bell&#8217;s methods with those of the Swiss educational reformer, Johann Heinrich
                        Pestalozzi (1746&#8211;1827), whose works included <title>How Gertrude Teaches Her Children</title> (1801). The &#8216;Pestalozzi Method&#8217;
                        argued that children should learn through activity and through things, rather than words. As part of this, children should be
