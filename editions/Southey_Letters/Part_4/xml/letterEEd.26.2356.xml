        <p rend="indent1"> Longman will send you two copies of what ought to be called Carmen Castratum,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s first official poem as Poet Laureate was extremely controversial and much altered prior to
                        publication. Five stanzas were considered by Croker and Rickman to be inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and deleted them
                        from the version published as <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the
                        deleted stanzas into an &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte&#8217;, published in the <title>Courier</title>, 3
                        February 1814.</note> &#8212; one you may transfer to your neighbour.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Barlow
                        (1759&#8211;1839), a neighbour of Herbert Hill&#8217;s in Streatham. Southey had recently completed a privately commissioned defence of
                        the conduct of William&#8217;s brother Sir George Hilaro Barlow (1763&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>), Governor of Madras 1807&#8211;1813. This
                        was published anonymously as <title>An Exposure of the Misrepresentations and Calumnies in Mr Marsh&#8217;s Review of Sir George
                            Barlow&#8217;s Administration at Madras. By the Relatives of Sir George Barlow</title> (1813).</note> I looked in the last

                    felt, &#8211; &amp; finding it there I thought more of him than of the victory. For his letters have given me a great interest in his
                    safety. Tell me how he is, &amp; where; &#8211; severely, does not necessarily imply dangerously.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorely out of humour with public affairs.

                        Child and Champion of &#8230; Jacobinism&#8217; in a speech in the House of Commons on 17 February 1800.</note> but whether Jacobinism, or
                    the Devil himself bred him, it is this country that has nurst him up to his present fortunes. <del>If</del> After the murder of

                        Bourbons, he took a prominent part in campaigns by French &#233;migr&#233;s against the Revolutionary government. In March 1804 he was
                        kidnapped from his home in Germany and convicted by a French military tribunal of involvement in a recent royalist plot, even
                        though the French government knew he was innocent of the charges. He was shot on 21 March 1804.</note> &amp; Palm,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The German bookseller Johann Philipp Palm (1768&#8211;1806), executed without trial for publishing an
                        attack on Bonaparte.</note> &#8211; avowed, open, notorious as they were, we ought to have made the war personal against a wretch
                    who was under the Ban of humanity. Had this been our constant language he would long since have been destroyed by the French
                    themselves, &#8211; nor do I think that Austria would ever have connected itself <del>with</del> &lt;by&gt; marriage with a man so

        <p rend="indent1"> I spoilt my poem in deference to <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> judgement &amp; <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Crokers</ref> advice by cutting out all which related to Buonaparte, &amp; which gave

        <p rend="indent1"> I had a letter a day or two ago from Kinder (my quondam BAyres journalist<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The merchant Thomas Kinder (c.1781&#8211;1846). Southey had borrowed Kinder&#8217;s unpublished journal of events in Buenos Aires in
                        1808&#8211;1810 that led to the independence of the states of the Rio de la Plata. (In 1813 Southey had a copy made of the journal,
                        no. 3162 in the sale catalogue of his library. The copy was published as, Malyn Newitt (ed.), <title>War, Revolution and
                            Society in the Rio de la Plata 1808&#8211;1810. Thomas Kinder&#8217;s Narrative of a Journey to Madeira, Montevideo and Buenos

                    From the specimens which he had seen he thought they combined a blacker assemblage of diabolical qualities than any set of men
                    whom he every before had had an opportunity of observing. &#8211; Now Kinder is a cool, clear-headed man, disposed to see things in

                    Spain, there has been none during the last six years, &amp; the ruffian-like propensities of the brute multitude have had their
                    full swing. Kinder had been to the scene of action &amp; dined frequently at head quarters. He finds Biscay more beautiful than he
                    expected, &#8211; but has seen nothing to equal the vale of <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. &#8211; I shall make use of him
