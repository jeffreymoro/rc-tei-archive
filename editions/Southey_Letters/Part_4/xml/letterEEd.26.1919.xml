                        had tried to persuade two French officers to become involved in a scheme to capture the port of Belleisle-sur-Mer. The clumsy
                        plot had been uncovered and Owen had told all he knew to the French authorities, resulting in the arrest of his
                        co-conspirators. Owen had been taken prisoner on 10 September 1810, when boats from HMS <hi rend="ital">Dreadnought</hi>, on
                        which Tom Southey was serving, had captured a Spanish merchant ship, which was moored in a creek near Ushant. The boats came
                        under heavy fire and six British sailors were killed, over thirty wounded and two boats drifted onto the shore and their men were
                        imprisoned; see the account in <title>The Times</title>, 15 September 1810. Despite these disasters, Owen escaped in 1813 and
