          <salute>My dear Wynn,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for remembering me at Jefferys.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Jeffrey (c. 1763&#8211;1832), a
                        London bookseller, with a long-established shop in Pall Mall.</note> I have the Castilian version of Desclot,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bernat Desclot (13th century), <title>Historia de Catalu&#241;a</title> (1616), no. 3287 in the sale
                        catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; &amp; a most curious &amp; interesting book it is. The title of the other book I
                    cannot understand: it looks like Espana Transpelana<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Unidentified. Southey did not buy this
                        work.</note> &#8211; but what that can be I do not know &amp; am unable to guess. Buy it for me however at a venture if it be any
                    thing except a mere compendium of the general history of Spain. <del>I wish you</del> If a copy of Gregory of Tours<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> St Gregory of Tours (c. 538&#8211;594), historian and bishop. An edition of his <title>Historiae
                            Francorum</title> (1561) was no. 1240 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> which is within compass of my
                    purse should fall in your way, pray purchase it for me. I want it for the purpose of gleaning costume for Roderick.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do not be too sure of your victory in the H. of Commons.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was deeply
                        worried as the Catholic Relief Bill, which gave the government a veto over the appointment of Catholic bishops (the main
                        &#8216;security&#8217; some Catholics were willing to concede), in return for full Catholic rights, had passed its Second Reading in the
                        House of Commons and was being considered in committee.</note> It is not unlikely that when the securities come to be
                    discussed you will find yourselves in a minority there, as well as in the country at large. The mischief however is done. It is
                    like certain bodily complaints trifling in <del>itself</del> &lt;themselves&gt;, &#8211; but of infinite import as symptomatic of
                    approaching death. The more I see, the more I read, &amp; the more I reflect, the more reason there appears to me to fear that our
                    turn of Revolution is <del>xxxx xxxx</del> hastening on. In the minds of the busy part of the public it is already effected. The
                    save-all reformers have made them suspicious; &#8211; the opposition has made them discontented, &#8211; the anarchists are making them
                    furious. Methodism is undermining the church, &amp; your party in league with all varieties of opinionists from the Atheists of
                    Edinburgh, to Ephraim Broadbrim,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> A popular name for a Quaker, from John Cartwright Cross
                        (1770-c. 1809), <title>The Village Doctor</title> (1796).</note> have battered it till you have succeeded in making a breach.
                    I give you all credit for good intentions, &#8211; but I know the dissenters &amp; the philosophists better than you do, &amp; know that
                    the principle which they have in common is a hatred of the Church of the England, &amp; a wish to overthrow her. This they will
                    accomplish, &#8211; &amp; you will regret it as much &lt;as&gt; I shall do, &#8211; not more <del>because</del> &lt;tho&gt; you believe in
                    some of its <del>articles xxx</del> articles which I disclaim, &#8211; &amp; certainly not the less for having yourself contributed to
                    its destruction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The end of all this will be the loss of liberty, &#8211; for that is the penalty which in the immutable order of things
                    is appointed for the abuse of it. What we may have to go thro before we sit <del>xx</del> down quietly in our chains God only
                    knows. </p>
