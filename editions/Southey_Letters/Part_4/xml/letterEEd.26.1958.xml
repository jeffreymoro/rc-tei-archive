        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#WhiteJames">James</ref> left us this morning. I went with him a few miles, for the sake of showing him
                    the Lake of Thirlmere, in a way seldom seen by travellers. He was exceedingly delighted with it; and, as he had three waterfalls,
                    all very fine ones, to see in the course of the morning, this day, notwithstanding it is that of his departure, will not be the
                    least agreeable that he has passed in this country. He was very fortunate in the weather, and saw nearly as much as the shortness
                    of the time permitted; but enough has been left unseen to supply a proper motive for another journey and a longer stay. Remember
                    your sisters are to visit us next midsummer, and I hope your excellent mother will accompany them.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Mary White, n&#233;e Neville (1755&#8211;1833). She had three daughters; Hannah White (c. 1779&#8211;1813); Frances Moriah White
                        (1791&#8211;1854); Catherine Bailey White (1795&#8211;1889).</note> When shall we see you?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Buenos Ayres papers, which are to me very interesting and very valuable, but except by your means
                    would have been inaccessible.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Copies of the <title>Gazeta de Buenos Ayres</title>, which
                        ran from 7 June 1810 to 12 September 1821.</note> I am not yet at work upon the third year&#8217;s &#8220;Register,&#8221;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title>, published in 1812.</note> which is
                    rather owing to the Edinburgh publishers than to myself. The success of the book, as a bookselling concern, seems to me rather
                    doubtful; its failure would make more difference in my emolument than in my occupation, for I am now so sensible of the utility of
                    the book, and so much interested by it, that if this concern were broken up I should continue my labours, and go on with this
                    contemporary history, as one of the most important works which I could possibly bequeath to after times.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What has been the event of that painful business which you communicated to me when last we met?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Details are unclear, but this was connected to a woman of White&#8217;s acquaintance who had got
                        involved with an unsuitable man; see Southey to Neville White, 16 November 1811, Letter 1984.</note> It would give me very
                    great pleasure to hear that it had been settled as you hoped it might he, and as, indeed, it must be if one of the parties has any
                    right sense either of honour or duty.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Make my respects to Mr. Park,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The antiquary and bibliographer Thomas Park
                        (1758/9&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>).</note> and tell him I <hi rend="ital">did</hi> receive the book he mentions, and that if I
                    did not write to acknowledge it, as certainly was my intention, I take shame to myself for the neglect.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably a volume, or volumes, of Park&#8217;s <title>Sharpe&#8217;s Edition of the Works of the British Poets</title>
                        (1808&#8211;1813). (Southey&#8217;s copy was no. 356 in the sale catalogue of his library.) Park had included a handful of poems by
                        Lovell; <title>Bristol, A Satire</title> (1794) was added to the selection published in later editions.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell&#8217;s</ref> few
                    other pieces which I could not find in time for his purpose, have since turned up, and shall be sent to him the first opportunity
                    that occurs of conveying them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We had a long and weary round before we reached home. I left <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Mrs. S.</ref>
                    at Bristol, and went to Taunton; returned to her, and went successively to <ref target="places.html#Llanthony">Llanthony</ref> in
                    Monmouthshire, to Ludlow, to <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Teddesley</ref> in Staffordshire, to Llangedwin in
                    Montgomeryshire, and to Liverpool, halting a few days with our friends at each of these places. We dined also at Llangollen with
                    the celebrated ladies of the place, <ref target="people.html#LlangollenLadies">Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby</ref>. The
                    singularity of their history, the highly ornamented state of their grounds, and the elegance of everything about their cottage,
                    made this a very interesting visit.</p>

                    satisfies me; and very probably the bearing which it has upon the present state of things, and the possibility that if it were
                    published it might tend to excite in others the same ardent sympathy with the Spaniards which I feel myself, may induce me to
                    devote more time to its completion than I otherwise should do. Remember us when you write to Nottingham, and remember me also to
