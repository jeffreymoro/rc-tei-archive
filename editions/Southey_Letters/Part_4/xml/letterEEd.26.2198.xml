        <p rend="indent1"> I have just been applied to for letters to Lisbon on behalf of a young Clergyman, who very probably may never live
                    to reach it, &amp; at any rate is taking a very awkward course there. He goes out with a friend who has a sloop of war bound to
                    Halifax, as far as Bermudas, &amp; there means to look for a passage either to Portugal or Cadiz. He is described to me as a man
                    of high character at Oxford &amp; among all who know him. Will you give him a letter to Sealy,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Sealy (d. 1821), Lisbon merchant and father-in-law of Henry Herbert Southey.</note> or any other
                    person, who, if he lives to reach Lisbon, may do those offices for him of which he will stand in need. His name is Henry

                        Reeves (1748&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>), vicar of Wrington and composer. Henry Daniel Reeves survived his visit to Portugal and
                        later worked in Syria and Greece, where he was agent for the British and Foreign Bible Society. He translated the bible and
                        the liturgy into modern Greek and at the time of the Greek War of Independence sheltered many Greek fugitives in his house,
                        thus saving them from the Turks.</note> &#8211; &amp; if you will put the letter in a cover with my compliments on the inside,

                        [April 1812], Letter 2085). He had either kept this or bought one of his own; see no. 2144 in the sale catalogue of his
