          <l rend="indent3"> Twas in the grey of morning; soon the sun,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Rising above Albardos, pourd his light</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Over the forest, &amp; with ray aslant</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Entering its depth, illumed the branchless pines,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Brightend their bark, tinged with a redder hue</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Its rusty stains, &amp; cast along the floor</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Long lines of shadow, where they rose erect</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Like pillars of the temple. With slow foot</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Roderick pursued his way, for penitence,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Remorse which gave no respite, &amp; the long</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And painful conflict of his troubled soul</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had worn him down: now brighter thoughts had risen,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And that triumphant vision floated still</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Before his sight, with all her blazonry,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her towered helm, &amp; the victorious sword</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which flashd like lightning over the field of blood:</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Thus musing as he went, the distant cry</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of horn, &amp; hound, &amp; huntsmans loud halloo,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Brake on his ear. Twas the first living voice</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of man which he had heard since he beheld</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Romanos lips while blessing him, break off</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The faltering prayer, &amp; fall for ever fixd:</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And started at the sound, his heart in fear</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A moment stopt, then throbbd with quicker spring.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Nearer the clamour came, with louder shout,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And broader blast of horn, &amp; deeper cry,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And tramp of thundering hoofs; anon the stag</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Bursts full in view, the huntsmen close behind</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Press on his flight, a turbaned company,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And lo the Moorish javelin gores his flank.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Yet a few paces with convulsive bound</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He sprung, then dropt at Rodericks feet; his eyes</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Were turnd on him, &amp; at that look of death.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And at his dying sobs, as at a sound</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of human agony, the fallen Goth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Shuddered; to him they seem&#8217;d to speak reproach,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Stinging reproach &amp; shame; &amp; as he shrunk</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And hid himself from sight within the wood.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Caitiff!&#8221; his inward soul upbraided him,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Wretch that thou art, the Misbelievers take</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;This pastime in thy land! the innocent beast</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;That bleeds beneath their spear accuseth thee!</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Yea all the blood,&#8221; &#8211; with that as if his heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had risen &amp; shaken off that dreadful thought,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;These enemies O Lord! are thine,&#8217; he cried</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Vengeance is thine! for thine own holy will;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Thy own redeeming Law, <del>&amp;</del> in thy good time</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Thou wilt deliver Spain; yea, I shall see</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;The dawn of her deliverance, of her day</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Of glory, &amp; my spirit ere I die,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8220;Shall taste of joy once more.&#8221;</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Instead thereof <del>in</del> her polluted tower</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Bidding the Moor to his unhallowed prayers</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The cryer stood, &amp; with his sonorous voice</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Filld the delicious vale where Lena winds</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Thro groves &amp; pastoral meads. The sound, the sight</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of turban, girdle, robe, &amp; scymitar</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And tawny skins, arousd contending thoughts</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of shame &amp; wrathful anguish in the Goth;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The unaccustomed face of humankind</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Confusd him now, &amp; thro the streets he went</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With haggard mien, &amp; countenance like one</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Crazd or bewildered. All who met him turnd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And wondered as he past; One stopt him short</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Put alms into his hand, &amp; then desird</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In broken Gothic speech, the moonstruck man</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To bless him. With a look of vacancy</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Roderick receivd the alms; his wandering eye</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Fell on the money, &amp; the fallen King,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Seeing his own royal impress on the piece,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Broke out into a quick convulsive voice</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That seemd like laughter first, but indeed soon</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In hollow groans supprest, the Musselman</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Shrunk at the ghastly sound, &amp; magnified</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The name of Allah <del>xx</del> as he past along.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A Christian woman spinning at her door</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Beheld him, &amp; with sudden pity touchd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> She laid her spindly by, &amp; hastening in</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Took bread, &amp; following after, calld him back</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And placing in his passive hands the loaf</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> She said, Christ Jesus for his mothers sake</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Have mercy on thee; with a look which seemd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Like idiotcy he heard her, &amp; stood still</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Staring awhile, then bursting into tears</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Wept like a child, &amp; thus relievd his heart,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Full even to bursting else with struggling thoughts</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> So thro the streets &amp; thro the northern gate</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Did Roderick, restless of a resting place</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With feeble, yet with hurried step pursue</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His agitated way, &amp; when he reachd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The open fields, &amp; found himself alone</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Beneath the starry canopy of heaven,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The sense of solitude so dreaded late</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Was then repose &amp; comfort. There he stopt</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Beside a little rill, &amp; broke the loaf,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And shedding oer that unaccustomed food</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Painful but quiet tears, with grateful heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He breathd thanksgiving forth then made his bed</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> On heath &amp; myrtle.</l>
          <l rend="indent6"> But when he arose</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> At day break &amp; pursued his way, his heart</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Felt lighten&#8217;d that the shock of mingling first</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Among his fellow-kind was overpast:</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And journeying on he greeted whom he met</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With such short interchange of benison</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> As each to other gentle travellers give,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Recovering thus the power of social speech</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which he had long disusd. When hunger prest</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He askd for alms; slight supplication serv&#8217;d,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A countenance so pale &amp; woe-begone</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Movd all to pity, &amp; the marks it bore</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of rigorous penance &amp; austerest life,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With something too of majesty that still</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Appeard amid the wreck, inspird a sense</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of reverence too. The Goatherd on the hills</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Opened his scrip for him; the babe in arms</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Affrighted at his visage, turned away,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And clinging to its mothers neck in tears,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Would yet again look up &amp; then again</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With cry renewd shrink back. The bolder imps</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Who playd beside the way, at his approach</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Break of their sport for wonder, &amp; stood still</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In silence, &#8211; some among them cried A Saint!</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The village matron when she gave him food</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Besought his prayers, &amp; one intreated him</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To lay his healing hands upon her child.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For with a sore &amp; hopeless malady</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Wasting it long had lain, &amp; more, she said,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He was a Man of God.</l>
          <l rend="indent6"> Thus travelling on</l>

                        leaning on</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Bent oer the open sepulchre. But soon</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With quiet mien collectedly, like one</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Who from intense devotion, &amp; the act</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of ardent prayer arising girds himself</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For this worlds daily business, she arose</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And said to Roderick, help me now to raise</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The covering of the tomb. With half-burnt planks</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which she had gathered for this funeral use</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> They roof&#8217;d the vault; then laying stones above</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> They closd it down; last, rendering all secure</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Stones upon stones they pil&#8217;d, till all appeard</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A huge &amp; shapeless heap. Enough, she cries</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And taking Rodericks hands in both her own,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And wringing them with fervent thankfulness,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> May God show mercy to thee, she exclaim&#8217;d,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> When most thou needest mercy! Who thou art</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> I know not; not of Auria, &#8211; for of all</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her sons &amp; daughters save the one who stands</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Before thee, not a soul is left alive.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> But thou hast rendered to me in my hour</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of need the only hope that man could give.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> What else of consolation may be found</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For one so utterly bereft, from Heaven,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And from myself must come. For deem not thou</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That I shall sink beneath calamity!</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> This visitation like a lightning stroke</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Hath scath&#8217;d the fruit &amp; blossom of my youth,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> One hour hath orphan&#8217;d me, &amp; widowd me,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And made me childless. In this sepulchre</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Lie buried all my earthward hopes &amp; fears,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> All human loves &amp; natural charities,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> All womanly tenderness, all gentle thoughts, &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> All womanly weakness too I bury here,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Yea all my former nature. There remain</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Revenge &amp; death: the bitterness of death</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Is past, &amp; Heaven already hath vouchsafd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A fore taste of revenge.</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> Look here! she cried,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And drawing back held forth her bloody hands,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Tis Moorish! &#8211; In the hour of massacre</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A captain of Alcamans murderous host</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Reservd me from the slaughter. Not <del>because</del>
                        &lt;because&gt;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> My rank &amp; station tempted him with thought</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of ransom, for amid the general waste</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of ruin all was lost &#8211; Nor yet because</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That pity mov&#8217;d him, they who from this race</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Accurst for pity look, such pity found</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> As ravenous wolves show the defenceless flock.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> My husband at my feet had fallen, my babe</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8211; O Jesus God &#8211; was on the spear, &#8211; &amp; then &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Even then, &#8211; amid the throes of agony</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which rent my soul, <del>which</del> &lt;when&gt; if this
                        solid earth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had opened, &amp; let out the central fire</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Before whose all involving flames <del>the</del> &lt;high&gt;
                        heaven <del>x</del>
          </l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Shall shrivel like a scroll, &amp; be consum&#8217;d,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The universal wreck had been to me</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Relief &amp; comfort, &#8211; even then this Moor</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Turn&#8217;d his libidinous eyes on me, &amp; bade</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His men reserve me safely for <del>his</del> an hour</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of dalliance, &#8211; me &#8211; me in my agonies.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> But when I found for what this miscreant child</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of Hell had snatchd me from the <del>massacre</del>
                        &lt;butchery&gt;,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The very horror of that monstrous thought</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sav&#8217;d me from madness. I was calm at once, &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Yea comforted &amp; reconciled to life, &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Hatred became to me the life of life;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Its purpose &amp; its power.</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> The glutted Moors</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> At length broke up, this hell-dog turn&#8217;d aside.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Toward his home, we travelled fast &amp; far,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Till by a forest edge at eve, he pitchd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His tents. I washd &amp; ate at his command</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Forcing revolted nature, &#8211; I composd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> My garments, &amp; bound up my scatterd hair,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And when he took my hand, &amp; to his couch</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Would fain have drawn me, gently I retird</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> From that abominable touch, &amp; said</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Forbear tonight I pray thee; for this day</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A widow as thou seest me was I made,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Therefore according to our law, must watch</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And pray to night. Tomorrow let my Lord</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Deal with his captive as it pleaseth him.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The villain paus&#8217;d before with loathsome smile</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He gave consent, then, laid him down to rest</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> While at the door of the pavilion, I</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Knelt on the ground &amp; bowd my face to earth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> But when the neighbouring tents had ceasd their stir</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The fires were out, &amp; all were fast asleep</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Then I arose; the blessed Moon from heaven</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Lent me her holy light. I did not pray</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For strength, for strength was given me, &amp; I drew</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The scymitar &amp; standing oer the couch</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Raisd it in both my hands with steady aim,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And smote his neck. Upward as from a spring</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> When newly opend by the husbandman,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The villainous life blood spoutd. Twice I struck</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> So making vengeance sure, then praising God</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Retird amid the wood, &amp; measurd back</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> My patient way to Auria, to perform</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The duty which thou seest.</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> As thus she spake,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Roderick intently listening, had forgot</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His crown, his kingdom, his calamities,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His crimes, so like a spell upon the Goth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her powerful words prevaild. With open lips</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And eager ears &amp; eyes which while they watched</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her features caught the spirit which she breathed</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Mute, &amp; enrapt he stood, &amp; motionless;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The vision rose before him, &amp; the shout</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which like a thunderpeal victorious Spain</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sent thro the welkin, rung within his soul</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Its deep prophetic echoes. On his brow</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The pride &amp; power of former majesty</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Dawnd once again, but changed &amp; purified</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> From all alloy of base &amp; selfish thoughts</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Vain glorious weakness &amp; triumphant vice,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Duty, &amp; high heroic purposes</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Now hallowd it, &amp; as with inward light</l>
