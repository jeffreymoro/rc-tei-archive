                    You will find the commencement of a curious chapter. Send it by post to <ref target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>, &amp;
                    by the same conveyance <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> may transmit it to <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</ref>. At present my work is pretty equally divided between this, &amp; the ex officio
                    poem, which for a reason that you will comprehend I entitle La Belle Alliance.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> A poem that
                        became <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816). Southey&#8217;s desire to name it the &#8216;Belle Alliance&#8217; was due to
                        his belief that it was more suited to verse (Southey to John Rickman, [c. 5 July 1815], Letter 2633), and that &#8216;the name of Waterloo was given to the battle by the Duke of Wellington in a spirit of the lowest &amp; vilest
                        jealousy&#8217; (Southey to Thomas Southey, 17 December 1815, Letter 2684).</note> It is in a six lined stanza, like the tale of
                        Gualberto,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ballad &#8216;St Juan Gualberto&#8217;, <title>Annual Anthology</title> (Bristol,
                        1800), 1&#8211;19.</note> &amp; I shall perhaps finish the Proem this evening.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have nearly finished the first volume of Sir J Malcolms book,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir John
                        Malcolm (1769&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of Persia</title> (1815), a lavish, two volume quarto, containing
                        a map and several plates and portraits. It was dedicated to <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">Marquis
                        Wellesley</ref>. Southey owned a copy, no. 1662 in the sale catalogue of his library. He did not review it.</note> surely the
                    dearest that ever issued from the Press. As far as I have gone it is an excellent book for reviewing precisely because the author
                    has left undone those things which he ought to have done. There may probably be some good matter to come, touching the present
                    state of the country, &#8211; but the first volume has no one merit whatever, &amp; has added less to my knowledge than I should have
                        <del>xxx</del> supposed possible.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> has gone on admirably during my long absence. A schoolmaster here gave him
                    one lesson weekly in Greek, but he went on daily <del>with</del> both with the Greek &amp; German by himself, as I expected, &amp;
                    made good progress in both. I have subscribed to the Saxon Chronicle,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> A copy of the
                        &#8216;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&#8217; so that Southey and Herbert could study Old English. In 1815 &#8216;A new edition of the Saxon Chronicle,
                        with an English translation and notes&#8217;, edited by James Ingram (1774&#8211;1850; <title>DNB</title>), Rawlinsonian Professor of
                        Anglo-Saxon at Oxford 1803&#8211;1808, was advertised as &#8216;In the press&#8217;, <title>The Tradesman</title>, 14 (January 1815), 55.
                        However, it did not appear until 1823. Southey had two copies, nos 2593 and 2594 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note>
                    &amp; when it arrives mean to make my way thro it with him, &#8211; a useful undertaking for both.</p>
