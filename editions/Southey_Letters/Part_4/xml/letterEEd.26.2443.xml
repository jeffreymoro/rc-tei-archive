        <p rend="indent1"> Your remarks arriving on Thursday when we have no outward post to London will perhaps render my reply too late to
                    be of any use. However I will reply for the chance.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford had sent a critique of
                        Southey&#8217;s three odes paying tribute to the Prince Regent and celebrating the 1814 visit to London of Alexander I (1777&#8211;1825;
                        Emperor of Russia 1801&#8211;1825) and Frederick William III (1770&#8211;1840; King of Prussia 1797&#8211;1840); published as
                            <title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty The Emperor of Russia, and
                            His Majesty the King of Prussia</title> (1814). Bedford had been overseeing the proofs, but as publication was imminent,
                        Southey was aware that the corrections sent in his letter were probably too late to be implemented.</note>
