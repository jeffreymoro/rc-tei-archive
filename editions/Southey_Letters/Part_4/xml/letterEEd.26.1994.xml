                        Windham&#8217;s (1750&#8211;1810; <title>DNB</title>) will.</note> who gave me two such excellent dinners, may possibly have it in his
                    power to render me a useful service for this work. In the long discussion upon the Walcheren expedition Windham spoke &#8220;at length&#8221;
                    &#8211; March 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Windham censured the Walcheren expedition in a speech
                        of two hours on 30 March 1810. It was not reported because Parliamentary journalists objected to Windham&#8217;s attitude in a
                        debate of 23 March 1810 on the exclusion of reporters from the Inns of Court &#8211; the boycott lasted until 10 April 1810. The
                        Walcheren expedition was an unsuccessful British landing in the Netherlands in 1809. The plan had been to open another front
                        in the war against Napoleon. Although there was little actual fighting, the British forces were severely depleted by a
                        sickness quickly dubbed the &#8216;Walcheren Fever&#8217;. For Southey&#8217;s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1
                        (1811), 660&#8211;692.</note>&#8211; but he had lately offended the Reporters. &amp; not a word of his speech can I find in <ref target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbetts</ref> Debates (the book which I use)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William
                        Cobbett had published an unofficial annual record of <title>Parliamentary Debates</title> since 1802.</note> &#8211; nor in the
                    newspapers. Now if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Legge has that speech among Windhams papers, &amp; will allow me to make an abstract of
                    it, I should be very much beholden to him. The circumstance of giving a speech of such a man &lt;which is&gt; not to be found
                    elsewhere, by accrediting the diligence of the writer &amp; the means of information which he possesses would be of considerable
                    use to the book. &#8211; If he will trust the papers to you, <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> or <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> will get them franked down, &amp; they shall be returned in eight
                    &amp; forty hours. &#8211; I might very well spare myself this trouble which is pure matter of supererogation: &#8211; nor <del>do</del> would
                    I do it for any other man but Windham, &#8211; <del>xxx</del> whose speeches, whether he was right or wrong, were always <del>xxx</del>
                    ingenious. &#8211; Do not however ask M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Legge if you see the slightest impropriety in the application, or feel the

                    bearings. I dedicate <del>xxx</del> it to <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">the Editor of the Edinburgh Review</ref>, &#8211; in
                    terms of stinging sarcasm such as he deserves at my hands.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You see <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> recommends my last years Register to the notice
                    of Parliament;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> A long aside in the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 18 (August 1811),
                        420&#8211;423n, had questioned whether the &#8216;virulent personal abuse &#8230; levelled at the most respectable members of the Legislature&#8217;
                        in the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> was in breach of Parliamentary privilege and hinted that action against the
                        author and publishers might be taken. In the event, the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>&#8217;s suggestion was not acted on.</note>
                    &amp; it would not surprize me if this recommendation should be the means of introducing me to the Sergeant at Arms.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francis John Colman, serjeant-at-arms (i.e. the chief law enforcement officer in the Houses of
                        Parliament) 1805&#8211;1811, died in Portugal on 12 December 1811. His successor was John Clementson (1780&#8211;1856), who served in a
                        temporary capacity from January&#8211;March 1812, when the post went to Henry Seymour (1778&#8211;1844), who held it until 1835.</note>
                    This would bring me to town in the winter instead of the ensuing fall of the leaf; &#8211; any other inconvenience would be amply
                    overbalanced by the celebrity which it would give to the book, &amp; the credit which I should gain when called <del>xxx</del>
                    upon to speak in my own behalf. <hi rend="ital">Speak</hi> I should not, &#8211; having no confidence in myself of that nature, &#8211;
                    solitary habits <del>xxx</del> have incapacitated me for speaking, but I should read a short paper every word of which would be
                    equally well-weighed &amp; weighty. &#8211; So if <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Broughams</ref> friendly hint produce its
                    intended effect, it will not find me unprepared. It is curious that in the very note in which this man accuses me of an offence
                    against the H of Commons, he brings a charge himself against the house, founded upon a direct falshood. &#8220;the House, he says, in an
                    unlucky hour was pleased to resolve that the proposal of discussing a Members conduct implied an invasion of the Bill of
                        Rights&#8221;<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 18 (August 1811), 416n.</note> &#8211; &amp; he hopes that &#8216;this Resolution will soon be
                    rescinded.&#8221; <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn </ref>
          <del> xxx</del> assures me that no such Resolution was ever past, &amp; that it was urged by no person except Mr Yorke,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Philip Yorke (1764&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), First Lord of the Admiralty, 1810&#8211;1812, in

                        journalist John Gale Jones (1769&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>). Yorke justified the House&#8217;s actions by referring to the Bill of
                        Rights (1689), which provided that Parliament&#8217;s actions could not be impeached or questioned.</note> &#8211; almost every other

                    evinces a thorough disregard of truth. I have him upon the hip in <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">Bells</ref> quarrel, &amp;
                    shall give him such a cross buttock as he has never met with before.</p>
