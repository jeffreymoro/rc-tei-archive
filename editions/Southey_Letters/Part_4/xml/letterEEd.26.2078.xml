                    how very few of them are there whose lots in life have proved to be what might

                    Nourjahad nap of twenty years.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In

                        life, but one interspersed with prolonged periods of sleep.</note> The same
                    thing might be said of me if my local habitation were not here at the end of the
                    map. I am leading the life which is convenient for me, &amp; following the
                    pursuits to which from my earliest boyhood I was so strongly predisposed. A less
                    troubled youth would probably have led to a less happy manhood. &#8211; I should have
                    thought less, studied less, laboured less, felt less, &amp; suffered less, &#8211; now
                    for all that I have felt &amp; suffered I know that I am the better, &amp; God
                    knows that I have yet much to think, &amp; to study &amp; to do. &#8211; It is now
                    eighteen years since you &amp; I used to sit till midnight over your claret in

                    during that time we have both of us rather grown than changed, &amp; accident

                        (1739&#8211;1816; <title>DNB</title>), geologist, author of <title>A Journey
                            Through Spain in the Years 1786 and 1787; with Particular Attention to
                            the Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce, Population, Taxes, and Revenue
                            of that Country</title> (1791).</note> who was as much deceived in this
                    case as I have been was about to try the point with them, &#8211; I know not what
                    prevented it, &#8211; but <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> tells me
                    the law was likely to be against him. This is a flagrant &amp; a cruel
                    injustice, &#8211; all however that I can do is to take precautions against it in
                    future, &#8211; but it is somewhat late in the day.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> By the end of next year I hope to stand on the right side in <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> books, where I was greatly
                    behind hand. The current editions will more than balance the account. If the
                    Register continues I shall by the same time have paid off a debt contracted for
                    my brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henrys</ref>
                    education, after which it will be in my power to lay by at least 100&#163; a year. At
                    present I am worth 209&#163; &#8211; vested in the Register as a twelfth share. This is the
                    foundation stone &amp; it is something to have laid one. If I live &amp;
                    preserve my health &amp; faculties I have no doubt of realizing a decent
                    competency in the course of twenty years: but twenty years is almost as much as
                    my chance of life would be reckoned at in tables of calculation, &amp; much more
                    than it really is, for besides my hereditary title to consumption, I am not of a
                    long lived race. The Southeys of the last generation barely reached three score. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One thing which I will do whenever I can afford leisure for the
                    task, will be to write &amp; leave behind me my own memoirs.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey never wrote his memoirs.</note>
                    They will contain so much of the literary history of the times as to have a
                    permanent value on that account. This would prove a good post-obit, at least to
                    the amount of my life-insurance, for there can be no doubt that I shall be
                    sufficiently talked of whenever I am gone. &#8211; Such are my ways &amp; means for
                    the future. But if I should not live to provide more than the very little which
                    is already done, then indeed the exertions of some friends would be required. An
                    arrangement might be made with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> to allow of a subscription edition of my works, &amp; this
                    would be productive in proportion to the efforts that were used. I should hope
                    also that in such a case the continuance of my pension might be looked for from
                    either of the present parties in the state, thro <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Perceval</ref>, or <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>, or yourself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This is a sort of Testamentary letter. It is fit there should be
                    one &amp; to whom my dear Wynn could it so properly be addressed? &#8211; By Gods
                    blessing I may yet live to make <del>xx</del> all necessary provision myself. My
                    means are now at last improving every year. I am up the hill of difficulty,
                    &amp; shall very soon get rid of the burthen which has impeded me on the ascent.
                    I have some arrangements with <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>
                    which are likely to prove more productive than any former speculations, &amp;
                    which I hope to get thro in the course of the summer. And should I succeed in
                    obtaining the office which the old Frenchman<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The diplomatist and writer Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812;
                            <title>DNB</title>). He died on 23 May 1812, but Southey&#8217;s hope to
                        succeed him as Historiographer Royal was unfulfilled.</note> fills at
                    present so properly, &amp; which is the only thing for which I have the
                    slightest ambition, it would soon put me in possession of as much as I could
                    want or wish for, inasmuch as I could lay by the whole income &amp; the title
                    would be in a great degree productive.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Hitherto I have &lt;been&gt; highly-favoured, &#8211; a healthy body,
                    an active mind, &amp; a chearful heart are the three best boons which nature can
                    bestow, &amp; God be praised, no man ever enjoyed them more perfectly. My skin
                    &amp; bones scarcely know what an ailment is, my mind is ever on the alert,
                    &amp; yet when its work is done becomes as tranquil as a babes, &amp; my spirits
                    invincibly good. Would they have been so, or could I have been what I am, if you
                    had not been for so many years my stay &amp; support? I believe not. Yet you had
                    been so long my familiar friend, that I felt no more sense of dependance in
                    receiving my main (&amp; at one time sole subsistence) from you, than if you had
                    been my brother: &#8211; it was being done by, as I would have done. </p>
