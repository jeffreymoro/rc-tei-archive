                    &amp; peradventure there may be some farther drawback for the distance between London &amp; Edinburgh. In announcing this draft to
                        <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref> last night, I desired him to inform me in what manner my next might

                    my letter, farther than by a note from London, promising that he would reply to it on his return, &#8211; ten days ago. &#8211; When you can
                    conveniently get this draft cashed send me the remainder of it, which will be very acceptable. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope you were at Drury Lane when D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Busby exhibited.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The composer and journalist Thomas Busby (1754&#8211;1838; <title>DNB</title>), who in 1801 had obtained his Cambridge doctorate in
                        music for a thanksgiving ode on British naval victories. Busby was a renowned self-promoter. In 1812 he submitted an entry for
                        the competition for an address to be spoken on the opening night of the rebuilt Drury Lane theatre on 10 October. It &#8211; along
                        with about 100 other entries &#8211; was rejected and a prologue by Byron commissioned instead. Accusations of favoritism ensued.
                        Byron&#8217;s prologue was spoken on the opening night, but on the nights of 14 and 15 October Busby&#8217;s son and then Busby himself
                        caused a furore by attempting to address the Drury Lane audience on the subject of the claims of the authors of the rejected
                        verses. The high point of the proceedings was on 15 October when Busby promised &#8216;such a monologue as they had seldom heard&#8217;,
                        which his son then proceeded to recite in an inaudible voice. Busby published his address in the <title>Morning
                            Chronicle</title>, 16 October. Southey was not alone in finding him a figure of ridicule, Busby was the target of Byron&#8217;s
                        parody &#8216;Parenthetical Address, by Dr Plagiary, to be recited in an inaudible voice by his Son&#8217;, <title>Morning
                            Chronicle</title> (23 October 1812) and of the satirical print &#8216;Management-or-Butts &amp; Hogsheads&#8217; (1812).</note> Many years ago<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> 1802; see Southey to
                        Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 4 August 1802, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part 2</title>, Letter 703.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#DyerGeorge">George Dyer</ref> brought the said Busby to present him to me. a little wretch, &#8211; all but
                    blinded with small-pox. His face had always <del>xxxx water</del> more than its fair share of perspiration, &#8211; &amp; less than its
                    share of <del>cold water</del> clean water, &amp; his whole appearance was of that description, that you did not like to come near
                    him, lest you should catch a bug or aught equally loathsome of the crawling kind. The scene at the theatre <del>is</del> amused me
                    highly, as a case of frantic vanity it exceeds any I ever witnessed. And this reminds me of Coyte,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Joseph William Coyte (fl. 1780s-1810s). Southey later describe him as: &#8216;a poor engraver by name Coyte, very
                            <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;simple&gt; very industrious, very poor &amp; completely crazed with vanity because he could compose
                        off-hand upon any subject such rhymes as the Bellmans used to be, Bedford&#8217;s father used to relieve him sometimes: I saw him on
                        one of his visits to Brixton, when he was between 40 &amp; 50 years of age: &amp; his countenance &amp; manner
                            <del>would</del> &lt;might&gt; have supplied Wilkes with a subject. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedford (-there never lived a
                        kinder-hearted man) loved merriment, &amp; played him off, &#8211; in which Grosvenor &amp; Horace joined &amp; I was not backward.
                        We gave him subjects upon which he presently wrote three or four[?] miserable couplets; <del>x</del> no creature was ever more
                        elated with <del>glory</del> &lt;triumph&gt; than he was at the hyperbolic commendations which he received, &amp; this mingled
                        with the genuine humility which the sense of his condition occasioned, produced a truly comic mixture in his feelings &amp;
