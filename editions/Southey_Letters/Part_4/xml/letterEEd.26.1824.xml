        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Tho it is only once in my life that I have had the pleasure of seeing you, even that acquaintance I hope will
                    justify me in addressing you at present, upon a subject whereon your opinions &amp; wishes &amp; hopes accord with my own. I am
                    engaged to write the historical part of the Edinburgh Annual Register<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title> (1811).</note> a task which I was induced to undertake by <del>xx</del> my deep &amp;
                    ardent interest for the Spaniards, &amp; a desire of assisting, as far as was in my power, to counteract the base calumnies &amp;
                    cowardly system of the Edinburgh Review, &amp; the Opposition.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Whigs, who were doubtful
                        about supporting the Spanish opposition to the French invasion; and the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, a quarterly journal,
                        founded in 1802, which generally agreed with the Whigs.</note> For the first year of this war in the peninsula the documents
                    happened to be tolerably full, &#8211; for the second they fell short. I can obtain no other details of the second siege of
                        Zaragoza,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish city of Zaragoza had been besieged in 1808 and 1809. It fell to
                        the French on 20 February 1809 after an outbreak of disease. For Southey&#8217;s accounts of the first and second sieges,
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 306&#8211;321; and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 508&#8211;527.</note> &amp; that of Gerona<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The city of Gerona
                        had fallen to the French on 11 December 1809 after a siege of nearly seven months. For Southey&#8217;s account see <title>Edinburgh
                            Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 728&#8211;744.</note> than what the &lt;English&gt; newspapers <del>supply</del> afford. Now it has
                    occurred to me that you might perhaps assist me. Can you obtain for me, of put me in the way of obtaining, a series of Spanish
                    papers or journals, of any kind, the farther back the better,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> This appeal was the foundation
                        of Southey&#8217;s 24 volumes of Spanish <title>Gazetas</title>, 1808&#8211;1813, no. 3472 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> &#8211; &amp;
                    can you instruct me how to obtain a regular supply of them for the future? &#8211; It was stated in the Times that they had received a
                    copious diary of the siege of Gerona.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did eventually obtain a copy of Juan Andres
                        Nieto Samaniego (fl. 1810), <title>Memorial Historica de los Sucesos mas Notables de Armas y Estado de la Salud Publica
                            Durante el Ultimo Sitio de la Plaza de Gerona</title> (1810). It has not been possible to trace the report in <title>The
                            Times</title>.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It would be in the highest degree gratifying as well as useful to me, if you could procure me this document.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I would apologize for the liberty which I am taking, if on such a subject apology were needful to a man of letters &amp; a true friend of what may truly be called the good cause.  And I will not omit this opportunity of thanking you for the service which you have rendered that cause in some of the ablest &amp; most valuable communications that ever did honour to the English journals.</p>
