        <p rend="indent1"> I have just received a very gratifying letter from the author of
                    the Tour in Zeeland, whose account of the Battle of Copenhagen was of such use
                    to me in my Life of Nelson.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Andreas
                        Andersen Feldborg (1782&#8211;1838), <title>A Tour in Zealand, the Year 1802; with
                            an Historical Sketch of the Battle of Copenhagen</title> (1805), which
                        had supplied details for Southey&#8217;s <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813); see
                        Southey to Thomas Southey, 24 December 1812, Letter 2192.</note> He is about
                    to translate the Life into Danish, &amp; requests any emendations which I may
                    have made.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Feldborg&#8217;s translation
                        does not seem to have been published.</note> Will you have the goodness to
                    furnish him with a copy of the second edition,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The second edition of the <title>Life of Nelson</title>,
                        published in 1814.</note> &amp; also with the Origin &amp;c of the New
                    System, &#8211; for he is going to Denmark to introduce the &#8216;Lancasterian System,&#8217; &#8211;
                    &amp; this little book may be of service to him.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>The Origin, Nature and Object, of the
                            New System of Education</title> (1812). Given that Feldborg was an
                        advocate of Joseph Lancaster, the &#8216;service&#8217; the book might do him was,
                        perhaps, to convert him to the educational system of Andrew Bell.</note> The
                    controversial parts are of course, wholly irrelevent to his object, but what is
                    say of <ref target="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Lancasters</ref> punishments,
                    &amp; of Trial by Jury, may produce a good effect.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lancaster had argued for a system of punishments based
                        upon public humiliation of the offender, see <title>The British System of
                            Education</title> (London, 1810), pp. 34&#8211;37. These included making
                        badly-behaved pupils wear labels that described their offence, e.g. &#8216;Idle&#8217;,
                        &#8216;Suck finger Baby&#8217;. Lancaster assured his readers that these punishments had
                        been tried for 13 years with great success. Southey had attacked this
                        &#8216;abominable&#8217; regime and advocated Bell&#8217;s system of trial by jury (where
                        offending pupils were tried and sentenced by their peers) in <title>The
                            Origin, Nature and Object, of the New System of Education</title>
                        (London, 1812), pp. 190&#8211;194.</note> They should be sent to John Reeves

          <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        barrister and writer John Reeves (1752&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>). In 1792 he
                        founded the Association for Preserving Liberty and Property against
                        Republicans and Levellers. He went on to produce several pamphlets on
                        political subjects and in 1796 was acquitted of libel, for his authorship of
                            <title>Thoughts on the English Government</title> (1795), which had
                        argued that because the British government was essentially monarchical,
                        there was no need for Parliament. In 1800 Reeves was appointed the king&#8217;s
                        printer and became a treasurer of the Literary Fund.</note> 18 Duke Street,
