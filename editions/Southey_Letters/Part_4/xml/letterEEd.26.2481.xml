                    Odes into the Princely, Royal &amp; Imperial presences.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. presenting copies of
                            <title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty The Emperor of Russia, and
                            His Majesty the King of Prussia</title> (1814) to the Prince Regent; Alexander I (1777&#8211;1825; Emperor of Russia 1801&#8211;1825);
                        and Frederick William III (1770&#8211;1840; King of Prussia 1797&#8211;1840).</note> If I was a little too late on that occasion, it was
                    in great <del>xx</del> measure owing to my being too early upon another. &#8211; In full expectation of the marriage with the Prince of
                    Orange, I planned a poem somewhat in the manner of the old poets, consisting of three parts, the Proem, the Dream &amp; L&#8217;Envoy;
                    &amp; had got half thro the task in a manner much to my own satisfaction.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The engagement
                        between Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales (1796&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>), only child of the Prince Regent, and Prince
                        William of Orange (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849) that had been agreed in December 1813 had been broken off in
                        June 1814. Charlotte married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865) in 1816 and Southey turned his planned poem into a
                        public celebration of the marriage, <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816).</note> You will soon
                    receive something of more weight from the same mint: Roderick is at length fairly thro&#8217; the press, &amp; probably at this time on
                    the way from Leith to London.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> I am going to the press with the concluding volume of the history of Brazil, which includes the whole story of the
                    Jesuits in Paraguay.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819). The second volume did not appear until 1817 and the third
                        not until 1819.</note> May I request permission to send up the manuscript under cover to you; without such a privilege the
                    post is far too expensive a mode of conveyance, &amp; <del>xxxx</del> any other is precarious.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The restoration of the Jesuits is one of the most extraordinary events of this fertile age.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pius VII (1742&#8211;1823), pontiff since 1800, restored the Society of Jesus (which had been suppressed in 1773), in
                        a Bull of 7 August 1814.</note> Believing them not to have been greater imposters than all the other religious orders, much
                    more useful than any of them, &amp; most wickedly &amp; cruelly used at their downfall, I certainly think the Church of Rome has
                    done wisely in restoring them, &amp; should rejoice in the measure were I a Catholic. But on the other hand I think this
                    Government will act very unwisely if they suffer them to establish themselves in Ireland.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        A reference to the establishment of Clongowes Wood College, near Clare in Ireland. The Jesuits had never been suppressed in
                        Russia and the Papacy had recognised their organisation there in 1801, clearly indicating the Order would be restored
                        elsewhere. Inspired by this decision, the two
                        Irish Jesuits who had survived since the suppression of the Order in 1773, recruited five new members, who studied at
                        Stonyhurst School (founded 1794) and then in Palermo (1808&#8211;1811), before returning to Ireland. The land at Clongowes was
                        bought for &#163;16,000 in March 1814 and the school admitted its first pupils on 18 May 1814.</note> Are we to see a second reign
