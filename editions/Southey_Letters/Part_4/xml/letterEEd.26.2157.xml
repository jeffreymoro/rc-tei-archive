                        in Russia from William Cathcart, Earl Cathcart (1755&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>), Ambassador to Russia 1812&#8211;1820.</note> &#8211; I had
                    the Russian news last night in a note from <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey replied to Bedford on 9 October 1812, see Letter 2156.</note> You are aware that this is
                    the battle of Moskwa or Mojaisk, of which we had the French account some time ago, &amp; for which rejoicings have been made in
                        France.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The battle of Mojaisk, also known as the battle of Borodino, 7 September 1812,
                        saw massive casualties on both sides. Although it was a French tactical victory, in the longer-term Napoleon&#8217;s failure to
                        destroy the Russian army marked a turning point in his campaign in Russia.</note> Buonaparte says the battle was fought in <hi rend="ital">the rear</hi> of Mojaisk, &amp; dates from Mojaisk two days after the battle. This phrase was so ambiguous that it
                    is impossible to learn from it whether he had advanced or retreated. The truth probably is that in this murderous conflict French
                    Generalship <del>could not prevail over</del> &lt;was baffled by&gt; Russian courage, but that &lt;the&gt; Russians
                        <del>courage</del> could not take advantage of the enemys repulse, for want of equal skill. Even this is <del>matter for</del>
                    &lt;a&gt; great thing, for if the Russians continue to fight thus, their ultimate success must be certain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had not heard of the fall of Burgos, &amp; was prepared to expect a battle before it would surrender.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wellington and his allies besieged the Spanish city of Burgos from 19 September&#8211;21 October 1812,
                        but failed to capture it.</note>

                    upon Zaragoza.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I stocked myself with Ottleys<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Ottley (dates unknown), wine merchant

                    hung upon hand &amp; could not be otherwise disposed of. Take what you want without reference to me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have as little opinion of Goldsmith<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The journalist and political writer
                        Lewis Goldsmith (c. 1763/4&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>) had started a Sunday newspaper, the <title>Anti-Gallican Monitor</title>,
                        in 1811. It was possibly backed by the Bourbons (it promoted the restoration of the French monarchy) and the British
                        government.</note> as you have, but take his paper, because the very circumstances which damn his character made him
                    acquainted with many facts <del>x</del> concerning the continental courts, &amp; the proceedings between France &amp; America</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Times shall be sent every night to Miss Crosthwaites.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Peter Crosthwaite
                        (1735&#8211;1808), was a retired naval commander, publisher of maps and inventor of the aeolian harp. In the 1780s he established
                        the first museum in Keswick. Its treasures included a set of musical stones, a stuffed albatross and a pig with no legs. By
                        1811 the Museum was run by his son Daniel (c. 1776&#8211;1847), a portrait painter. Miss Crosthwaite might be his sister, Sarah
                        Crosthwaite (1771&#8211;1817).</note> I failed on Wednesday, &amp; I had nothing better than Goldsmith to send in its stead.</p>
