                    opinions, &amp; in many of these very erroneous, but of almost unparallelled ingenuity, &amp; one of the best of men. As a German
                    scholar I believe <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> to be the only person who equals him. Of course
                    he will advance no opinions dissonant from those of your Review, &amp; &lt;he&gt; is too much accustomed to see his pecularities
                    of diction altered by an Editor to complain of the exertion of this necessary prerogative. For many years he was the best writer

                    to whatever he undertakes. <ref target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref> told me that he was expecting you would send him
                    the book. Do not delay this, if it be not already done. Whatever he does for you will attract notice &amp; gain credit, &amp; it
                    will be wholesome for him to feel himself in orthodox company.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Was there ever such a succession of tidings of great joy! One thing only is wanting to crown the whole, &#8211; the death
