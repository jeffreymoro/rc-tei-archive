          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have this moment received your parcel &amp; am not a little mortified at the contents of your postscript. I wrote to <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Frere</ref> immediately upon the receipt of his letter to express my admiration of his epitaph, &amp; to thank him for it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Frere had sent an epitaph to be annexed to a future edition of Southey&#8217;s<title> Life of Nelson</title>. It was not attached to the third edition of 1825.
                        For Southey&#8217;s reply; see Southey to John Hookham Frere, 16 January 1815, Letter 2545.</note> He had given me no address, &amp; therefore I inclosed my reply to <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gifford</ref>, that he might direct it for me. On my part I have been wondering meantime at not having heard from
                        <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Frere</ref> for in this ill fated letter I told him that I had procured a copy of the <del>Poema del
                        Ferr</del> Poem of Ferran Gonzalez<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The &#8216;Poem of Fernan Gonzalez&#8217;, a 13th-century account of the life of Fernando Gonzalez, Count of
                        Castile 931&#8211;970. The poem survived in one 15th-century manuscipt in the royal archive at Escurial. A copy was sent to Southey by Manuel Abella; see Southey to John Rickman, 9
                        October 1814, Letter 2484.</note> (which I heard him in 1808 regret that he had neglected to do) &#8211; &amp; added that if he had not <del>seen</del> yet seen it, I would send my
                    copy, thro you. I am truly vexed that the miscarriage of this letter should have made me appear guilty of great rudeness in a quarter where I am truly desirous of showing the
                    respect which I feel.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Whether the letter was lost on its way to <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gifford</ref>, or after he forwarded it I know not.
                    Possibly it may have been mislaid by him &amp; forgotten &#8211; In that case an inquiry may recall it to his mind. And I should rather the old letter were recovered, &#8211; because its date
                    would show <del>how</del> with what promptness I acknowledged what I felt to be an honour.</p>
