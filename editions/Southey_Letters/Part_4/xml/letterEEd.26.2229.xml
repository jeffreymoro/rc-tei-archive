                        Cabinet, which was officially &#8216;neutral&#8217; on the issue (Castlereagh was also in favour). This was a crucial time as the Catholic
                        Relief Bill, which gave the government a veto over the appointment of Catholic bishops, in return for full Catholic rights,
                        had passed its Second Reading in the House of Commons and was being considered in committee.</note> This is not the only sign

                    suspected him from the moment I read the first letter.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 14 January 1813, Caroline of
                        Brunswick-Wolfenb&#252;ttel (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of the Prince Regent, had written to her husband
                        protesting about the restrictions placed on her access to their daughter, Princess Charlotte Augusta (1796&#8211;1817;
                            <title>DNB</title>). In early March a second letter on the same subject was sent to the Speaker of the House of Commons.
                        As it was unsigned its authorship was initially questioned, though it was later attributed to Caroline. After debate,
                        parliament agreed that it was the Regent&#8217;s right as a father and ruler to be in charge of his daughter&#8217;s education; see
                            <title>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</title>, 83 (April 1813), 361, 363&#8211;364, 373&#8211;376. The letter was widely, and correctly,
                        attributed to Brougham, the Princess&#8217;s legal adviser; see, for example, the <title>Courier</title>, whose report of 18
                        February 1813, strongly implied Brougham&#8217;s authorship.</note>
