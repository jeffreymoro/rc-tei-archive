                    that I will say come with all speed. Your place must be taken in the Carlisle &amp; Glasgow mail as far as Penrith. Now there are
                    two Carlisle mails, the one runs thro Manchester, &amp; they are rascals enough at the coach office to take travellers in,

                    delay at midnight in a miserable common room at Manchester. You must come by the Newark &amp; Doncaster road. This mail used to
                    set out from the <ref target="places.html#BullandMouth">Bull &amp; Mouth</ref>, &amp; I suppose still does. It will land you at Penrith between 11 &amp; 12 &lt;the second

                    friend. – You &amp; I differ a little about the Spanish people. National hatred has much to do in their resistance, but not more
                    than national pride. – I never doubted that the Convention of Cintra<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The 1808 Convention
                        of Cintra, under the terms of which the defeated French were allowed to evacuate their forces from Portugal.</note> ought to

                    question, the more I was confirmed. Cooperation with the Spaniards is not practicable upon a great scale, but exceedingly
                    advisable on a small one, – that is as we are doing in the North Coast by flying squadrons. A flying force might at this time cut
                    off the besieging army before Tortosa, &amp; might have relieved Hostalrich<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Catalonian
