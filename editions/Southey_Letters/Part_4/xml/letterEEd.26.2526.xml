          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your hint concerning the Register has been working in me, &amp; upon taking counsel with my Necessities I do not
                    think I could do better than resume a labour which was not laid down for want of inclination to continue it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Murray had suggested that he might take over the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> and
                        that Southey might like to resume writing for this publication; see Southey to John Murray, 4 December 1814 (Letter 2510) and
                        12 December 1814 (Letter 2515).</note> It is for you to determine whether you would continue the former work, (in which case
                    there has been a year lost) or start under a new title &amp; begin not with the beginning of the year 1814 but from the
                        Peace,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Treaty of Paris, signed 30 May 1814, which ended the war between France and
                        the Sixth Coalition.</note> as from a new &amp; precise era.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the latter case it would be well to rid the work of all that superfluous matter with which Registers are
                    clogged, &amp; which were literally tacked on to the historical part at first in order to make the book of sufficient bulk. In my
                    judgement there should be nothing but the history, the state papers &amp; the public accounts.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should prefer beginning with the peace for this reason, that it would give room for a good foundation, &amp; a
                    comprehensive view of the state of the World. It is a sort of leisure year in which the Annalist has time for bringing up his
                    accounts. For instance the Wahabees,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Saud dynasty from Nejd, with the support of the
                        Wahhabi religious movement within Islam, had captured Mecca from the Ottoman Empire in 1802, only to be driven out in 1812 by
                        an Egyptian army.</note> Persia,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Persia had been defeated by Russia in the
                        Russo-Persian War of 1804&#8211;1813 and in the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) had to accept Russian control of most of the
                        Caucasus.</note> the S Sea Islands,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Pacific islands. Southey had a long-standing
                        interest in missionary work in this area.</note> B Bay,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Botany Bay, i.e. the British
                        colony of New South Wales in Australia, which had been expanding rapidly since the First Fleet arrived in 1788. Southey was
                        particularly interested in explorations into the interior of Australia (the Blue Mountains were first officially crossed in
                        1813) and missionary work in the colony.</note> Abyssinia (on occasion of Salts Embassy<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> In March 1809 the traveller and collector of antiquities Henry Salt (1780&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>) had been sent by the
                        British government to Abyssinia. His mission was to take gifts to the Egwala Sion, Emperor of Abyssinia 1801&#8211;1818, and report
                        on the condition of the country. He returned to England in 1811 and in 1814 published an account of his travels, <title>A
                            Voyage to Abyssinia</title>.</note>) might each have a chapter afforded to them. A good name for the work might be The
                    Annual History. By taking this excursive view, the volume may be made much more entertaining than that of a busier year, &#8211;
                    therefore the better to begin with. There are many other topics, &#8211; this paper indeed would soon be filled if I were to touch upon
                    them. But I have said enough for you to perceive what I would aim at</p>
