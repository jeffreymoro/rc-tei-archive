        <p rend="indent1"> I had no opportunity when last we met to tell you what has past concerning the Q Review.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was unhappy with changes made by Croker to his review of Eustache-Auguste Carel (1788&#8211;1836),

                        indication of the changes; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 17 November 1815 (Letter 2670) and Southey to John
                        Murray, [22 November 1815], Letter 2671.</note> In consequence of my letter to <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> which you saw,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The letter appears not to have survived.</note> I found
                    that the interpolations came from no less <del>than</del> a personage than the <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke</ref> himself, who thought proper thro <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> to <del>xxx</del> make me his tool.
                    I spoke as became me upon the occasion, &#8211; insisted upon stopping the press, carried my point, struck out the falsehoods which had
                    been inserted, &amp; replaced what had been struck out. Upon seeing the former part of the article (the proofs of which had not
                    been sent me) I find a passage interpolated about the Convention of Cintra<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Under the terms
                        of the Convention of Cintra (30 August 1808) the defeated French were allowed to evacuate their troops from Portugal.</note>
                    which is contrary to my own expressed opinion.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey objected that a section praising
                        Wellington&#8217;s reaction to the Convention as &#8216;a presage of [his] &#8230; extraordinary military foresight&#8217; had been interpolated;
                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (July 1815), 476.</note> This I shall resent &amp; insist upon it that nothing
                    hereafter be inserted in any paper of mine without my consent, &#8211; otherwise I will withdraw from the work. &#8211; I had an interview at
                    the Admiralty<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. Southey had visited Croker at his office at the Admiralty.</note> after
                    this business, &amp; it was curious to observe how carefully the subject was avoided &amp; yet what concessions were made &amp;
                    civilities shown in reference to it.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I was much pleased with Mina, &amp; shall get from him a sketch of his own history.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Either Francisco Javier de Mina (1789&#8211;1817), guerrilla leader in Navarre 1808&#8211;1810; or his uncle, General
                        Espoz de Mina (1781&#8211;1836). Both had fled Spain after a failed rising in Pamplona on 25&#8211;26 September 1814.</note> With <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> also I am likely to have much correspondence. He has been a very ill used
                        man,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Frere had been Minister Plenipotentiary to the Central Junta in 1808&#8211;1809 and
                        advised Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>) to advance on Madrid, or, if necessary, to retreat through Galicia
                        rather than Portugal&#8211; advice that led to the disastrous retreat to Corunna. Southey had defended Frere in the <title>Edinburgh
                            Annual Register for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 86&#8211;108.</note> &amp; is perfectly aware that I am likely to prove his best
                    friend &#8211; Of course he is able to give me much information. &#8211; but I was much gratified by finding that on most points the opinion
                    which I had previously formed was strengthened &amp; confirmed by what he communicated.</p>
