                    do some good, but I see two things which prevent any sanguine <del>xx</del>
                    hopes on my part, &#8211; first that these great personages may be like other great
                    personages very little accustomed to consider of what it &lt;is&gt; right to do
                    with their patronage, &#8211; &amp; secondly that <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B.s</ref> heart &amp; head are both so full of
                    one thing &#8211; that they have very little room for any thing else. He will see the
                    thing in its proper light, &amp; will wish to promote our wishes, &#8211; but there is
                    a great chance of his forgetting it. However I will jog his memory from time to
                    time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will try two pair of these iron shoes, &#8211; stout mountaineering
                    shoes. For thinner shoes, &#8211; i-e &#8211; afternoon ones, it cannot be worth while to
                    have the nail-fashion, for the sole always out last the leathers in shoes of
                    house-wear.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had a visit from Lord Somerville<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s third cousin the agriculturist John Southey,

                    symptomatic that my reputation is rising in the world, &#8211; or he would never have
                    volunteered this mark of civility to me after his vile manoeuvres to injure me

        <p rend="indent1"> You &amp; I agree about the prospect in Russia, &amp; I have the
                    more confidence in my own opinion, because my apprehensions about Lord

                        up the post of Ambassador to the Russian court in July 1812. He was actively
                        involved in Russian attempts to resist Bonaparte and sent regular dispatches
                        to the British government. Southey is probably referring to his account of
