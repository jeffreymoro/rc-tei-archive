                        fifteenth book of <title>Roderick</title>, it was probably the &#8216;more&#8217; that was promised for 22 March 1814.</p>

          <l rend="indent3"> And heard its earliest sounds; &amp; when the Prince</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> With pensive face upon Pionias side</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Wandering alone &amp; slow. For he had left</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The wearying place of his unrest, that morn</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With its cold dews might bathe his throbbing brow</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> To ask, ere on the lap of earth in peace</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> He lay his head resignd. In silent prayer</l>
