        <p rend="indent1"> In talking with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Downman<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Downman (1750&#8211;1824;
                        <title>DNB</title>), who in autumn 1812 was painting two portraits of
                        Southey (one commissioned by Murray) and one of Edith.</note> concerning his
                    intended work,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Downman had suggested
                        a series of portraits of prominent figures in the English Reformation. This
                        project did not come about; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford,
                        29 September 1812, Letter 2152.</note> I suggested to him, as an easy means
                    of giving additional interest to it, that the name of every person should be
                    given under his portrait in a fac-simile of his signature, &#8211; where it was
                    possible to procure it, which in most cases it must be. It occurred to me also,
                    that instead of accompanying the portraits with a page of biographical notices,
                    a series of Inscriptions might be written for them. The thought has warmed me,
                    &amp; if I do not deceive myself, I could execute it much to my own
                    satisfaction. This form of poem is from its style peculiarly adapted for
                    conveying precepts, <del>&amp;</del> &lt;which&gt; from its brevity, are likely
                    to be impressed upon the memory. &#8211; You need not be told what fine subjects these
                    men would afford.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had almost made a vow never again to sit under an artists
                    hands. I am glad that the vow was not made. There was some thing so good natured
                    both about M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Downman &amp; his daughter,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Isabella-Chloe Downman (d. 1840).</note>
                    that it would have been very unpleasant to me to have put a denial upon any
                    thing which they seemed to wish, &amp; he has produced a likeness, which in the
                    opinion of all who have seen it, is very very far superior to any that has ever
                    yet been taken of me. We are so much pleased with it that I am under his hands
                    for another, &#8211; &amp; I am exceedingly obliged to him for presenting me with
                        <del>the</del> &lt;an&gt; appropriate companion to it, in the portrait of
