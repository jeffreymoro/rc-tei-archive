            <title>The Origin, Nature and Object, of the New System of Education</title> (1812).</note> which I think will convince you
                    that <ref target="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Lancaster</ref> is a vulgar-minded plagiarist, and a liar of the foulest kind. The
                    good which he has done is very great, but it is pretty much in the way that the devil has been the cause of Redemption.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. by provoking the Church of England into setting up the National Society for Promoting the
                        Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church in 1811.</note> His cause was taken up by the insidious
                    enemies of the Church; the beauty of the principle which he had stolen was so manifest, and its power so great, in spite of all
                    that he has done to adulterate and disguise it, that it enables them to attach a very general interest to the subject; and the
                    manner in which this was made an engine against the Church has at last frightened the clergy into doing their duty, which I verily
                    believe no other means would have effected. The Bishop of Durham<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Shute Barrington
                        (1734&#8211;1826; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Durham since 1791. He was a vigorous supporter of practical philanthropy and had
                        promoted both the inter-demoninational Religious Tract Society (founded 1799) and the British and Foreign Bible Society
                        (founded 1804).</note> is a noble exception to the abominable indifference which they displayed for more than ten years. As
                    for <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">Dr. Bell</ref>, he has been, and is, as much an enthusiast in this pursuit, as <ref target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</ref> has been respecting the slave trade, and is to me, who know both the men,
                    not less an object of respect and reverence. Herbert Marsh&#8217;s sermon very ably and clearly shows in what manner the new system upon
                    the Lancastrian scheme must needs operate to undermine the Church Establishment.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Herbert
                        Marsh (1757&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>), cleric and biblical critic. He had preached a sermon at St Paul&#8217;s on 13 June 1811 that
                        was critical of the interdenominational British and Foreign Bible Society (founded 1804) and urged that Anglicans should found
                        their own Bible society. Southey had read the pamphlet form of the sermon, <title>The National Religion the Foundation of
                            National Education: A Sermon Preached in the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, London</title> (1811).</note> It is, in
                    reality, a self-evident absurdity to affirm that it is not the duty of the State to see that national education be conducted upon
                    the principle of the national religion. Do not misunderstand me; my meaning is, that in parochial schools, which I want to see
                    established at the public expense over all England, the Church Catechism ought to be taught, and no substitute for it; because
                    this is known and approved, and what may be substituted we know not, and we do know that <hi rend="ital">nothing</hi> can be
                    devised more conformable to the doctrines of the Church of England. This would exclude none of the orthodox dissenters, except the
                    Baptists; and those whom it would exclude may have schools of their own. The dissenters who are not orthodox (Quakers, Arians, and
                    Socinians) have no poor to stand in need of gratuitous education. Neither have the Baptists many. But if for these few it be
                    thought right and liberal to abstain from making any portion of the established creed a part of primary education, it must of
                    necessity be much more so to exclude Christianity altogether. It then makes room for the Jews, who have many poor. To say that
                    religious instruction may be left to the parents is absurd; the poor have not the leisure for this, even if they had the requisite
                    knowledge and ability. Neither ought it to be left to the clergyman: he has duties enough without it. But if it be made a part of
                    education, it is impossible not to draw the line of exclusion somewhere.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The final section
                        of this paragraph paraphrases arguments in <title>The Origin, Nature and Object, of the New System of Education</title>
                        (London, 1812), which advocated that the &#8216;school and church establishments ought &#8230; to be intimately connected&#8217; (p. 197) and
                        that the pupils at these new national schools &#8216;should be allowed to accompany the master to church&#8217; (p. 118). Even Bell felt
                        that Southey had gone too far and in a letter of 10 March 1812 cautioned against compulsion in this matter (&#8216;we should draw the
                        children to church by cords of love, and not drag them by chains of iron&#8217;), see Southey, Caroline Southey and Charles Cuthbert

                    but even the scurrility of such an opponent as this will not prevent the controversy from doing mischief. God bless you.</p>
