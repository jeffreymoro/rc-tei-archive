                    that I would appoint some person in Bristol to sign a receipt for a payment which had to make me as Executor to our dear <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref>. In my reply<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> This does not appear to

            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> &#8211; that if you have not I may repeat my direction to the

                    the second is ready. &#8211; I still hesitate what to write next, not for want of a subject, but from not making up my mind which
                    subject (of many before me) to prefer, &amp; in what metre to clothe it. The New-England story<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Oliver Newman&#8217;, left incomplete at his death. A fragment was published posthumously in 1845 by Southey&#8217;s

                        Southey wanted to experiment again with the metre used in <title>Thalaba, the Destroyer</title> (1801). His plan was to use it
                        in a romance on Robin Hood, a project which eventually turned into a collaboration with Caroline Bowles. It was left
                        unfinished at Southey&#8217;s death, and a fragment published posthumously in 1847.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> A curious manuscript has been sent for my inspection by the booksellers. The travels of Eulia Effendi a Turk of
                    some consequence who in the middle of the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century went over the whole of the Ottoman Empire, &amp; great
                    part of Persia. A German at Vienna has translated it into English, &#8211; England I suppose being the only market.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Evliya &#199;elebi (1611&#8211;1682) whose <title>Seyahatname</title> described his travels through the
                        Ottoman empire. An English version of part of this was published as <title>Narrative of Travels in Europe, Asia and
                            Africa</title> (1834) by the Austrian orientalist Ritter Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774&#8211;1856). He had published a
                        German version in 1814 and was probably the author of the MS sent to Southey.</note> It extends to four volumes (the
                    translation) of about 280 folio pages each, &amp; he asks for it 500&#163;, which tho not more than his labours deserve &#8211; is I
                    apprehend more than can be given for them. For tho the work is exceedingly curious, it is not likely to bear the expence of
                    publication in the ordinary form. The old Turk, for he was between 80 &amp; 90 years of age when he finished his work, is very
                    orthodox, very inquisitive, indefatigable in his enquiries, &amp; as credulous as need be, but by no means wanting in sagacity: &#8211;
                    a very extraordinary Turk. He gives a compleat view of the system &amp; strength of the Ottoman Empire at that time, &amp; much of
                    its history, the author having been attached to one of the Grand Viziers &#8211; &amp; borne a part in many of the great transactions of
                    his day. I have only seen the last two volumes, the first two not having reached England. &#8211; It is a mournful thing that England is
                    the only country where there is a chance of encouragement for literary labours of this kind. &#8211; God knows there is little enough of

                    travelling as a <hi rend="ital">qualified</hi> Mussleman in Africa &amp; made his pilgrimage to Mecca, &amp; attained to the
                    honour of sweeping the Caaba (the highest which can be conferred upon a pilgrim) &#8211; is printing his travels in London. He brings
                    intelligence (not from his own knowledge) of a mediterranean in Africa, or more properly a huge fresh water lake, into which I
                    suppose the Niger runs, &amp; from which <del>probably</del> perhaps the larger &amp; remoter branch of the Nile proceeds.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    in the structure &lt;of the stanza&gt; for of this a foreigner may be able to judge upon principles which must be common to every
                    modern European language. And he has not imitated the thread bare incidents of Homer, Virgil &amp; Tasso.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Torquato Tasso (1544&#8211;1595), Italian poet and author of <title>La Gerusalemme Liberata</title> (1580).</note>
