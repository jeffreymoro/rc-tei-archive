        <p rend="indent1"> It is certainly a serious matter when a mans neck is in danger. I hope however that the tumour in mine may be
                    satisfactorily accounted for: upon thinking the case over &amp; over it flashed upon me that it might be a mere enlargement of the
                    muscle produced by position, sitting as you know I do almost continually at my desk <del>xx</del> &amp; (which perhaps you may not
                    know) with my head habitually inclining toward the left shoulder, so as to <del>produce</del> extend that very muscle. (You know
                    how one of my fingers has been deformed by the pressure of the pen.) Upon communicating this to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Docstor</ref>
          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Henry
                        Herbert Southey, 2 June 1815, Letter 2609.</note> &amp; <ref target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref> they both agreed
                    that it was the most probable solution, &amp; when I went again to <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> &amp; let
                    him compare the theory with the fact, he was satisfied also that I had fallen upon the true cause, &amp; that the thing would give
                    us no trouble. Aneurism it certainly is not, &amp; tho I will not say that I am perfectly sure it may be nothing else (tho I know
                    what it can be) it does appear to me most probable that the only thing to be done is to let out my short collars; &amp; think no
                    more of what is merely a slight deformity in a place where nobody sees it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Now to the thing <del>most x</del> nearest to the body natural, &amp; next in importance, to wit the covering
                    thereof. Whenever you can rob the Exchequer for me will you make a visit to the egregious Hyde, the Imperator Sartorum,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The &#8216;sartorial emperor&#8217; Hyde (d. 1820), was Southey&#8217;s London tailor.</note> &amp; pay him
                    for a suit of clothes to which I stand debtor in his book, &amp; tell him to send me a coat forthwith, &#8211; a <hi rend="ital">coloured</hi> one, of what colour I leave to be decided between him &amp; you, premising only that if in the opinion of two
                    such connoisseurs it be thought I can carry off a drab I should prefer something in the drab line.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford preferred the coloured; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, [20 July 1815], Letter
                    2637.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our bells are ringing as they ought to do, &amp; I after a burst of exhilaration at the days news am in a state of
                    serious &amp; thoughtful thankfulness, for what perhaps ought to be considered as the greatest deliverance that civilized society
                    has experienced since the defeat of the Moors by Charles Martel.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The celebrations were for
                        the victory at Waterloo (18 June 1815), which Southey compares with the defeat of the Moors by Charles Martel (c. 688&#8211;741) at
                        the battle of Tours (10 October 732). Martel&#8217;s victory was widely believed to have saved Christian Europe.</note> I never
                    feared or doubted the result; but if we had been thus thoroughly defeated in the first battle, the consequences would have been
                    too fatal to think of with composure. <del>&amp;</del> Perhaps enough has been done to excite a revolt in Paris. But I have a
                    strong impression either upon my imagination or my judgement that that city will suffer some part of its deserved chastisement. &#8211;
                    The cannon should be sent home &amp; formed into a pillar to support a statue of <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellington</ref> in the centre of the largest square in London.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 29 June 1815, the House of Commons approved an address for a monument to commemorate the
                        victory at Waterloo, and the British troops who fell there.</note>
