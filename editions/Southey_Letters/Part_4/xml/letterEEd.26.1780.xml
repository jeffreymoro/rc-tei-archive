        <p rend="indent1"> You will wonder at the long interval between the half notes.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. half-banknotes &#8211; a secure way of
                        sending money in the post, by tearing banknotes in half and sending the two
                        halves separately; see Southey to Charles Danvers, 2 May 1810, Letter
                        1774.</note> The truth is that tho they went with me to Durham, they came
                    back with me also, &#8211; for dissipation allowed me less leisure than I always
                    possess amid my own regular employments. I had to see this place &amp; that
                    place, &#8211; people called on me &amp; I was to call on them in return, visiting
                    eating &amp; drinking took up no small portion of my time, &amp; what little
                    time was not thus taken up was given to some books from the Cathedral libraries.
                    We were absent from home nineteen days, two of which were past with <ref target="people.html#LoshJames">Losh</ref>. He desired to be remembered to
                    you, &amp; requested me to say how glad he should be if when you came into the
                    North you could make his house in your way. Now that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Sir Domine</ref>
                    is at Durham you may perhaps one day accomplish this, especially as Durham is I
                    think more worth seeing than any other place in England. Indeed I never saw any
                    thing equal to it, &amp; the more I saw the more it delighted me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> went with us, meaning to return
                    here, &#8211; he has however fallen over head &amp; ears in love, &amp; remains at
                    Durham. From all his goings on there, &amp; his staying behind it seems as if he
                    were very much in earnest, notwithstanding the mortal objection of want of
                    fortune on both side. The <ref target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Lady</ref> is about 30, singularly interesting, &amp; <del>with
                        xx</del> very much respected for her excellent conduct during many family
                    difficulties. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> was so incessantly
                    at the house that it is not possible his attentions could have been overlooked,
                    &amp; hardly possible that he could have been there so much unless they had been
                    encouraged, &#8211; which considering worldly circumstances is sufficiently strange. I
                    suppose he will write to me ere long &amp; explain his views. She was engaged to
                    a young man who died, &amp; his family then settled 100&#163; a year upon her, as a
                    mark of their respect. This &lt;annuity&gt; I should suppose would cease if she
                    married. As to prudential calculations however <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> is <del>xxxx</del> able to make
                    them for himself, &amp; as I believe he might search the world round without
                    making a better choice, I shall be more disposed to excuse him if he acts
                    imprudently, than to volunteer advice which when it is unwelcome is generally
                    unavailing.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Thus far last night. To days post has brought me a letter from
