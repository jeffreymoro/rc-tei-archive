        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for your letter, &amp; in consequence of it immediately transcribed the Carmen &amp; sent it to <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Croker</ref>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Rickman had cautioned
                        Southey about the content and tone of his first Laureate poem, &#8216;Carmen Annuum&#8217;, see Orlo Williams, <title>Lamb&#8217;s Friend the
                            Census-Taker. Life and Letters of John Rickman</title> (Boston and New York, 1912), pp. 173&#8211;174. In order to gauge the
                        establishment&#8217;s response, Southey had then sent a copy to Croker on 15 December 1813 (Letter 2349). Croker was not impressed.
                        He and Rickman were particularly concerned about five stanzas. Southey bowed to pressure and deleted them from the
                        version published as <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the deleted stanzas
                        into an &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte&#8217;, published in the <title>Courier</title>, 3 February 1814.</note>
                    It had never occurred to me that any thing like an official character could be attached to it, or that any other reserve was
                    necessary than that of not saying any thing which might be offensive to the Government, &#8211; e &#8211;g in 1809 the P.L. would
                        <del>not</del> be expected &lt;not&gt; to write in praise of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Clarke, &amp; the resignation of the D of
                        York.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763&#8211;1827;
                            <title>DNB</title>) had been forced to resign as commander-in-chief of the British army in the wake of allegations that he
                        had profited from office trafficking. After a lengthy investigation, the charges were found to be unproven. However, it became
                        apparent that his former mistress Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>) had received money from individuals keen
                        for her to use her influence with the Duke, and that the Duke himself had known of her actions. For Southey&#8217;s account of the
                        scandal, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 109&#8211;301.</note> I dare say you are right, &amp; am
                    prepared to expect a letter from <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C.</ref> advising the suppression of any
                    thing discourteous towards Buonaparte. In that case I shall perhaps add something to the other part of the poem respecting Hanover
                    &amp; Holland, &amp; send the maledictory stanzas<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. the five stanzas of &#8216;Carmen

                        Buonaparte, in January 1814&#8217;.</note> to the Courier without a name. By the bye if the Government did not feel as I do the
                    Courier would not hoist Bourbon colours as it has lately done.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have profited by your remarks in many instances. &#8211; The lines took their name from Torres Vedras,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the final version of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814), stanza 6, line 65, Southey
                        referred to &#8216;those old Towers&#8217;. This is an English translation of &#8216;Torres Vedras&#8217;, the name of the line of forts built near
                        the town of Torres Vedras, with the aim of defending Portugal against the French.</note> &amp; that name happens to answer

                    alike in sound &amp; import <del>that</del> will confound them. In reality the one is only a metaphorical application of the
                    other. I have altered the passage, &amp; improved it by the alteration. I have got rid also of the <del>doubling</del> repetition
                    of base &amp; abase, point &amp; points, which had escaped me, owing to the piecemeal manner in which the stanzas were made &amp;
                        mended.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The paragraph deals with more of Southey&#8217;s alterations to the sixth
