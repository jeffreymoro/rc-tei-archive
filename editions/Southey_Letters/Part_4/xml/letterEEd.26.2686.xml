        <p rend="indent1"> For the last week I have been shut up in the house by snow, &#8211; no evil for one like myself who am as little addicted
                    to dispensible exercise as tho I were a Turk. Meantime I have been making good progress in prose &amp; in rhyme.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was exceedingly pleased to find that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> had gone on during my
                    absence, with his German testament<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A German translation of the New Testament.</note> as
                    regularly &amp; well as possible. The great difficulty in this language seems to be the vocabulary, as in the Dutch, &#8211; &amp; as
                    yet I do not find that the one affords much assistance in the other. I have subscribed to the Saxon Chronicle, &amp; do not think
                    myself too old for studying my mother tongue in its oldest form, when it shall arrive; for which purpose I shall read it with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>, who bids fair, if he lives, to have more knowledge than his father, &amp;
                    to be as well disposed to make use of it.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> A copy of the &#8216;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&#8217; so that
                        Southey and Herbert could study Old English. In 1815 &#8216;A new edition of the Saxon Chronicle, with an English translation and
                        notes&#8217;, edited by James Ingram (1774&#8211;1850; <title>DNB</title>), Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford 1803&#8211;1808, was
                        advertised as &#8216;In the press&#8217;, <title>The Tradesman</title>, 14 (January 1815), 55. However, it did not appear until 1823.
                        Southey had two copies, nos 2593 and 2594 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Part of my foreign purchases have reached London, &amp; I am told the Acta Sanctorum<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey acquired an abridged 6 volume series (1783&#8211;1794), no. 152 in the sale catalogue of his library; not as
                        he hoped a complete 53 volume set (1643&#8211;1794), no. 207 in the sale catalogue of his library (he bought the latter in
                        1818).</note> among them. The result of my memorial<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s memorial protesting
                        about the import duty on books, see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 8 December 1815, Letter 2678.</note> I do not know,
                    &#8211; but enormous as the duty is (it is scandalous that such a duty should exist) I would rather pay it threefold than be without
                    this invaluable collection. It would be a worthy task (were there any chance of its answering in sale) to do what was begun in
