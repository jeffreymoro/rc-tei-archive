          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> I could give a much nearer guess at the intrinsic worth of a manuscript of Locke&#8217;s<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The philosopher John Locke (1632&#8211;1704; <title>DNB</title>). The manuscript is unidentified.</note> than at its
                    marketable value. What that may be is extremely doubtful, &#8211; more, probably, for a philosophical work than a political one, &#8211; more
                    for a religious one than either. There are two ways of proceeding in such a business, &#8211; either to publish it by subscription, or
                    to offer it to the booksellers. If the owner has some active friends who would bestir themselves in good earnest to collect names
                    for him, the former would be the best plan, because should the book prove of any permanent value, the property remains with him.
                    But unless a couple of thousand subscribers could be procured, (which would require the exertions of several zealous friends) the
                    latter plan is preferable, for I think the booksellers would be likely to give as much as could be gained by an edition of 1500
                    copies. Suppose you were to put the MSS. in your pocket, &amp; call upon <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> with
                    it, &#8211; he knows something of these things &amp; will shew it to the booksellers. Were I upon the spot I would gladly do this. Or if
                    you think proper to see them yourself, <del>no intro</del> tho no introduction can be necessary upon a matter of business, my name
                    if you like to make use of it, will serve as one both at <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> house, &amp; at
                        <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref>. There is a publisher who would perhaps bid higher for it than either, &#8211;
                    <ref target="people.html#PhillipsRichard">Sir Richard Phillips</ref>; &#8211; he would sell half an edition by mere dint of puffing. But if your
                    friend thinks proper to go to him, &#8211; let him remember that he is dealing with one of the most accomplished rogues in his majestys
                    dominions. &#8211; Whatever is done I should recommend that a slip of paper simply stating that such a work is in existence should be
                    left at Sir Richards for announcement in the Monthly Magazine. This will cost only the trouble of writing the memorandum, &#8211; the
                    notice will be widely diffused, &amp; copied in other journals, &amp; the expectation raised will benefit the sale of the work,
                    &amp; perhaps (very probably indeed) produce an overture from Sir Richard; &#8211; now the knowledge of what he would give for it would
                    be of advantage <del>wh</del> if it were thought better to offer it to other publishers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We have had a very variable winter, with severe &amp; frequent storms, but on the whole, mild weather. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> White<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> William White (d. 1811), a wealthy man who had retired to
                        Keswick. His mistress&#8217;s identity is unknown.</note> is dead &amp; has left his mistress 20,000 &#163; in the funds, she is also his
                    residuary legatee <del>&amp; is</del> which will very considerably increase the bequest. I could have wished that she would have
                    gone some where else to enjoy this fortune, but she is in treaty for this new house next door to us, &amp; I very much fear we
                    shall have her for a neighbour, &#8211; a circumstance exceedingly unpleasant.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Times of this post contains a most imprudent proclamation from Rio de Janeiro imposing restrictions upon the
                    Lisbon Press:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> See <title>The Times</title> (12 February 1812). The edict (5 October 1811)
                        forbad the licensing by the Lisbon censors of works which insulted the monarch and royal family; attacked Christianity; and
                        commented positively or negatively on the Spanish Cortes.</note> Jupiter seems determined to destroy the Braganzas,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ruling house of Portugal and its colonies since 1640.</note> &#8211; &amp; this madness with which
                    he has long visited the family is beyond the reach either of experience or hellebore. I am grieved at it, because the obstinate
                    system which his ministers pursue cannot be violently over thrown without great evil, &amp; it would be easier effectually to
                    reform it, than to bring about the least of the reforms which are perpetually agitated in England. The Portugueze have an
                    excellent Government, which is suspended but has never been changed by any law<del>s</del>; &#8211; as good a Government as can well be
                    imagined; little inferior to our own in theory, &amp; for all foreign concerns better in practise.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Medieval Portugal had developed a representative Cortes, but it had not met since 1698 and Portuguese monarchs
