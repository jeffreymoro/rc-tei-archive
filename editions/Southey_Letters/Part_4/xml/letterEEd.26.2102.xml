        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter has relieved us this evening from a most anxious
                    expectation. to say that it has increased my vexation would not be true, for
                    nothing could add to that. It is beyond measure vexatious to think that this
                    White-widow as poor Jopy Nicolson<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Jopy Nicolson; a Keswick resident.</note> calls her in Cumbrian-English,
                    should have taken up her abode on the hill here just at this time!<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Mary Barker&#8217;s plans to move into Greta
                        Lodge were frustrated by the former mistress and heiress of William White of
                        Keswick (d. 1811).</note> &#8212; I thought of poor <ref target="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">Bunbury&#8217;s</ref> house, but it seems <ref target="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">Col. Bunbury</ref> is coming to it himself. It is not likely however that
                    he will think of making it his residence, even if he withdraws from public life.
                    &#8212; There is General Peches great house,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Major-General John Pech&#233; (d. 1823), of the East India Company
                        Army.</note> &#8212; but that is far too large, even if the old part were let off,
                    which it might be, being sufficiently separate: &amp; they ask a heavy rent for
                    it &#8212; 70&#163;. I think, &#8212; this will never be given for it, but still it will hardly
                    be lowered to any reasonable price, even if the house were in other respects
                    more desirable. As for <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs
                        Coleridges</ref> part,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e., the
                        other half of Greta Hall.</note> it is wholly occupied every summer, except
                    the two upper rooms. You must come down to us as soon as you can, &amp; look
                    about at leisure. White-Widow has a three years lease, &amp; is laying out money
                    as if she meant to make it her permanent abode. But she goes to London in the
                    winter, &amp; her money is likely enough to get her taken out of our way, in the
                    way of honest matrimony. Besides the backguard boys call her Neddy in the
                    street, &amp; perhaps this may dispose her to think of moving. There is this
                    chance; &#8212; there is the probability of <ref target="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">Col. Bunbury&#8217;s</ref>, something
                    else may turn up &amp; you must come &amp; wait for the chance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But alas for the furniture! He who demonstrated that the world
                    might be compressed into a nut-shell<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Possibly an adaptation of <title>Hamlet</title>, Act II, scene 2, line
                        263.</note> would have been puzzled to find room here for your furniture.
                    When you come you will see how full we are. All that is not of immediate use had
                    better be packed up &amp; stowed away at <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Teddesley</ref> till a place is found for it here. What you want may come
                    by canal as far as Burton, &#8212; eleven miles short of Kendal.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8212; Your letter has justified my fears. I can perfectly enter into
                    your feelings, &#8212; but am not the less sorry that they should have this
                    gratification. I always apprehended that when <ref target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir E</ref>. made
                    his will he would forget that money is not of the same value now that it was
                    forty years ago.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> In Sir Edward
                        Littleton&#8217;s will Mary Barker was bequeathed &#163;500, an annuity of &#163;200 and all
                        the gifts and furniture that Sir Edward had bought for her use.</note> In
                    the disposal of his property he seem to have acted with the most perfect
                    propriety: perhaps it would have been better not to have had this disposition
