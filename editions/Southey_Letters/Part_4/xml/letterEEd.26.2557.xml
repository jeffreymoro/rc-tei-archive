                    every thing which is not downright eulogium. The quantity of extract is not more than would be allowed, but it must be better if
                        <del>one</del> there were one specimen given at greater length, that the general character of the verse might be felt, which
                    it cannot be in the short fragments. I do not think <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> will reject it, nor do
                    I see why he should, so <del>imagine</del> &lt;believe&gt; that he <del>will</del> has any person among all his merry men who
                    would write a better.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Grosvenor Bedford had been commissioned, at Southey’s suggestion, to
                        review <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814) for the <title>Quarterly</title>. His article eventually appeared
                        in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (April 1815), 83–113. However, it contained, as this letter demonstrates, many
                        emendations and suggestions by Southey himself.</note> The preliminary matter may be shortened, – &amp; above all it will be
                    deemed indispensable that every thing <del>xxx</del> which implies that the Critic does not know better than the Poet should be
                    struck out. I should like you to <del>put in one</del> throw in some mention of the Congratulatory Odes, which are in my judgement
                    among the best of my minor poems, – &amp; you know the state of their sale.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty The Emperor of Russia, and His
                            Majesty the King of Prussia</title> (1814). Southey had hoped they would go into a second edition, but poor sales
                        prevented this.</note> Just <del>xx</del> allude to them, &amp; marry them to <del>some</del> such epithet as you may think
                    they deserve. Perhaps you may find a place in Book 18 where you &lt;say&gt; after the coronation that the Poet appears
                        <del>himself</del> in his own person: this part of the poem<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 18, lines 274–352.</note> is instead of the <del>xxx</del>
                    hackneyed mode of prophecy, vision &amp;c – it was necessary to give the reader a view of the termination of the struggle with the
                    Moors, &amp; it is effected here by passing from the narrative to a lyric strain. You may censure me, &amp; perhaps with justice,
                    for not having inserted any other direct allusion to the late war, than the curious mention of Zaragoza<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 18, lines 313–315.</note> in this place: &amp; this might serve to
                    bring in the Odes.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> As published, this section of Bedford’s article read: ‘we cannot but
                        express our surprise, and in some measure our disappointment, that Mr. Southey has made no allusion to the late war in the
                        peninsula, except a very slight and cursory mention of Zaragoza’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (April 1815), 103.
                        However, the <title>Congratulatory Odes</title> were not given a much-needed puff.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I have received to night as much of the mss of Roderick as the rascally coach-office people think worth five
                    shillings. You shall have it in the frank potential. What have you done with my copy?</p><p rend="indent1"> I do not know who has continued the E A Register,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Edinburgh
                            Annual Register</title>, for which Southey had ceased work at the end of 1813. A new edition, <title>Edinburgh Annual
                            Register, for 1812</title> (1814), had appeared. The historical section was taken over by the Scottish lawyer and writer,
                        James Russell (1790–1861; <title>DNB</title>).</note> nor have I seen the volume.</p><p rend="indent1"> My battery upon <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Gog</ref> may best be opened in the newspapers for many
                    reasons. First because no review would allow me that latitude of language which I mean to take. secondly because the form of
                    letters to <del>the</del><ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis"> Gog</ref> himself will be the best, &amp; thirdly because <del>they</del> &lt;it&gt;
                    will be read more surely, more immediately, &amp; far more extensively than in any other form. They will also be administered dose
                    after dose to the greater comfort of the said <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Gog</ref>: – cut &amp; come again. And when
                    the whole <del>operation</del> series is compleated then they may be collected into a pamphlett, – &amp; finally embodied among
                    the Works of RS.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not carry out this intention.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> There may be this reason for having your article in the next number – that perhaps <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> poem will not be reviewed there:<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> George
                        Ellis’s review of Scott’s <title>The Lord of the Isles</title> (1815) appeared in the next but one issue, <title>Quarterly
                            Review</title>, 13 (July 1815), 287–309.</note> – they will not be noticed in the same number certes, for it will not do
                    to have two Kings of Brentford upon the stage <del>on</del> at once.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. Scott and
                        Southey himself. The analogy is with two mythical characters (‘Kings’ of the Essex town of Brentford – a place renowned for
                        its dirtiness), whose existence seems to derive from George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham (1628–1687; <title>DNB</title>),
                            <title>The Rehearsal</title> (1672), a satire on heroic tragedy. A ‘mock’ play within Villiers’ drama includes a scene in
                        which two king of Brentford enter hand in hand. In the next century, the phrase entered into wider cultural use, see for
                        example, William Cowper (1731–1800; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Task, A Poem, in Six Books</title> (London, 1785), p.
                        5.</note> I therefore send back this portion without waiting for the conclusion.</p><p rend="center"> ____</p><p rend="indent1"> I am a little uneasy about <ref target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">my youngest child</ref> – a discharge from the
                    inside of the ear having been clumsily treated by <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> who cannot be expected to

                    discovered degenerated into a fistulous sore, – what the nature of it may be, or with what degree of ease or difficulty it may be
                    cured I am entirely ignorant: – there is clearly a hole behind the ear, communicating <del>to the</del> with the cavity of the
                    ear, but I apprehend it will be necessary to take her to London. It is four months since the discharge began, first it was like
                    water, it has since been <del>a</del> icherous or fetid, – always <del>xx</del> very small. The ear swelled &amp; gathered, &amp;
                    in that state I believe was <del>lanced too soon &amp;</del> improperly treated, – having been first blistered, &amp; afterward
                    lanced too soon; – for a long time it has been left alone, merely keeping it clean &amp; now a <del>xxxxx</del> fistulous opening
                    is formed. I wrote to the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Docstor</ref> about it some time ago, – &amp; when you see
                    him you may tell him what <del>I sa</del> has since occurred. If it be necessary to take her to town, I must regulate my plan
                    accordingly, &amp; see you (not very willingly) much sooner than I intended or shall find convenient. I am uneasy about this, –
                    for I do not know the extent of the evil. The child suffers neither pain nor inconvenience, but I suspect that such things are
                    very difficult of cure, &amp; cannot tell from the nature of the plan how it is to be operated upon. That it should heal of itself
