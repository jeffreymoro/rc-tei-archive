        <p rend="indent1"> According to all forms I ought to write you a letter of congratulation,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Herbert Southey had married <ref target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">Louisa Gonne</ref> on 21 August 1815.</note> &#8211; but some unlucky ingredient in my moral, physical &amp; intellectual composition has all
                    my life long operated upon me with respect to forms like that antipathy which some persons feels toward cats, or other objects equally inoffensive. I get thro them so badly at all
                    times, that <del>x</del> whenever I am obliged to the performance my chief concern is how to slink out of it as expeditiously as possible. I have moreover a propensity which may
                    seem at first not very well to accord with that constitutional hilarity <del>xxxxxx</del> which is my best inheritance. Occasions of joy &amp; festivity serve rather to depress the
                        <del>xxxx</del> barometer of my spirits than to raise it: birthdays &amp; wedding days therefore pass uncelebrated by me, &amp; with the strongest conviction of the good effect
                    of national holydays, &amp; a feeling toward them which men who are incapable of understanding what is meant by the imaginative faculty might call superstition, I <del>xx</del> yet
                    wish if it were possible that Xmas &amp; New Years Day <del>xx</del> could be blotted from my kalendar. It might not be difficult to explain why this is, &#8211; but it would be somewhat
                    metaphysical which is bad, &#8211; &amp; somewhat sentimental, &#8211; which is worse.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Monday the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of August was not a more remarkable day in your life than it was in that of my neighbour <ref target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref>, who is a much older personage. The weather served for our bonfire, &amp; never I believe was such an assemblage upon such a spot. To my utter astonishment <ref target="people.html#SunderlinLord">Lord Sunderlin</ref> rode up &amp; <ref target="people.html#SunderlinLady">Lady S.</ref> who had endeavoured to dissuade <hi rend="ital">me</hi> from going, as a thing too dangerous, joined the walking party. <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> with <ref target="people.html#WordsworthMary">his wife</ref>, <ref target="people.html#WordsworthDorothy">sister</ref> &amp; eldest boy came over on purpose.

                    that I ever saw before, drank a huge wooden bowl of punch, <del>xx</del> fired cannon at every health with three times three, &amp; rolled large &lt;blazing&gt; balls of tow &amp;
                    turpentine down the steep side of the mountain. The effect was grand beyond imagination, we formd a huge circle round the most intense light, &amp; behind us was an immeasurable
                    circle of the most intense darkness &#8211; for our bonfire fairly put out the moon.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The only mishap which occurred will make a famous anecdote in the life of a great poet if James Boswell after the example of his father<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> His father was James Boswell (1740&#8211;1795; <title>DNB</title>), lawyer, diarist and biographer of Samuel Johnson (1709&#8211;1784; <title>DNB</title>).</note>
                    keepeth a Diary of the sayings of remarkable men. When we were craving for the punch, a cry went forth that the kettle had been kicked over with all the boiling water! <hi rend="ital">Colonel</hi> Barker as Bozzy named the <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora</ref> from her having had the command on this occasion, immediately
                    instituted a strict enquiry to discover the culprit, from a suspicion that it might have been done in mischief, &#8211; water as you know being a commodity not easily replaced on the
                    summit of <ref target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref>. The persons about the fire declared it was one of the Gentlemen, &#8211; they did not know his name, &#8211; but he had a red cloak
                    on: &amp; they pointed him out in the circle.
