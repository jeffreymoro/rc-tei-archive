        <p rend="indent1"> I am three hundred miles from town, &amp; were I there upon the spot I should not know of whom to ask a question
                    which it behoves me to have resolved, &#8211; except of you. New Years Day is at hand, &amp; whether I am expected to bring forth a New
                    Years Ode <hi rend="ital">more nefasto</hi> majorum,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;After the manner of our ancestors&#8217;;
                        i.e. as Southey&#8217;s predecessors as Poet Laureate had done.</note> or not, I am altogether ignorant. Last year <ref target="people.html#ParsonsWilliam">Sir W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Parsons</ref> wrote to me as I was leaving town, &amp; desired
                    he might have the Ode as soon as possible. I sent him such a portion as made a whole of itself sufficient for his purpose; &amp;
                    that I might not be deficient in any proper civility, told him that if any other parts of the Carmen<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s first official poem as Laureate, <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814).</note> would suit him
                    better, I hoped he would take just what he pleased, &#8211; &amp; therefore submitted the whole to his choice. He never thought proper
                    to take the slightest notice of my letter, &amp; whether any portion of the Ode were performed, or if the ceremony were dropt, I
                    know not. But I rather <del>xxxx</del> think it must have been waived, because no part of the poem appeared in the papers till the
                    whole was published;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Part of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> appeared in the <title>Courier</title>, 8 January 1814. It was published in book format, with
                        notes, on 1 January 1814.</note> &amp; otherwise the portion performed would most probably have been procured by the papers in
                    the usual way. Tell me according to your judgement whether I may rest in peace upon this subject, or if you think it necessary
                    that I should tax brains which are <hi rend="ital">bona fide</hi> better employed?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you are of the opinion that I may hold myself absolved, shall I insert these lines in a copy of Roderick,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). These lines were not used to preface the poem.</note> for presentation.
                    Understand I pray you, that I am far from wishing to be thought obtrusive with such things, &amp; only wish to do it, if it
                        <del>xxx</del> ought to be done &amp; could not without some impropriety be left undone.</p>

                    the <hi rend="ital">aere perennius</hi>;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;More lasting than bronze&#8217;.</note> &amp; there is
                    no want of precedent to justify the tone. But I am solicitous to do what is proper, &#8211; not to make use of the verses.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Few public measures have ever given me so much satisfaction as your late Admiralty measures.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Admiralty had reformed the Royal Navy pension system, so that all sailors were entitled to a
                        pension after 14 years&#8217; service and all could demand their discharge after 21 years&#8217; service, with a pension of at least 1<hi rend="ital">s</hi>. per day. These measures were announced publicly in January 1815.</note> These are the real radical
                    reforms, of which not many are wanting to render the strength &amp; the prosperity of this country as permanent, as human
                    institutions are capable of being made. I shall do my best to hold this up in its proper light.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Will you not smile to hear that I had written not less than fifty six-lined stanzas upon the intended marriage with
                    the Prince of Orange; &#8211; a good many of which are not convertible to <del>the xxx xx</del> any other Prince.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The engagement between Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales (1796&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>), only
                        child of the Prince Regent, and Prince William of Orange (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849) had been broken off in
                        June 1814. Charlotte married Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865) in 1816 and Southey turned his planned poem into a
                        public celebration of the marriage, <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816).</note> This is one of the
                    miseries of human life which cannot fall to every ones portion. However I have my labour for my pains (which is all I ever should
                    have had) &amp; a good laugh <del>xxx</del> at my disappointment. It is not the first time that in a restless apprehension of
                    being too late, I have <del>been</del> &lt;found myself&gt; too soon.</p>
