                    the &#964;&#959; &#950;&#957;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;The one (thing)&#8217;. Southey is ironically applying the phrase

        <p rend="indent1"> I wish I could think Lord Cochrane were innocent. If he is so, the best means of inducing the world to believe it,
                    would be for the guilty persons to make oath that he was only accidentally &amp; innocently involved with them. This is so
                    straight forward a course that its omission makes heavily against him.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The naval officer
                        and MP for Westminster since 1807, Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>). In February 1814
                        Cochrane&#8217;s uncle, Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone (1767&#8211;1833), and a Frenchman called Charles Random de Berenger (fl. 1800s&#8211;1830s)
                        perpetrated an ingenious fraud by spreading false news of Napoleon&#8217;s death, leading to a rapid rise and then fall in the price
                        of government funds, from which they benefited by dealing in these stocks. Cochrane protested he was innocent of any
                        involvement, but he was convicted with the others. He was fined &#163;1000; sentenced to one year&#8217;s imprisonment in the King&#8217;s
                        Bench and to stand for an hour in the pillory. The latter was remitted. In addition, Cochrane was struck off the navy list,
                        and expelled from the House of Commons and from the chapel of the Knights of the Bath.</note>
