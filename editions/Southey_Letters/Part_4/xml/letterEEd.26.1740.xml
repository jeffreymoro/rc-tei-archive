        <p rend="indent1"> I am very far from thinking that a set of Politicians when they
                    get into place are bound to repeal all the measures which they have opposed when
                    out of place; &#8211; even supposing their opposition to have been upon pure principle
                    &amp; not upon pure party, as it usually is. Thus I hold Fox<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles James Fox (1749&#8211;1806;
                            <title>DNB</title>), Whig politician and Foreign Secretary in 1806 in
                        the &#8216;Ministry of all the Talents&#8217; of 1806&#8211;1807. He had opposed the Union of
                        Great Britain and Ireland in 1800, but on 17 February 1806 declared &#8216;it was
                        not now to be lightly rescinded&#8217;.</note> to have been perfectly right in
                    what he said about the Union. &#8211; You will see some part of my objection to the
                    Foxites in the Register.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810),
                        2&#8211;7</note>. &#8211; with regard to the Income,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The &#8216;Ministry of All the Talents&#8217; of 1806&#8211;1807 had
                        modified the income tax in 1806, raising it to 10% on incomes over &#163;150
                        p.a., with a system of abatements and allowances for incomes of &#163;50 to &#163;150
                        p.a. In <title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 4,
                        Southey vented his anger against this &#8216;Cruel and iniquitous&#8217; tax.</note>
                    what I abominate is the extent to which they carried it, &amp; the detestable
                    manner in which it is taken from every body. &#8211; leaving those who are
                        <del>not</del> below the line a right of getting it back again, &#8211; which it
                    is so difficult for them to do. But I hate them worst because they are already
                    subdued in heart by Buonaparte, &amp; ready to sacrifice the honour of the
                    country, &#8211; without which there is no salvation for us. &#8211; As for unrejectable
                    terms of peace I do not agree with you. The independence of S America is not his
                    to offer, for our fleets prevent them from ever being his. &#8211; You will see what I
                    have said about making the war professedly personal against Buonaparte &amp;
                    distinguishing between him &amp; the French nation.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    usurpation of Spain left him without disguise.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. when Napoleon invaded Spain in 1808.</note>

                        coincided with Newcastle races in the last week of April or first week of
                        May. Southey witnessed it during a visit to Durham in 1810, with the
                        intention of including it in his unexecuted continuation to <title>Letters
                            from England</title> (1807).</note> &#8211; more fashionable &amp; less brutal

                        was held at various locations at Easter and was regarded as one of the
                        severest tests on the cockfighting calendar. It usually featured over 30
                        birds who fought each other head to head until one was left standing.</note>
