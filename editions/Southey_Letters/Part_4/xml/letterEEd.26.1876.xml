                        interventionist case in the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 99. In contrast, the published

                        Sicily because of British support. Its main sins in his eyes were its reactionary nature and its unwillingness to wage war
                        against the French. Southey had to wait until <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 422&#8211;437 to

                    frequency of pardons, &#8211; but I would have the punishment of death taken away from &lt;some&gt; cases in which it is usually
                    inflicted, &#8211; coining &amp; forging. because there ought to be a strong line of distinction drawn between offences against the

                    for their offences would be good colonists. &#8211; No man should be hanged who is pitied at the gallows: the feeling of vengeance is
                    necessary to sanction &amp; sanctify punishment. Our puny moralists are for seperating them! &amp; hanging men upon a supposed

                        offences that carried the death penalty. Not all members of the government were opposed to these measures. On 27 February
                        1811,
                        Romilly introduced petitions from calico printers asking for the death penalty to be abolished for the crime of stealing from
                        a bleaching ground, and this measure passed, with government acquiescence. On 4 March 1811, the government appointed a
                        committee to look into building more prisons, partly as an alternative to the death penalty.</note> Let us once begin to
