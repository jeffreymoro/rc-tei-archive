        <p rend="indent1"> I was sorry to see that <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Perceval</ref> contradicted that story of the soldier at Taunton as
                    altogether false.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In parliament on 15
                        April 1812, Burdett spoke to the issue of the flogging of soldiers. He cited
                        the case of Phineas Adams, &#8216;who had undergone the most horrible torture, in
                        order to get out of the army and out of the reach of the lash. [Burdett] &#8230;
                        stated, that Adams, amongst other tortures, had endured that of pins
                        thrusted up under his nails; that he had been <hi rend="ital">scalped</hi>,
                        and had his skull scraped&#8217;. In reply, Perceval had challenged the
                        authenticity of these claims. A full account of the case was given in
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.2 (1813), 159&#8211;160.
                        Adams had pretended to be comatose to obtain his discharge from the army and
                        even kept up the pretence when a surgeon operated on his skull. The case
                        occurred in Taunton in June 1811.</note> When <ref target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> asserts any thing
                    roundly in the house it is likely to prove just as veracious as his statements
                    in the Edinburgh Review. This however happened to be true. &#8211; The story itself in
                    a physical point of view is one of the most extraordinary upon record.
                        <del>He</del> The fellow certainly puzzled every medical man who saw him, &#8211;
                    &amp; one of the Taunton surgeons is a man thoroughly scientific &amp; of very
                    uncommon powers of mind.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#StandertHughChudleigh">Hugh Chudleigh
                        Standert</ref>.</note> I was at Taunton at the time, heard every particular,

                        and Somerset Hospital.</note> A North American Indian could not have stood
                    the test better. He baffled every trial which could be made. &#8211; The fact had
                    nothing <del>x</del> more to do with the subject under debate than that it
                    showed the fellow wanted his discharge, &amp; chose a most extraordinary way to
                    obtain it. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am glad to see this subject taken up, &#8211; &amp; yet in the hands

                        brutality to his men was well known. In 1809 his crew brought a complaint
                        against him for cruelty and oppression. Corbet demanded a court martial.
                        This acquitted him of all charges except that of punishing his crew &#8216;with
                        sticks of an improper size and such as are not usual in his majesty&#8217;s
                        service&#8217;. He was reprimanded but allowed to resume command of his ship the
