                    a rich work of fancy, &#8211; Kilmeny a fine one of imagination, &#8211; which is a higher &amp; rarer gift. These poems have given general
                    pleasure throughout the house; my eldest girl often comes out with a stanza or two of the Witch, &#8211; but she wishes sometimes that

        <p rend="indent1"> We hoped to have seen you on your way back from Ellory.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Wilson&#8217;s home,
                        near Kendal.</note> I believe you did not get the Ballad of the Devil &amp; the Bishop<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        &#8216;A True Ballad of St Antidius, the Pope, and the Devil&#8217;, <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), III, pp. 171&#8211;180;
                        first published as &#8216;A True Ballad of a Pope&#8217;, <title>Morning Post</title>, 4 February 1803.</note> which <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> transcribed for you. I am reprinting my miscellaneous poems collected
                    into three volumes, &#8211; <del>&amp; as</del> your projected publication<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly Hogg&#8217;s
                            <title>Pilgrims of the Sun</title> (1815).</note> will have the start of it greatly, for the first volume is not nearly
                    thro the press, &#8211; &amp; there is a corrected copy of the ballad, with its introduction, in <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantynes</ref> hands, which you can make use &lt;of&gt; before it will be wanted in
                    its place.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You ask me why I am not intimate with <ref target="people.html#WilsonJohn">Wilson</ref>. There is a sufficient
                    reason in the distance between our respective abodes. I seldom go even to <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</ref> or <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyds</ref>, &#8211; &amp; Ellory is far enough from either of their
                    houses to make a visit the main business of a day. So it happens that except dining in his company once at <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyds</ref> many years ago, &amp; breakfasting with him here not long afterwards, I have
                    barely exchanged saluations with him once or twice when we met upon the road. Perhaps however I might have sought him had it not
                    been for his passion for cockfighting. But this is a thing which I regard with abhorrence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Would that Roderick<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> were in your hands for reviewing. I should desire no fairer nor
                    more competent critic. But it is of little consequence what friends or enemies may do for it now; it will find its due place in
                    time, which is slow but sure in its decisions. From the nature of my studies I may almost be said to live in the past; it is to
                    the future that I look on for my reward, &amp; it would be difficult to make any person who is not thoroughly intimate with me,
                    understand how compleatly indifferent I am to the praise or censure of the present generation, farther than as it may affect my
                        <del>xxxxx</del> means of subsistence, which thank God it can no longer effectually do. There was a time when I was materially
                    injured by unjust criticism; but even then I despised it, from a confidence in myself, &amp; a natural buoyancy of spirit. It
                    cannot injure me now, &#8211; but I cannot hold it in more thorough contempt.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Come &amp; visit me when the warm weather returns. You can go nowhere where you will be more sincerely welcomed
                    &#8211;</p>
