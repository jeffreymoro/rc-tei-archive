          <salute>My dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have done many things which have given me great pleasure since your last letter. I never was more rejoiced than
                    when <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord Grenville</ref> gave his full &amp; manly support to a war which beyond all
                    others in which we have been involved, is necessary &amp; inevitable.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In a House of Lords
                        debate on 23 May 1815, Lord Grenville had declared Napoleon to be &#8216;the common enemy of Europe&#8217; and had fully supported the war
                        against France.</note> &#8211; I am very glad also to see that you are doing something to promote vaccination.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wynn had introduced a Bill into the House of Commons on 15 June 1815 &#8216;For procuring the benefit
                        of Vaccination to such poor persons as are desirous of receiving it&#8217;, <title>Hansard</title> (15 June 1815), col. 845. The
                        Bill was eventually rejected, <title>Hansard</title> (5 July 1815), col. 1121. It had proposed State funding for smallpox
                        vaccinations.</note> Much may be done both towards the cure &amp; prevention of diseases by wise legislative interference; &#8211;
                    &amp; this is one of the points in which the state of society is susceptible of great amelioration. I thank you too for standing
                    up against those vile Vice-Society people,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Society for the Suppression of Vice,
                        founded in 1802. In the House of Commons on 8 June 1815 Wynn had opposed the Thames Bathing Bill, which sought to impose
                        penalties for &#8216;indecent exposure&#8217; whilst bathing in the Thames.</note> who would keep <del>the people</del> &lt;men&gt; filthy
                    rather than let them undress to wash themselves!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The question of incest was touched upon, &amp; you very properly recommended that the case of Sir H Mildmay should
                    rest upon the existing law rather than make it the subject of a specific (&amp; superfluous) clause in the act of divorce.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 14 June 1815 Wynn had spoken in the House of Commons during a debate on the Rosebery
                        Divorce Bill. Archibald John Primrose, 4th Earl of Rosebery (1783&#8211;1868; <title>DNB</title>) was divorcing his wife
                        Harriet (d. 1834) on the grounds of her adultery with Sir Henry St John Mildmay, 4th Baronet (1787&#8211;1848). The draft Bill
                        included a clause forbidding the remarriage of Lady Rosebery to Mildmay. The issue of incest was raised on the grounds that
                        Mildmay&#8217;s late wife, Charlotte (d. 1810), had been the sister of Lady Rosebery. Wynn&#8217;s intervention reminded his fellow MPs
                        that &#8216;the insertion of the clause in the present instance did not bind the House to the adoption of a similar clause in other
                        cases, because a divorce bill was at all times a special interference of the Legislature, which they might fashion according
                        to their discretion&#8217;, <title>Hansard</title> (14 June 1815), col 793. Rosebery was granted his divorce, with the provision
                        that Mildmay pay &#163;15,000 in damages. Mildmay and Lady Rosebery were married shortly afterwards.</note> But has it never
                    occurred to you, my dear Wynn that this law is an abominable relic of ecclesiastical tyranny? Of all second marriages I have no
                    hesitation in saying, that these<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. marriages between a surviving spouse and their
                        deceased wife&#8217;s sister. Such marriages were banned as they violated Canon Law, as expressed in the Church of England&#8217;s &#8216;Table
                        of Kindred and Affinity&#8217; in the <title>Book of Common Prayer</title> (1662).</note> are the most natural, the most suitable,
                    &amp; likely to be the most frequent, if the Law did not sometimes prevent them. It is quite monstrous to hear Judges &amp;
                    Lawyers <del>xx</del> speaking as they have done of late upon this subject, &amp; confounding natural incest with what was only
                    deemed to be &lt;incestuous&gt; in order that the Church might profit by selling dispensations for its commission: &#8211; a species of
                    marriage too which was not only permitted by the Levitical law, but even enjoined by it.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Such marriages were enjoined by <title>Deuteronomy</title> 25: 5, but banned by <title>Leviticus</title> 18: 18.</note> I
                    should be glad to know in what part of the Christian dispensation it is prohibited as a crime. The probable reason why this law
