                        the educational systems advocated by Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster (the &#8216;Dragon&#8217;), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 6
                        (October 1811), 264&#8211;304. Southey had written to Murray the previous day; see Southey to John Murray, 10 March 1812, Letter
                        2058.</note> besides your own, &#8211; three of them are for <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref>. The other

        <p rend="indent1"> The book will probably be published in about ten days, possibly sooner. The comments upon the Ed. Review are in a
                    proper <hi rend="ital">mordacious</hi> style, &amp; contain part of what was to have been in the Epistle Dedicatory to <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Gog</ref>, if that had been thought advisable.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey had been provoked by an article in the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 17 (November 1810), 58&#8211;88, which was severely
                            criticised in <title>The Origin, Nature, and Object of the New System of Education</title>. The <title>Edinburgh</title> had condemned Bell and proclaimed Lancaster&#8217;s methods superior.
                        Southey had originally planned to dedicate <title>The Origin</title> (1812) to Gog (ie. Francis Jeffrey, so ironically
                        nicknamed because of his lack of height). Instead, he interspersed swipes at the <title>Edinburgh</title> and its editor
                        throughout. See Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 5 November 1811, Letter 1979.</note> I think you will find some good
                    plain English properly applied.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The pistols are arrived, <del>&amp;</del> very compleat they seem to be, &amp; now procul este<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Be gone&#8217;.</note> ugly fellows! Rattelavi rattelos, &#8211; rattelavi <del>&amp; depol</del> et

                        made by the watchman&#8217;s rattles Southey had requested from Bedford; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 17 January 1812
                        (Letter 2018) and [January 1812] (Letter 2026).</note> Mighty pretty instruments they are: they came in the best possible
                    point of time, &#8211; just as I had got up myself, &amp; so I handselld them by taking my stand in the passage <del>by</del> &lt;at&gt;

                    action of the poem will proceed rapidly from this point, where indeed if I had thought it expedient to follow the receipts for
                    Epic poetry, it would have begun. But the <del>xxx</del> manner in which Rodericks character is conceived made it necessary to
                    begin ab ovo,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;from the beginning&#8217;.</note> &amp; perhaps it may be proper in consequence
                    to call it Roderick the Last of the Goths.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The title under which the poem was published in
                        1814.</note> &#8211; for it will end with him <del>as</del> even as it begun with him. This however is of little consequence &amp;
                    may be decided upon hereafter. From this point you will have action enough, flight &amp; pursuit, siege &amp; battle &amp;
