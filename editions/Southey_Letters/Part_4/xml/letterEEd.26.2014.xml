            <title>The Origin, Nature, and Object of the New System of Education</title> (1812), an expansion of Southey&#8217;s review in

                    deal of pains taken to perplex. I have planned two books with the hope &amp; expectation of fitting them upon the establishment of
                    schools of the National Institution.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> The National Society for Promoting the Education of
                        the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church was founded in 1811 to promote Anglican education.</note> &#8212; for the
                    purpose of training up our youth in the way that they should go. The Book of the Church, &amp; the Book of the Constitution,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824). Southey never wrote his defence of the British constitution.</note> &#8212; being at
                    once the philosophy &amp; the flowers of our ecclesiastical &amp; civil history. This is the outline of the first. &#8212; 1. The
                    religion of our British Roman &amp; Saxon ancestors, being the evils from which the conversion of this island delivered us 2. A
                    picture of popery. 3. a picture of puritanism. 4. methodism. all this given in historical form, showing the evils from which our
                    Ch. Establishment has delivered us, &#8212; &amp; those from which at present it preserves us. In short I want to make people feel &amp;
                    understand, what they neither understand nor feel now. &amp; the Book of the Constitution is the parallel of these. Shall I not
                    Senhora be well employed in executing this in such a manner as shall at once suit the comprehension of youth &amp; satisfy the
                    understanding of mature judgements? In reading for this purpose I dwelt over Fox&#8217;s book of Martyrs<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Foxe (1517&#8211;1587; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Actes and Monuments</title> (1563), popularly known as the
