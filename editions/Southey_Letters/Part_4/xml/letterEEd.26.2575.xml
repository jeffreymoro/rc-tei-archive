          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> This evening I return you Wolfe&#8217;s Letters.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Wolfe (1727&#8211;1759;
                            <title>DNB</title>), British general killed in the victory at Quebec during the Seven Years War 1756&#8211;1763. Southey appears
                        to have been asked by Murray to read a selection of manuscript letters from Wolfe to his family, possibly with a view to their
                        publication. No edition appeared at this time.</note> I read them &lt;carefully&gt; &amp; am glad so to have done, but the
                    utmost ingenuity could not extract <del>xxx</del> matter from them for more than a couple of chapters.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Perhaps you may get scent of other <del>letter</del> parts of his correspondence, &#8211; it is very clear to me that
                    these family letters must be the least interesting of all he can have written, &#8211; for Wolfe&#8217;s father &amp; mother<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lieutenant-General Edward Wolfe (1685&#8211;1759; <title>DNB</title>) and his wife Henrietta (d. 1764;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> were not people to whom he could write in that happy tone of mind which gives life &amp;
                    sunshine to this kind of intercourse. If the present series is printed, his name will probably secure a <del>xxx</del> sale to a
                    certain extent but the <del>xxx</del> publication will do little toward raising that name. I have the highest admiration for
                    Wolfe: the last scene of his life was eminently heroic, &amp; he had a true sense of duty <del>for</del> toward his country. But
                    the intellect which he undoubtedly possessed is seldom called forth in this correspondence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If Buonapartes friends in France are as staunch to him as his <del>xxx</del> semi-allies in the British Parliament,
                        M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Whitbread<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The radical MP Samuel Whitbread (1764&#8211;1815;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> &amp; <ref target="people.html#GreyCharles">Earl Grey</ref>, he is at this time de facto
                    Emperor again. And then for another contest, under all the disadvantages of having half Switzerland &amp; all Italy in his favour!
                    Spain neutral, &amp; Belgium perhaps worse than neutral! better however that contest under all disadvantages than peace with
                    Buonaparte. If he enters Paris his first measure will be to offer to negotiate with us. Thank God we shall escape the infamy &amp;
                    such of listening to any <del>xxx</del> term which he may offer.</p>
