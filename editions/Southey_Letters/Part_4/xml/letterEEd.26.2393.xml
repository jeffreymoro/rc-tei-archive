          <l rend="indent3"> Count, said Pelayo, Nature hath assignd</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Two sovereign remedies for human grief;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Strength to the weak &amp; to the wounded balm</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Religion, surest, firmest, first, &amp; best,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And strenuous action next. Think not I came</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With unprovided heart. My noble wife</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In the last solemn words, the last farewell</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With which she charged her secret messenger,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Told me that whatsoeer was my resolve,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> She bore a mind prepared. And well I know</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The evil, be it what it may, hath found</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> In her a courage equal to the hour.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Captivity, or death, or what worse pangs</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> She in her children may be doomed to feel,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Will never make that steady soul repent</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Its virtuous purpose. I too did cast </l>
          <l rend="indent3"> My single life into the lot, but knew</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> These dearer pledges on the die were set;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And if the worst has fallen, I shall but bear</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That in my breast, which with transfiguring power</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of piety, makes chastening sorrow take</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The form of hope &amp; sees in Death the friend</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And the delivering Angel. We must rest</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Perforce, &amp; wait what tidings night may bring</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Haply of comfort. Ho there! kindle fires,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And see if aught of hospitality</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Can yet within these mournful walls be found.</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Thus while he spake lights were descried far off,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Moving among the trees, &amp; coming sounds</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Were heard, as of a distant multitude.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Anon a company of horse &amp; foot</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Advancing in disorderly array</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Came up the vale: before them &amp; beside</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> At once were gone; impatient in desire</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of second victory alert they stood,</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Imagination to their wish had shaped</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Vanished in nearer vision, high-wrought hope</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Departing, left the spirit pall&#8217;d &amp; blank.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> No turband race, no sons of Africa</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Were they who now came winding up the vale,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> As waving wide before their horses feet</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The torch-light floated, with its hovering glare</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Blackening the incumbent &amp; surrounding night</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Helmet &amp; breastplate glittered as they came,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And spears erect; &amp; <del>x</del> nearer as they drew</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Were the loose folds of female garments seen</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> On those who led the company. Who then</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had stood beside Pelayo, might have heard</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The beating of his heart</l>
          <l rend="indent7"> But vainly there</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sought he with wistful eye the well-known forms</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Beloved; &amp; plainly might it now be seen</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That from some bloody conflict they return&#8217;d</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Victorious, for at every saddle bow</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> A gory head was hung. Anon they stopt</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Levelling in quick alarm their ready spears.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Hold! who goes there? cried one. A hundred tongues</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Sent forth with one accord the glad reply,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Friends &amp; Asturians! &#8211; Onward moved the lights</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The People knew their Lord.</l>
          <l rend="indent5"> Then what a shout</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Rung thro the valley! From their clay-built nests</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Beneath the overbrowing battlements,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Then first disturbd the affrighted martins fled</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And uttering notes of terror short &amp; shrill</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Amid the yellow glare &amp; lurid smoke</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Wheeld giddily. Then plainly was it shown</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> How well the vassals loved their generous Lord,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> How like a father the Asturian Prince</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Was dear. They crowded round, they claspd his knees</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> They snatchd his hand, they fell upon his neck, &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> They wept, &#8211; they blest Almighty Providence</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which had restored him thus from bondage free,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> God was with them &amp; their good cause they said,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His hand was here, His shield was over them</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His spirit was abroad, His power displayd,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And pointing to their bloody trophies then</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> They told Pelayo there he might behold</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The first fruits of the harvest they should</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Soon reap in the field of war. &#8211; Benignantly</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With voice &amp; look &amp; gesture did the Prince</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To these warm greetings of tumultuous joy</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Respond; &amp; sure if at that moment aught</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Could for awhile have overpowered those fears</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Which from the inmost heart oer all his frame</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Diffused their chilling influence, worthy pride</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And sympathy of love &amp; joy &amp; hope,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had then possessed him wholly. Even now</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> His spirit rose: the sense of power, the sight</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of his brave people ready where he led</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To fight their countrys battles, &amp; the thought</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of instant action &amp; deliverance,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> If Heaven which thus far had protected him</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Should favour still, revived his heart, &amp; gave</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Fresh impulse to its spring. In vain he sought</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Amid that turbulent greeting to enquire</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Where Gaudiosa was, his children where,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Who called them to the field, who captained them,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And how these women thus with arms &amp; death</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Environed, came amid their company.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> For yet amid the fluctuating light</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And tumult of the crowd he knew them not.</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Holds the loose rein with careless hand? A helm</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Upon the turmoil round. One countenance</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> So strongly-markd, so passion worn was there,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That it recalled her mind. Ha! Maccabee!</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Lifting her arm exultingly she cried,</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> From whom the impulse came.</l>
          <l rend="indent8"> That startling call</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That voice so well remembered touchd the Goth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> With timely impulse now; for he had seen</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> For whom her supplications day &amp; night</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Was calm; her placid countenance, tho grief</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Deeper than time had left its traces there,</l>

                        English force under Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch (1748&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>) failed to capture Bergen-op-Zoom in the
                        Netherlands on March 8 1814, with a loss of 900 killed and wounded and 1800 prisoners. Graham had defeated the French forces
                        besieging Cadiz on 5 March 1811 at the Battle of Barrosa. This victory proved a significant boost to British morale, but had
                        no wider strategic consequences. Southey disliked Graham both for his criticism of the Spanish army&#8217;s operations at Barrosa
                        and his Whig opinions (he was MP for Perthshire 1794&#8211;1807).</note> As for the Dutch indeed their torpor at this time is such
