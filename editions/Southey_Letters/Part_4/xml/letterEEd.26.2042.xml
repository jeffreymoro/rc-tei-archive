        <p rend="indent1"> It is long since I have heard from you, not (I believe) since <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>
                    delivered to me your note accompanying the Vision of Don Roderic:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott&#8217;s <title>Vision of
                            Don Roderick</title> (1811), which covered similar territory to that in Southey&#8217;s <title>Roderick, the Last of the
                            Goths</title> (1814).</note> &amp; I am sorry to learn by a letter from <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> last night that during this long interval you have been suffering from sorrow &amp; domestic sickness. This
                    latter evil I trust is at an end, as he tells me there is hope of your lending a strong hand once more to the Quarterly. &#8211; Leydens
                    death must have distressed you. It grieved me, who was a stranger to him, &amp; made me curse Batavia &amp; wish that the Dutch
                    had the island again rather than that such a price should have been paid for it.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poet
                        and linguist John Leyden (1775&#8211;1811; <title>DNB</title>) had travelled to Batavia to act as an interpreter when the Dutch
                        territories in Java were occupied by British forces in 1811. He contracted fever and died on 28 August 1811.</note> Poor
                    fellow, &#8211; &amp; this then is the end of his labours!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But I will turn to other thoughts. &#8211; Have you seen Count Julian?<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Walter
                        Savage Landor&#8217;s <title>Count Julian: A Tragedy</title> (1812).</note> I feel the departure from historical character in Orpas
                    &amp; Sisibert<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Orpas, Archbishop of Seville; and Sisibert, illegitimate son of Witiza (c.
                        687&#8211;710; Visigothic King of Hispania 694&#8211;710). Both were portrayed as leading Gothic renegades and collaborators with the
                        invading Moors in <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> unpleasantly, but this is merely because my own
                    representation of them will be so different, &#8211; to other readers it will be no objection. The drama cannot be popular, because its
                    faults are of a nature to be seen by every body &amp; its merits of that class which can only be appreciated by the few. There is
                    an obscurity at times in the language of which the author never will rid himself, &amp; which I know not how to account for, &#8211; but
                    there are passages expressed as forcibly as they are conceived, &amp; both in expression &amp; conception equalling any thing in
                    the best writers. &#8211; I shall review it for the next number.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s review of
                            <title>Count Julian</title> appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (September 1812), 86&#8211;92.</note> If we poets did
                    but always enjoy the privilege of being tried by our peers, how much injustice &amp; injury should we <del>then</del> escape! </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My own poem<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> proceeds slowly, &#8211; it being only in prose-concerns that occasion
                    has any spurs for me. Part of it, of which the spirit was caught from Zaragoza,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        spirited resistance of the inhabitants of the Spanish city of Zaragoza to the French attacks of 1808 and 1809.</note> seems to
                    me better than any of my former writings, &amp; if I can persuade myself that the publication will have any effect in reviving
                    &amp; strengthening the feelings of the public toward me a good cause, it may induce me to quicken my progress. That cause will
                    prosper in spite of the most provoking &amp; continued misconduct. &#8211; think of that army in Sicily four whole years, while the

                    been defeated &amp; destroyed! Think <del>x</del> too of the blind obstinacy of the Spanish Government, from the Junta to this

                        that led to the independence of the states of the Rio de la Plata. (In 1813 Southey had a copy made of the journal, no. 3162
