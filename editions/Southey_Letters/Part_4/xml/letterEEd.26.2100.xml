        <p rend="indent1"> The Bahia consignment turns out to be two printed books &#8211; one the
                    same as that which the Envoy contrived to forward so ingeniously by the post
                    from Lisbon.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> This was a copy of
                        Manuel Calado (1584&#8211;1654), <title>Valeroso Lucideno e o Triunfo da
                            Liberdade</title> (1648), a first-hand account of Brazil during the
                        period of Dutch rule. It had been sent to Southey (via Longman) by Charles
                        Stuart, Baron Stuart de Rothesay (1779&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), envoy at
                        Lisbon 1810&#8211;1814. The parcel had attracted the huge charge of 16 guineas for
                        postage, and Southey had to pull strings with Francis Freeling to get it
                        reduced to 1 guinea; see Southey to Richard Heber, 7 September 1812,
                        Letter 2143.</note>
          <del>Our</del> The Consul<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        diplomat Frederick Lindeman (dates unknown), who had taken up his post at
                        Bahia in 1810.</note> has made the blunder &amp; the disappointment, not the
                    person who sent the books &#8211; both of which I was very desirous of possessing, &#8211;
                    &amp; the one of which from its extreme rarity I had considered as compleatly
                        unattainable.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The parcel from
                        Bahia had been sent at the request of Marcos de Noronha e Brito, Conde dos
                        Arcos (1771&#8211;1828), Governor General of Bahia 30 September 1810&#8211;26 January
                        1818. It included a copy of Jos&#233; de Anchieta (1534&#8211;1597), <title>Arte de
                            Grammatica da Lingoa mais Usada na Costa do Brasil</title> (1595). This
                        was no. 1530 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, inscribed by him:
                        &#8216;This singularly rare and curious book was sent to me from the Public
                        Library of Bahia de Todos, or Santos, by desire of the Conde des Arcos, then
                        Governor of that Captaincy.&#8217;</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> Whoever the ministers may be I hope they will look to the state
                    of the newspapers, &amp; put a stop to the cut-throat system while it is yet
                    possible. I could recommend a short way with the Catholicks, &#8211; tell them to
                    agree upon the security which they will give in the way of the veto, &amp; then
                    we are ready to take their claims into consideration. &#8211; This would be adjourning
                    the question <hi rend="ital">sine die</hi>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. &#8216;Without assigning a day for a further hearing.&#8217; At
                        this time various compromise schemes for Catholic Emancipation were being
                        floated, including the idea that the government should have a &#8216;veto&#8217; over
                        the appointment of Catholic bishops.</note> A better way would be to grant
                    them every thing except seats in Parliament, &#8211; a distinction which I have always
                    made. As for pacifying Ireland by any concessions, it is the height of folly or
                    ignorance to suppose it possible, &#8211; but the English Romanists <del>are entitled
                        to</del> ought not to be excluded from any thing which does not involve

                        conducted along the lines advocated by Sir Charles William Pasley
                        (1780&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>), who had served in the British army in Spain
                        in 1808 and 1809. His <title>Essay on the Military Policy and Institutions
                            of the British Empire</title> (London, 1810), p. 241, argued that the
                        British should have demanded &#8216;the chief command of every combined army in
                        Spain&#8217;.</note> As for the question who pays the piper, &#8211; they who have
                    funded property must look to that. &#8211; I am in the situation of that traveller who
                    may sing in sight of the robber.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    whether the <del>Government</del> &lt;present system&gt; can retain them are
