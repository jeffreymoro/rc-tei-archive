                        wine business as a partner in the firm Stert and May.</note> &#8211; &amp; rich
                    enough to drink it daily: <del>meantime</del> at present you can only have my
                    best wishes, <del>for</del> &amp; a good word, which I fear is of little more
                    value than mere good will. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</ref>
                    is a man of whom his acquaintance say there is one place in which they will
                    never see him, &#8211; at the head of his own table. The fact is that he lives upon
                    the move, <del>&amp;</del> his establishment in Shropshire has nothing to fix a
                    batchelor there, &amp; his home in town is a mere <del>wareho</del>
                    receiving-house for books, where he has barely room for a small breakfast
                    table.</p>

                        May</ref> is thoroughly recovered. We are going on well as far as concerns
                    ourselves; &#8211; but <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has
                    a <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">brother</ref> here, &#8211;
                    who came to us for a visit, &amp; is likely to find his last home here. He is
                    labouring under a complicated disease of &lt;the&gt; liver &amp; lungs, which
                    must bring him to the grave. &#8211; I see him but little, for I am rarely out of my
                    library except at meal-times; &amp; never sit after dinner <del>except</del> but
                    at such times as I have guests. Still I cannot help feeling a heavy depression
                    of <del>m</del> spirits; &amp; as soon as possible I shall run into Durham for a
                    week or two, for the mere purpose of endeavouring to shake off the effects of
                    this sight of death.</p>
