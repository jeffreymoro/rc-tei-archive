        <p rend="indent1"> I have too long delayed thanking you for your English champagne, &#8211; which well deserves that appellation. You have I
                    trust in the meantime heard from me in printers characters tho&#8217; not in my own. I desired that a copy of my Minor Poems<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Minor Poems</title> (1815).</note> should be sent you. The greater part are not such things as I should publish now,
                    tho&#8217; they were well enough for the age at which they were written; &amp; for that very reason many of them are <del>xxxx</del>
                    &lt;more&gt; suited to the common standard of taste than they would be if they were better. The Ode respecting Buonaparte is
                    republished at a proper time.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Ode, Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte, 1814&#8217;,
                        originally published in the <title>Courier</title>, 3 February 1814, it incorporated five stanzas deleted from <title>Carmen
                        Triumphale</title>. It was included in <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 217&#8211;224.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This days paper has brought us the first account of the first battle,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        battle of Quarte Bras, 16 June 1815, between Wellington&#8217;s Anglo-Dutch army and part of the French Arm&#233;e du Nord under the
                        command of Marshal Michel Ney (1769&#8211;1815). It was a tactical draw.</note> &#8211; our news is four &amp; twenty hours later, &amp;
                    just now I could envy you for being a hundred &amp; fifty miles nearer the scene of action. You know with what confidence I always
                    looked on to the result of a battle with Buonaparte, if we ever <del>xxxx</del> to meet him with equal, or with not-greatly
                    inferior forces. The result of the first conflict at this time is of exceeding importance. &amp; I cannot but think it likely that
                    a little ill success will embolden some Frenchmen to save their country, or at least to remove the chief &amp; immediate cause of
                    its calamities, by putting him to death. On the other hand it really seems as if divine Justice were about to punish the French
                    people for their accumulated guilt, &amp; for the <del>crimes</del> &lt;miseries&gt; which they have <del>xxxxxxxxx</del>
                    inflicted upon the rest of Europe; &amp; that we are about to have the most aweful example of retribution that the world has ever
                    yet beheld. The state of parties <del>of a</del> in Paris bears a sufficient resemblance to that of the factions in Jerusalem
                    before its destruction by Titus.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. before it was destroyed by the Roman general and
                        future emperor Titus (AD 39&#8211;81) in AD 70, Jerusalem had been riven by faction fights between the Sicarii and the
                        Zealots.</note> That city is in not less danger from the frenzy of the Jacobines than from the despair of Buonaparte. I well
                    remember that Isnard,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Maximin Isnard (1758&#8211;1825). He made his famous declaration on 25 May
                        1793, when, as President of the Convention, he replied to a deputation from the Paris Commune that was demanding the release
                        of the radical journalist, Jacques Rene Hebert (1757&#8211;1794).</note> one of the Brissotines, speaking in 1793 of the evils which
                    the wilder party were bringing on, warned them to beware lest travellers should one day seek for the ruins of Paris upon the banks
                    of the Seine: that apprehension is more likely to be realized now, than it was then.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This neighbourhood has been much shocked by the death of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Denton<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sarah (d. 1815), wife of Isaac Denton (c. 1758&#8211;1820), Vicar of Crosthwaite, Keswick, 1786&#8211;1820.</note> after
                    an illness of only three days, &amp; danger not apprehended till the last. I believe it was a case of cholera morbus. All else are
                    much as when you left us, with little other difference than what the course of time makes, &#8211; upon the young fry this indeed is
                    very perceptible. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> is at Oxford; &#8211; he has got a postmastership<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The name given to a Scholarship at Merton College, Oxford.</note> at Merton, &#8211; a situation
                    as respectable as any in the University &amp; worth 50 or perhaps 60&#163; a year. This was obtained for him by <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeWilliamHart">one of his Coleridge
                        cousins</ref>,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Hart Coleridge was a clergyman who later became Bishop of Barbados and the Leeward Islands
                        1824&#8211;1842; and was well-suited to give advice about the University of Oxford as he had graduated from Christ Church in
