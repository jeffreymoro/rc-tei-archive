                    am reading this Archdeacons history of the Spanish Bourbons,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Coxe&#8217;s <title>Memoirs
                            of the Kings of Spain</title> (1813).</note> &#8211; like his Austrian volumes<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> William
                        Coxe&#8217;s <title>History of the House of Austria</title> (1807).</note> it is written upon the curious &amp; novel principle that
                    the history of nations is comprized in the squabbles of cabinets &amp; the dispatches of Embassadors. Whatever is out of the
                    circle of diplomacy is extramundane to William Coxe! &#8211; Nevertheless his books have their use, but never in the course of all my
                    reading did I feel so little respect for any author who communicated to me any thing which I desired to know.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Roderick<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> is in the press, &amp; most of my time is devoted to it, &#8211; yet
                    my progress is not very rapid. Indeed I am no longer a rapid writer either in prose or verse, &amp; the quantity which I produce
                    is accumulated by dribletts, &#8211; as fortunes are made in low retail trades. Ten lines cost me more thought &amp; as much time as a
                    hundred were wont to do fifteen &lt;or 20&gt; years ago. This is the effect of maturity, &#8211; <del>which</del> &amp; in all things
                    the stage next beyond maturity is decay. I am, God be praised, in the full strength of my faculties, &amp; have good reason to be
                    satisfied with the use which has been made of them, &#8211; but the sense of the chances &amp; changes to which we are all liable is so
                    ever present to my mind, that if I possessed an income equal to my expenditure I should most assuredly renounce all
                        <del>those</del> periodical &amp; minor composition of every kind, &amp; devote <del>x</del> myself without interruption to
                    the completion of my historical works &amp; the great poems which I have planned, &#8211; in the hope of <del>living to feel that</del>
                    being able one day to feel that my work was fully &amp; fairly done.</p>

          <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> has not written to me about the Busts<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had sat for a bust in October 1813. The sculptor was James Smith (1775&#8211;1815).</note> &#8211; (for he has to
                    look after them) but I conceive that the reason why nothing has been heard concerning them is that the winter set in so unusually
                    soon, &amp; has continued with such unusual severity, &#8211; frost agreeing as ill with this &lt;kind of&gt; plaister work as with
                    masonry.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am exceedingly glad to hear that the Brazil ship arrived safe, &#8211; the business wore an ugly aspect &amp; must have
                    added very much to those <del>disquieting</del> causes of disquietude by which you have so long been harrassed. Most happy should
                    I be to learn that Worthingtons<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Worthington (dates unknown) was May&#8217;s business

        <p rend="indent1"> I have had two or three letters from my brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref>, the contents
                    of which you may probably have heard from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref>. Their complection is very
                    bad, &#8211; <del>nonetheless</del> he is not married, &#8211; &amp; this discovery renders it impracticable to get him a respectable
                    engagement in his own wretched profession, &#8211; as I could not recommend him under these circumstances to a regular theatre, &#8211; the
                    character of the women being very properly considered of importance in all country theatres. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> therefore, as the only remaining alternative, has written to Spain to procure
                    him a commission in the Spanish service, &amp; the answer may be expected in a week or two from this time. In my own mind I am
                    almost certain that the result of this attempt will be the same as it has been in all the former instances; it ought however to be
                    made, however hopeless I may <del>think it</del> consider it. </p>
