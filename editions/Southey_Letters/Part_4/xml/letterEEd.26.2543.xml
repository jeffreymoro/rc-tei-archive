                    to your last letter. That letter <del>gave me xxxxx xxxxxx</del> affected me much, &#8211; for I well know how much it must cost you to
                    leave so delightful a habitation as that at Richmond. But you have the satisfaction of knowing that you are acting well, &amp;
                    this brings with it the peace &#8220;which passeth all understanding&#8221;,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    additional enjoyment. I have been looking also for some selfish reasons to reconcile myself to the thoughts of this removal: &#8211; I
                    shall see more of you when I visit London, &#8211; &amp; perhaps when you have no longer so sweet a summer residence, you &amp; <ref target="people.html#MaySusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> May</ref> will resolve upon making us a summers visit. I long to show
                    you this country; &amp; am old enough to feel, when calling to mind the changes &amp; chances of human life, that the sooner I
                    show it you the better.</p>

                    be made with tolerable regularity, once a quarter, leaving always the quarters which they are behind-hand as a sort of
                        post-obit.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s salary as Poet Laureate was paid by the Lord Chamberlain&#8217;s

                        appointment was deemed to have taken effect immediately, his first quarter&#8217;s payment started on 12 August.</note>

                    to which the Author was eye-witness, &amp; which of course is now placed beyond all possibility of doubt. The poisoning story he
                    cannot establish in the same manner, but what he says tends to establish it. This last was a gratuitous crime in Buonaparte, for
                    there is reason enough to conclude that if he had not thus disposed of the sick, his troops would have abandoned them.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> When Bonaparte retreated from Jaffa on 27 May 1799, he ordered that French troops who had been

                    take interest enough in employments of this kind, &amp; should like them well were it not for the consciousness that I might be

        <p rend="indent1"> I am heartily glad of the peace with America, tho not pleased with the terms.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ratification in February 1815 of the Treaty of Ghent (24 December 1814), brought an end to the war between
                        Britain and the United States. However, it left a number of issues that had sparked the conflict unresolved. America did not
                        accept Britain&#8217;s right to impress British sailors on American ships; Britain was not willing to give American sailors access
                        to the Newfoundland fisheries. Southey feared this might alienate New England, which had largely opposed the war with
                        Britain.</note> For our own sake I could have wished a distinct recognition of our naval rights, &amp; I would not have
                    injured the New-England states by <del>depriving</del> &lt;excluding&gt; them from the fishery: this gratifies Maddison,<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Madison (1751&#8211;1836), President of the United States of America 1809&#8211;1817.</note>
                    &amp; makes them our enemies: they (a brave, active, &amp; enterprizing people) will naturally look to recover by war, what they
                    have lost by war. In my view the conquest of Canada by Wolfe<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Wolfe (1727&#8211;1759;
                            <title>DNB</title>), responsible for the decisive victory in 1759 that led to the British conquest of Quebec from
                        France.</note> will prove no eventual advantage to G Britain: while the colonies were ours it was a debateable ground with
                    France, &amp; now it will always be a vulnerable part of the <del>emp</del> British dominions, &#8211; till it becomes independent
                    itself. Had the war with America continued I think France would have recovered it. The French are of all nations the most
                    national; &#8211; the English I fear of all nations the least so.</p>
