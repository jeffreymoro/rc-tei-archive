                    we are all heartily glad the affair is ended.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Fricker was accused of an assault on
                        a young woman in Bristol; see Southey to Charles Danvers, 7 October 1812, Letter 2154. But the matter seems to have been
                        dropped. Southey certainly believed in George&#8217;s innocence.</note>

                    nothing of the men who have been chosen, but am very glad that Romilly has been unsuccessful, not merely because of his general
                    politics, which would assuredly <del>xxx to</del> tend to make this country a province of France, as a fit punishment &amp;

                        defeated at Bristol in the general election of 1812. The successful candidates were the Tory merchant, Richard Hart Davis
                        (1766&#8211;1842; MP for Bristol 1812&#8211;1831) and the Whig coal and iron magnate, Edward Protheroe I (1775&#8211;1856; MP for Bristol

                    those who understand any thing of the nature of man &amp; society despise the pseudo-philosophy from which they spring. Of all
                    absurdities never was there a grosser than to suppose it possible that you can uniformly fit the Law to the offence.</p>
