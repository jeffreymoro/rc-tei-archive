        <p rend="indent1"> Our intimacy I think entitles me to <del>claim</del> feel a little uncomfortable when you are silent longer than
                    you ought to be. If you were as strong as a horse, you might be as dumb as Sir Equus for three months without one objurgatory hint
                    on my part, &#8211; but till you are so I humbly conceive that, under favour of the <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Chancellor
                        of the Exchequer</ref>, I might more frequently be favoured with a Bulletin.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was very much obliged to <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> for the Gazette.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably a copy of the government publication, the <title>London Gazette</title>.</note> Will you
                    ask him if he has seen <ref target="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Kosters</ref> pamphlett upon Bullion.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Theodore Koster, <title>A Short Statement of the Trade in Gold Bullion: Shewing the True Causes of the
                            General Scarcity and Consequent High Price on that Precious Metal: Also Demonstrating that the Notes of the Bank of
                            England are Not Depreciated</title> (1810). It went into a second edition in 1811, and Koster followed this with
                            <title>Further Observations on Bullion and Bank Notes</title> (1811).</note> An utter inability to feel the slightest
                    interest in such subjects has made me contentedly suppose in myself a natural incapacity for understanding them &#8211; that is, &#8211; that
                    just as I have no ear for music, so I have no head for finance, statistics &amp;c &amp;c &#8211; This being premised, <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> will not suppose that I place much confidence in any opinion which I may
                    have happened to form upon the bullion question. &#8211; It does however appear to me that <ref target="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Koster</ref> has made a discovery in political oeconomy. He argues that as the value of gold depends, like that of all other
                    things, upon the supply &amp; the consumption, there is an absurdity in fixing a standard price for it, &amp; that the whole evil
                    has been occasioned by this blunder. It has not produced that evil sooner because the supply &amp; the consumption formerly
                    balanced each other, &#8211; of late years the supply from Brazil has totally ceased, &#8211; &amp; the consumption has been yearly increasing
                    in a prodigious proportion. &#8211; The result is that a maximum ought no more to be fixed for gold than for any other commodity. &#8211; The
                    pamphlett may be read in an hour, &amp; I should be very glad to know what <ref target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> thinks of <del>this</del> it. If <ref target="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Koster</ref> be right, all the
                    other disputants are in the wrong &amp; the remedy is easy, &amp; the sooner the principle is known when it could be made
                    effective the better. If he is wrong, I wish to know where his error lies, lest I should blunder about in when the subject comes
                    in my way, as it will do in the next years Annals.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not deal with the bullion
