                    impossible to decide upon the truth or falsehood of <del>thei</del> any particular point of evidence, except by some collateral
                    chance. But luckily they both afford a sort of measurement for themselves. Both deal in providences judgements &amp; miracles
                    displayed upon the occasion: now all these are lies sans doubt, &amp; therefore we have only to see which side has the most of
                    them to decide which is the greatest liar. In this the Franciscans have beat the Jesuits hollow. It is therefore fair to give the
                    most credit to the Jesuits.</p>
