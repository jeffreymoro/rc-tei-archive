                        Southey&#8217;s first official poem as Poet Laureate was extremely controversial and much altered prior to publication. Five stanzas were considered by Croker and Rickman to be inflammatory. Southey bowed to pressure and deleted them from the
                        version published as <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> in a quarto of 30 pages on 1 January 1814. He incorporated the deleted stanzas
                        into an &#8216;Ode Written During the Negotiations with Bonaparte&#8217;, published in the <title>Courier</title>, 3 February 1814.</note>
