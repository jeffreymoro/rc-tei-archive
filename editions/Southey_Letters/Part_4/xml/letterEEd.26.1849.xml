                            Institutions of the British Empire</title> (1810). It was sent to Southey for review. His article was deemed by Gifford to
                        be &#8216;perfectly incorrect and dangerous&#8217; with the result that the version published in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 5
                        (May 1811), 403&#8211;457, was much altered by <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>, in consultation with Gifford and <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>; see <ref type="l" target="/reference/qr/index/10.html">Jonathan Cutmore, <title>The Quarterly Review Archive</title>
            </ref>.</note> &#8211; I should like also in the compass of about two pages to
                    counteract the mischief which such a rascally <del>x</del> work as Lewis Goldsmiths is calculated, &amp; as I believe <hi rend="ital">designed</hi> to do, by its absurd &amp; palpable falshoods. &#8211;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lewis

                        argued that Britain could never make a secure peace with Napoleon. Goldsmith&#8217;s narrative combined accurate information with
                        wild allegations, including atrocity stories and tales of sexual misconduct. It was a bestseller, going into 6 editions by
                        1811.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> My history of Brazil is very favourably, very kindly, &amp; very well reviewed.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title> had been published by Longman in 1810. The remainder
                    of this paragraph is a response to the appraisal (by <ref target="people.html#HeberReginald">Reginald Heber</ref>) published in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4
                        (November 1810), 454&#8211;474 (esp. 472; 474). Southey&#8217;s unusual words appeared at the following points in the
                            <title>History</title>: &#8216;coronal&#8217;, p. 187; &#8216;tambour&#8217;, pp. 89, 121; &#8216;napery&#8217;, p. 381; &#8216;poitrals&#8217;, p. 122; &#8216;broads&#8217;, p. 133;
                    &#8216;plumery&#8217;, pp. 116, 120, 140; Southey inadvertently referred to Dutch missionaries in Brazil as Lutherans rather than Calvinists
                    on p. 567; the note on Araboutan as the Tupi word for the Brazil-nut tree is p. 626.</note> &#8211; With regard
                    to the want of generalization, &amp; of retrospective views this is a charge to which I have rendered myself liable by publishing
                    the work in portions. The fit time for a retrospect is at the close of the Dutch war,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                        end of the Dutch-Portuguese war in 1654. This was dealt with in volume 2 of the <title>History of Brazil</title>, published in

                    as unusual, in every instance except one I think they can be justified. <hi rend="ital">coronet</hi> is a word appropriate to

                    any word except <hi rend="ital">coronal</hi> by which it can <del>appro</del> properly be called. I use tambour instead of drum,
                    because drum represents to us a specific musical instrument in daily use, &#8211; altogether different from any among the savages. I use
                    napery instead of napkins &amp; table-cloths because it is a comprehensive word expressing both. Poitrals because exclusively
                    appropriated to <hi rend="ital">horse</hi> armour, &#8211; a breast-plate belonging to a man. The word <hi rend="ital">Broad</hi> in the
                    sense which I have used it, is in common use in Norfolk, &amp; will I have no doubt be found in the maps of that country: it is
                    that species of lake which is formed by a <del>great</del> river <del>xxxxxx</del> on its course, &#8211; differing from lake &amp; from
                    lagoon. <del>&amp; required for</del> We must go to provincialisms when we want to designate natural objects with precision, &#8211; for
                        <del>upon</del> in such things the dialect of the metropolis is necessarily deficient. <hi rend="ital">Plumery</hi> I allow
                    has no advantage over feathers except that I like it better in its place. &#8211; The cause of my misuse of the word Lutheranism is
                    rightly guessed at &#8211; I fell into the obvious error from having the word Luteranos constantly before my eyes. &#8211; Araboutan is not as
                    the reviewer thinks the native name of the country, which was too extensive &amp; in too wild a state to have a general name, &#8211;
                    but of the Brazil-tree.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If I understand my own manner of writing, the style always grows out of the subject. I have no other rule or system
                    than that of always expressing myself 1. as perspicuously as possible. 2 as impressively as possible. 3 &#8211; as concisely as
                    possible. Excuse me for having intruded upon you with this subject. &amp; receive it as a proof of the attention with which I am
                    at all willing to listen <del>xx</del> to criticism when it comes in a friendly tone.</p>
