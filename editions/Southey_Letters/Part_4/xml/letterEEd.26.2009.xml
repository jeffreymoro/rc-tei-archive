        <p rend="indent1"> I have a letter from <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B.</ref> this evening. Concerning
                    the little essay now in the Press, it will be enough to say, that I shall without the smallest reluctance suppress any thing which
                    may be thought needlessly or offensively severe.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>The Origin, Nature and
                            Object, of the New System of Education</title> (1812) was an expansion of his advocacy of Bell in <title>Quarterly
                            Review</title>, 6 (August 1811), 264&#8211;304. Southey&#8217;s attacks on Brougham, Jeffrey and others were moderated before
                        publication. Bell had written to Southey on 26 December 1811 expressing concern that his case would be damaged if Southey
                        employed &#8216;any degree of acrimony and severity of expression&#8217;. Instead he urged him to write in &#8216;the least offensive and most
                        conciliatory style&#8217;; see Southey, Caroline Southey and Charles Cuthbert Southey, <title>The Life of the Rev. Andrew
                            Bell</title>, 3 vols (London, 1844), II, p. 650. For Southey&#8217;s reply to this; see Southey to Andrew Bell, 30
                        December 1811, Letter 2008.</note> Concerning the Book of the Church<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        1997.</note> I feel a strong conviction that I could not be better employed than in getting it ready with the least possible
                    delay. &#8211; It will not occupy me much longer than a long article for the Review, &#8211; dispense with me therefore for the next number,
                    &amp; I will forthwith set apart a portion of the day for this really important object. Have the goodness to procure for
