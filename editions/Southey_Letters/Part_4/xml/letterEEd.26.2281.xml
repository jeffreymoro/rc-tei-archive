                        to be read at the opening night of the rebuilt Drury Lane Theatre. One hundred and twelve entries were submitted, but none of
                        these were felt to be acceptable, so instead an ode was commissioned from Byron. In response, the humourists Horace
                        (1779&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>) and James Smith (1775&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>) published an anonymous collection of parodies
                        that purported to be a selection of the rejected poems. <title>Rejected Addresses, or, The New Theatrum Poetarum</title>
                        (1812) was a hit, going into 17 editions by 1819.</note> I liked <ref target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> best;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Cui Bono&#8217;, <title>Rejected Addresses, or, The New Theatrum Poetarum</title> (London,
