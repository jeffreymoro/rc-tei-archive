        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your early application<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Wynn was canvassing on Southey&#8217;s
                        behalf for the post of Historiographer Royal, vacated on the death of Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>) on 23 May
                    1812. The campaign was unsuccessful and the post went to one of Southey&#8217;s particular b&#234;tes noires, James Stanier Clarke (c.
                        1765&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>).</note> thro <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>, &#8211; I should else have thought the
                    thing had been lost for want of applying in time. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref> has just sent me
                    a note of <ref target="people.html#HertfordLord">Lord Hertfords</ref> saying it was disposed of before his application arrived. &#8211;
                    All that can now be done is to find out some good in the disappointment, &#8211; &amp; it is some good to feel <del>xxxxxxxxxxxxx</del>
                    sure of never being disappointed again. For <del>xxx</del> I have now neither expectation, hope, <del>xx</del> &lt;or&gt; I
                    believe I may add, possibility of <del>ever</del> any thing beyond what the grey goose quill may procure. In this case I had good
                    interest, as well as a fair claim.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In speaking of the <del>xxx</del> evils to be dreaded in consequence of <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Percevals</ref> death I looked forward to <del>what appears to me</del> a change of system with respect to the Peninsula, &#8211;
                    concessions to America, &amp; concessions to the Catholics. With regard to the first point, &#8211; I have more fears at this moment for
                    G Britain than for Spain. As to America it is not all the concessions <del>not</del> on our part, nor all the sufferance
                    imaginable which can conciliate a <del>party</del> &lt;Governments&gt; leagued with France &amp; bribed with the promise of the
                    spoils of Spain. America will go to war with us at last whenever she can no longer injure us as effectually by measures short of
                    hostility &amp; whenever she can muster up courage enough for it &#8211; which submission on our part will be the best means of giving
                    her, &#8211; disputes of this kind &#8211; <hi rend="ital">se termineront toujours a une guerre non seulement parce que l&#8217;homme prudent se
                        lasse a souffrir, mais aussi parce que l&#8217;insolent se lasse d&#8217;etre souffert</hi>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                            The French translates as &#8216;[it] will always end in a war, not only because the prudent man grows weary of suffering, but
                            because the insolent man tires of being suffered&#8217;: Paola Sarpi (1552&#8211;1623) &#8216;Supplement de l&#8217;Histoire des Uscoques&#8217;, probably encountered by Southey in
                        Abraham Nicolas Amelot de la Houssaye (1634&#8211;1706), <title>Histoire du Gouvernment de Venise</title> 3 vols (1768), III, p.
                        229. This book was no. 42 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Southey approved of Sarpi as a determined opponent of
                        papal authority in Venice.</note> The observation is Father Paul&#8217;s.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Upon the effects of Catholic concessions in Ireland I shall endeavour to explain my own notions in reply to <ref target="people.html#Adderley">Adderley</ref>, &amp; will enclose the letter to you. Its effects in England will be to hasten
                    on that downfall of the Establishment which so many causes are at this time operating to bring about. You know I am neither a
                    bigot, nor a hypocrite &#8211; I never conceal my dissent from the Church upon some very material points, &#8211; still I regard it as the

                    Christian, &#8211; &amp; it is more than probable that many of his followers are of the same no-faith. If a measure were proposed which

        <p rend="indent1"> The sale of the tythes is such a measure. It would be popular beyond a doubt. Whatever Minister should propose it
                    would have the farmers with him, &amp; the country gentlemen, &#8211; he would have the Dissenters, &amp; the <del>xxxxxxxx</del>

                    will carry on the war triumphantly, careless of the cost. He is right in this, &amp; if he took the money from the sinking fund,
                    or raised it by a hearth tax, or a graduated poll-tax I would applaud him. But the tythes offer a <del>recourse xxx</del> readier
                    resource, &#8211; because there would <del>be only the party who are to</del> be none to stand up in their defence except the party to

                    to the lowest bidder: &#8211; a prospect which will reconcile the Saints to the new Reformation.</p>
