                        Quincey</ref>, but I wish you would sometimes let me hear <hi rend="ital">from</hi> you. There was a time when scarcely a day
                    past without my seeing you, &amp; in all that time I do not remember that there ever was a passing cloud of coolness between us.
                    The feeling I am sure continues. Do not then let us so entirely be seperated by distance, which in case of correspondence, may
                    almost be considered as a mere abstraction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> How has your attack in the spring left you?<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Earlier in 1814 Cottle had been
                        &#8216;afflicted with the bursting of a blood vessel, occasioned, probably, by present agitations of mind, which reduced &#8230; [him] to
                        the point of death&#8217;, <title>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</title> (London, 1847), p, 379; see
                        also Southey to Joseph Cottle, 13 May 1814, Letter 2420.</note> Disease has no form more alarming in appearance, but &lt;there
                        are&gt;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &lt;there are&gt;: in another hand, probably Cottle&#8217;s.</note> many which are
                    more perilous in reality. You must be careful during the winter not to expose yourself to frosty air, &amp; would do well to
                    regulate the temperature of your apartments as nearly as possible to an equable heat. There is a stove by which this may be done
                    with little trouble, &#8211; &amp; which at once heats &amp; ventilates a house.</p>

            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> It has been printed about two months, but he delays its
                    publication till November, for reasons of which he must needs be the best judge. I am neither sanguine about its early, nor
                    doubtful concerning its ultimate acceptation in the world. The passion is in a deeper tone than in any of my former works; I call
                    it a tragic poem for this reason, &amp; also that the reader may not expect the same busy &amp; compleated action which the term
                    heroic might <del>xxxx</del> seem to promise. The subject has the disadvantage of belonging to an age of which little or no
                    costume has been preserved. I was therefore cut off from all adornments of this kind, &amp; <del>xxxx</del> had little left me to
                    relieve the stronger parts but description the best of which is from the life.</p>
