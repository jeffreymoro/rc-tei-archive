The letter had been sent by Wellington to Henry, 3rd Earl Bathurst
                        (1762&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies.</note> He says to Ld Bathurst that tho&#8217;
                    perfectly aware of Buonapartes plan, he could not in the first instance prevent it. Buonaparte means, he says, to attack in mass
                    &amp; force thro my lines. As he has to choose his point I cannot unfurnish any part of them, &#8211; &amp; they are extensive: the
                    consequence probably will be that in spite of all endeavours he will succeed. Having done this his course will be correctly
                    ascertained, &amp; I think that then I can undertake to answer for him. &#8211; This I received from <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> as a piece of private information before the news of the victory arrived.
                    When Buonaparte finds it impossible to make head in the field I am afraid he will disappear, &#8211; <del>xxx</del> &amp; tho he may not
                    reappear to do more mischief, it would be a provoking catastrophe if he were to steal out of life in obscurity. There seems much
                    likelihood that Paris may be destroyed in the struggle; it deserves to suffer above all other cities in the world, &amp; if such
                    be the event I certainly shall not affect to conceal my satisfaction.</p>
