                        Paraguay and owned copies of his <title>Essais sur l&#8217;Histoire Naturelle des Quadrupedes de la Province du Paraguay</title>
                        (1801) and <title>Voyages dans l&#8217;Amerique Meridionale depuis 1781, jusqu&#8217; en 1801</title> (1809), nos 89 and 90 in the sale
                        catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. The book requested by Hill is the <title>Voyages</title>.</note> which I have had this year
                    &amp; half, &#8211; it is quoted in the notes to my first volume,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    important book.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8211; The Arte de Furtar is manifestly written by an Alentejo man, probably by an inhabitant of Villa Vi&#231;osa. There is
                    such plain proof of this that I cannot conceive how it should ever have been given to Vieyra.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Arte de Furtar</title> (1652). Now attributed to the Jesuit Manuel de Costa (1601&#8211;1667), but at this time thought to be
                        by Vieira. Southey&#8217;s copy was no. 3772 in the sale catalogue of his library. De Costa was from Alentejo.</note>

                    for it those works by which I subsist, &#8211; for there is no subsisting by any other works than those which are of temporary interest.

                        Southey is describing events in the mid to late seventeenth-century, including the defeat of the Dutch in 1654, the foundation
                        of the Jesuit Reductions and their conflict with slave-raiders from Sao Paulo in the 1620s&#8211;1670s. This material filled volume
