                        horse race meeting at Newcastle, in the last week of April, or first week May.</note> &#8211; which perhaps you may not know is the
                    great exhibition of Cock fighting, &amp; but for this I should probably have delayed my visit till the autumn, when <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, who was full loth to leave the Lakes at this season, would not have been ashore to
                    go with me. He meets with a certain <ref target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Miss Castle</ref>, &#8211; sits down to beseige that Castle

                    such a respect for her that they settled upon her an annuity of 100&#163;. I cannot tell whether this settlement was for life or if it
                    were merely at pleasure, &amp; therefore likely to cease now &#8211; But I rather guess that she has this, &#8211; &amp; that she

                    so imprudent as they appear. &#8211; She is a very interesting woman &#8211; about 30 &#8211; or verging toward it, &#8211; what little I saw of her
                    pleased me very much indeed.</p>
