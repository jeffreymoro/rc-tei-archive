                    present rents a farm not very far from you, being on the edge of Radnorshire, near Kington: &#8211; he is an illiterate man, but a very

                    guess, to be assisted with his cousins skill &amp; capital, if he stands in need of either. &#8211; So much for this matter, &#8211; of which
                    I shall perhaps hear more speedily, as I am in daily expectation of seeing some of the Wordsworths.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Hutchinson did view the farm but found it unsuitable; see Southey to Mary Matilda Betham, 30 October 1811,
                        Letter 1974. In the event he did succeed in helping Landor find a tenant, Charles Betham (b. 1779). The consequences were
                        disastrous. Betham and Landor were soon in dispute over the rent and the use of the land. The final straw was when Betham&#8217;s
                        brother, Frederick (b. 1789/1790), dug up trees Landor had planted. Landor denounced Frederick in a handbill that he
                        personally posted up in Monmouth during the assizes. Betham sued for libel, Landor lost and had to pay &#163;100 in damages. In May
                        1814 Landor went abroad.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> You would have had a book of Pelayo<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The early incarnation of
                            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> ere this, had not <ref target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref> very unconsciously prevented me. He happens like myself to rise about seven, &amp; found his way into my library,
                    as early as I did. Now poetry is the only thing which I cannot compose if any person be present, &#8211; because <del>my</del> voice,
                    gesture &amp; eyes require a freedom, which the sense of any human presence would restrain. What has been written since my return,
                    if it be not good deceives me grievously, for I never produced any thing under the influence of deeper feeling.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I quarrel with our climate because I like the fruits of the South, &amp; feel a positive pleasure in breathing the
                    pure air of Portugal. Its moral effects however are in the main, as you say. Its physical ones very grievous to the poor, &#8211; but
                    that is the fault of our imperfect state of society, &#8211; &amp; in spite of all the evils which we have seen in our times, &amp;
                    still see, &#8211; there never was any age <del>in</del> which held out to us such hopes for poor humanity. I am a good hoper, &amp; am
                    doing my utmost to persuade the ministry &amp; the public to agree with me. My history of 1809<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title> (1811).</note> is full of &lt;this&gt; spirit, &#8211; I am
                    told that the Edinburgh Review in a note recommends it for prosecution, as a libel upon that white-livered Whitbread.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The radical MP Samuel Whitbread (1764&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>). The threat of parliamentary
                        action was the result of a long aside in the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 18 (August 1811), 420&#8211;423n, which had questioned
                        whether the &#8216;virulent personal abuse &#8230; levelled at the most respectable members of the Legislature&#8217; in the <title>Edinburgh
                            Annual Register</title> was in breach of Parliamentary privilege and hinted that action against the author and publishers
                        might be taken. In the event, the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>&#8217;s suggestion was not acted on.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> Wakefield, who is about a statistic account of Ireland has been here.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                    philanthropist, land agent and writer on political economy, Edward Wakefield&#8217;s (1774&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>) <title>Ireland,

                    when a Methodist gets up to preach to the people, the Catholic priest comes with a horsewhip &amp; lays about him till he puts the
                    congregation to flight. This he has twice been an eye witness of. The Bishop of Meath<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Thomas Lewis O&#8217;Beirne (1747&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Meath 1798&#8211;1823. The son of a County Longford farmer, he had
                        been educated for the Catholic priesthood, but converted to Protestantism and became a Church of Ireland clergyman. He had
                        been a well-known Whig, but by 1811 he was increasingly conservative and a defender of the Church of Ireland.</note> also who
                    is lodging here, tells me that when a school had been established in his neighbourhood upon <ref target="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Lancasters</ref> sneaking system of <del>xxxxxxxx all do</del> teaching no peculiar
                    religion, the Priest used to way lay the children with the horse whip, &amp; thus literally <del>prevented</del> &lt;kept&gt; the
                    little catholicks <del>by</del> away by main force, when he could not operate upon the minds of their parents. The system of
                    priest-tyranny is carried to its utmost height in that country, &#8211; &amp; these are the fellows who clamour for Emancipation!</p>
