                    &amp; I am sure I have reason to do so now, having compleated a poem of 7000
                    lines. The press is now waiting for the books in your hands,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. MS drafts of <title>Roderick</title>

                    longer than is necessary. This is the first thing which I have to say. The next
                    is concerning the Dedication. You know very well that the thought of addressing
                    it to the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince</ref>
                    would never have entered my head, had it not seemed proper that as a Poet I
                    should <del>pay</del> offer him some mark of respect &amp; this has been
                    sufficiently done by beöding him.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey had considered dedicating <title>Roderick, the Last of the
                            Goths</title> (1814) to the Prince Regent, and sent Bedford a draft
                        dedication; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, [30 April–1 May 1814],
                        Letter 2412. However, he had changed his mind after publishing an ‘Ode to
                        His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
                        &amp; Ireland’, III and IV; <title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal
                            Highness The Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty The Emperor of Russia,

                        [5]–12.</note> Any thing farther would be doing too much, &amp; you know me
                    well enough to be certain that I should rather err on the other side. Roderick
                    therefore will go into the world with a dedication much more accordant to my
                    feelings. It is in Latin because a man may promise himself immortality with a
                    better grace in that language than he can do in English, but I was never expert
                    in Latin composition, &amp; for twenty years have entirely disused it,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. since Southey left Balliol College,
                        Oxford in 1794.</note> so that I may very &lt;well&gt; distrust myself now
                    in attempting that wherein I should at no time have felt confident. However a
                    man in his senses cannot <del>xxxxxxxx</del> be drownd in shallow water, &amp;
