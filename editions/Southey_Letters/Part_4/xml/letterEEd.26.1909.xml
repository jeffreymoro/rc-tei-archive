                    of the <ref target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">Imperials</ref> .
                    The same post brought me one from my good <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> , telling me that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Mr T. Southey</ref> was dead &amp;
                    had left part of his property to an acquaintance at Bristol,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably William Oliver (1775&#8211;1830) of Hope
                        Corner, Taunton.</note> the rest to his man Tom.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey&#8217;s servant, Tom (dates and surname
                        unknown).</note> For my own part &amp; my brothers<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom Southey</ref>

                            Southey</ref>.</note> I am neither surprised nor grieved, &#8211; but it vexes
                    me to think that he should have behaved so unnaturally to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">his sister</ref> , who is now
                    far advanced in years, &amp; had only 400 &#163;. This wretched man turned her out of
                    doors about two years ago, merely because she could not conceal that she thought
                    her nephews rather more worthy subjects than the footboy Tom. You know me well
                    enough to believe that as to the usage which I myself have received I care for
                    just as little as I have deserved it. A light heart &amp; a thin pair of &#8211;
                    pantaloons, &#8211; you know is the old song upon such occasions.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A popular saying about the need to be
                        cheerful, taken from a traditional song.</note> hitherto I have gone thro
                    the world well with them, &amp; by God&#8217;s blessing so I expect still shall be
                    enabled to do. &#8220;I hope God will forgive him, says my poor good <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt</ref> , &#8220;<ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John</ref>  made himself a

                     had made himself a fool to give it away.&#8221; &#8211; Tis a passage worth
                    transcribing, for it comprizes the sum of the history of two brothers &amp; of
                    40,000&#163;, &#8211; for that is the meaning of the word <hi rend="ital">trash</hi>, a

                    of whom will regard it much more than I do. &#8211; I can make nothing of the picture,
                    &#8211; it is likely to have its foundation in some piece of recent history, certainly
                    not in romance.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Not
