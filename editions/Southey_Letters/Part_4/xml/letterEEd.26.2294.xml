        <p rend="indent1"> I do not know any way so likely to lead to an accommodation of the points in dispute between myself &amp; Messrs
                        Ballantyne,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">James Ballantyne</ref>. The
                        letter concerns Southey&#8217;s dealing with the brothers over the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register 1810&#8211;1813</title>. Scott replied
                        on 19 October 1813; see H. C. Grierson (ed.), <title>The Letters of Walter Scott, 1787&#8211;1832</title>, 12, vols (London,
                        1932&#8211;1937), III, pp. 364&#8211;366.</note> as by putting you in possession of the facts. You will I am sure forgive me for thus
                    trespassing on your good nature, &amp; at least give me your advice if you are not able to arbitrate between us. I will state the
                    circumstances as briefly &amp; clearly as possible.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Aug 11. 1810 <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</ref> wrote to me in these words &#8220;Now that
                    the book<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810).</note> has succeeded &amp; that so much of its success is
                    attributable to you, I am empowered by the literary proprietors here (&amp; heartily concur myself) to offer you 1/12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> share, which will be vacated by the concern on your account. The outlay on each 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                    has been 209&#163; the profit on these two volumes, &#163; 80; being about 40 p cent on the outlay. We sell the books of the literary
                    sharers, &amp; give them our bill at a year for their profit immediately. The outlay on the first volume, which is stock, goes on
                    towards the conduct of the second; &amp; when any proprietor would retire, his share is purchased by the remaining parties at the
                    original &#163; 209.&#8221;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8211; Aug 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. following, <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</ref> wrote
                    thus, &#8220;We have agreed to sell for them the shares of the other literary proprietors, &amp; to grant them a bill for the profits
                    arising, at twelve months after the date of the publication of each volume; the profits to be calculated on the difference arising
                    betwixt the sum laid out for the volume, &amp; the value at what is technically called Trade-price, with the deduction of 10 p
                    cent for trouble &amp; risk. The profits upon each twelfth so calculated of the Register for 1808 amounts to &#163;80, for which sum,
                    if it is agreable to you that we shall sell your proportion of the books, we shall presently grant you our bill.&#8221;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> These were the <del>terms upon</del> &lt;offers by&gt; which I &lt;was induced to&gt; become a proprietor of the
                    Register. &#8211; But in the terms which were after drawn up, an important alteration was introduced. It was there thus expressed: &#8220;on a
                    proprietor signifying a wish to retire, his <del>xxxx</del> share must be offered to the other proprietors in the first instance,
                    at the original cost price of &#163; 209.&#8221; &#8211; By not having adverted to this alteration at the times I perceive that I have <del>xxx
                        xxx</del> lost all right of requiring that my share should be repurchased.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I committed a farther oversight in not calling upon <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                        John Ballantyne</ref> for the stipulated Bill at 12 months date upon the publication of each volume. This neglect however in
                    no degree invalidates my right. He now after repeated evasions &amp; delays has avowed his intention of witholding from me monies
                    due for <del>the fourth history</del> my contributions to the fourth volume,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813).</note> upon the plea that there has been a loss upon my twelfth
                    share. But I maintain that my agreement involves no risk on my part whatever: that the share was proposed to me not as a
                    speculation but as a <hi rend="ital">bonus</hi>, or recompense: that <del>it</del> he told me not what the profits <hi rend="ital">might be</hi>, but what they <hi rend="ital">actually were</hi>; that he ought to have given me his bill for those profits at
                    the times appointed by himself, &#8211; that if those bills had been given, payment could not have been resisted upon the plea of stock
                    in hand, &amp; that I am morally &amp; legally entitled to &#163;80 profits upon the first volume, as clearly as if I had his note for
                    the sum, &amp; that <del>x</del> tho I am content to look for no profit upon the second &amp; third volumes owing to their
                    increased bulk <del>x</del> I am not &amp; cannot be liable to any loss upon them, consequent upon want of sale.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> More than a week before <del>I saw</del> you were at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> I had written
                    to <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</ref>, &amp; desired his answer might be directed here.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s letter to Ballantyne seems not to have survived. For Scott&#8217;s visit to Keswick, see
                        Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 15 August 1813, Letter 2290.</note> He has not written, &amp; I know not how much longer
                    he intends to shuffle off the settlement: for I will <del>xx</del> not conceal from you that from every quarter I hear equally
                    well of <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">his brother</ref>, &amp; ill of him. I have brought with me the conclusion of
                    the fourth volume which has been finished many weeks, but which I shall not part with till the dispute be accommodated. &#8211; My share
                    is plainly worth nothing, &#8211; this loss I must no doubt submit to, &amp; it is quite sufficient. But as long as I hold that share I
                    hold <del>no</del> myself not liable to any loss upon it; &amp; shall require upon the publication of each volume a bill at twelve
                    months date for the profits.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I earnestly hope you may be able to make <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">Mr James Ballantyne</ref> see
                    the propriety of coming to an amicable termination of this unpleasant business. Upon my first representation of the matter to him,
                    he saw it just as I expected an honourable man would; &amp; tho his brother has signed &lt;for <hi rend="ital">him</hi> &amp; for
                    himself&gt; the last letter which I received, &amp; in which he first explicitly states what he had for some months (or indeed
                    years) <del>xxxxxx off</del> contrived to <del>xx</del> evade avowing. I verily believe that if he will but look into the affair,
                    he will come to a very different conclusion from that to which his brother has come for him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8211; A word or two of other things. &#8211; you took me by surprize at Keswick when my house had not recovered the
