                        Southey had asked for the proofs of his account of the Battle in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1809</title>, 2.1
                        (1811), 364&#8211;379 to be sent to Tom Southey for comment.</note> business I had spoken of in the former part of the chapter, &#8211;
                    yet had your letter reached me in time, &#8211; rather &#8211; had that proof been sent you as it ought to have been, I should have added
                        <del>something</del> a remark which ought not to have been overlooked by me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The proposed object of Parl: Reform is, as far as possible, to make all elections popular, like those of
                    Westminster &amp; Middlesex.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Westminster had c. 12,000 electors and Middlesex c. 6,000,
                        making them two of the largest constituencies in England and the site of regular, intensely-fought contests. Athens and
                        Carthage both had republican forms of government, which included some role for popularly-elected assemblies, at the height of
                        their power.</note> The effect of this would be that the mob would then be the electors, would elect none but those who
                    engaged to vote as they were instructed by their constituents, &#8211; &amp; this leads to direct &amp; immediate anarchy, ending in the
                    destruction of the state as at Athens &amp; Carthage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is public opinion that requires reformation &#8211; not Parliament. Our H. of Commons is not a legislative body
                    composed of men who assemble with no other object than to take measures for the public good, &#8211; there is always a party there whose
                    avowed &amp; only business is to thwart the Government in all its measures &amp; impede it by every possible means. It is speaking

                    it becomes so sometimes by mismanagement. The case of the D of York<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809, Prince
                        Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>), had been forced to resign as commander-in-chief of the
                        British army in the wake of allegations that he had profited from office trafficking. After a lengthy investigation, the
                        charges were found to be unproven. It had, however, become apparent that his former mistress Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852;
                            <title>DNB</title>) had received money from individuals keen for her to use her influence with the Duke, and that the Duke
                        himself had known of her actions. For Southey&#8217;s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
                        109&#8211;301.</note> was an instance of such mismanagement. Still even in that case public opinion triumphed, &amp; I believe that
                    public opinion has attained in England its maximum of power compatible with the purpose of government. In England Government can
                    never be tyrannical except when it acts with the popular cry in its favour. This was the case in the dancing days of
