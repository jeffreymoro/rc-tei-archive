          <salute>Dear Turner,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for your little volume,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Turner had possibly sent Southey a
                        manuscript of his unpublished poems.</note> which I have read with pleasure, as the faithful transcript of a good man&#8217;s mind.
                    It contains ample proof that you possess the perceptions of a poet; and if the diction in which they are clothed has sometimes its
                    defects, it is because you have been too laboriously employed in more dignified pursuits to have had leisure for maturing the
                    mechanical part of an art which, of all other trades or professions, requires the longest apprenticeship.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What I have written upon the Missionaries I well knew would accord with your feelings and opinions.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s accounts of the Baptist Missionary Society, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 1
                        (February 1809), 193&#8211;226; and of Missionary Societies in the South Sea Islands, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 2 (August
                        1809), 24&#8211;61.</note> I have not yet done with the subject, meaning, so soon as my many occupations will allow, to prepare an
                    article upon the South African missions;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> This was not written. It would probably have
                        focused on the Moravians&#8217; and London Missionary Society&#8217;s efforts in the Cape of Good Hope.</note> and, perhaps, to go on at
                    intervals till I have given a view of all the existing Protestant missions; proved my own firm belief that there are but two
                    methods of extending civilisation, &#8211; conquest and conversion, &#8211; the latter the only certain one; entered fully into the
                    difficulties which oppose the reception of Christianity; and, finally, connected this subject with that of civilisation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had given <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> credit for the Austrian article,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The review of <title>Proclamation of the Archduke Charles to his Army</title> (1809);
                            <title>Declaration of War by the Emperor of Austria</title> (1809); and <title>Address of the Archduke to the German
                            Nation</title> (1809), in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 1 (May 1809), 436&#8211;455. It is now attributed to Canning, <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> and <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, with possibly
                        some assistance from the German diplomat Friedrich von Gentz (1764&#8211;1832).</note> though half suspecting that it was giving him
                    credit for too much, because there was a reference to the principles of human nature and a sense of its dignity rarely, or never,
                    to be found in a politician by trade. The Quarterly does well; but it would do far better if it was emancipated from the shackles
                    of party. It wants also some recondite learning: you should give them an account of the Welsh Archaiology;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        manuscripts for the first time. Turner had a long-standing interest in Welsh language and culture; see his <title>Vindication
                            of the Genuineness of the Antient British poems of Aneurin, Taliesin, Llywarch Hen and Merdhin with Specimens of their
                            Poems</title> (1803).</note> or, if that be too laborious, should take some of the Welshmen&#8217;s publications, Davies<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Welsh antiquary Edward Davies (1756&#8211;1831). His numerous works included <title>The

        <p rend="indent1"> You will receive the first volume of my greatest labours<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume
                        of the <title>History of Brazil</title>, published in 1810.</note> very shortly; for, after many provoking delays, it has at
                    last got out of the <ref target="people.html#PopleWilliam">printer&#8217;s</ref> hands. It is less interesting perhaps than the second

                        &#8216;The History of Portugal&#8217;. Southey did not complete or publish it.</note> but it will repay perusal, and you will find many
                    valuable hints respecting savage life. I have a poem also in the press,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> which you will wonder at and abuse. It is, in my own judgment, a successful
                    attempt at giving to rhyme the whole freedom, and more than the variety, of blank verse. But in all its structure and story it is
                    so wholly unlike anything else, that I expect to have very few admirers. This has been a sort of episode to my main employments &#8230;
                    What I am busied upon most intently is the historical part of <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne&#8217;s</ref> new
                    Annual Register.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810).</note>
                    The perfect freedom and perfect sincerity with which I am discharging this task has astonished <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref>, and I dare say he will find his account in it; for, sure I am, the
                    veriest knave will feel that it is written with honesty &#8230; This evening I have finished the siege of Zaragoza, and my pulse has not
                    yet recovered its usual regularity.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish city of Zaragoza had been besieged in
                        1808 and 1809. It fell to the French on 20 February 1809 after an outbreak of disease. For Southey&#8217;s accounts of the first and second sieges,
                            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 306&#8211;321; and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 508&#8211;527.</note> The death of Sir John Moore will conclude the volume &#8230;<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> The British commander, Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), who, after a highly controversial
                        campaign, was killed in battle at Corunna on 16 January 1809. For Southey&#8217;s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 442&#8211;459. Although he praised many of Moore&#8217;s personal qualities, Southey suggested that he was
                        not &#8216;equal to the difficulties of his situation&#8217; (458).</note>
