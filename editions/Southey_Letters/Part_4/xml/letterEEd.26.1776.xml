                        evacuate their forces from Portugal. Southey had praised it as &#8216;a work which has never been surpassed in eloquence, and to the

                    was in the strictest sense of the word impartial. An opinion prevails that <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wordsworth</ref> &amp; I are in close habits of intimacy, &#8211; &amp; the notion of a literary connection

                    at the other. It is very likely that from this supposed intimacy you may <del>hi</del> have suspected my praise of his pamphlett
                    to have proceeded from &lt;feelings of&gt; personal friendship. But the truth <del>t</del> is that this general opinion is

                    philosopher, there never has existed, &amp; I believe never will, any such intercourse between us as could in any degree induce me

                        invasion of Portugal in 1808.</note> I did the best I could without it, &#8211; still the disappointment was vexatious, tho I trust
