        <p rend="indent1"> A Northumberland man who knows your neighbours dined with me yesterday. He travels about forming Bible Societies, &#8211;
                    in which I see great good, tho I am no Bibliolater. Bates his name is, of Hallon Castle,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Thomas Bates (1775&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>), a famously combative breeder of cattle, particularly shorthorns. He leased the
                        Halton Castle estate from 1800&#8211;1818. Bates was a member of the Tindale Ward and Its Vicinity Auxiliary Society, an adjunct of
                        the British and Foreign Bible Society.</note> &#8211; I liked the cut of his jib, &amp; am only afraid he will take me for an
                    Evangelical, &#8211; tho God knows I was guilty of no hypocrisy. He wanted me to go a meeting, take the chair &amp; make a speech, &#8211;
                    honours which I begged leave to decline, &#8211; but I declared myself friendly to his object &amp; ready to become a subscriber, &amp;
                    I urged him very strongly to form a missionary society, associated with the Church-Mission, in preference, &#8211; or to any other if
                    that could not be: &#8211; he was willing enough, but I suspect that he is one of those men who cannot think of two things at once.</p>
