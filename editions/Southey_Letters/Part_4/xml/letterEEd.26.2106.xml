                        Protestant, held the post of Historiographer Royal until his death on 23 May 1812. Southey&#8217;s campaign for the post proved
                        unsuccessful and it went to one of his particular b&#234;tes noires, James Stanier Clarke (c. 1765&#8211;1834;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> The first intelligence of this was sent me by <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> who had already desired <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> to apply to the <del>xxx </del>

                        of George IV (1762&#8211;1830; Prince Regent 1811&#8211;1820, King of the United Kingdom 1820&#8211;1830; <title>DNB</title>). She was referred

        <p rend="indent1"> M. Dutens could never have made his exit at a more unlucky time. I was sure of <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Percevals</ref> good will, &amp; had the best &amp; readiest
                    access to him. <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> has <del>xxxx</del> repeatedly sent me the fairest professions, but
                    he has something else to think of at this moment supposing those professions to be as sincere as they were gratuitous. I have
                    written to him &#8211; but forwarded the letter to <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, leaving it at his discretion
                    to deliver it, or throw it into the fire, according as he may think a letter at such a time may operate. I have written to <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref> &amp; depend upon his influence, if it can be of any use, &amp; I have
                    also written to <ref target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George Beaumont</ref>, who may very likely be acquainted with <ref target="people.html#HertfordLord">Ld Hertford</ref>, &amp; who I am sure would spare no trouble to serve me. These letters all
                    went off last night. Here the business rests at present, &amp; whether I shall be appointed to that good ship the Historiographer
                    or not, Heaven knows. The salary is a nominal 400&#163; &#8211; that is 280&#163; <del>xxxx</del> after all deductions. And now having told you

                    single event could possibly have done. There is now every reason to think the Catholic question will be carried. Its effect in
                    Ireland I take to be this &#8211; that the Catholics would rise in rebellion against the Protestants if <del>x xxx</del> the
                    Emancipation (as it is called) were withheld, &#8211; &amp; that if it is granted the Protestants will soon be driven in
                    self-preservation to take arms against the Catholics: for a man must be compleatly ignorant of the spirit of the Romish Church
                        <del>if xx</del> &amp; of its history also, if he <del>xx</del> supposes that it will be content with any &lt;thing&gt; short
                    of supremacy, &amp; of exclusive supremacy. As for the Protestant Establishment in Ireland it is so truly an <hi rend="ital">Irish</hi> Protestant Establishment that I could be very well content to see Requiescat<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;rest in peace&#8217;.</note> written <del>xxxx xxx</del> upon its monument.

                        xxx</del> might turn the scale upon great questions, &#8211; hence they will have great weight with any minister. But the next Duke
                    of Norfolk<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bernard Edward Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk (1765&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>).
                        Unlike his cousin and predecessor, Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk (1765&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), he was a Catholic.
                        Charles Howard controlled at least eight Parliamentary boroughs (Arundel, Horsham, Shoreham, Steyning, Gloucester, Hereford,
                        Leominster and Thetford).</note> will return Catholicks for all his boroughs. <del>xxxx</del> &#8211; &amp; you &amp; I know that if
                    it be supposed possible to bring about the downfall of the heretical Church by increasing the number of Catholic votes in
                    Parliament, money will never be wanting to purchase as many seats as come fairly into the market. With these the dissenting
                    members will all cooperate, the Scotch Presbyterians, &amp; the Scotch dabblers in philosophy. A needy minister (especially such a
                    man as <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">M Wellesley</ref>) will see an immediate resource in the tithes: which were
                    looked at <del>xxxx</del> by Pitt<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Pitt (1759&#8211;1806; Prime Minister, 1783&#8211;1801,
                        1804&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>).</note> with a greedy eye they will be sold like the land tax,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pitt was a sceptic about the long-term value of tithes to the Church of England, but he made no move to reform
                        the system. He did, though, introduce a scheme in 1798, whereby a landowner could exempt his land from land tax, by paying a
                        lump sum equivalent to 15 years&#8217; annual tax.</note> &#8211; the money funded, &#8211; &amp; the clergy made directly stipendiaries of the
                    crown, &amp; dependent upon the Crown for any additions to their stipends when the shifting value of money may render it
                    absolutely necessary. The country gentlemen would joyfully support such a measure, &amp; there can be no doubt that it would at
                    this time be as popular as it would be unjust &amp; pernicious in its consequences.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One immediate consequence would be that the new Establishment would be put up to sale, as it were, to the lowest
                    bidders, &#8211; &amp; in another generation the Methodists would obtain complete possession.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am perfectly convinced that this country owes more of its peculiar advantages to its Church than to its
                    Government, &amp; that when the one falls the other will not long survive it. The whole prospect is at this time a most gloomy
                    one. We may possibly <del>xx</del> escape the worst of all horrors by which we are immediately threatened: &#8212; a war of the poor
                    against the rich, but the prevention requires &amp; renders necessary far greater powers in the hand of Government than I should
                    willingly see trusted to <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">M Wellesley</ref>. The abuse of liberty has always been
                    punished with the loss of liberty. <del>xxxx</del> God grant that we may not find it so in our own case. For my own part I
                        <del>xxxxx</del> believe that the proudest days of England are to come, but that her best &amp; happiest days are over: That
                    we shall beat down France in the field, become a mighty military power, &amp; lose our civil &amp; religious freedom</p>
