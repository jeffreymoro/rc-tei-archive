          <salute>My dear Tom</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> Of late I have been almost overwhelmed with proof sheets, &amp; as if the Devil were determined I should have no
                    time ever to think of hitching him into a ballad again, he has contrived that I should have half a score of letters to write upon
                    a subject no ways concerning me. There came to me in a parcel from <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> a book
                    entitled Commentary on the Memoirs of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fox,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> By Walter Savage Landor.
                        Although Landor&#8217;s book was printed, Murray eventually suppressed its publication, refusing to publish a book that attacked the
                        Tory government and was dedicated to James Madison (1751&#8211;1836), President of the United States, with whom Britain was about to
                        go to war.</note> &#8211; evidently not yet published, for the last sheet was in its proof state, &amp; the conclusion wanting. I
                    had not dipt into three pages before I saw that it must be <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landors</ref>, &amp; had
                    not read half a dozen before I found that it must involve him in about as many prosecutions. Of course I wrote directly both to
                    him &amp; to <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, &#8211; &amp; it quite vexatious to think how many letters I have
                    written in consequence, having been obliged to act as mediator between <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">L.</ref> &amp;
                        <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">the bookseller</ref>, &amp; now that all the actionable parts are expunged <del>I am
                        in</del> my trouble is not yet over. For there remains a vehement attack upon <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Charles James Fox: a Commentary on his Life and Character by Walter Savage Landor</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (1907),
                        p. 216: &#8216;He was a very extraordinary boy, and is a very extraordinary boy still. He has not grown an inch in intellect &#8230; [he
                        is] answerable to the country for the loss of five thousand men, and for the worst of all our badly planned attacks [the
                        Walcheren expedition of 1809]. Canning is among those sour productions, which acquire an early tinge of maturity, and drop
                        off. It is idleness or unwariness in those who pick them up and taste them, and folly or shame in those who do not spit them
                        out.&#8217;</note> to whom <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> is personally obliged, &amp; which of course he would
                    never have consented to publish had he inspected the mss. but this he did not do, in compliment to <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">L.</ref> &amp; confidence in him as a friend of mine. He wishes to be allowed to
                    transfer the work to another publisher, taking the whole trouble upon himself, but <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">L.</ref> has been so little master of himself in the correspondence with him, that <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">M.</ref> could only make this proposal thro me, &amp; I have not yet received the answer.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Walter Savage Landor, 23 February 1812, Letter 2045.</note> All <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Ls</ref> letters to me upon the subject have been what they ought to be, &amp; I
                    expect to finish the business satisfactorily, &#8211; but it has vexed me a little, &amp; interrupted me a good deal.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The carpet is arrived &amp; very handsome, &#8211; but I fear very ill made in point of strength. The six shilling order
                    seems to have come too late, 5/6 being charged for it, &amp; the texture very coarse &amp; very slight. The brown is rather claret
                    than chocolate, &amp; will neither look so well nor wear so well, &#8211; but it is very handsome &amp; will greatly improve the
                    grandeur of my room. The Lion is a grand Lion, &#8211; verily a most worthy beast, &#8211; but I wish the Devil had the blue sky, for ten days
                    weather will make dirty weather of it, &amp; every coal that would only singe the Lions hide without hurting him, will make a flaw
                    in the firmament.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To night I have a letter from <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, apologizing for long silence,
                    which was because Pinkerton<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Pinkerton (1758&#8211;1826; <title>DNB</title>), editor of

                        (1808&#8211;1814). Southey had approached Murray to enquire about the possibility of publishing a &#8216;voyage&#8217; narrative Tom had found

                    answer, &#8211; but they are much obliged by the offer &amp;c. &#8211; I suppose your books are on the road, as well as some which are bound
                    hitherwards. But if they should not the J Arc &amp; Madoc<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> A fourth edition of <title>Joan
