        <p rend="indent1"> I have hardly heart to write to you, or to cast a thought towards
                    Bristol. &#8211; Out of my own blows this loss has been the heaviest that I could have
                    sustained, &#8211; <del>xx</del> it throws a gloom over the recollections of half my
                    life.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The death of <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Charles Danvers</ref>, one of Southey&#8217;s oldest and closest
                        friends.</note> You too will feel it deeply.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I write because I am very uneasy respecting <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Coleridge&#8217;s daughter</ref> who is beyond all doubt in a very alarming
                    state. She is in her twelfth year &amp; has long been in weak health, &#8211; subject
                    to frequent febrile attacks &amp; especially to nervous sleeplessness. <del>But
                        at present she has decided dropsical symptoms, &#8211; &amp; her kidneys are in
                        such a state that her urine is deeply tinged with blood. The swelling first
                        appeared in the face &amp; then in the abdomen; yesterday it seemed to
                        diminish &amp; to day is absent again; but the bloody appearance of the
                        urine continues xxx xxxxxx xx the quantity is materially increased by the
                        medecine. She is xxxxx xxxxxxxx &amp; this morning when she xxxx xxxxxxx at
                        breakfast her face was almost instantly xxxxxxx xxx xxx xxxxxxx to day her
                        appetite returned &amp; her spirits which had been xxxxxxx recovered xxxxx
                        xxxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx back.</del> I wish most earnestly that she
                    were within reach of you &#8211; she has long required good medical superintendance, &#8211;
                    but <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">Coleridge</ref> leaves every thing to chance &#8211; it is useless
                    to write to him, he never answers a letter &amp; probably never opens one, &amp;
                    he may very likely never know that his child is ill till he reads of her death
                    in the newspapers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the autumn she was supposed to have strained one of her feet,
                    a slight pain &amp; swelling began which was then accounted for, &amp; for which
                    she has been twice blistered, before this more formidable disease put all
                    slighter ailments out of mind. <ref target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> thinks her
                    affliction scrofulous, for that there is a scrofula in the blood is now too
                    certain, <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> having at this time an abscess in his
                    neck. <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> is not fully aware
                    of this, nor perhaps is she quite sensible of the extent of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Saras</ref> danger. God knows she is unhappy enough without these fresh
                    afflictions.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am looking toward the Continent. In three years the first term
                    of my lease will expire.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s
                        lease on Greta Hall.</note> It is a long time to look forward, &#8211; but should
                    I live so long, &amp; be able to raise the means (which is doubtful enough) I
                    feel very much inclined to take my family abroad for some years into a cheaper
                    land &amp; a more genial climate; <del>&amp; not to return till we had

                    something of Germany &amp; of Italy also. The diminished expences of living
                    might perhaps cover the costs of the journey, &amp; my labours would be as
                    productive there as here. This is but a dream as yet, but I think it would be
                    desirable for the children &amp; for myself. It is very possible that the state
                    of Europe may frustrate it, for even if no fresh wars should break out, those
                    countries which have been the scene of hostilities will long be overrun with
                    banditti. This is so much the case in Portugal that it is not safe to go from
                    Lisbon to Setubal without a guard. </p>

                            <title>Madoc</title> (1805). In 1815 Southey added a footnote to the
                        &#8216;Preface&#8217; to the fourth edition of <title>Madoc</title> clarifying that
                        contemporary expeditions had found nothing, and &#8216;it is now certain that no
