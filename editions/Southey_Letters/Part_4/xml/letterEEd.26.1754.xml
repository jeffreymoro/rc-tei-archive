            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>, published in 1810.</note> has been cruising after you for this month past &amp; ought ere
                    this to have found you out. I have sent off two more to night, that <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> may see them, a journey to London will do them no harm, &amp; if they do not reach you at Durham they will
                    follow you from thence by virtue of <ref target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Mr Percevals</ref> sign manual. You are right enough
                    in not liking the Snake battle.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), Book 16, lines 207&#8211;332.</note> &#8211; I can find very good reasons why it should be
                    liked, &#8211; but the truth is I am not very fond of it myself in spite of those reasons. As for the resemblance to Madoc<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The comparison is with <title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part 2, Book 7.</note> the objection will
                    obviously be <del>x</del> made, &amp; yet it is so obviously unreasonable that I altogether disregard it, there being nothing in
                    common except the name of snake, &#8211; if it were worth while I might turn him into a great cuttle fish with nine tails <del>to</del>
                    &amp; so destroy the likeness. That book goes off to night for Edinburgh &#8211; <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames ">Ballantyne</ref> I think will come to it in something less than a month. &#8211; certainly not in less than three weeks. &#8211; If you
                    find your way here in the course of the next fortnight I will talk <del>of</del> over the scene in the first walk we take, &amp;
                    then it is ten to one but <del>something</del> some radical alteration may be struck out in time to supply its place: for tho the
                    battle is well-managed &amp; all circumstances kept skilfully in view, certes I do not like it myself</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will find upon comparing the printed with the mss copy that of the altered passages some things which appear
                    alterations &amp; not improvements, have been made necessary by others which really are improvements: &amp; others (that which you
                    have instanced is an example) <del>made</del> &lt;became&gt; necessary <del>xx</del> when it was determined to cast the poem in
                    rhyme, which you know was not wholly determined till it was resumed with a resolution of going thro with it.</p>

          <l rend="indent3"> To the sweet season of her womanhood</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Belov&#8217;d &amp; lovely, like a flower whose leaf</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And bud &amp; blossom all are beautiful.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her virgin years were past in peacefulness;</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And when in prosperous wedlock she was given,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Among the Cumbrian mountains far away</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> She had her summer bower. Twas like a sight</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of old Romance to see her when she plied</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Her little boat on Derwents glassy lake</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Under the gorgeous evenings glowing sky.</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> But soon a wasting malady began</l>

          <l rend="indent3"> Yet with its intervals of calm that mock</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The hopes of anxious love, &amp; most of all</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> The sufferer self-deceivd. During those days</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Of treacherous respite, many a time hath he</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Who leaves this record of his friend, drawn back</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Into the shadow from her social board,</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Because amid her smiles &amp; innocent mirth</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> There was the bloom of death upon her cheek, &#8211; </l>
          <l rend="indent3"> And at that aweful thought a heavier grief</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Opprest his heart, then when the tidings came</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> That, all her sufferings ended, she was laid</l>
          <l rend="indent3"> To rest, amid Madeiras orange groves.</l>

                    may get on by stage the next day either to Penrith or Wigton the latter will be a new road for you, &amp; preferable because it is
                    a very fine approach to these Lakes. &#8211; </p>
