          <salute>My dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have so many things to say to you that I scarcely know where to begin. It was a great mortification that I could
                    not make the circuit which I had proposed in my way home, &amp; halt with you by the way; but the state of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughters</ref> health kept us in a state of feverish disquietude, &amp; for the
                        <del>time</del> first time I felt how serious an evil it was to be at so great a distance from my own fire side. Happily the
                    weather favoured us, the child grew better as we proceeded, &amp; like a true mountaineer seemed to be revived as soon as the
                    breath of the mountains reached her. We arrived safely without other accident than that of breaking down in the street at
                    Nottingham, &#8211; the only accident which occurrd during the whole journey at home &amp; abroad.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The infrequency of my letters my dear Wynn God knows is owing to no distaste, &#8211; the pressing employments of one who
                    keeps pace with an increasing expenditure by temporary writings, the quantity which from necessity as well as inclination I have
                    to read, &amp; the multiplicity of letters which I have to write, are the sufficient causes. You do not know the number of letters
                    which come to me from perfect strangers, who seem to think a Poet Laureat has as much patronage as a Lord Chancellor, <del>both
                        xxxxxx unfrequently xxx</del> not unfrequently the writers remind me so strongly of <del>xx</del> my own younger days that I
                    have given them the best advice I could with earnestness as well as sincerity, &amp; <del>xx</del> more than once been thus led
                    into an occasional correspondence. The Laureateship itself with me is no sinecure. I am at work in consequence of it at this time.
                    Do not suppose that I mean to rival <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref>. My poem will be in a very different
                    strain. It is in the sixlined stanza of Gualberto,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ballad &#8216;St Juan Gualberto&#8217;,
                            <title>Annual Anthology</title> (Bristol, 1800), 1&#8211;19.</note> &amp; will consist of the &#8220;Proem&#8221;, the journey the field of
                    Battle, the Lamentation (or some equivalent name) the reproof, &amp; the <add>xx</add> Hymn for Victory. The Proem touching upon
                    my return home &amp; personal feelings will be obnoxious to the charge of egotism, &#8211; no matter, if it is called of, it must answer
                    a useful purpose. The Lamentation will express a feeling concerning <del>xx</del> the state of affairs very similar to yours &#8211;
                    &amp; the Reproof instead of answering the particulara at which I <del>shall</del> strike home, will deal in generals, &amp; hold
                    out a picture of the hopes of mankind. I have written between 2 &amp; 300 lines, &amp; expect to satisfy myself.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poem was <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note>
          <ref target="people.html#NashEdward">An artist</ref> who was of our party has made some views for me which I mean to have
                    engraved, &amp; the title will be La Belle Alliance. Thereby hangs a tale &#8211; which must be for your private ear.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s desire to name it the &#8216;Belle Alliance&#8217; was due to his belief that it was more
                        suited to verse (Southey to John Rickman, [c. 5 July 1815], Letter 2633), and that &#8216;the name of Waterloo
                        was given to the battle by the Duke of Wellington in a spirit of the lowest &amp; vilest jealousy&#8217; (Southey to Thomas Southey,
                        17 December 1815, Letter 2684).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I think you must have felt a wish as I did that the Battle should have borne the title, tho it was plain that once
                    it had been named from Waterloo a word so English in its appearance would prevail. But there is a story connected with this. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My last paper in the Quarterly was written before I left England, &amp; I corrected the proof sheets of the whole
                    on my way thro London to the continent.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> This and the following two paragraphs provide the

                    still unpublished, tho this was the last article in it. I suspected that <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> had
                    kept it back for the sake of getting from me what farther knowledge I might have acquired upon the spot, &amp; tho not very well
                    pleased at the supposition I nevertheless willingly proposed to <del>xxx</del> him to revise it before it should be worked off,
                    &amp; correct any error into which ignorance of the ground might possibly have led me. It was not however till I had been
                        <del>above a for</del> nearly three weeks in London that I could procure the proofs, tho I repeatedly applied for them both to

                    only the latter half of the article was sent me. With this I was satisfied as it contained the Waterloo part. Imagine my surprize
                    &amp; indignation at finding two huge interpolations placed so as totally to destroy the effect of a continuous narrative &amp;
                    compleatly spoil the composition. But this was a light objection to them: &#8211; for the object of the first was to deny in the most
                    audacious &amp; insolent terms that the <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke of Wellington</ref> had been
                    surprized, &amp; that of the second to deny in the same manner that any merit whatever was due to the Prussians in the
                    victory!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My blood boiled in me. I wrote to <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> in temperate but strong
                        terms.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> This letter appears not to have survived.</note> I pointed out the folly &amp;
                    the falsehood in both instances, &amp; advised him as he valued the character of the journal to cancel the <del>xx</del> most
                    objectionable parts, &amp; for the sake of the composition to throw such as might be retained without offence to the truth
                        <del>into</del> to the bottom of the page. I went to <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, &amp; convinced him
                    that the character of the Review was at stake, &#8211; from him &amp; from <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">G.</ref> I learnt
                    not only what I knew from the first that this passage came from <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>, but what I

                    him, &#8211; that the delay in publication had been occasioned while their precious alterations were made at Paris, &amp; the
                    correspondence <del>xxx</del> took place between that city &amp; Dublin, &#8211; in short that I had been chosen as a fit mouthpiece for
                    conveying falsehood to the public thro an accredited channel. &#8211; You may guess what followed. I insisted upon having the <del>xxxx
                        xxxxx</del> paper put into my hands, struck out their falsehoods, reinserted what had been expunged to make room for them,
                    &amp; carried my point with a high hand: whereby I shall not doubt have deserved &amp; procured the ill-will &amp; the respect
                    both of the <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke</ref> &amp; his friend. I saw <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> afterwards at his particular &amp; repeated desire, after having declined an
                    invitation to dine with. You will easily believe that he carefully avoided all reference to the subject, tho his conversation was
                    often influenced by it, &amp; that he behaved with the greatest possible civility.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One of the passages which I struck out was a sentence saying that the good sense of Europe had rejected the name of
                    Belle Alliance for the battle as being <del>xxx</del> in some degree false. &#8211; I have since discovered that in the <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Dukes</ref> dispatches he underlined <del>xxx</del> the word <hi rend="ital">Waterloo</hi> thus for the same mean motive.</p>
