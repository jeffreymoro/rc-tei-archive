        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The <ref target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">General</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">Dr. Bell</ref>
                    were dining with me yesterday when your letter arrived, and they did not leave
                    me till after ten o&#8217;clock; this was unfortunate, as it prevented me from
                    immediately writing to <ref target="people.html#WhiteJames">James</ref>.
                    I have written to him by this day&#8217;s post, endeavouring, as far as I could, to
                    convince him that the degree, and not the honour, is the essential object of his
                    studies; that such honours are not worth much in the University, and worth
                    nothing anywhere else; and that the opinion of what he <hi rend="ital">could</hi> have done, if he had attempted it, will be of as much use to him
                    as an actual honour, in case of taking pupils, or standing for a fellowship:
                    which I verily believe.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey
                        to James White, 11 November 1814, Letter 2499.</note> In a soldier, the want
                    of presence of mind is disgraceful and criminal, because he has entered a
                    profession which makes weakness a crime; yet even in a soldier some degree of
                    compassion (out of his profession) usually attaches itself to the consideration
                    of this failing; and in other men I am not sure that it does not in some degree
                    compensate for the inconvenience which it occasions, by exciting an interest in
                    considerate and kindly natures. I have written to him sportively as well as
                    seriously and endeavoured to put him in good humour with himself. If his health
                    is not permanently injured, there is no real injury sustained. I have an
                    absolute hatred of this stimulating system; it is equally injurious to mind and
                    body, and but too often fatal to both. Better was the old sleepy course of
                    things at Oxford, under which men were left to themselves to do just what they
                    pleased and nothing more.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What shall I say about your present? I could be angry with you if
                    anger had any effect upon the incorrigible. The box arrived on Wednesday while I
                    was at the Island. The two Ediths<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May Southey</ref>.</note>
                    were desirous that it should not be opened till I were present; which, in the
                    younger one, was no small proof of virtue; the rest, however, were mutinous,
                    and, <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs. Coleridge</ref> putting herself
                    at the head of the mutineers, they succeeded. They agreed among themselves that
                    I was not to be told what each of them had received, but that they were to
                    surprise me in the morning; and, accordingly, I was beset in the very act of
                    shaving. &#8220;Here, Pappa! here, Pappa! &#8211; only look at mine,&#8221; cries one; &#8220;Look at
                    mine,&#8221; cries another. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>
                    brings his books, and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> her box, and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bel</ref>, jumping for joy in the midst of them, told me that &#8220; Mitter White sent her a
                    deal of pretty things in a <hi rend="ital">boss</hi>!&#8221; I cut myself, of course,
                    in all this confusion; and the father and children with their treasures, and the
                    razor, and the lather, and just blood enough to give effect to the scene, would
                    have made a good comic picture. But indeed, Neville, you are too bountiful.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope you will see <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother Harry</ref> frequently, now you have been fellow-travellers
                    among the mountains. He has a thoroughly good heart of his own, an admirable
                    temper, and, with very considerable talents, a larger portion of practical good
                    sense than has fallen to my lot, &#8211; one of those men whom you love and respect
                    the more the better you know him. You will be glad to hear that he is likely to
                    give me <ref target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">a new sister</ref>, &#8211; a very interesting woman, whose <ref target="people.html#GonneMrs">mother</ref> I have known nineteen years, and always considered
                    as the model of whatever is most lovely and excellent in womankind. They were a
                    Lisbon family, but for some years past have lived at Champion Hill. The <ref target="people.html#GonneWilliam">father</ref> has long been
                    lingering in a slow consumption, from which there is little or no hope of his
                    recovery. In point of fortune the connection, on <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry&#8217;s</ref> part, is exactly what
                    I should wish it to be &#8211; neither ambitious nor imprudent.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am charged with more thanks for you than would have filled this
                    whole sheet; and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bel</ref>,
                    moreover, says she &#8220;will send you a kiss.&#8221; Imagine, therefore, all joyful
                    expressions of thankfulness from the young, and all warm thanks and affectionate
                    remembrances from the elders. God bless you.</p>

            <label>P.S.</label> One word more, my dear Neville. Do not let me see your
                        letters marked at the post office in <hi rend="ital">red ink</hi> for the
                        future. I do not like my friends to pay for my gratification.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> At this time, letters were often paid
                            for by the recipient. If they were marked in red ink this was an
                            indication that the sender had paid the postage.</note>
