                        been fuelled by learning (from Southey) of the latter&#8217;s views on his poetry. Fellowes had observed in a letter to Seward of
                        1803 that: &#8216;The author of Gebir &#8230; has lately made another attempt to convey the waters of Helicon by leaden pipes, and many
