                    you with calomel, it is nevertheless a considerable relief to me to find that
                    these unpleasant symptoms are the effect of the remedy, &amp; not consequences
                    of the disease, for they are much more within the reach of art. I am also glad

        <p rend="indent1"> I came back yesterday from <ref target="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</ref> after a three days absence. My motive for leaving home was
                    to give myself a dose of different air, &amp; shake up the solids by a good
                    round walk &#8211; in addition to these benefits I obtained that of a thorough
                    rain-bath on my return, for which I am no worse. There was a large parcel
                    awaiting me, so that my return would have been a joyful one if I had not found
                    three of the children indisposed; &#8211; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Moon</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> with a feverish attack, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">the infant</ref> with an

                    killed that robust child where <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> lodged, &amp; one other in the town. To day they are all
                    better, yet none of them well enough to make me feel quite at ease, &amp; <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is now sickening in

                    cutting open the leaves of the first copy of his own book to be the consummation

                    that can happen to the book will vex me, &amp; the only thing that will surprize
                    me would be if any body, except some half dozen of my own friends, should like
                    it. &#8211; I am sorry to see that a number of errors have crept into the printing
                    since I corrected the proofs, &amp; which I am certain did not exist at that
                    time. In several instances two paragraphs are printed as one, when there was a
                    natural &amp; necessary division. Pray notice the fashion of the typography,
                    &amp; complain that the first two or three sheets are not correct in this
                    respect. It is a great improvement &amp; any public mention of it in this way
                    will go far towards establishing it.</p>

                        had seen Coleridge on 18&#8211;19 November 1810. He may have conveyed some
                        information to Bedford about Coleridge&#8217;s marriage or the state of his
                        health.</note> We have heard nothing from <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> yet. His silence
                    is too easily accounted for to excite any thing like anger. &#8211; he went to London
                    professedly to put himself under medical advice for &#8211; bad habits, &amp; as we
                    very well knew would be the case, he is going on in those habits. When he is
                    tired of his London &amp; Hammersmith friends he will come back again as if he
                    had done nothing amiss, or absurd, &amp; we whose resentment has long since
                    given place to regret &amp; <del>x</del> compassion, shall receive him as kindly
                    as we took leave of him, &#8211; but more chearfully, or rather with less inward
                    sorrow, for if he will destroy himself by self-indulgence, it is better he
                    should do it here than among strangers. O Grosvenor what a mind is <del>xx</del>

        <p rend="indent1"> I am afraid that ministers have suffered a great opportunity to

                    Lisbon itself may be sorely annoyed if the French possess Alentejo. It is
                    supplied with its fuel from thence, &amp; with much of its food. As for the
                    English lines, manned as they will be I consider them impregnable by any force
                    [MS torn] can be brought against them, &amp; only wish Buonaparte would come to
                    attack them in person. Our men would fight ten fold the better for it. This
