                        New Year; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 21 December 1814, Letter 2523. In reply, Bedford had expressed his
                        concerns. Southey responds to these in this letter. The poem became ‘Ode, Written in December 1814’. It was thought unsuitable
                        by the authorities, and was not published until Southey’s <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 227–238.
                        It was retitled ‘Ode, Written During the War with America, 1814’ in the 1837–1838 edition of Southey’s poetical works.</note>
                    – which naturally arose from the conviction that one was wanting here; – but my thoughts were of the Bp of Durham &amp; the
                    National Society,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Shute Barrington (1734–1826; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Durham,
                        1791–1826. He was an active proponent of the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Christian
                        Church. Founded in November 1811, the Society championed the Madras system of Andrew Bell.</note> – not of the H of
                        Brunswick.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The United Kingdom’s monarchs since 1714.</note> – As the 18 of Jan<hi rend="sup">y</hi> service for N Years Day at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> James’s there is no reason why I should not take advantage

                    night. The line to which you object in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> stanza is part of a vile sentence, which I must alter or omit.
                    But what shall I say about Washington?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Washington (1732–1799), first President of
                        the United States of America, 1789–1797. Stanza 2, lines 8–10 of the version of the ‘Ode’, sent to Bedford on 21 December
                        1814, were deeply respectful of Washington and his legacy.</note> – If you have read in the last Register the Chapter
                    respecting South America you will know what I think of the American Revolution.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 367–421 (chapters 26–27). The general tone was very critical
                        of the movements for independence in Spanish America.</note> You know also how I feel respecting the present American
                        War.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The United Kingdom and United States were at war 1812–1814. Unbeknowst to
                        Southey, peace terms had been agreed in the Treaty of Ghent, signed on 24 December 1814.</note> But this does not prevent me
                    from thinking Washington one of the greatest &amp; most admirable characters in history. – I wish the Ode had not been
                    communicated to <ref target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref>.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford had
                        probably forwarded the poem to Croker.</note> At your suggestion this passage might quietly have been expunged, – to expunge
                    it at his, is a different thing; nor <del>can I</del> do I know just now whether I will submit to the humiliation. Besides the
                        <del>passage</del> manner in which Washington is mentioned refers <del>more</del> especially to his latter &amp; Anglican
                    policy, – the very policy &lt;for&gt; which the Federalists &lt;contend&gt; in opposition to the Ruling Party.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The opposition Federalist party had been against the war with the United Kingdom in 1812–1814. In
                        office, Washington had promoted friendly relations with the United Kingdom, especially through the Jay Treaty (1794), which
                        settled many outstanding issues between the two countries.</note> Luckily enough the whole stanza is very bad, &amp; may
                    perhaps be entirely replaced. – Your correction for pure faith is good, &amp; ransackd caverns will be better than bowels. – But I
                    hope to mend it in many places.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> See the version of the ‘Ode’ sent to Bedford on 21

                    thing which can be done to prevent its being an honour is to insist upon this sort of task work; – the only thing I can do to make
