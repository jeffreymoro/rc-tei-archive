                    printed. When you see the bulk of the volume you will not wonder at the length of time which it has cost me, &amp; when you look
                    at the business of the year you will not wonder at the bulk.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had invested more
                        time and energy into his work for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> than he had anticipated and his contributions
                        greatly exceded, in terms of length, those of the previous year. <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn ">Ballantyne</ref>
                        was concerned enough about the length of the historical section to insist that Southey explained himself to the readers in a

                        1810&#8211;1814. He had sent Southey a copy of Manuel Calado (1584&#8211;1654), <title>Valeroso Lucideno e o Triunfo da Liberdade</title>
                        (1648), a first-hand account of Brazil during the period of Dutch rule.</note> &amp; it reached <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> with a charge of sixteen guineas for postage. They referred the matter to
