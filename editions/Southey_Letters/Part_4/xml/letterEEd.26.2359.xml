                        survived.</note> was directed to London, &#8211; the place from whence my letter was dated having not been noticed. This gave <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> an opportunity of seeing its contents, <del>&amp; you will</del> &amp;
                    the opinion which he expresses upon them is but too just. There is a sort of insanity in <del>this</del> all this. Falsehood is
                    become so habitual to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">him</ref> that he seems not to know how to speak truth. &#8211; He is now
                    six &amp; twenty, &#8211; there is still time before him, &#8211; still opportunity, &#8211; &amp; nothing is wanting to save him but the will to be
                    saved, &#8211; &amp; <del>xxx</del> &lt;tho&gt; it is so little possible in the natural course of things that I could almost agree with
                    the Methodists, that a new birth, &#8211; an immediate act of grace upon the soul, is necessary to produce it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wished him to continue in the line of life to which he has always <hi rend="ital">gravitated</hi>, because I feel
                    perfectly certain that he will find his way back to it, if he be sent to the Antipodes. And if he could have been placed in a
                    decent theatre I thought it not unlikely that he might venture at composition &amp; become a dramatic writer, being plentifully
                    gifted with talents. God knows whether I could have got him an engagement; it would have been very difficult, especially as he
                    objected to the Bath &amp; Bristol stage, &#8211; the only one where I had any acquaintance with the Proprietor of a Theatre.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Palmer (1742&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>), owner of the Theatre Royal in Bath and in
                        Bristol.</note> This is out of the question now. I am as little inclined to be uncharitable as any man can be;
                        <del>being</del> in his situation it was exceedingly likely that he should form such a connection as this, &amp; as he could
                    not make the woman worse in point of character or feeling than he found her, exceedingly excusable. It was also natural enough
                    that he should <del>not</del> represent himself as married to you.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Southey had
                        claimed to have married a Miss Lack (dates unknown); see Southey to John Rickman, [2 November 1813], Letter 2322. In fact no
                        marriage had taken place.</note> To me it was a foolish falshood, &amp; the second letter is worse than the first. However
                        <del>x</del> all that results from it is that I cannot recommend him to an <del>xxxx</del> established theatre, &#8211; <del>I</del>
                    merely deprives me of the power of making a very doubtful experiment. <del>but do you then to Doyle if</del> Do you then apply to
                        Doyle,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly Charles William Doyle (1770&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), an officer who
                        had acted as a liaison between British and Spanish forces and had been involved in training Spanish troops.</note> &#8211; he turned
                    Catholic some years ago to <del>get the favour of</del> &lt;please&gt; some old Irish Countess,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The inspiration for Edward Southey&#8217;s conversion is unidentified.</note> &amp; I suppose if he gets to Spain he

                        opposed the policies of the government and the king and were generally supportive of those of the ex-Prime Minister George
                        Grenville (1712&#8211;1770; <title>DNB</title>) and of the radical politician John Wilkes (1725&#8211;1797; <title>DNB</title>). There
                        was, from the outset, much debate as to the identity of their author or authors. Wynn was well placed to report on the stories
