          <salute>SIR,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> A pamphlet has been transmitted to me from New York, entitled &#8220;<hi rend="ital">The United States and England</hi>:
                    being a Reply to the Criticism on <hi rend="ital">Inchiquin&#8217;s Letters</hi>, contained in <title>The Quarterly Review</title>, for
                    January, 1814.&#8221;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The pamphlet&#8217;s author was James Kirke Paulding (1778&#8211;1860), writer and
                        from 1815&#8211;1823 secretary to the United States Board of Navy Commissioners.</note> In this pamphlet the writer assures the
                    American People, that I am the Editor of <title>The Quarterly Review</title>, and the author of the particular article which has
                    excited his indignation.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The review of Charles Jared Ingersoll (1782&#8211;1862),
                            <title>Inchiquen, the Jesuit&#8217;s Letters, during a Late Residence in the United States of America; being a Fragment of a
                            Private Correspondence, accidentally discovered in Europe, containing a favourable View of the Manners, Literature, and
                            State of Society, of the United States; and a Refutation of many of the Aspersions cast upon this Country, by former
                            Residents and Tourists. By some Unknown Foreigner</title> (1810), in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 10 (January 1814),
                        494&#8211;530. The author of the offending article, which was highly critical of the United States, was John Barrow (1764&#8211;1848;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Allow me, Sir, to reply through the medium of the COURIER, &#8211; a very few lines will suffice: &#8211; there can be no
                    better means of making my reply known in America; and in this country, as well as in that, it may be useful to shew the exceeding
                    impropriety of attacking any man as the author of an anonymous publication, without the fullest proof that he is so. I did not
                    write the Criticism on Inchiquin&#8217;s Letters; and everybody in England who knows the Quarterly Review, knows that I am not the
                    Editor of it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The editor at this time was <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">William
                            Gifford</ref>.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Had the American writer observed any kind of decency in his attack, I would have addressed a private letter to him,
                    through his publisher, requesting that he would publicly acknowledge his mistake, and thereby atone, as far as he could, for an
                    unprovoked wrong. But the style and temper of his pamphlet preclude all courtesy on my part; nor shall I condescend to notice him
                    farther than to express a hope that this letter may be copied into the American papers. A writer of his stamp would probably
                    neither have sufficient sense of honour to believe my disavowal, nor to make it public.</p>
