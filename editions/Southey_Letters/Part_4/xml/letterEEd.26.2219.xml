        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the notes.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Banknotes.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your last letter noticed the arrival of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> book of Roderick<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), which Bedford was reading in MS.</note> &#8211; which had been lying some ten
                    days at <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref>, &#8211; &amp; this you have no doubt <del>x</del> recollected ere this.
                    The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> I gave <ref target="people.html#SunderlinLord">Lord Sunderlin</ref> this
                    morning to take to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>, thinking that as he will be about five days on the
                    road they will meet their predecessors there, &amp; save the trouble of one transfer. The latter of these will be new to you, &#8211;
                    &amp; by the time you get them I shall have transcribed &amp; sent off to you the two following, &#8211; beyond which the poem has not
                    yet proceeded, &#8211; <del>except</del> more than a few lines.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Whenever your comments arrive all due attention shall be paid to them. I myself anticipate little immediate success
                    for the poem: &#8211; the mere accidental &amp; temporary interest which it might have excited from its accommodation to passing events,
                    will, most probably have past away before it is published; &amp; it will have little of that novelish excitement which is what
                    ordinary readers look for. I proceed <del>it</del> with it in a temper proof against disappointment hoping nothing as to its
                    present reputation, but looking to its future rank in full faith. There will be a great deal to do in ornamenting, stiffening
                    &amp; stately-fying the parts where the author speaks, which ought to have a more elaborate character than such as are
                    dramatic.</p>
