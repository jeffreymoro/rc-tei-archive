        <p rend="indent1"> I know too well the necessity of subordination in a Review, to complain of any curtailment that may be thought
                    expedient in any of my contributions, &#8211; however much my opinion may differ concerning the expediency. &#8211; Yet upon this occasion the
                    Philistines are so compleatly delivered into my hands, &#8211; that it would be unjust to a good cause to let them escape so easily. I
                    have more to say upon the war of <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">Bell</ref> &amp; the <ref target="people.html#LancasterJoseph">Dragon</ref>. &#8211; The best way in which it could be said would be by enlarging what is
                    already written, so at least it appears to me at present. Some three months hence when the present number shall have done its work
                    &amp; had its seperate sale, it <del>would</del> might serve the Review rather than injure it, if the article, enlarged as it
                    would be, were published separately.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>The Origin, Nature and Object, of
                            the New System of Education</title> (1812), an expansion of his advocacy of Andrew Bell&#8217;s system over that of Joseph
                        Lancaster&#8217;s in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 6 (August 1811), 264&#8211;304.</note> The Edinburgh did so with their attack upon

                        in <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 10 (July 1807), 386&#8211;421. This was a determined attack on the radical William Cobbett,
                        pointing out his inconsistencies.</note> But if you think otherwise, it will not be difficult for me to arrange my materials
                    in some other form. In whatever form it appears it will be the heaviest blow that ever the Edinburgh has received.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s book contained numerous attacks on the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, but not a

        <p rend="indent1"> In proposing this to your consideration I must beg you to regard the interest of the Review exclusively, &amp;
                    think nothing of my convenience.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The proposed pamphlett, written wholly new or partly so, may lead to something farther, &#8211; for I will throw the
                    gauntlett to the Enemy, &amp; if he takes it up &#8211; it is at his <del>per</del> peril. <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</ref> little knows of what stuff I am made. If I once grapple with him in controversy it will be to break every bone
                    in his body. Never did men so commit themselves as they have done upon this question, &amp; <ref target="people.html#CoplestonEdward">Copplestones</ref> dose<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Copleston had engaged in a prolonged public debate
                        with the <title>Edinburgh</title>. His <title>A Reply to the Calumnies of the Edinburgh Review against Oxford</title> (Oxford,

                        (October 1809), 40&#8211;53. Copleston noted in response that no one would &#8216;apply to the Edinburgh Review for information about the
                        Classics&#8217; (<title>Reply</title>, p. 118). For the reviewers&#8217; reaction see <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 16 (April 1810),
                        158&#8211;187. Copleston followed up with <title>A Second Reply to the Edinburgh Review</title> (1810) and <title>A Third Reply to
