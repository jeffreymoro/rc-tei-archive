                        349–353.</note> After stating the sum of their losses he says “we cannot
                    subsist, in our contracted shape, on the interest of what remains. The capital
                    will last our joint lives, but I shall be abandoned at once to solitariness
                    &amp; penury. To what can I look forwards, but to a voluntary interment in the
                    same grave with my parents? O that nature would realize this most convenient
                        doom.”<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The financial crisis,
                        caused by a series of risky investments made by Taylor’s father, William
                        Taylor Senior (1731/2–1819), came to a head in 1811. The Taylors had to move
                        to a smaller house in King Street, Norwich, and were financially
                        pressed.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Now my reason for transcribing this passage to you is, because it
                    has made a deep impression on me, &amp; haunts me when I lie down at night. You
                    know more of Norwich than I do, &amp; more of <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylors</ref>
                    connections. Who is most in his confidence? Is it <ref target="people.html#SayersFrank">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sayers</ref>? – I
                    thought of writing directly to him, but was withheld by a suspicion that there
                    is no great warmth of heart about him. But what I would say to the person who
                    may be most likely to enter into my <del>x</del> wishes is that <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylors</ref>
                    friends should raise such an annuity for him, as would secure him from penury,
                    &amp; at once relieve his mind from the apprehension of it: – either raising
                        <del>xx xxxx</del> a sum sufficient to purchase it (the best way because the
                    least liable to accidents) – or by yearly contributions, – <ref target="people.html#SayersFrank">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> S.</ref>
                        (<del>xx</del> any other the fittest person) receiving &amp; regularly
                    paying it, &amp; he never knowing particularly from whence it comes, but merely
                    that it is his. The former plan is the best, because in that case there would be
                    only to purchase the annuity &amp; put the security into his hands, – &amp; this
                    might be done without any person appearing in it, – the office transmitting him
                    the <del>xxx</del> necessary documents. – This of course is a thing upon which
                    the very wind must not blow. Ten years hence, or perhaps five, if the
                        <del>fir</del> least desirable of these plans should be found most
                    practicable, you &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> may be able to cooperate in it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Herbert Southey wrote himself to Taylor on 13

                    to secure him at least 100£ a year, one way or the other, – the world is worse
                    than I thought it.</p><p rend="indent1"> To whom shall I write to propose this? – At one time I thought of
