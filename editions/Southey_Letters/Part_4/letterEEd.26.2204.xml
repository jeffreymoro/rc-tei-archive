But other thoughts</l><l rend="indent3"> Curbing his spirit made him yet awhile</l><l rend="indent3"> Sustain the weight of bondage. Here alone</l><l rend="indent3"> Of all the Gothic baronage the Moors</l><l rend="indent3"> Watchd with regard of wary policy,</l><l rend="indent3"> Knowing his powerful name, his noble mind,</l><l rend="indent3"> And how in him the old Iberian blood</l><l rend="indent3"> Of royal &amp; remotest ancestry,</l><l rend="indent3"> From undisputed source, flowd undefiled;</l><l rend="indent3"> His mother’s after guilt attaining not</l><l rend="indent3"> The claim legitimate he derived from her,</l><l rend="indent3"> Her first-born in her time of innocence.</l><l rend="indent3"> He too of Chindasuintho’s regal line</l><l rend="indent3"> Sole remnant now, drew after him the love</l><l rend="indent3"> Of all true Goths, uniting in himself</l><l rend="indent3"> Thus by this double right the general heart</l><l rend="indent3"> Of Spain. For this the renegade crew,</l><l rend="indent3"> Wretches in whom their conscious guilt &amp; fear</l><l rend="indent3"> Engendered cruellest hatred, still advised</l><l rend="indent3"> The extinction of Pelayo’s house: but most,</l><l rend="indent3"> The apostate Prelate, in iniquity</l><l rend="indent3"> Witizas genuine brother as in blood,</l><l rend="indent3"> Orpas, pursued his life. He never ceas’d</l><l rend="indent3"> With busy zeal, true traitor, to infuse</l><l rend="indent3"> His deadly rancour in the Moorish Chiefs;</l><l rend="indent3"> Their only danger, ever he observed,</l><l rend="indent3"> Was from Pelayo; root his lineage out</l><l rend="indent3"> The Caliphs empire then would be secure,</l><l rend="indent3"> And universal Spain, all hope of change</l><l rend="indent3"> Being lost, receive the Prophets conquering law.</l><l rend="indent3"> Then did the Archvillain urge the Moor at once</l><l rend="indent3"> To cut off future perils, telling him</l><l rend="indent3"> Death was a trusty keeper, &amp; that none</l><l rend="indent3"> Eer broke the prison of the grave. But here</l><l rend="indent3"> Did malice overshoot its mark. The Moor</l><l rend="indent3"> Who from the plunder of their native land</l><l rend="indent3"> Had bought the recreant crew that joind his arms,</l><l rend="indent3"> Or cheaplier with their own possessions bribed</l><l rend="indent3"> Their sordid souls, saw thro the flimsy show</l><l rend="indent3"> Of policy with which they sought to cloak</l><l rend="indent3"><del>Of</del> Old enmity, &amp; selfish sins: he scornd</l><l rend="indent3"> To let their private purposes incline</l><l rend="indent3"> His counsels; &amp; believing, Spain subdued:</l><l rend="indent3"> Smiled in the pride of power &amp; victory,</l><l rend="indent3"> Disdainful at the thought of farther strife.</l><l rend="indent3"> Howbeit he held Pelayo at his court,</l><l rend="indent3"> And told him that until his country men</l><l rend="indent3"> Submissively should lay their weapons down,</l><l rend="indent3"> He from his children &amp; paternal hearth</l><l rend="indent3"> Apart <del>fro</del> must dwell, nor hope to see again</l><l rend="indent3"> His native mountains &amp; their vales beloved,</l><l rend="indent3"> Till all the Austrian &amp; Cantabrian Hills</l><l rend="indent3"> Had bowed before the Caliph: Cordoba</l><l rend="indent3"> Must be his nightly prison till that hour</l><l rend="indent3"> This might be special favour from the Moor</l><l rend="indent3"> Askd &amp; vouchsafd, he past without the walls,</l><l rend="indent3"> Keeping his yearly vigil; on this night</l><l rend="indent3"> Therefore the princely Spaniard could not fly,</l><l rend="indent3"> Being thus in strongest bonds by honour held.</l><l rend="indent3"> Nor would he by his own escape expose</l><l rend="indent3"> To stricter bondage, or belike to death</l><l rend="indent3"> Count Pedro’s son: the ancient enmity</l><l rend="indent3"> Of rival houses from Pelayo’s heart</l><l rend="indent3"> Had, like a thing forgotten, past away.</l><l rend="indent3"> He pitied child &amp; parent, separated</l><l rend="indent3"> By the stern mandate of unfeeling power,</l><l rend="indent3"> And almost with a fathers eyes beheld</l><l rend="indent3"> The boy, his fellow in captivity.</l><l rend="indent3"> For young Alphonso was in truth an heir</l><l rend="indent3"> Of natures largest patrimony; rich </l><l rend="indent3"> In form &amp; feature, growing strength of limb,</l><l rend="indent3"> A gentle heart, a soul affectionate,</l><l rend="indent3"> A joyous spirit filld with generous thoughts,</l><l rend="indent3"> And genius heightening &amp; ennobling all.</l><l rend="indent3"> The blossom of all manly virtues made</l><l rend="indent3"> His boyhood beautiful.

Within those wells</l><l rend="indent3"> Returning day restored no chearful sounds</l><l rend="indent3"><del>Of</del> &lt;Or&gt; joyous motions, of awakening life;</l><l rend="indent3"> But in the stream of light the speckled motes,</l><l rend="indent3"> As if in mimickry of insect play</l><l rend="indent3"> Floated with mazy movement. Sloping down</l><l rend="indent3"> Over the altar past the pillar’d beam,</l><l rend="indent3"> And rested on the sinful womans grave,</l><l rend="indent3"> As if it entered there, a light from Heaven</l><l rend="indent3"> So be it, cried Pelayo, even so!</l><l rend="indent3"> As in a momentary interval,</l><l rend="indent3"> (When thought expelling thought, had left his mind</l><l rend="indent3"> Open &amp; passive to the influxes</l><l rend="indent3"> Of outward sense) his vacant eye was there, –</l><l rend="indent3"> So be it, heavenly Father, even so!</l><l rend="indent3"> Thus may thy vivifying mercy shed</l><l rend="indent3"> Forgiveness there; for let not thou the groans</l><l rend="indent3"> Of dying penitence, nor my bitter prayers</l><l rend="indent3"> Before thy judgement seat be heard in vain.</l><l rend="indent3"> And thou poor soul, who in the dolorous house</l><l rend="indent3"> Of weeping &amp; of pain, dost look to me</l><l rend="indent3"> To shorten &amp; assuage thy penal term,</l><l rend="indent3"> Pardon me that these hours in other thought</l><l rend="indent3"> And other duties than this garb, this night</l><l rend="indent3"> Enjoin, should thus have past, Our mother-land</l><l rend="indent3"> Exacted of my heart the sacrifice;</l><l rend="indent3"> And many a vigil must thy son perform</l><l rend="indent3"> Henceforth, in woods &amp; mountain fastnesses,</l><l rend="indent3"> And tented fields, outwatching for her sake</l><l rend="indent3"> The starry host, &amp; ready for the work</l><l rend="indent3"> Of day, before the Sun begins his course.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> The noble mountaineer concluding then</l><l rend="indent3"> With silent prayer, the service of the night,</l><l rend="indent3"> Went forth. Without the porch awaiting him</l><l rend="indent3"> He saw Alphonso, pacing to &amp; fro</l><l rend="indent3"> With patient step, &amp; eyes reverted oft.</l><l rend="indent3"> He springing forward when he heard the door</l><l rend="indent3"> Move on its heavy hinges, ran to him</l><l rend="indent3"> And welcomed him with smiles youthful love.</l><l rend="indent3"> I have been watching yonder moon, quoth he,</l><l rend="indent3"> How it grew pale &amp; paler as the Sun</l><l rend="indent3"> Scattered the flying shades. But woe is me,</l><l rend="indent3"> For on his towers of Cordoba the while</l><l rend="indent3"> That baleful crescent glittered in the moon,</l><l rend="indent3"> And with its insolent triumph seemd to mock</l><l rend="indent3"> The omen I had found. – Last night I dreamt</l><l rend="indent3"> That thou wert in the field, in arms for Spain,</l><l rend="indent3"> And I was by thy side. The infidels</l><l rend="indent3"> Beset us round, but we with our good swords</l><l rend="indent3"> Hewd out a way. Methought I stabbed a Moor</l><l rend="indent3"> Who would have slain thee, &amp; with that I woke</l><l rend="indent3"> For joy, &amp; wept to find it but a dream.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> Thus as he spake, a livelier glow oerspread</l><l rend="indent3"> His cheek, &amp; starting tears again suffusd</l><l rend="indent3"> The brightening lustre of his eyes. The Prince</l><l rend="indent3"><del>Behel</del> Regarded him a moment stedfastly</l><l rend="indent3"> As if in quick resolve, then looking round</l><l rend="indent3"> Aright aleft with keen &amp; rapid glance,</l><l rend="indent3"> Drew him within the Church. Alphonsos heart</l><l rend="indent3"> Throbbd with a joyful boding, as he marked</l><l rend="indent3"> The calmness of Pelayo’s countenance,</l><l rend="indent3"> Kindled with solemn thought, expressing now</l><l rend="indent3"> High purposes of resolute hope. He gazed</l><l rend="indent3"> All eagerly to hear what most he wishd.</l><l rend="indent3"> If, said the Prince, thy dream were verified</l><l rend="indent3"> Thus far, that I were in the field in arms</l><l rend="indent3"> For Spain, – wouldst thou indeed be at my side</l><l rend="indent3"> Our countrys banner on our native hills,</l><l rend="indent3"> Wouldst thou Alphonso share my dangerous flight</l><l rend="indent3"> Dear boy – &amp; <del>can</del> wilt thou take my lot with me</l><l rend="indent3"> For death, or for deliverance?</l><l rend="indent7"> Shall I swear</l><l rend="indent3"> Replied the impatient boy, &amp; laying hand</l><l rend="indent3"> Upon the altar, on his knees he bent,</l><l rend="indent3"> Looking toward Pelayo with such joy</l><l rend="indent3"> Of reverential love, as if a God</l><l rend="indent3"> Were present to receive the eager vow.</l><l rend="indent3"> Nay, quoth Pelayo, what hath thou to do</l><l rend="indent3"> With oaths? bright emanation as thou art</l><l rend="indent3"> It were a wrong to thy unsullied soul</l><l rend="indent3"> A sin to nature, were I to require</l><l rend="indent3"> Promise or vow from thee! Enough for me</l><l rend="indent3"> That thy heart answers to the stirring call</l><l rend="indent3"> Alphonso follow thus in happy faith</l><l rend="indent3"> Alway the indwelling voice that counsels thee</l><l rend="indent3"> And then, let fall the issue as it may</l><l rend="indent3"> Shall all thy paths be in the light of Heaven</l><l rend="indent3"> The peace of Heaven be with thee in all hours.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> How then, exclaimd the boy, shall I discharge</l><l rend="indent3"> The burthen of this happiness; how ease</l><l rend="indent3"> My overflowing soul. O gracious God,</l><l rend="indent3"> Shall I behold my mothers face again,</l><l rend="indent3"> My fathers hall, my native hills &amp; vales</l><l rend="indent3"> And hear the voices of their streams again</l><l rend="indent3"> And free as I was born amid those scenes</l><l rend="indent3"> Beloved, maintain my countrys freedom there</l><l rend="indent3"> Or failing in the sacred enterprize,</l><l rend="indent3"> Die, as becomes a Spaniard! Saying thus</l><l rend="indent3"> He lifted up his hands &amp; eyes toward</l><l rend="indent3"> The image of the Crucified, &amp; cried,</l><l rend="indent3"> O thou who didst with thy most precious blood</l><l rend="indent3"> Redeem us, Jesu help us while we seek</l><l rend="indent3"> Earthly redemption from the yoke of shame</l><l rend="indent3"> And misbelief &amp; death!</l><l rend="indent7"> The noble boy</l><l rend="indent3"> Then rose &amp; would have knelt again to clasp</l><l rend="indent3"> Pelayo’s knees &amp; by kiss his hand in act</l><l rend="indent3"> Of homage; but the Prince preventing this</l><l rend="indent3"> Bent over him in fatherly embrace,</l><l rend="indent3"> And breath’d a fervent blessing on his head.</l></lg><p rend="indent6"> ___</p><p rend="indent6"> 9</p><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> There sate a woman like a supplicant,</l><l rend="indent3"> Muffled &amp; cloak’d, before Pelayo’s gate,</l><l rend="indent3"> Awaiting when he should return that morn.</l><l rend="indent3"> She rose at his approach, &amp; bowd her head,</l><l rend="indent3"> And with a low &amp; trembling utterance</l><l rend="indent3"> Besought him to vouchsafe her speech within</l><l rend="indent3"> In privacy. And when they were alone</l><l rend="indent3"> And the door closd, she knelt &amp; claspt his knees</l><l rend="indent3"> Saying, a boon, a boon! This night O Prince</l><l rend="indent3"> Hast thou kept vigil for thy mothers soul;</l><l rend="indent3"> For her souls sake, &amp; for the sake of him,</l><l rend="indent3"> Whom <del>in our</del> &lt;once in&gt; happier days, of all mankind</l><l rend="indent3"> Thou heldest for thy chosen bosom-friend, –</l><l rend="indent3"> Oh for the sake of his poor suffering soul</l><l rend="indent3"> Refuse me not!</l><l rend="indent6"> How should I dare refuse,</l><l rend="indent3"> Being thus abjur’d? he answerd.

Shrinking then, with both her hands</l><l rend="indent3"> She hid herself, &amp; bowd her head abased</l><l rend="indent3"> Upon her knee; as one who if the grave</l><l rend="indent3"> Had oped beneath her, would have thrown herself</l><l rend="indent3"> Even like a lover, in the arms of Death.</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> Pelayo stood confus’d: he had not seen</l><l rend="indent3"> Count Julian’s daughter, since in Rodericks court,</l><l rend="indent3"> Glittering in beauty &amp; in innocence,</l><l rend="indent3"> A radiant vision in her joy she moved,</l><l rend="indent3"> More like a poets dream, or form divine</l><l rend="indent3"> (So lovely was the presence) than a thing</l><l rend="indent3"> Of earth, &amp; perishable elements.</l><l rend="indent3"> Now had he seen her in her winding sheet</l><l rend="indent3"> Less painful would that spectacle have proved,</l><l rend="indent3"> For peace is with the death, &amp; piety</l><l rend="indent3"> Bringeth a patient hope to those who mourn</l><l rend="indent3"> For the departed: but this altered face</l><l rend="indent3"> Bearing its deadly sorrow characterd,</l><l rend="indent3"> Came to him like a ghost which in the grave</l><l rend="indent3"> Could find no rest. He taking her cold hand</l><l rend="indent3"> Raisd her, &amp; would have spoken; but his tongue</l><l rend="indent3"> Faild in its office, &amp; could only speak</l><l rend="indent3"> In under tones compassionate her name.</l><l rend="indent3"> The voice of pity soothd &amp; melted her,</l><l rend="indent3"> And when the Prince bade her be comforted,</l><l rend="indent3"> Proffering his zealous aid in whatsoeer</l><l rend="indent3"> Might please her to appoint, a feeble smile</l><l rend="indent3"> Past slowly over her pale countenance,</l><l rend="indent3"> Like moonlight on a marble statue. Heaven</l><l rend="indent3"> Requite thee, Prince! she answerd. All I ask</l><l rend="indent3"> Is but a quiet resting place, wherein</l><l rend="indent3"> A broken heart in prayer &amp; humble hope</l><l rend="indent3"> May wait for its deliverance, – even this</l><l rend="indent3"> My most unhappy fate denies me here</l><l rend="indent3"> Griefs which are known too widely &amp; too well.</l><l rend="indent3"> I need not now remember – I could bear</l><l rend="indent3"> Privation of all Christian ordinances; –</l><l rend="indent3"> The woe which kills hath saved me too, &amp; made</l><l rend="indent3"> A temple of this ruined tabernacle,</l><l rend="indent3"> Wherein redeeming God doth not disdain</l><l rend="indent3"> To let his presence shine.

Orpas the perjurd Priest,</l><l rend="indent3"> The apostate Orpas claims me for his bride.</l><l rend="indent3"> Obdurate as he is, the wretch profanes</l><l rend="indent3"> My sacred woe, &amp; woos me to his bed,</l><l rend="indent3"> The thing I am, – the living death thou seest!</l></lg><lb/><lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3"> Miscreant! exclaimd Pelayo.
