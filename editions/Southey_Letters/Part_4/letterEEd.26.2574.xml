                    months ago, – these delays are unavoidable at such a distance &amp; thro such channels of conveyance, – but they are vexatious, when they give occasion for a suspicion of
                    incivility or neglect, where I should be most sorry to incur, &amp; most unwilling to deserve it.</p><p rend="indent1"> You touch upon two painful subjects. Of our dead friend<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Charles Danvers</ref>,

It gave me much pain to hear, as I accidentally did, that you were offended with him, &amp; it gives me more that you should
                    thus have mentioned him with asperity.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Estlin had taken offence at a comment made by Coleridge in his lecture ‘On the Minor Poems of
                        Milton’ (7 April 1814), that Milton represented Satan as a sceptical Socinian. Estlin had communicated his displeasure in a note to Coleridge, to which the latter sent an
                        apologetic reply on 9 April. See E.L. Griggs (ed.), <title>Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</title>, 6 vols (Oxford, 1956–1971), III, 471–2, 477–8, 492.</note> You
                    would find him different only in some of his opinions, a change which would certainly break one bond of union, but should not methinks be allowed to break all ties asunder. You
                    would deem the Churchman a bigot who should &lt;have&gt; renounced all connection with him when he became a Unitarian. It is very likely that he may have thrown out expressions
                    which he himself would not vindicate, in that warmth of language &amp; wantonness of mind which you know are habitual to him. It is also likely that these expressions may have been
                    exaggerated by report, or at least so changed in their bearing by being presented nakedly without all those circumstances which introduced, accompanied, qualified &amp; explained
                    them, as to represent something very different from what they were intended to convey. But as I <hi rend="ital">know</hi> no circumstances could ever abate his feelings of respect
                    for you, I cannot but regret that anything should have thus entirely alienated your <del>good will</del> kindly ones towards him. – As for his conduct, – he can neither be censured
                    nor commiserated too much, – but in those who suffer <del>the</del> most from it commiseration is the feeling which predominates. It is my belief that he labours under a disease of
                    the volition, nothing short of insanity: nosologists perhaps will not admit of the term, where the moral &amp; not the intellectual faculties are affected. But in his case it is
                    the moral part which is diseased while the intellect is as vigorous as ever.</p><p rend="indent1"> You are kind enough to inquire after my domestic concerns.
