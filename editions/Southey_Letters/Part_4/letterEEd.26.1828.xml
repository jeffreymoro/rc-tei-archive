                        (1809), in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (November 1810), 480–514.</note> The beginning was written some weeks ago, &amp;
                    contains some home attacks upon Sidney Smith <del>x</del> in return for his sneers upon the defence of the Missionaries.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sydney Smith (1771–1845; <title>DNB</title>), one of the founders of and leading
                        contributors to the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>. Southey is probably referring to the review of John Styles (1782-1849),

                    judge than I can be; – my gall has been eased by the act of writing, &amp; whether what I have written be published or suppressed
                    is to me a matter of indifference.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey changed his mind when he saw the published
                        article, complaining that many of his more cutting points against Smith were removed prior to publication; see Southey to Tom

The Register<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title> (1811).</note> occupies me so closely that whatever I do for the Review
                    till that be finished must be upon subjects which require no expence of time in collecting materials – matters of speculation
