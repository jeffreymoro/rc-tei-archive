                    the war. It is pitiable to see the weakness of the Ministry, &amp; the manner in which they are baited by a set of curs, who if they &lt;were&gt; but fairly met, would put their

                        (1742–1823; Pope 1800–1823) seemed to be pursuing a reactionary course: the Society of Jesus was restored on 7 August 1814 (after being suppressed since 1773); two Papal
                        congregations were examining the conduct of clergy who had collaborated with the French regime in Rome; and Jean-Sifrein Maury (1746–1817), Archbishop of Paris since 1810, was
                        imprisoned for disobeying Papal orders. In France, the country had been consecrated to the Virgin Mary as its special patroness by royal decrees in 1638, 1656 and 1738. On 5
                        August 1814 Louis XVIII (1755–1824; King of France 1814–1824) ordered the initial declaration of 1638 should be read again in all churches on the Feast of the Assumption of the
                        Virgin (15 August), followed by a special procession of local dignitaries. Southey uses this behaviour by the Catholic Church to criticise those favouring Catholic Emancipation
