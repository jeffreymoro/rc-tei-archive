                  It had, however, become apparent that his former mistress Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776–1852; <title>DNB</title>) had received money
                  from individuals keen for her to use her influence with the Duke, and that the Duke himself had known of her actions. For Southey’s

               doctrine which he advances is that the whole evil consists in the error of having fixed a standard price for gold, the value of which
               like that of every thing else must depend upon the proportion between the supply &amp; the consumption.<note n="13" place="foot"

               Notes he shows to be a mere absurdity. The depreciation of paper money shews itself like that of the stocks numerically &amp; palpable.
               A pound note is not depreciated when it passes for twenty shillings. The fact is that gold has become scarcer &amp; therefore dearer.
