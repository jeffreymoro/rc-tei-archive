                    before passed without a letter since our communication began. How truly has it
                    been said that the first twenty years of life are the longest part of it, let it
                    be ever so long extended. Days, weeks, and months now pass away so rapidly and
                    yet so imperceptibly, that I am scarcely sensible of the sum of time which has
                    gone by, till some business stares me in the face which has been left
                    undone.</p><p rend="indent1"> It is not, however, from uniformity of happiness that time of
                    late has passed so speedily with me. We have had ailments enough among the
                    children to keep me perpetually anxious for the last eight or ten weeks. These
                    are things which a man hardly understands till they have happened to himself,
                    and even then some are affected more by them and some less; but it is one of the
                    weak parts of my nature to feel them more perhaps than the occasion always
                    justifies. I myself have had my share, though not a very heavy one, of the
                    complaints which the unusual length and obstinacy of the winter scattered so
                    plentifully in these parts. And though I have not been idle, and what I have
                    done might be deemed a sufficient quantity for one who had less to do, the last
                    four months have perhaps produced less than any former ones. I readily
                    acknowledge that it may be fortunate for me to be under the necessity of
                    continually bestirring my faculties in composition, otherwise the pleasure of
                    acquiring knowledge, and continually supplying those deficiencies in my own
                    acquirements, of which they who know most are most sensible in themselves, is so
                    much more delightful than the act of communicating what I already know, that
                    very probably I might fall into this kind of self-indulgence. My great poem will
                    not be out before June.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> I am

                    be vexed if the former be either delayed or mutilated.</p><p rend="indent1"> This evening’s newspaper brings great news. The old desire of my
                    heart, – that of seeing peace dictated before the walls of Paris – seems about
                    to be fulfilled.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The French defeat at
                        Laon on 9–10 March 1814 had opened the way for the forces of the Sixth
                        Coalition to occupy Paris, though this did not occur until 30 March
                        1814.</note> But what a dreadful business has this been at
                        Bergen-op-Zoom!<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> An English force
                        under Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch (1748–1843; <title>DNB</title>)
                        failed to capture Bergen-op-Zoom in the Netherlands on March 8 1814, with a
                        loss of 900 killed and wounded and 1800 prisoners.</note> This is the
                    consequence of Government deferring to popular opinion when founded upon false
                    grounds. Graham was extolled and rewarded for the battle of Barrosa,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Graham had defeated the French forces
                        besieging Cadiz on 5 March 1811 at the Battle of Barrosa. This victory
                        proved a significant boost to British morale, but had no wider strategic
                        consequences. Southey disliked Graham both for his criticism of the Spanish
                        army’s operations at Barrosa and his Whig opinions (he was MP for Perthshire
                        1794–1807).</note> – a battle which he ought not to have fought, and which
                    was worse than useless. Government knew this, and felt concerning it as I am now
                    expressing myself. Yet they of course were glad to raise a cry of success, and
                    the Opposition joined it in extolling Graham for the sake of abusing the
                    Spaniards; whereas, in truth, he was infinitely more in fault than La Peña.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> General Manuel La Pena (fl. 1808–1811)
                        commanded the Spanish forces at Barrosa and was widely blamed for his
                        inactivity and failure to co-ordinate his actions with Graham. The incident
                        caused considerable ill-feeling between the British and Spanish
                        armies.</note> After the battle he never ought to have been trusted with
                    command. </p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> Believe me, my dear Neville,</salute><salute rend="indent2"> Ever yours with the truest regard,</salute><signed rend="indent4"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
