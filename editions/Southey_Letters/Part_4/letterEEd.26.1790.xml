                    once delayed, – the difficulty of knowing what to say, – rather the impossibility of saying any thing to the purpose, became a
                    cause of farther delay. What can be said! – of all the persons whom I have ever known you have been the most unfortunate in your
                    family, – but even this, aggravated as it has been by this last stroke, is a less painful consideration to me than to think on how
                    frail a tenure the <ref target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">only connection</ref> rests in which you have found any kind of
                    compensation. You yourself have never appeared to me to be sensible on how very frail a thread it hangs, [two words crossed out]

                    more intercourse during those years than often falls to the lot of persons of different sexes who are not related have given us a
