                    it, as for any person living.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> May had asked Southey to write an inscription to be engraved
                        on a gift for <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">George Coleridge</ref>, to be presented on the latter’s retirement
                        from his school at Ottery St Mary in December 1811. Southey attempted the task, but soon admitted his failure; see Southey to
                        John May, 8 December 1811, Letter 1996.</note> You will therefore give due weight to my reasons for not attempting what you
                    now desire of me. First, the inscription ought to be – in Latin, decidedly; – so it appears to me. Now I have not written a Latin
                    sentence these seventeen years,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. since Southey left Balliol College, Oxford in
                        1794.</note> and, moreover, have read so much of the middle-age Latin, that classical Latinity is one of those things which I
                    have forgotten. This I am by no means ashamed of confessing: on the contrary, it is to my credit that I can afford to forget
                    it.</p><p rend="indent1"> But you will say it may be in English verse – which alone I could do, – having never attempted the lapidary style
                    of composition. This I could do had there been time for it. It is true, little time is required for composing ten or fifteen
                    lines, when the matter is once ready; but it might be weeks or months before I could conceive in what form it ought to be cast.
                    There is no sitting down to these things doggedly. Fifteen years ago<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1796 Southey had
                        composed a prose epitaph, which May thought fit to put on the tomb of his father, Joseph May (1730–1796), in St Marys Church,
                        Hale.</note> I could have answered any of these calls on demand, because I was more easily satisfied with myself. Two
                    instances of later occurrence will show you the state of my ability now. I was requested to write two epitaphs by different
                    persons, and very desirous in both cases of doing it: in the one because I knew and loved the dead almost as if she had been my
                        sister;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The inscription to <ref target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>;
                        published as ‘Inscription XVIII’ in <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 131–132; see Southey to William
                        Peachy, 27 February 1810, Letter 1751.</note> in the other, because the letter containing the request was written in a manner
                    that very much impressed and affected me.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> An inscription for the mother of Southey’s Lake
                        District neighbour Major-General John Peché (d. 1823), of the East India Company’s army. The epitaph was first published in
                            <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 129–130, as ‘Inscription XVII. Epitaph’.</note> Both were fine
                    subjects for monumental inscriptions, and this I immediately felt, and neither of them employed me an hour, but I was six weeks
                    before I could perceive in what manner to shape the one inscription, and three months on the other; and I can safely affirm that
                    no day passed without the subject recurring to my mind, and in some degree harassing me. Heaven knows how long it might be before
                    I could do anything, and when it were done it might very probably be worth very little! You see, therefore, that I have no chance
                    of having verse of mine engraved on silver. If I could do it to my own satisfaction I would most cheerfully, though there are two
                    poets in the family, by either of whom an inscription might be supplied.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> i.e. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</ref> and <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Taylor Coleridge</ref>.

                        Coleridge</ref>, that the inscription should be in Latin. The thing should be classical.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have not the “Privilegios Ingleses,”<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly a copy of the <title>Cartas

                        privileges in Brazil.</note> and shall be much obliged to you to send me the book. <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> will convey it to me.</p><p rend="indent1"> The “Treaties” I have in the “Correio Braziliense.”<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Correio
                            Braziliense</title> (also known as the ‘Literary Warehouse’) was a journal in Portuguese. Edited by Hipolito Jose da Costa
                        (1774–1823), it was printed in London and ran from 1808–1822. It was critical of the Portuguese monarchy and advocated liberal
                        ideas. Southey possessed a complete set, no. 3203 in the sale catalogue of his library. The ‘treaties’ were probably the
                        agreements between Britain and Portugal in 1807–1808 for the Portuguese Court to flee to Brazil under British protection and
                        to open Brazil to trade with ‘friendly’ nations i.e. primarily Britain; and a formal Treaty of Friendship (1810).</note> Do
                    you see that work? The editor’s parallel between the English and Portuguese constitutions is exceedingly able, and I would wish
                    nothing better for Portugal or Brazil than to see its ministers acting upon such principles as this writer holds out. But they go
                    on ill in Brazil. If things can be kept quiet there, the tendency of society now is to mend itself. The English will act upon the
                    people there as they did at Lisbon and Porto, – soften down their intolerance, and teach them commercial industry. What is to be
                    feared is, that the abuses of the Government will increase the disaffection of the subjects, and that the principles of their
                    neighbours on the Plata will spread among them. The provocations which the Spanish Americans have received are very great, I fully
                    admit, but not such as to justify them. I have a good many B. Ayres “Gazettes” of late date,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Gazeta de Buenos Ayres</title>, which ran from 7 June 1810 to 12 September 1821.</note> and the feeling with which the
                    affairs of the mother country are mentioned is precisely like that which the Caraccas deputies<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> A Congress at Caraccas had declared the independence of Venezeula on 5 July 1811.</note> make no attempt to
                    conceal, – sorrow at any event which seems likely to retard the total subjugation of the Peninsula, because that subjugation would
                    seem to justify them, and would remove all obstacles to a free commerce with Great Britain. The more I think of Spanish America,
                    the worse the prospect appears. For the mother country I do not regard the separation as eventually an evil, except that, as in
                    our case with North America, the cause of the separation will always remain a blot upon her history.</p><p rend="indent1"> The best edition of Shakespeare is Isaac Reid’s, in twenty-one volumes.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The variorum edition of Shakespeare edited by Isaac Reed (1742–1807; <title>DNB</title>). It was published in 1803. Southey’s
                        praise for Reed could be due not just to his scholarship. In 1792 Reed had tried, and failed, to prevent the printer of
                            <title>The Flagellant</title> from revealing Southey’s name to the authorities at Westminster School; see Southey to
