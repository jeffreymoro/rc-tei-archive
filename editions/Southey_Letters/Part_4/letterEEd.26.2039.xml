                        ‘Reviewers and magazine-men, the linkboys and scavengers of literature’ Landor singled out Robert Fellowes (1770–1847;
                            <title>DNB</title>): ‘Of late years, if any one had paid any attention to such people [reviewers] … one would imagine …
                        that Aristotle only kept a box for Mr. Fellowes.// This reverent gentleman having settled religion to his mind, but unhappily
                        … driven out from the poets, is retaliating on them as their judge. He writes, or did write, for I know not whether the work
                        survives his hand, in <title>The Critical Review</title>; strange successor to the gentle, but high-minded Southey’, Landor,
                            <title>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His Life and Character</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 146.
                        Landor’s dislike of Fellowes had undoubtedly been fuelled by learning (from Southey) of the latter’s views on his poetry.
                        Fellowes had observed in a letter to Seward of 1803 that: ‘The author of Gebir … has lately made another attempt to convey the
                        waters of Helicon by leaden pipes, and many dark subterranean ways … having trod the dark profound of Gebir, I feel no
                        inclination to begin another journey, which promises so little pleasure, and probably where only a few occasional flashes will
                        enlighten the road’, <title>Letters of Anna Seward: Written Between the Years 1784 and 1807</title>, 6 vols (Edinburgh, 1811),
                        V, p. 77 n. *.</note> I objected to what was said of Croker as in every respect wrong,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Landor seems to have removed his comments on Croker.</note> – to the mention of Lord Riversdale,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Tonson, 2nd Lord Riversdale (1775–1848). His father, William Tonson, 1st Lord Riversdale (1724–1787),
                        was born William Hull and was probably the illegitimate son of the substantial Irish landowner, Robert Tonson (1695–1773).
                        Landor had referred to the 1st Lord Riversdale as ‘the bastard of a scullion’; <title>Charles James Fox. A Commentary on His
                            Life and Character</title>, ed. Stephen Wheeler (London, 1907), p. 90.</note> &amp; the story of Kett.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Kett (1761–1825; <title>DNB</title>), Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, and writer on
                        education. Landor had encountered him during his time at Oxford. Kett features regularly in Landor’s satirical writings and
                        the <title>Commentary</title> related an anecdote about his unprofessional, self-serving conduct; <title>Charles James Fox. A

                    surprize me if he should resolve in anger to suppress the whole. Had he given me a hint of this intended publication I would have
                    begged him to let me see the manuscript; any comments upon it in that state would have availed more, because there would have been
                    no inconvenience in attending to them. Now they will vex &amp; perhaps for that reason irritate him, – because anger is the
                    easiest way of throwing off vexation, or at least of disguising it. Yet I have too good an opinion of him, &amp; believe that he
                    has too good a one of me, – to expect that this will be the case. <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">L.</ref> is a man

                        critical of the interdenominational British and Foreign Bible Society (founded 1804) and urged that Anglicans should found

                    dissenters gain. This is very clear, – Marsh is a logical writer, &amp; all his antagonists are mere children to him. But it would
                    have been better not to have agitated the question, – &amp; to have effected the proposed object in a quieter way by proposing a
