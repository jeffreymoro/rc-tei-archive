The latter has begun Greek under my tuition, and to his great

                    memory that I shall probably go through with this curious undertaking.</p><p rend="indent1"> Has <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> sent you the “Omniana”?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Omniana, or Horae Otiosiores</title> (1812).</note> These volumes are the fruits of many hours of that laborious
                    idleness which is to me the most delightful of all dissipation. I who methodise upon so many subjects, and upon so extensive a
                    scale, may certainly be allowed to smile, if upon this occasion I should be censured for throwing crude materials together without
                    any method at all. My only reply would be, that the person who can find nothing there but what he knew before, is entitled to
                    abuse the book. I have materials, or rather memoranda, marked in the course of many years’ almost incessant reading, which are
                    enough to fill half-a-dozen more such volumes; and if these should sell, I shall certainly put two more to the press. But the sale
                    of books depends upon such adventitious circumstances, that I can form a better guess about to-morrow’s weather, than upon so
                    uncertain a chance. The articles which are not my own, are <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge’s</ref>: they
                    would not have been there (being so few) if I had not hoped to obtain from him enough to have doubled the extent of the
                    collection; and for this I waited so long, as not to leave me time for doing it myself.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am reading Dr. Clarke’s “Travels.”<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The mineralogist and antiquarian
                        Edward Daniel Clarke (1769–1822; <title>DNB</title>). Author of <title>Travels in Various Countries of Europe, Asia and
                            Africa</title> (1812–1816). Southey’s copy was no. 601 in the sale catalogue of his library. Volume I, p. 37 had a
                        particularly unflattering description of Russian life.</note> They give me a very poor opinion of the author’s judgment or
                    powers of mind; but I am thankful for his facts, and find the book on that score exceedingly valuable. His prejudices against the
                    Russians are both ridiculous and mischievous; and an Englishman travelling in Russia hereafter may feel their effects, as English
                    travellers in Sicily have heretofore felt the effects of Brydone’s rascally exposure of private intercourse.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Patrick Brydone (1736–1818; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Tour through Sicily and Malta</title>.
                        An account of a journey made with companions who included William Beckford (1744–1799; <title>DNB</title>), a cousin of the
                        author of <title>Vathek</title>. First published in 1773, <title>A Tour</title> went into multiple editions and was translated
                        into French and German. Brydone’s observations on volcanoes (notably Etna) and electricity gained him election to the Royal
                        Society in 1772 or 1773. Southey owned an edition of 1806, no. 390 in the sale catalogue of his library. William Irvine
                        (1776–1811; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Letters on Sicily. By the Late William Irvine</title> (1813), p. 91, had castigated
                        Brydone for revealing details of private conversations, especially with Abbot Giuseppe Ricupero (1720–1778), an observer of
                        eruptions on Mount Etna. The Abbot’s comments on what volcanic activity revealed about the age of the earth were repeated in
                        Brydone’s book and led to an investigation by the Church. Southey may have seen a pre-publication version of Irvine’s
                            <title>Letters</title> as he was collecting material on Sicily for his chapter in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                            1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 422–437.</note> There is a species of falsehood which consists in telling nothing but truth,
                    but, by telling only a part of the truth, produces all the effects of falsehood, and this is what Dr. Clarke has done. He tells
                    you all the faults of the Russians, and keeps out of sight the good qualities which co-exist with those faults. I know persons who
                    have lived in Russia; they uniformly speak of the nobles as a corrupted and vicious class, but of the people as possessing those
                    good qualities which in a certain stage of civilisation are natural to humanity. In savage life they are like the seed which fell
                    upon stones, and cannot shoot forth: in such a state as that of the Russian nobles, or the English journeymen manufacturers, they
                    are stifled or poisoned; but neither the beard of the common Russian, nor the dust of his house, nor his creepers and crawlers,
                    have any necessary effect upon the natural charities of life. One of his virtues has now been sufficiently proved; he loves his
                    country, and will fight for it.</p><p rend="indent1"> We may look for a battle in Spain, and expect a victory. I feared from the beginning that <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Lord Wellington</ref> was wasting precious time at Burgos:<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> An Anglo-Portuguese Army unsuccessfully besieged Burgos 19 September-21 October 1812. Wellington
                        then retreated back to Portugal to avoid encirclement. On 15 November the two opposing forces faced each other at Salamanca,
                        but the French refused to attack, so avoiding the decisive battle Southey anticipated.</note> the evil will be counterbalanced

                    reputation. It is intolerable to see the obstinacy of the Spanish Government with regard to their enemies; their conduct must seem
                    unpardonable and unaccountable to those who do not know that it proceeds from the national character.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish Army had performed poorly in 1812, being defeated in eight out its ten major engagements with the
