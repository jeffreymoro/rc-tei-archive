                    Ambassador-Extraordinary.</p><p rend="indent1"> What I would say is to dissuade him from this preceptoring
                        plan.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coleridge had fallen ill at
                        Bath in December 1813 and had been unable to deliver his planned course of
                        lectures in Bristol. But he was toying with the idea of starting a
                        school.</note> Supposing that he could so far controul himself as to attend
                    regularly to the most wearying of all employments, the most exhausting of all
                    kinds of <del>xx</del> intellectual drudgery, – supposing that he could depend
                    also upon the regularity of his health; – even if both these <del>xx</del>
                    difficulties were overcome, he would find himself less a gainer at the end of
                    the year than he should by producing a play which would cost him three months
                    labour, &lt;or by any other literary labour in that line.&gt; I advise him
                    earnestly to raise what he can by lecturing for immediate emergencies; &amp;
                    then to come here, &amp; write for the theatre, &amp; for the Reviews. From the
                    Reviews <del>he may</del> alone he may get if he chuses, as much as would
                    suffice to keep <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> at
                    College. Let him but come down here &amp; task himself merely to two hours in
                    the day, – &amp; he will make himself happy &amp; do all that is needful for his
                    family. But the plan of taking pupils would involve him in duties which he will
                    never perform, &amp; in <del>difficulties</del> &lt;embarrassments&gt; from
                    which it may be very difficult to extricate himself.</p><p rend="center"> ______</p><p rend="indent1"> I had forgotten in my former letters to say something about Mr

                        activist, with premises in Brunswick Square. The book is Ezra Stiles
                        (1727–1795), <title>History of the Three Judges of King Charles I</title>
                        (1794). See Southey to Charles Danvers, 15 June 1813, Letter 2269.</note>

                        defective</del> knowing that it might be made up by transcribing from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> L.s. Will you employ some person who writes a clear hand
                    to copy out the eight pages from p. 75 to 82, inclusive, – that I may have the
                    book rebound &amp; this manuscript inserted in its place. The size of the
                    written page must be that of the printed one; – the writing not wider than the
                    letter-press, – as for the size of the writing, it matters not so it be clear,
                        <del>or the eight pages be</del> into how many pages the eight printed ones
                    may be extended. The book is no beauty, – any more than its author at whose wig
