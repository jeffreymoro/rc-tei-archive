               single apartment unoccupied. Behold then the optimism of our having been delayed all night upon the passage. – But I have a dolorous
               void within me. I had no dinner yesterday, &amp; no supper – &amp; the breakfast which I had was lost upon the way. True it is that
               after a mournful parting with my breakfast (you know the pain of such partings) I ate bread &amp; cheese, &amp; drank porter, &amp;
               added to my meat a slice of German sausage civilly offered <del>b</del> me by a fellow passenger, but I accepted it only as receiver
               for the fishes, &amp; in that capacity all that I took was taken, &amp; faithfully paid over to their account. –</p>

               wished to have seen the entrance of the port. Little was lost in this. The Ramsgate captain cheated me, – a la Ramsgate. The agent for
               the packet, seeing <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</ref> size, demanded 16 shillings for her, – the captain
               when he saw her asked for one pound. We offered to pay, &amp; he desired to be paid at Ostend, – then he demanded full price for her, –
               alledging that she had occupied a whole berth. This he knew she must of necessity do when he saw her. Of course I paid the money
               without dispute, &amp; now write down <del>X</del> Capt Aylesbury of the Lord Liverpool for a picaroon.<note n="3" place="foot"

               the rain will continue. The boat for Bruges starts at three in the afternoon, – perhaps we shall not find apartments when we arrive
