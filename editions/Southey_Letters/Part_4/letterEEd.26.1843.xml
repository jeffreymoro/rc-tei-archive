                    written in defence of himself against various attacks in the Mirror, &amp; published in the Morning Post.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Monthly Mirror</title>, 8 (July–September 1810) 26–31, 98–105, 186–196, had published a highly
                        critical ‘Commentary on Coleridge’s Three Graves’. It had been rebutted in a letter signed ‘Ille Ego’, published in the
                        <title>Morning Post</title> on 5 December 1810.</note> Do me the favour to assure him on my word &amp; positive knowledge, that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C.</ref> so far from having defended himself knows nothing
                    of the provocation, – &amp; that if he did I am perfectly certain he would never notice it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> A retraction was printed in the <title>Monthly Mirror</title>, 8 (December 1810), 402: ‘On information which we had many
                        reasons to believe, we treated certain letters in the Morning Post as the production of <hi rend="ital">Mr. Coleridge</hi>,
                        but we have now to state, on the authority of a gentleman, whose word is not to be doubted, that we were entirely misled … For
                        our opinion of Mr. C’s POETRY and <hi rend="ital">prose</hi>, as we have never read any of his works, except the <hi rend="ital">Friend</hi>, we have no apology to make; but for suspecting him of the weakness and meanness exhibited by <hi rend="ital">Ille Ego</hi>, we are heartily sorry.’</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Who the person may be whom your writer supposes, or appears to suppose – to be <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C.</ref> I know not. But some three months ago there
                    appeared an attack upon <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> in the Courier signed S.T.C.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The London newspaper the
                            <title>Courier</title> (15 September 1810) had published an article entitled ‘Some Imitations of Scott’ and signed
                        ‘S.T.C.’. This compared extracts from <title>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title> and <title>Marmion</title> with ones from
                        Dryden, Baillie, Home, Ossian, Pope, Spenser, and Southey (Madoc) in an attempt to prove that Scott had been ‘more
                        particularly … guilty of imitation’. A declaration, supplied by Coleridge, that the ‘S.T.C.’ who had signed the piece on Scott
                        was not the same person as ‘Mr. S. T. Coleridge’ appeared in the <title>Courier</title> on 20 September 1810.</note> It
                    imposed upon the Editor,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Either <ref target="people.html#StuartDaniel">Daniel Stuart</ref>, or his partner Thomas George Street (dates
                        unknown).</note> &amp; obtained admission in consequence of the signature, but it failed of producing any mischief, for I
                    immediately wrote to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> to assure him that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> was not the author of so pitiful a piece of malice, &amp; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> himself publicly disavowed it. – It is not unlikely that the articles in
                    the M Post (I have not seen them) may have been written by this same person, &amp; if they <del>xxxxxxxx</del> &lt;personat&gt;
                        <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> I should have no doubt of it. The man who was rascal enough to forge
                    his signature for the purpose of annoying <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>, &amp; occasioning a breach between
                    two men of letters who are on courteous terms with each other, would be rascal enough to do anything. – With respect to <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Coleridge’s</ref> poetry or prose I shall say nothing – all
                    men who publish are liable to be criticised by the wise &amp; the foolish alike, &amp; I should be the last person in the world to
                    complain either for myself, or for my friends. But as the error into which your Editor has fallen has thus been pointed out, I
                    trust he will not repeat his attack upon that ground.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Edward Dubois (1774–1850;
