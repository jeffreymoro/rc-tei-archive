                        troops were forced to conclude a peace agreement on 20 May and Murat fled to Corsica. He was eventually executed by firing
                        squad on 23 October 1815 after an unsuccessful attempt to regain Naples.</note> Buonapartes only chance is from the
                    dissentions among the Allies, whom I fear it is not easy to keep together; but the struggle is likely to be ended before he can
                    profit by their folly. La Vendee appears beyond all doubt to be thoroughly engaged in insurrection, &amp; he is sending troops
                    there, every man of whom will be wanted upon the frontiers.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> La Vendee was a strongly
                        Royalist region of western France. Napoleon sent an army of 10,000 men to suppress a pro-Bourbon revolt there in 1815.</note>

                    But indeed the conduct of a man who has written a poem upon principles which are purely <hi rend="ital">popish</hi>, is not worth
                    a thought. This Charlemagne of his has so entirely failed of exciting the smallest interest that both <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> wish it not to be
                    reviewed; – a wish to which I very readily assent.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lucien Bonaparte’s poem
                            <title>Charlemagne, ou l’Eglise Délivrée</title> (1814) was dedicated to Pius VII (1742–1823; Pope 1800–1823). Southey
                        inserted a swipe at it in his review of accounts of Wellington and Waterloo, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (July 1815),
                        448–526: ‘The publication of Charlemagne, so ostentatiously announced, was fatal to his literary character … his poem … proved
                        him to be a sorry Homer’ (489).</note> The Jacobines who act with Buonaparte are clearly influenced by no better motive than a
                    hatred of the old family, – the younger part of whom had derived no benefit from adversity. The Duke de Berry<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Ferdinand d’Artois, Duke of Berry (1778–1820), third in line to the French Throne. He was
                        Commander-in-Chief of the Army at Paris 1814–1815, but fled to Ghent on Napoleon’s return.</note> was more especially
                    unpopular: – &amp; it is said that the Duke of Orleans,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> Louis Philippe d’Orleans
                        (1773–1850; King of the French 1830–1848). He was head of the Orleans branch of the Royal family, who would succeed if the
                        ruling Bourbons died out, and had openly sided with the liberal opposition in 1814–1815. His father, Louis Philippe Joseph
                        d’Orleans (1747–1793), had initially supported the French Revolution, but was guillotined during the Terror.</note> after the
                    example of his father, was forming a party for himself in hopes of obtaining the crown, – this is so like insanity that it would
                    appear impossible, if any wickedness &amp; any folly were not possible for an ambitious man. As far as I can judge all things seem
                    tending to draw upon France &amp; the French people &amp; especially upon Paris, the vengeance which they so amply deserve. I
                    trust it will now be placed beyond all controversy that they are a conquered people &amp; that their capital has been taken. For
                    the security of Europe, Alsace Lorraine &amp; Franche Comte ought to be taken from France.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> Only minor border adjustments were made in the post-war Treaty of Paris (1815) and France retained these
