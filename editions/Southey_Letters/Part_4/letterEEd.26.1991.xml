                    you as much as it did me. It is from a work by an old English Physician cui
                    nomen James sive Jacob Primerose. <title>De Vulgi erroribus in Medicinâ</title>.
                    1656. He has a chapter with this title – <hi rend="ital">Maritium loco Uxoris

                        (Amsterdam, 1639), pp. 66–67. The quotation translates as: ‘Amongst very
                        many errors, this one appears to be especially laughable, that a man should
                        believe himself to be ill, and to be afflicted by those symptoms which are
                        characteristic of a pregnant woman, and very many people want this to be
                        confirmed by a test. I had one man who was ill and struggling with fever,
                        with urine which was very fiery and cloudy, who recognised no cause for his
                        illness other than his wife’s pregnancy. Nowhere else in the world except in
                        England do I remember hearing or reading that this has been observed.’ A
                        longer version of this appeared in the notes to Southey’s <title>A Tale of
                            Paraguay</title> (London, 1827), p. 181.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> This you will think odd enough – but odder still to tell, upon

                        America. Southey had borrowed Kinder’s unpublished journal of events in

                        Rio de la Plata. (In 1813 Southey had a copy made of the journal, no. 3162
                        in the sale catalogue of his library. The copy was published as, Malyn

                            and Buenos Ayres</title> (2010).) Kinder had also lent Southey ‘a volume
