                    that time I have read two thirds of one volume, which tho not enough to satisfy
                    my curiosity is, I think sufficient, for forming an opinion of the work.
                    Certainly it is a highly curious work, but I very much doubt whether it would
                    find purchasers enough to indemnify the publication.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> An unpublished English translation by the Austrian
                        orientalist Ritter Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774–1856) of Evliya Çelebi
                        (1611–1682), <title>Seyahatname</title>, which described the latter’s
                        travels through the Ottoman empire. Von Hammer-Purgstall had published a
                        German translation of Çelebi in 1814 and his English version,
                            <title>Narrative of Travels in Europe, Asia and Africa</title>, appeared
                        in 1834. See also Southey to John Rickman, 4 December 1814, Letter
                        2511.</note> For tho there is something for the historian, something for the
                    geographer, something for the statesman &amp; something for the poet, there is
                    very little for the general reader. It is one of those works which a public body
                    should take the expence &amp; the credit of publishing, but alas we have no
                    Academy in England. – Buchanans Travels<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly a reference to John Lanne Buchanan (fl.1780–1816;

                    matter of statistic detail, – &amp; that I believe proved a very losing concern.
                    This has clearly been apprehended in Germany, or the translation would not have
                    been made in English. It would be a fit book to publish by subscription, – if
                    that mode should be adopted. I should willingly be a subscriber: – but for fear
                    it should not find a publisher, you will allow me to keep the mss. two or three
                    days longer. I will go thro <del>them</del> &lt;it&gt; as fast as I dare tax my
