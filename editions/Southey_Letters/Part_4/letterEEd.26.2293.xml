                    myself in the mail coach. I ought long since to have written to you: the chief <del>cause</del> occasion of this silence has been
                    that I am involved in a dispute with the Ballantynes<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Edinburgh Annual

                    proper termination &amp; have been as constantly disappointed. The share in the Register which they induced me to take not as a
                    matter of speculation, but as a recompence for having made the reputation of the work proves to be worth nothing, (at least
                    according to all appearance;) – &amp; not contented with having thus deluded me of 209 £, they are at this time attempting to with
                    hold from me about 225 £ more, due upon the forthcoming volume, upon the plea of loss upon my twelfth share. I have brought up all
                    the necessary papers with me to put into <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</ref> hands if they persist in this which
                    is in direct contradiction to the letter &amp; spirit of our agreement: &amp; I withhold from them the conclusion of the
