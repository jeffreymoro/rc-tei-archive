                    been most profitably spent, has been when in pure despair, &amp; for the sake of my eyes I have een removed to the sofa &amp; gone
                    to sleep. By way of trying what exercise would do I went one day with <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> to the top of Causey Pike, &amp; made my sides sore
                    for three days with rolling great stones down the mountain, – which (be it known to you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedford) is among

                        Britain had suspended the Orders in Council prohibiting trade between neutrals and France on 16 June 1812, hoping to ease
                        relations with America. The government (and Southey) did not know that America had declared war on Great Britain on 18 June
                        1812.</note> – The next Irish <del>que</del> demand will be for a Catholic Establishment, – they who are bent upon a
                    separation from this country can never go upon a more popular ground. I know not upon what grounds they who have concede so much
                    can refuse this proper consequence. I would have <hi rend="ital">given</hi> every thing except seats in parliament &amp; fought
                    against that. To fighting Paddy will bring it at last, &amp; then by the help of the bayonet &amp; the halter he will be quiet for
                    another generation, during which it is to be hoped the increasing industry &amp; prosperity of the country will do that for the
