                    from the pause being on the ninth syllable in the line, exactly where the
                    alliteration must begin. Were you here I could explain this to you in a

                        Odysseus on his return and then dies. In Southey’s poem (Book 15, lines
                        241–279) Theron sees through Roderick’s disguise.</note> which is a heavy
                    objection to it. But you will see to what it tends, – for it makes Rusilla
                    instantly recognise him. You rightly object to Rodericks abrupt departure – this
                    I will remedy; tho to confess the truth I was glad of an excuse to break off a
                    dialogue which it is very difficult to carry on, or to end with effect. – The
                    death of Argus in Homer appears to me overstrained. The effect of feeling it
                    cannot be intended to be, &amp; <del>is</del> an accident should not have been

                        book<del>s</del> contains a scene between Roderick &amp; Siverian wherein it
                    appears that Florinda has exculpated him to Pelayo, – that Pelayo has expressed
                    a wish he were living to resume the crown, &amp; that the old man (never
                    suspecting his companion) has persuaded himself that Roderick is not dead, now
                    that he no longer considers him as dishonoured. The consequence is that Roderick
                    immediately prepares to have Pelayo <hi rend="ital">acclaimed</hi>, – which is
                    the act of coronation. This act begins the 18 book &amp; is followed by

                    him, &amp; he going to throw himself at her feet. The next business after a few
                    essentials about the management of the war-concerns is to carry Florinda back to
                    her father in the Moorish camp, &amp; Roderick with her, &amp; then the
