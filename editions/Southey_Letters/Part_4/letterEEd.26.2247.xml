                        reference to Southey’s review of Patrick Colquhoun (1745–1820; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Propositions for Ameliorating the
                            Condition of the Poor: and For Improving the Moral Habits, and Increasing the Comforts of the Labouring People</title>
                        (1812), in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319–356. At 346–347, Southey had stated ‘To slander public
                        and private characters has become a regular trade in England, and miscreants of one description take to it just as miscreants
                        of another to the more dangerous, but not more nefarious, practice of thieving and robbing; they begin upon players and they

                            Folly</title> (1811–1816). Both magazines depended for their sales on the virulence of their attacks on public figures.
                            <title>The Satirist</title>, 2 (1808), 61, had described Southey as guilty of ‘perpetual and inimitable
                    absurdity’.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> In writing upon the French Revolutionists I concluded the article by promising that upon the Poor, – or rather upon
                    the predisposing causes of revolution in England, saying that we also had our Heberts &amp; our Marats.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s ‘Lives of the French Revolutionists’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 7 (June 1812), 412–438, esp.
                        437–438, had attacked British journalists who were, in his view, abusing the liberty of the press and thus provoking unrest
                        amongst the poor. He had compared them to the journalists and revolutionaries Jacques Hébert (1757–1794), Jean-Paul Marat
                        (1743–1793) and the radical politician Pierre Gaspard Chaumette (1763–1794). All three had met violent ends. Southey’s article
                        had not mentioned Hunt by name, but it did draw clear parallels between revolutionary France and contemporary Britain.</note>
                    – I got the Examiner <del>xxx</del> as a Volume, some year &amp; half after its completion, among other materials for the
                        Register;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title> Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813).</note> –
                        <del>x</del> one volume that for 1811 is all that I have yet had of it. It convinced me that the <ref target="people.html#HuntLeigh">Editor</ref> was a man of good feelings, who was led astray by them, &amp; who was taking a
                    course which would lead him irretrievably wrong, because pride &amp; shame &amp; vindictive feelings &amp; party spirit would
                    chain down his <del>soul</del> &lt;mind&gt; to its errors, – &amp; that which began in a love of general liberty would end in
                    hatred of the government under which he lived. His talents were manifest, – his presumption not less so; this I readily pardoned,
                    – &amp; when I exposed (as I have done in the forth-coming Annals of the year) his blundering predictions respecting the war in
                    Portugal, &amp; the unwise, unjust &amp; unfeeling manner in which he spoke of the Spaniards, I wrote without asperity, or the
                    slightest personal allusion.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was being disingenuous. He had not actually named
                        Hunt, but his target was clear. Southey had quoted and dismissed the <title>Examiner</title>’s observations on the ‘crisis in
                        Portugal’ (<title>Examiner</title>, 9 (20 January 1811), 39), <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813),
                        245–246. That said, Hunt came off lightly compared to Cobbett, who, in the same chapter was labelled a ‘demagogue’ and accused
                        of ‘virulent and malicious misrepresentation’, Ibid., 246.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> But in the same volume there is an unprovoked <hi rend="ital">personal</hi> attack upon <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The
                            <title>Examiner</title>’s reply to an article in the <title>Courier</title>, 25 February 1811, on ‘Mutinous Libels’, which
                        had lamented the Hunts’ recent acquittal for publishing an article condemning military flogging (<title>Examiner</title>, 8 (2
                        September 1810), 557–558). Although the <title>Examiner</title> did not mention Coleridge by name, the concluding paragraph
                        made it clear that he was the target: ‘Retire … to your patrons and a bottle; and there, calling for white handkerchiefs and
                        pouring out libations to the departed <hi rend="ital">Friend</hi>, lament over the shocking increase of humanity and public
                        spirit, so fatal to selfishness and public corruption’, <title>Examiner</title>, 9 (3 March 1811), 131. The next issue
                        published, at Coleridge’s request, a note that denied his authorship of the offending article, <title>Examiner</title>, 9 (10
                        March 1811), 154.</note> And last summer a single number of his paper found its way to one of my guests, containing another
                    passage levelled at him, &amp; alluding in no ambiguous terms to his habits of life,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Possibly a reference to the <title>Examiner</title>, 9 (21 June 1812), 387: ‘A love of drinking, especially if it has any gift
                        of talking to work upon, will make a man exceedingly didactic; … he will sometimes deceive his very self into a notion that he
                        is a worthy person, and attribute his bad habits to a vague sort of destiny that besets him, and renders him more to be pitied
                        than blamed. The most didactic and talkative person of the day appears to be one of this description, and wants nothing but
                        his supply of brandy and water to be set a-doling about the “moral feeling” from morning to night.’</note> – <del>habits
                        which</del> To <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C’s</ref> family those habits <del>have</del> are a far heavier

                        Hunt had married Marianne Kent (d. 1857) in 1809. Their family eventually numbered seven children.</note> – <del>I trust</del>

                    heaviest affliction, – &amp; will occasion a life-long <del>regret</del> &lt;sorrow&gt;. <ref target="people.html#HuntLeigh">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hunt</ref> may judge how I felt towards him when that number of the Examiner came<del>s</del> into the

                    extraordinary.</p><p rend="indent1"> Soon after my article on the French Revolutionists had appeared, a paragraph from the Examiner was copied into one

                        Hunt</ref> had taken what was said of our Heberts &amp; Marats to himself, &amp; challenged the reviewer, – whom he called
                    hireling or slave or some such name, to specify whom he had alluded to.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Examiner</title>, 9 (30 August 1812), 556, where the anonymous author (Southey) of the article in the
                            <title>Quarterly</title> that Hunt felt alluded to him was described as one of the government’s ‘servile scribes’.</note>
                    – Had I looked for a parallel for <hi rend="ital">him</hi> I should have found it in Camille Desmoulins: – an enthusiast for
                    liberty, a man of talents, of good feelings &amp; domestic virtues, – who was led on step by step to concur in the executions of
                    the Royalists first – then of the Brissotines, – &amp; of course took his own turn at last.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> The journalist and revolutionary Camille Desmoulins (1760–1794). The Brissotins were the followers of Jacques
                        Pierre Brissot (1754–1793). They were better known as the Girondins and were ousted from power by the more radical Jacobins in

                    derives its point from circumstances <del>which</del> occurring after it was written, – the <del>arti</del> paper was written for
