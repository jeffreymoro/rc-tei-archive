                        Kehama<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> to the Twopenny Post, directed to the <ref target="places.html#Streatham">Parsonage, Streatham</ref>, – <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> having just taken up his abode there.
                    The second requires a longer explanation, <del>of it</del> such as I trust will carry with it its own apology.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#RobertsWilliamIsaac">A youth of Bristol</ref> died about a year &amp; half ago at the age of nineteen. He
                    spent the last weeks of a hopeless consumption in arranging &amp; putting together his poems, &amp; left them to two of his
                        friends<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref target="people.html#HoggEdward">Edward Hogg</ref> and <ref target="people.html#JamesPaulMoon">Paul Moon James</ref>.
                        Their edition of Roberts appeared in 1811.</note> to be by them published for the benefit of an only sister,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Eliza Roberts (dates unknown).</note> of whom (like Chatterton)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Bristol-born Thomas Chatterton (1752–1770; <title>DNB</title>), whose poems Southey and Cottle had edited
                        in 1803.</note> he was exceedingly fond, &amp; to whom he had nothing else to bequeath. Circumstances have rendered this poor
                    bequest <del>of</del> more <del>importance</del> &lt;necessary&gt; than he foresaw. – His father<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Roberts (dates unknown), a Bristol brewer who went bankrupt in 1793.</note> had been a brewer, had
                    failed, &amp; obtained a situation in the Customs, of little emolument, but sufficient with the profits of a lodging house, &amp;
                    with the sons salary from a Bank (70£) to maintain the family in decent comfort. Since his death the father has been rendered
                    helpless by an apoplectic stroke, has lost his place in consequence, &amp; the family, a mother, grandmother, &amp; daughter, are,
                    I believe it may be said, in want.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#RobertsWilliamIsaac">William I. Roberts</ref> (such was his name) was a youth of very great promise. His
                    verses are as good as a youths of that age can be, where there is no prematurity. I will not say that I should have advised their
                    publication under other circumstances, – in these it is not a matter of choice; – with a selection from his letters &amp; a
                    prefatory Memoir they will form a volume sufficiently attracting for common readers &amp; capable of affecting those of a higher
                    class. They will be edited by <ref target="people.html#JamesPaulMoon">James of Birmingham</ref>, a Banker, the author of those
                    very pretty stanzas upon the Otaheitean Girl which were quoted in the third Quarterly Review.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> ‘The Otaheitan Mourner’: ‘Peggy Stewart, daughter of an Otaheitian Chief, and married to one of the Mutineers
                        of the Bounty. On Stewart’s being seized and carried away in the Pandora Frigate, Peggy fell into a rapid decay, and in two
                        months died of a broken heart, leaving an infant daughter, who is still living’, published in <title>Monthly Magazine</title>,
                        26 (December 1808), 457–458. Two stanzas were quoted by Southey in his ‘Transactions of the Missionary Societies in the South
                        Sea Islands’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 2 (August 1809), 50 n*.</note> We are very solicitous to raise such a sum by
                    subscription, for this volume (a half-guinea book) as may suffice to place Eliza Roberts in a situation where she may support
                    herself &amp; her parents <del>in</del> respectably – accustomed as they have been to better days, their minds are not broken down
                    to their fortunes. – Poor fellow the first wish of his heart was to provide for his sisters comfort, &amp; he did not know that
                    the support of the family would soon depend entirely upon her. The will in which he bequeathed his verses to be published for her
                    benefit was written a few days only before his death, &amp; will I am sure affect you when you see it. – I will not say any thing
                    about their merits – (&amp; yet they are extraordinary relics) – if the book were <del>worse</del> a bad one I think you would not
                    be unwilling to give me your assistance in obtaining subscribers for it. Tell the story to some of your friends, for the love of
                    charity rather than of literature, – &amp; when the book appears I hope you will find that I <del>have</del> might have ventured
                    to say more in its commendation.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> believe me my dear Sir</salute><salute rend="indent2"> Yours truly &amp; with respect</salute><salute rend="indent5"> Robert Southey.</salute></closer><postscript><p><address><placeName><ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>.</placeName></address><date>April 11. 1810.</date></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
