In 1683 Captain William Phips (1651–1695;
                     <title>DNB</title>) made an unsuccessful attempt to locate the wreck of a Spanish galleon off the Bermuda Banks. Acting on advice
                  provided by an ‘old Spaniard’ he searched ‘a few leagues to the northwards of Puerta de la Plata’. Another attempt in 1687 succeeded
                  in locating the wreck on a ‘shoal called The Boilers’, near Puerta de la Plata. Phips received a knighthood and £11,000 (his share
                  of the £250,000 salvaged cargo). The story was told in Tom Southey, <title>Chronological History of the West Indies</title>, 3 vols

                  expeditions were made. In April 1818 one commanded by David Buchan (1780–1838; <title>DNB</title>) and John Franklin (1786–1847;

                  window tax he would have to pay, as this depended on the number of windows in the house. Possibly, he had only been paying tax on
                  the number of windows in the part of the house he had originally rented in 1803.</note> I have great hopes about the Poor

                  determine his liability for poor rates, to support the local poor. Presumably he hoped that the economic situation was improving and
                  thus the amount required in poor rates would decline.</note> – <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</ref> is

                  family, well-connected Lancashire landowners, at Summerhill, near Ulverston 1817–1819. Robert Gregge Hopwood (1773–1854) had married
                  in 1805 Cecilia Elizabeth Byng (1770–1854), daughter of John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington (1743–1813). However she was a first
                  cousin, rather than a sister, of Georgiana Byng (1768–1801), first wife of Lord John Russell, later the 6th Duke of Bedford
                  (1766–1839; <title>DNB</title>). Lady Russell had lived in Lisbon for two years for her health and was known to Herbert Hill and,
                  possibly, John May. Derwent Coleridge was tutor to the Hopwoods’ sons: Edward (1807–1891); Frank (1810–1890); and Hervey
                  (1811–1881).</note> where if he stays two years he is to have 35 guineas for the first &amp; 40 for the second – he will then have
