               the event.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">It was reported in the
                     <title>Courier</title> on 4 July 1818 that Brougham, campaigning as a Whig in
                  the 1818 general election in Westmorland, had attacked Southey and Wordsworth from
                  the hustings on 30 June 1818. </note> Fool as well as liar that he is, he shall

                  knight. Little John, likewise, was the comrade and assistant of the romance–hero
                  Robin Hood. At the start of his literary career, in the mid 1790s, Southey had
                  planned to publish a volume of poems with Robert Lovell under the pseudonyms
                  ‘Orson’ and ‘Valentine’. This did not materialise.</note> this fellow with his

                  he termed the ‘Tender Epistle’. Parts of it were printed, without mention of

                  tour in 1817, Southey had bought, on May’s behalf, Hippolyte Helyot (1660–1716),

                  unidentified work. These books, along with Southey’s purchases, after many delays,
                  were then left for collection at Longmans.</note> If he should not, desire him to
               make inquiry for them. My only reason for doubt upon the subject, is that I wished

                  Hunt (1773–1835; <title>DNB</title>), the radical politician, was a candidate for
                  Westminster in the election of 1818. He attracted large crowds to his election
                  meetings but polled only 84 votes. Hunt was from Widdington on Salisbury Plain,
                  rather than Bristol, but he had invested in a Bristol brewery and contested the
                  seat in 1812, christening himself ‘Bristol Hunt’.</note> Certainly that
                  <del>xxxxxxx</del> townsman of ours does no credit to Bristol. He is not game. Did
               you observe that the <hi rend="ital">Maximus Piscis</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  elections at Nottingham (1796, 1807, 1812), Preston (1818) and Liverpool (1820).
                  At Preston in 1818 he won 1245 votes, only 353 votes behind the second elected
                  candidate. In 1804 Crompton had visited Southey in Keswick; see Southey to John

                  so ‘maximus pisces’ or ‘greatest fish’ is undoubtedly an ironic
                  description.</note> I am sorry that <ref type="m" target="people.html#AclandThomasSir">Sir T. Acland</ref> is
