               very day after I had received his letter, there came another inviting me into the

               think the name of his place sounds, however it may be spelt) is the person who was so
               nearly murdered by the mob at Kendal. I believe in the history of electioneering
               (which would not be a very honourable history for England or for human nature) it
               would be difficult to find a worse instance of the ferocious spirit {of faction} than
               was exhibited in that little town, – for the rabble knew that they were attacking men
               who were not only highly respectable private characters, – but who were their
               neighbours, &amp; benefactors.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Although
                  parliament was yet to be dissolved it was already clear there would be a contest
                  for the first time since 1774 in Westmorland, between Henry Brougham and the
                  candidates supported by the Lowther family. The election canvas produced a good
                  deal of violence, especially in Kendal. Southey is referring to the injuries
                  received on 21 February 1818 by John Fleming (c. 1769–1835) of Rayrigg Hall,
                  Rector of Bootle 1814–1835. </note> But they have been sucking the venom of a
               rascally newspaper for several years past,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle</title> (1811–1834), a
                  pro-Whig newspaper.</note> &amp; the effects have now shown themselves. We are out
               of the sphere of the contest &amp; I know nothing more about it than what I learnt
               the other day from <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref>.
               He understands that <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> can only reckon upon £4000 which Lord Thanet<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Sackville Tufton, 9th Earl of Thanet (1769–1825;

                  Whig in the county and the financial mainstay of Brougham’s campaign.</note>
               supplies – &amp; this will not go far in a county election, especially when the

               have been visited in London &amp; in the West did not extend to us. We have had for
               some weeks past, a succession of windy weather, but no violent storms. – <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref> has been placing

               which there is some obscure organic derangement, &amp; no hope.</p><p rend="indent1"> You were unlucky in not having hit that debate upon the Indemnity
