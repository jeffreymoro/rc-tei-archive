                  (1816) recommended alterations in its operations. ‘On the Poor Laws’,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (January 1818), 264, condemned the
                  operation of the Act without referring to the Report. Southey intimates that

               perceive how greatly it would be for his interest to let me give the review its
               political tone. However for the present we have got a most important paper, – most
               important in two points, for strengthening authority as much as for its remedy for
               the evil of the Poor Laws. No doubt it will produce good.</p><p rend="indent1"> The second Police Report<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The
