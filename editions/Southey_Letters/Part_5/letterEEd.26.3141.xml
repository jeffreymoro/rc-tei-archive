               acknowledging earlier the favour of your last communications.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Craufurd had sent Southey his own thoughts on the Peninsular
                  War and some papers of his brother, Major-General Robert Craufurd (1764–1812;
                     <title>DNB</title>), to aid Southey with his <title>History of the Peninsular
                     War</title> (1823–1832).</note> I now return the printed papers, having
               extracted from them such particulars as will hereafter be useful. I <del>can</del>
               inclose also an amended copy of the Inscription, in which the action of the Coa is
               now introduced.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The combat of the River
                  Coa, near Almeida, Portugal, took place on 24 July 1810 when, under pressure from
                  superior French forces, British and Portuguese troops commanded by Major-General
                  Robert Craufurd fell back to the Coa, and then successfully defended a bridge
                  crossing it. The Inscription to which Southey refers commemorates Craufurd. It is
                  his ‘For the Walls of Ciudad Rodrigo’, one of a series of Inscriptions on the
                  Peninsular War published in his <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London,
                  1837–1838), III, pp. 150–151. The poem deals with the action at the Coa at lines
                  15–20. </note></p><p rend="indent1"> The remarks with which you have favoured me upon the events of the
               Peninsular War will be highly serviceable. In most points they fully confirm the
               judgement which I had previously formed, – in some they correct, &amp; in others they
               will lead me to reconsider it. But it is a great satisfaction to find my own views
               generally in perfect accord with those of so competent an observer.</p><p rend="indent1"> In availing myself of these remarks, as in every other instance where
               I am guided by private documents, I shall <del>of cou</del> be especially careful to
               give no intimation of the source from whence they proceed. Great confidence has been
               placed in me, of which I should prove myself unworthy, if I were not always to bear
               in mind the propriety of this caution.</p><p rend="indent1"> The moral reason which deters you from writing those military
                  Memoirs<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Craufurd did not write his
                  memoirs.</note> which no other person can supply, might perhaps be counterbalanced
               by the certainty that the errors which you are unwilling to notice, will be brought
               forward by others, – &amp; perhaps with exaggerated severity, – while the
               circumstances which led to those errors, &amp; might palliate or in some degree
                  <del>excuse</del> account for them, will not be adduced to explain &amp; to excuse
               them. But the state of your health is indeed an unanswerable objection, – &amp;
               deeply indeed is <del>it to be regretted</del> the public loss to be regretted, – as
               well as the private calamity</p><p rend="indent1"> I have the honour to be</p><closer><salute rend="indent2">My dear Sir</salute><salute rend="indent3"> with the greatest respect</salute><salute rend="indent4"> your obliged &amp; obedient servant</salute><signed rend="indent5"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
