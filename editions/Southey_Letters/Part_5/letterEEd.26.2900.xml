               beauty is all that has suffered any serious injury in these providential escapes. – A
               few lines I write in haste, – because this is an opportunity of conveying them. It
               was desirable to include in the book the matter of certain former articles: &amp; as
               it is proper to state this in a prefatory advertisement that acknowledgement may
               cover as much or as little as is convenient. So the present article goes first into
               the Review, &amp; then great part of it is transferred to the book; – the first part
               with little alteration; the latter with omissions, &amp; additions, &amp; in a
               different arrangement.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Parliamentary
                  Reform’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 225–278 (published 11
                  February 1817), which Southey at this stage intended to form part of a book on the
                  ‘State of the Nation’.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> The sauces I ought to have told you are sold in little cases, which
               Burgess will send per wagon, per se.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 7 December 1816 (Letter 2874) had
                  requested that Bedford procure sauces for Southey from the firm of John Burgess
                  and Son, sauce manufacturers, 107 Strand, London.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> It does not surprize me that I guest rightly at the scheme of the

                  2888) contained a passage for a forthcoming article, ‘Parliamentary Reform’,

                  1817), which he was so sure would be cut out that he placed it in brackets. The
                  passage was indeed not published, though his quotation from Thomas Hobbes
                  (1588–1679; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Leviathan</title> (1651), Chapter 29, ‘Of
                  Those Things That Weaken or Tend to the Dissolution of a Commonwealth’, did
                  appear.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> My table is covered with sedition. How is it that they suffer these

                  November 1816, by removing news items but retaining comment, Cobbett had avoided

                  reducing its price to two pence, and so reaching a wider readership.</note></p><closer><salute rend="indent1">Remember me to all at home</salute><salute rend="indent2">God bless you</salute><signed rend="indent3">RS</signed></closer><postscript><p><date when="1817-01-17">17 Jan<hi rend="sup">ry</hi>.
