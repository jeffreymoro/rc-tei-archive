                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 225–278 (published 11
                  February 1817).</note> – a letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> had previously reached me, he
               told me that he had been obliged to omit some thing “in <hi rend="ital">pity</hi> to
               the <hi rend="ital">terror</hi> of Government.” – he did not however mention half the
               omissions which he has made, – &amp; to do him justice, I must needs say that he has
               done all in his power to render the paper spiritless &amp; worthless. As it stands it
               is a mere pamphlett of the day, holding forth in behalf of ministry, – every thing
               which could be useful, <del>every xxxxxxxation</del> has been expunged. What ideots
               are these men, – &amp; what a fool am I to be trammelled with them!</p><p rend="indent1"> I have a letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> also, – praying that I will give up the thought of embodying my own
               opinions in a separate work,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey intended
                  to use his articles in the <title>Quarterly Review</title> as the basis of a book
                  on the ‘State of the Nation’. This did not materialise.</note> &amp; dole them out
               in the Review, – as the more profitable &amp; more effectual way of getting them into
               circulation. His letter is four days old &amp; I have not yet made up my mind how to
               answer it. The sight of the Review however goes far toward determining me, – <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford </ref><hi rend="ital">dares</hi> not speak my opinions, – &amp; for this I do not blame
               him, – his is rather to be pitied, – or the ministry are to be pitied who dare not
               ever <hi rend="ital">hear</hi> the advice of one of their most strenuous &amp; most
               disinterested advocates. But what devil is it that makes him garble my sentences as
               well as my arguments! Look at p 239 – about the Ed. Rev. &amp; Balaam, &amp; see what
               he has made of the allusion!<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘And we had our
                  wise men of the North, who came forward, like the son of Beor, to take up their
                  prophecy in behalf of the Moabite; but the voice of the country was in accord with
                  its honour and its duty; with its own dearest interests and with those of
                  mankind’: ‘Parliamentary Reform’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October
                  1816), 225–278 (239–240). Here, Gifford’s editing has obscured Southey’s meaning
                  in his equation of the <title>Edinburgh Review</title> (1802–1929), the leading
                  Whig journal, and its opposition to the Peninsular War, with the story of Balaam,
                  son of Beor, who advised the King of Moab on how the Israelites could be defeated
                     (<title>Numbers</title> 31: 6).</note> I do not write to him <del>upon</del>
               immediately, because I am really too much offended at these impertinent mutilations.
               – This matter I thought had been put upon a proper footing. But it shall be so in
               future; &amp; I will have him distinctly understand that I <del>shall</del> {will}
               not submit, like a school boy, – to have my compositions corrected in this manner. –
               Ideots that they are! they call upon me to fight their battles, – &amp; then
               carefully take off the edge of my sword.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am angry, &amp; I am vexed, – vexed, that I suffered this paper to
               go into <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> hands,
               instead of pursuing my own straight forward course. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> is afraid of his Review, – if I
               arrange &amp; republish these papers he says it will subject the journal to be
               reviewed, – silly man, as if it could escape attack by any caution – or any
               cowardice! – He will be the loser by this timidity. And perhaps as the best vehicle
               for conveying unpalatable truths, &amp; bold speculations, I shall put what I have to
