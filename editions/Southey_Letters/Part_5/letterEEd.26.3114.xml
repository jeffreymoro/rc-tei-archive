               interested motives. I want only to enforce the call for public patronage, – that is to say national &amp; government-patronage, without
               which the highest branch of the art can only be pursued in this <del>xx</del> country, by men so careless of every thing but their art,
               that they go headlong to ruin &amp; misery with their eyes open. I want to get pictures into our churches &amp; public buildings, –
               &amp; to press this upon those <del>xx</del> in whose power it is (&amp; who I verily believe do not want the inclination) by
               eulogizing them for what they have done, – for what they are doing, – &amp; for what they will do. Not to complain of neglect; – not to
               reproach the age, or any person or set of person, – but to put them in good humour with themselves by that sort of deserved panegyric
               {of} which every man will take his share, &amp; so to <del>xx</del> win their good will to the proposals – or rather hints, which

                  library. Egede did not keep a journal. Southey’s confusion arose from the fact that much of the contemporary interest in Greenland
                  had been stimulated by the publication of an English translation of a work by Egede’s grandson, Hans Egede Saabye (1746–1817),
                     <title>Greenland, Being Extracts from a Journal kept in that Country, in the Years 1770 to 1773. By Hans Egede Saabye, formerly
                     Ordained Minister in the Districts of Claushaon and Christianshaab, now Minister of Udbye, in the Bishopric of Fuhnen, and
                     Grandson of the celebrated Hans Egede. To which is prefixed, an Introduction, containing some Accounts of the Manners of the
                     Greenlanders, and of the Mission in Greenland</title> (1818). Egede Saabye’s journal had only been published in Denmark in
                  1816.</note> Surely his journal (tho I have never seen it) has been published these fifty years. Greenland &amp; the Moravaian

                  <title>DNB</title>), <title>Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores Veteres</title>, 4 vols (1814–1826), no. 2112 in the sale catalogue of
                  Southey’s library. This was an edition of some of the manuscripts in the library at Stowe. O’Conor was the chaplain of Mary,
                  Marchioness of Buckinghamshire (d. 1812). Her husband, George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham (1753–1813;
                     <title>DNB</title>), provided financial support for the project. The catalogue was <title>Bibliotheca MS. Stowensis. A
                     Descriptive Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Stowe Library</title> (1818–1819). Southey is being a little disingenuous here – he had
                  not met O’Conor or Buckingham, but Buckingham’s nephew, Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, was one of his best friends and he had
                  promised Wynn he would try and promote O’Conor’s edition.</note> – an incomparable book of its kind. I shall have the second volume

               serve him perhaps essentially at the same time, when we can do it, &amp; at so cheap a rate? – It is both unjust &amp; cruel to
               withhold <del>from</del> this from an author <del>when he</del> deserves it. – The cursed system of acrimonious criticism has prevailed
               too generally &amp; too long: keep it for the culprits of literature, for pretenders in <del>xxxx</del> {philosophy} incendiaries in
               politics, scoffers in religion, – those who lay unhallowed hands upon the ark. These are our natural enemies, &amp; may they always

               he might as well have been your friend. – Above all let us do ample justice to those who are most obnoxious: – <hi rend="ital">more</hi> than justice has been done to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WatsonRichardBishopLlandaff">Bp Watson</ref><note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (October 1817), 229–253, there was a favourable review, by
