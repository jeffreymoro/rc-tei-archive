               – &amp; it is very possible that these horrors would have been perpetrated, if it had
               not been for his interference. It is a dismal story. One of the leaders was his most

               subjects connected with the history of the country. He was a man of very superior
               abilities, much greater knowledge than is usually found among the Portugueze, good
               intentions, a noble spirit, &amp; a generous heart. But he <del>xxx</del> ran from
               the miserable superstitions of popery into a more deplorable state of utter unbelief,
               – he was possessed by that revolutionary spirit which even at this time is propagated
