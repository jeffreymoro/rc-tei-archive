                  Oxford and was not ordained until 1819. Southey had met Blackstone in Switzerland in June 1817 at the home of John Awdry

                  activities and provide the Consul with a salary. But in the case of Portuguese ports, a proportion of these levies was paid into a

                  ‘dangerously ill’; see the <title>Morning Post</title>, 25 May 1818. At the time of this report, she was living at Pesaro on the
                  Adriatic coast of Italy. Southey was kept informed of goings-on in Italy by his friend Landor, whom he had visited there in June
                  1817. Princess Caroline of Brunswick was living with an entourage of servants, with one of whom she was thought to be having an
                  affair. The Rome newspapers of 15 May had carried reports that it was being rumoured that the servant in question, Bartolomeo
                  Pergami (1783/4–1842), had been poisoned; see the <title>Morning Post</title>, 8 June 1818. However, Southey’s account came from
                  Landor in a letter of May 1818; see John Forster (1812–1876; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Walter Savage Landor: a Biography</title>,
