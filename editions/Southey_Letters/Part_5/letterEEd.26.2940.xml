                     <title>DNB</title>), leader of the Peasants’ Revolt, referencing his family
                  connections: his mother’s mother, Margaret Bradford (1710–1782) had married
                  firstly William Tyler (1709–1747), and Southey had no fewer than three uncles with
                  the surname of ‘Tyler’. Hence Southey’s jokey name for his play <title>Wat
                     Tyler</title> (1817).</note> by this time, – which is more than I do. I have
               let <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> guide me, &amp;
               suppose that I shall obtain &amp; maintain an injunction.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1794 Southey had sent James Ridgway (1755–1838) and Henry
                  Symonds (1741–1816), radical booksellers, then in Newgate prison, a copy of his
                  Jacobin drama <title>Wat Tyler</title>; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c.
                  12 January 1795], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part
                  One</title>, Letter 123. Ridgway and Symonds did not publish it and it remained in
                  manuscript until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass the now anti-Jacobin
                  Southey, appeared in 1817. Having taken advice from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, Wynn and <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, Southey launched a suit in
                  Chancery so as to gain an injunction suppressing the publication. His case was not
                  heard until 18–19 March 1817.</note> This is all the notice that I am inclined to
               take. Wat Tyler does no more than state broadly &amp; in a very injudicious manner
               (the story being ill chosen &amp; worse managed) the same opinions which I have not
               thought it necessary to expunge from many of my juvenile poems, because there is not
               the slightest reason to be ashamed of having entertained such opinions at such an age
               &amp; in such times. The gradual change in those opinions may be distinctly traced by
               those who think it worth while to trace it, in my many operas, – more especially in
               the Register,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual
                     Register, for 1808–1811</title> (1810–1813), for which Southey wrote on current
                  affairs.</note> &amp; I shall not gratify the scoundrel who has raked up what I
               had consigned to oblivion, by taking any public notice of the affair, – farther than
               by an appeal to the laws. What my opinions <hi rend="ital">are</hi>, &amp; on what
               substantial grounds they rest, these rascals know &amp; feel, &amp; I shall continue
               to make myself felt &amp; understood as long as the necessity exists for such

               thinking perhaps to mortify me, had in reality asserted what in my own secret heart I
               was very much inclined to believe, – that I pointed it out to {the} <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> – asking him if it would not do
               well in an advertisement; – upon the ground that the World liked me sufficiently well
               as a poet, – &amp; only wanted to be told that they ought to give me equal credit in
               the other department. It was half jest with me to provoke the writer, whoever he may
               have been.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The Advertisement for the second

                  the endorsement ‘“We have no hesitation in saying that we like him (Mr. Southey)
                  much better as an Historian than as a Poet.” – Monthly Review.’ The endorsement
                  had originally appeared in the (very mixed) review of the first volume of the
