               <p>Your Lordships letter with its inclosure, followed me to this place, where I am on
                  the eve of departing for the Continent. The intended time of my absence does not exceed
                  two months, &amp; immediately on my return I shall go to press with the first volume of
                  my historical work.

                  this is, especially during the latter months of the war, your Lordship must well know.
                  I have however the prospect of obtaining some, French as well as English. If I may
                  be allowed to point out the manner in which your Lordships offered communications
                  would be most advantageous, it would be in a military sketch of the operations of
                  the army, however brief. Keeping this as a chart before me, I would draw up my own
                  narrative from all the documents which I may be able to collect, &amp; when this was done,
                  submit it to the perusal of your Lordship &amp; of Sir Henry Clinton,
