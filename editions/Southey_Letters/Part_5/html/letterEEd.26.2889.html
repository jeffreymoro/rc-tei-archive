                           who met at various London public houses. Their political ideas were modelled on the
                           writings of Thomas Spence (1750–1814; DNB), the radical journalist and campaigner
                           for communal ownership of land. Southey dealt with the Spenceans in his article, ‘Parliamentary
                           Reform’, Quarterly Review, 16 (October 1816), 225–278, and reproduced their handbill
                           advertising their meetings in Grafton Street at 263.</span></div>
                  </div> One of their meetings is held at the Cock, Grafton Street, Soho, – every Wednesday
                  at a quarter after eight. They must have some publications, &amp; perhaps by enquiring
                  there you might be able to obtain them.</p>

               <p>Spence I remember was punished either for selling the Rights of Man, – or for publishing

                           sales of Thomas Paine (1737–1809; DNB), The Rights of Man (1791–1792) were undoubtedly
                           factors in his imprisonment; in 1801 he was sentenced to a year’s imprisonment for
                           publishing a seditious libel, The Restorer of Society to its Natural State (1801).</span></div>
                  </div> I heard of him many years ago as a fanatic, miserable beyond all men in his mean &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> squalid appearance. As the great landholders most of whom are with Opposition will
                  not much a sect who take No Landlords for their motto, – I am by no means sorry that
                  these <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> consistent Levellers have made their appearance. The handbill is not ill-written,
                  – &amp; they are very far from being such blockheads as the Spa fields politicians.
