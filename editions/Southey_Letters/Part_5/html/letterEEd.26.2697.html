               <p>Mariners information has been put into a very good form for the press, – it is better
                  not to make an expensive book of it, – prints of scenery, costume &amp; natural history
                  in such works justify expence &amp; tempt purchasers, but here you have nothing of that
                  kind. I think you over-estimate the extent of the manuscript. I should not think it
                  contained more than an ordinary octavo volume: – the promised vocabulary which certainly
                  should not be omitted, may be printed in a close type, &amp; cannot occupy many pages.
                  With regard to the composition it is in such a state that I should think the editor
                  has nothing more to do than to prepare a transcript for the press.
