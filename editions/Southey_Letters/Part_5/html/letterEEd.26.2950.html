               (1741–1816), radical booksellers, for publication; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker,

               Wynn, on 17 and 19 March 1817 (Letters 2944 and 2948), for him to forward to the newspaper.
               In the event, Wynn’s absence from home led to a delay in his receiving the letters.
