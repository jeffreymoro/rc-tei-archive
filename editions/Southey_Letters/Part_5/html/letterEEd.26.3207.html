               <p>The lowering of the pulse which led me to drink your honours health in a glass of
                  gin was not produced by green tea, which, as you know I never take at breakfast, nor
                  tea of any kind, if there be any thing else to be had. It came on without any assignable
                  cause, &amp; went off upon the application of the honest dram. Green tea has had this
                  effect upon some half a score times in my life, more particularly when I have taken
                  it in a morning. It is indeed, between ourselves, a matter of surprize {to me} that
                  this bodily machine of mine should have continued its operations with so few derangements, <span class="strikethrough">considering</span> knowing, as I well do, its excessive susceptibility to many deranging causes. The
                  nitrous oxyd approached nearer to the notion of a <span class="ital">neurometer</span> than any thing which <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> perhaps could be desired, &amp; I was acted upon by a far smaller dose than any person <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> upon whom it had ever been tried, when I was in the habit of taking it.

                  considerably changed me – the outside remains pretty much the same, but it is far
                  otherwise within. If hitherto the day has been sufficient for the labour, as well
