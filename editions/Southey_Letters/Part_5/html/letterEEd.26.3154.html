               <p>I have just received <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</a> reply, which is very much what might be expected.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey had sent Murray the manuscript poem ‘Ellen Fitzarthur’ that Bowles had sent
                           to him, seeking advice on bringing it to publication. Murray did not publish it; Longman
                           did, in 1820. </span></div>
                  </div> It is in these words “I will have great pleasure in reading the Ladys MSS poem though
                  unless it be very striking indeed, it will not have the smallest chance of succeeding.
                  I receive at least 500 poems every year, out of which I cannot venture to print six,
                  &amp; of those not one half defray the expences of publication.”</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Times are very much changed in this country with regard to literature, – or perhaps
               I should rather say fashions are changed. A book seller would formerly take the opinion
               of some man of letters, &amp; be guided by his private &amp; unbiased judgement, of the merit
               of the work. The Trade are grown wiser now they have discovered that the success of
               poetry does not depend upon its merit, but upon the humour of the season; &amp; they have
               discovered also, what is not less true that being upon the spot, &amp; being dealers in
               the commodity, they themselves are the best judges of what <span class="ital">will</span> take.</p>
            <p class="indent1">If it were possible I would read this poem with you &amp; explain as we went thro it <span class="strikethrough">why</span> {wherein} any expression is faulty, &amp; why any part or passage requires alteration.
               Generally speaking women write letters better than men, &amp; they write novels better;
               – I do not mean as to the construction of the story, or the conception of the characters,
               – but their language is easier &amp; happier, – they express their feelings more readily
               &amp; therefore more naturally, – &amp; they write the real language of life, when men would
               be thinking of fine composition, – which has much the same effect upon a mans style,
               as it would have upon his manners if he were always to be thinking of his clothes.
               But verse requires a precision <span class="strikethrough">of language</span> both of thought &amp; language (very rarely indeed attained, <span class="strikethrough">by</span> scarcely by two writers in a generation,) to which women are less accustomed &amp; to
               which <span class="strikethrough">indeed</span> their education has not trained them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have the eye, the ear &amp; the heart of a poetess. What is wanting in you is that
                  which I was twenty years in learning, &amp; had hardly acquired when evening prospects
                  &amp; autumnal feelings unfitted me for what requires ardour &amp; an expenditure of spirits <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> which I can no longer support with impunity. C[MS obscured] criticism might most materially
                  have abridged my course, – but it was not my fortune to meet with it. – Your poem
                  deserves to be carefully corrected. The first <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> point to observe is to strike out whatever is superfluous, whatever adds no strength
                  of beauty to the sentence, or repeats what is clearly implied before. For instance
                  – ‘The stone was full, – no vacant space was there.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This line was changed to ‘Bursts from her heart – another name is there’ in Ellen
                           Fitzarthur: a Metrical Tale, in Five Cantos (London, 1820), p. 115.</span></div>
                  </div> – This line exemplifies the fault. The whole of the catastrophe is very finely conceived,
                  – I do not remember a situation more truly or deeply tragical. Here therefore especially
                  any thing unnecessary or feeble should be avoided: “<span class="strikethrough">at length</span> “<span class="ital">conviction came</span> –” is an expression better out of the way.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Another fault to be looked for with a suspicious eye is that of using words, which
               convey a different meaning from that into which they are pressed for the convenience
               of the verse. The word <span class="ital">have</span> is thus used at the opening of the poem, &amp; the couplet in which it occurs had better
               be expunged. The only error of diction which I observe is in the use of the word <span class="ital">laid</span> instead of <span class="ital">lay</span>; the mistake is not infrequently made <span class="ital">laid</span> is the perfect tense of to <span class="ital">lay</span>, not of to <span class="ital">lie</span> – (lie – lay – lay – laid)</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Do not be discouraged at what I say, I am sure you would not if I could <span class="ital">say</span> instead of writing it. I think I could persuade you to go thro the poem, &amp; resolutely
                  weed out whatever displeased you. I myself <span class="ital">rewrote</span> two of my long poems, &amp; a very considerable part of two others.
