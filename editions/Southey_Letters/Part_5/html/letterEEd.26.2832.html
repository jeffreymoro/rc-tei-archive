               to the Battle of Trafalgar (21 October 1805). Designs were drawn up and debated extensively,
               but neither monument was built. Southey’s idea was ingenious as London was desperately
               short of space for burials, though no solution was found until the construction of
               large private cemeteries in the suburbs from 1832 onwards.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
