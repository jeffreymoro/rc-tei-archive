               <p>Yesterday as I was going to dine at the Island I took up my letters on the way &amp; found
                  among them one from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</a> informing me that your son has been involved in the affair at Eton.

                           as ‘Palk’s Rebellion’, that occurred on 3–4 November 1818.</span></div>
                  </div> The news was introduced by speaking of a heavy affliction that had fallen upon you,
                  &amp; I can hardly express <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> how great a relief it was when I found that it was nothing worse, – nothing that affected
                  life or limb, – nothing that touched you in the heart of your affections, – nothing
                  but some temporary inconvenience, &amp; a vexation rather than a grief. It is no ill sign
                  when a boy goes wrong in such cases from a quick sense of honour, &amp; a generous sympathy
                  with his companions: – it shows that the <span class="strikethrough">heart</span> {great principle} is right { – the main spring – } &amp; then we are sure that <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> {every thing else} will come right in time. If I had learnt that John had got for
                  himself the character of being what we used to call at Westminster

                  most irremediable of all afflictions. But this affair will do the boy no hurt in his
                  fortunes, &amp; may even prove beneficial to him by inducing a sense of error &amp; of the
                  consequences of error which may possibly prevent more important aberrations. It is

                  tyranny against the Captain. Without understanding the merits of this case, it is
                  easy to perceive that the boys believed their privileges were invaded &amp; fancied that
                  the Magna Charta of Eton was in danger.

                           inheritance that legally belongs to the donee’s direct descendants. Southey uses these
                           terms to make a pun on flogging.</span></div>
                  </div>) John took the patriotic side, acting upon Whig principles. They are very good principles
                  in their time &amp; place; &amp; youth is a good time &amp; school a good place for them. When
                  he grows older he will see the necessity of subordination &amp; learn that Order should
                  be a more sacred name than Liberty, – or rather that it is only by means of Order
                  that Liberty can be secured. John I dare say already feels that he has done wrong,
                  because he must see that he has grieved his excellent parents. But the sense of having
                  done wrong may be use in softening his spirit, &amp; happy are they who purchase experience

                  more so than I or than any one else could have anticipated, – for I was expelled for

I treated it in a strange whimsical
                  ironical sort of manner, to prove that it was an unchristian practise because it had
                  formed a part of the religious ceremonies of the Heathens, &amp; the Fathers had held
                  that the Gods of the Heathens were our Devils, &amp; so I proved it to be an invention
                  of the Devil &amp; therefore unfit to be practised {in schools}; &amp; tho <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> this was done with very little respect for the Devil, or the Father, or the Heathen
                  Gods, or the Schoolmasters, yet I as little expected to offend one as the other.
