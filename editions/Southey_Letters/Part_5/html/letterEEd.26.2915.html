                  </div> – a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> had previously reached me, he told me that he had been obliged to omit some thing
                  “in <span class="ital">pity</span> to the <span class="ital">terror</span> of Government.” – he did not however mention half the omissions which he has made,
                  – &amp; to do him justice, I must needs say that he has done all in his power to render
                  the paper spiritless &amp; worthless. As it stands it is a mere pamphlett of the day,
                  holding forth in behalf of ministry, – every thing which could be useful, <span class="strikethrough">every xxxxxxxation</span> has been expunged. What ideots are these men, – &amp; what a fool am I to be trammelled

                  them into circulation. His letter is four days old &amp; I have not yet made up my mind
                  how to answer it. The sight of the Review however goes far toward determining me,

                  devil is it that makes him garble my sentences as well as my arguments! Look at p
                  239 – about the Ed. Rev. &amp; Balaam, &amp; see what he has made of the allusion!
