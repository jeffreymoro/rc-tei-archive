                  </div> I received it last night, and rejoice to see such topics treated in a manner so judicious,
                  so forcible, and so impressive. You are treading in the steps of the great and admirable
                  men by whom our church has been reformed and supported; and those who are to come
                  after us will tread in yours. Unless I deceive myself, the state of religion in these
                  kingdoms is better at this time than it has been at any other, since the first fervour
                  of the Reformation. Knowledge is reviving as well as zeal, and zeal is taking the
                  best direction. We stand in need of both when evil principles are so actively at work.</p>

               <p>I am writing the Life of Wesley in such a manner as to comprise our religious history

                  </div> It is a subject which I have long meditated, and may God bless the labour. Perhaps
                  you can give me some light into the reasons why Methodism should have made so little
                  progress in Ireland, where the seed seems to have fallen upon a most ungenial soil,
                  though it was scattered with abundant care. In Scotland its failure may be explained
                  by the general respectability of the Scotch clergy, the effect of education, the scattered
                  population, and the cold and cautious character of the people. Is the jealousy with
                  which the Romish priests watch over their deluded flocks sufficient to account for
                  its failure in Ireland? If so, why was not Quakerism equally unsuccessful?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I will not apologise for asking your opinion upon this subject. Even if we were not
               both fortunate enough to possess the same valuable friends, we are now known sufficiently
               to each other; and men of letters, who hold the same faith, and labour, though in
               different ways, for the same cause, are bound together by no common ties. </p>
