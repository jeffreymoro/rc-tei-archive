               <p>I beg pardon for having forgotten your enquiry respecting my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterHenry">Kosters</a> address. It is simply Pernambuco, – but the Brazil packet goes to the Rio; &amp; there
                  is no communication with Pernambuco except by merchant ships. The best plan therefore
                  will be to consign your packet to the care of his father <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">John Theodore Koster</a>, Liverpool.

                  coarse weaving which is not so mischievous, because only men are employed in it. These
                  suffer something, but not much; – a collection was made several weeks ago; – the amount
                  must have been very trifling, – but nothing more has been called for, &amp; no complaints
                  are heard. Our population is in a deplorable state both as to law &amp; gospel; – the
                  magistrates careless to the last degree &amp; the Vicar who is one of them, has the comprehensive
                  sin of omission to answer for.
