                  </div> – Instead however of reading comments upon that pregnant text I will tell you briefly

            <p class="indent1">You are not too old for marrying, – tho it would have been better to have married
               earlier, – but whether you can make up your mind to the kind of marriage which is
               within your choice is a question which you alone can answer, &amp; perhaps have never
               asked yourself; It is too late to marry for love, &amp; at your time of life you ought
               not to chuse a woman under thirty, – a greater disparity of years would afford less
               chance for happiness. – Most women marry for the sake of obtaining a settlement in
               life, – their condition in this country is very forlorn unless they have fortunes,
               – &amp; fortune falls to the lot of few. If you can resolve to marry a woman who has no
               money, you may find plenty who would accept you <span class="strikethrough">for prudenti</span>, not for affection, but for prudential considerations, – but who would very <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> soon learn to estimate you as you deserve. You could not do this without making some
               worldly sacrifices: – the first indispensable measure would be to insure your life,
               &amp; thus secure a provision for <span class="strikethrough">your famil widow &amp; f</span> her in case of your death; – the next to live upon a scale of expenditure which should
               be within <span class="strikethrough">your</span> the residue of your income by 100 £ an year. There would be no diminution of comfort
               or of respectability in this, for 500 £ a year you could live as <span class="ital">happily</span> as for 5000 £. – In your situation this is what I should do. I might have expressed
               myself perhaps <span class="strikethrough">as better less directly</span> {more winningly} by means of circumlocution, – but you will not require any round-aboutness,
               <span class="strikethrough">or</span> protestations, or qualifications from me.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A walk from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#RydalMount">Rydal</a>, &amp; a weeks continual exercise &amp; excitement have somewhat <span class="strikethrough">tired me &amp;</span> unfitted me for writing just now – therefore it is that I have thus bolted out my
               meaning in blunt words.</p>
