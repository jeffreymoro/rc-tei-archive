               pointing out that Manners had still been allowed to practice as a barrister, despite
               his conviction in 1809 for libelling the opposition journalist Peter Finnerty (c.
               1766–1822), who had himself been imprisoned in 1811 for libelling Castlereagh. But
               Castlereagh did not mention that Manners had also been found guilty of libel by the
               Court of King’s Bench on 2 June 1811 and sentenced to three months in prison – the
               victim was William Hallett (1784–1843), radical candidate for Berkshire in 1812, whom
