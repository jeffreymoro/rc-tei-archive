                  some documents, &amp; shall obtain more, which will enable me to treat the specific subject
                  of the Poor Laws with full information, &amp; a clear &amp; <span class="strikethrough">specific</span> {determined} <span class="ital">purpose</span>, in a way, that coming with the weight of your journal, &amp; in this next number, may
                  assist (very materially I hope &amp; <span class="ital">trust</span>) in ridding this country of a burthen far more ruinous than its national debt. Reforms
                  will be presented at the meeting of Parliament without which the <span class="ital">research</span> &amp; <span class="ital">strength</span> of the article cannot be compleat – &amp; upon such a subject &amp; at such a time I think
                  you will not repine at a three weeks delay, – especially as in that time I shall fit
                  up &amp; finish the present paper for the number after, with this title – On the means
                  of improving the People. – I am giving my whole time &amp; thought to these great subjects,
                  – but the Poor Laws must <span class="strikethrough">xxx xx</span> come <span class="strikethrough">as the</span> first <span class="strikethrough">part</span>, – that we may take the lead in preparing &amp; informing the public.
