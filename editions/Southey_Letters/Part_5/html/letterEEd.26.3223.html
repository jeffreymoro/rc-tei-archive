                  </div> – &amp; the feeling when the weather had so sensibly abated that the danger was over,
                  is the only one I can compare to that which is felt in a case like yours upon the
                  first assurance <span class="strikethrough">x</span> that the disease is giving way. Those writers who speak of childhood, or even of youth,
                  as the happiest season of life seem to me to speak with little reason. There is indeed
                  an exemption from the cares of the world, &amp; from those anxieties which shake us to
                  the very centre. But as far as my own experience goes, when we are exempt from trials
                  of this <span class="strikethrough">kind</span> {nature}, our happiness as we grow older is more in quantity &amp; <span class="strikethrough">x</span> higher in degree as well as in kind. What hopes we have are no longer accompanied
                  with uneasiness, or restless desires; – the way before us is no longer uncertain,
                  – we see to the end of our journey; the acquisition of knowledge becomes more &amp; more
                  delightful, &amp; the appetite for it may truly be said to grow with what it feeds on.
                  And as we set our thoughts &amp; hearts in order for another world, the prospect of that
                  world becomes a source of deeper <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxx</span> delight than any thing which this <span class="strikethrough">world</span> could administer to an immortal spirit. On the other hand we are vulnerable out of
                  our-selves – &amp; you &amp; I are reaching that time of life in which the losses which we
                  have to endure will be so many amputations, – the wound may heal but the mutilation
                  will always be felt. Not to speak of more vital afflictions, the loss of a familiar
                  friend casts a shade over the remembrance of every thing in which he was associated.
                  – You &amp; I my dear Wynn are less to each other than we were in old times, – years pass
                  away without our meeting, nor is it at all likely that we shall ever again see as
                  much of each other in this world, as we used to do in the course of one short term
                  at Oxford. And yet he who is to be the survivor will one day feel how much we are
                  to each other even now, – when all those recollections which he now loves to invite
                  &amp; dwell upon will come to him like spectres.</p>

                  in that reformation of the criminal laws, which cannot much longer be delayed, &amp; which
                  will be infinitely better in your hands than in Romilly’s.

                           the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty. Frankland’s speech had been
                           reported approvingly by Southey in the Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811, 4.1 (1813),

                  that it excites is that of compassion for the criminal. – A man &amp; woman were executed

                           increase confidence in its paper banknotes, to prosecute 870 people for forgery over
                           the next twenty years, over 300 of whom were hanged. On 5 December and 7 December
                           1818 four men accused of forgery were acquitted, leading to charges that the law was
                           out of step with popular feeling on the matter, e.g. Morning Chronicle, 10 December
                           1818. The notorious case to which Southey refers is that of 8 April 1806, when, at
                           Horsemonger Lane jail in Southwark, the husband and wife, Benjamin and Sarah Herring,

                  sentence in all cases proportionate to the crime, &amp; the execution certain, – nothing,
                  in my judgement can be more impracticable, &amp; I am sure nothing could lead to greater
                  injustice than an attempt to effect it. The sentence must be sufficient for the <span class="strikethrough">worst state</span> {highest degree} of the crime, &amp; a discretionary power <span class="strikethrough">given</span> allowed for tempering it to the level of the lowest. – You would take up the matter

               increase confidence in its paper banknotes, to prosecute 870 people for forgery over
               the next twenty years, over 300 of whom were hanged. On 5 December and 7 December
               1818 four men accused of forgery were acquitted, leading to charges that the law was
               out of step with popular feeling on the matter, e.g. <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 10 December 1818. The notorious case to which Southey refers is that of 8 April
               1806, when, at Horsemonger Lane jail in Southwark, the husband and wife, Benjamin
               and Sarah Herring, were hanged, alongside the notorious murderer Richard Patch (c.
               1770–1806, <em>DNB</em>), although their crime was forging small denomination coins.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               had decided to split away from the Whigs in July 1817; he was well aware of his own
               deficiencies as a speaker, which were not helped by his high, piping voice. Brougham
               was not the official leader of the Whigs, but he was one of their most forceful figures
               in the House of Commons. He was a member of a long-established landed dynasty, based
               at Brougham Hall, near Penrith, which claimed to have been established in the area
               since the 11th century. But Brougham was often perceived to be too ambitious and combative
               to be considered a gentleman.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">8.. </span><span class="noteBody">Brougham had been campaigning since 1816 against the abuse of funds by charities and
               in 1818 the Charity Commission was set up, initially to examine those charities providing
               for the education of the poor. Brougham vehemently objected to its limited powers
               and scope in his <em>Letter to Samuel Romilly, M.P. from Henry Brougham, Esq. M.P., F.R.S. Upon the Abuse
                  of Charities</em> (1818). This pamphlet (pp. 51–53) contained some stinging criticism that Winchester
               College, founded in 1382 to educate the ‘poor and indigent’, was attended in the main
               by the sons of by rich men. Liscombe Clarke (d. 1841) defended the College in <em>A Letter to H. Brougham Esq. …: in Reply to the Strictures on Winchester College Contained
                  in his Letter to Sir Samuel Romilly M.P.</em> (1818); and William Lisle Bowles did the same in <em>Vindiciae Wykehamicae; or, a Vindication of Winchester College, in a Letter to H.
                  Brougham Esq., Occasioned by his Letter to Sir S. Romilly, on Charitable Abuses</em> (1818). Brougham’s pamphlet (e.g. pp. 16, 28) also had much to say on the abuse of
               charities in Croydon, including the Whitgift Foundation. Defences of their conduct
               included John Ireland (1761–1842; <em>DNB</em>), <em>A Letter to Henry Brougham, Esq. M.P.</em> (1818). Southey (correctly) perceived Brougham’s actions as an attack on the Church
               of England and an attempt to remove some of its endowments for use in state education.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
