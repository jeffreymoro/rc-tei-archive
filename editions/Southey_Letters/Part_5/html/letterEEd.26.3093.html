               prosecuted by the crown in three separate trials 18–20 December 1817 on the grounds
               that his radical satires, which parodied the Church of England’s litany and the Athanasian
               Creed, constituted blasphemous libel. Furthermore, when he learned that Thomas de
               Grey, 3rd Lord Grantham (1781–1859) had, on political grounds, been appointed Lord
               Lieutenant of Bedfordshire in preference to himself, he resigned his Deputy Lieutenancy
               for the county in a letter to Grantham of 17 February 1818 that became public; see
               the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 11 March 1818. Nevertheless, the Duke had appointed Herbert Hill as Rector of Streatham,
               so Southey’s remarks were a little injudicious.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note27_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
