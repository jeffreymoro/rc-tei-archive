                           The Mother-in-Law, or Memoirs of Madam de Morville, by M. Ann Burlingham (1817). The
                           novel was presented as the memoirs of a woman who was born in Keswick and died there
                           on 17 October 1814, aged seventy-six; her memoirs being then edited and presented
                           to the public by her daughter. The central character was buried beside her father
                           and husband, at the site of a willow tree, which her father had planted. Southey’s
                           reply strengthens the idea that Spafford’s novel was based on real events and people.</span></div>

                  </div> about twelve years ago, he sold the timber upon it to the person who rented the farm,

                  not be <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> the man who should cut it down.” – I have respected the old man ever since. He has
                  left the farm, but the Oak is yet standing.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">There <span class="ital">was</span> within my view a yew tree, likewise of great age &amp; beauty. The town of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> consists chiefly of one long street: &amp; this yew stood behind some houses, which have
               been erected not above twenty years: other buildings have since been built behind

                  than all the rest, &amp; stands a conspicuous object above them all. – If this should
                  be your tree, – I have a deeper feeling connected with it even than yours. I had an <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">only son</a>, of whom it has pleased God to bereave me; – he was my pupil &amp; I was his playfellow; <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xx father</span> I loved him with all my heart &amp; with all my soul &amp; with all my strength, – for he
                  was in intellect &amp; in disposition every thing I could desire, &amp; in acquirements I
                  verily believe superior to every boy of his age. He was the constant companion of
                  my walks; &amp; our last walk was to that Pine Tree. It was not a happy one, – for the
                  symptoms of that disease which proved mortal had appeared sufficiently to disquiet
                  me greatly. But he chose that point for his walk, &amp; enjoyd <span class="strikethrough">for</span> upon the summit something of his habitual cheerfulness. And I well remember that he
                  touched the Tree, &amp; remarked that it must have been planted before the surrounding
                  wood. It is full in view from the window of my study, – but I have never since ventured
                  to the spot.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Tell me if either of these <span class="strikethrough">are</span> {may be} the memorial to which you allude; – or direct me to it if you can, that
               if it be still standing, I may use my endeavours to prevent it from being ever cut
               down.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Tell me also how I may direct some of my recent publications to you. My publishers
               can probably inclose them in a package to New York, if you will inform me to whose
               care they may be addressed. I would fain keep up this intercourse with you, – &amp; if
               you can enable me to ascertain your Tree I will have a drawing made of it &amp; send you.
