               <p>. . . . . . . The loss which I have sustained is, I believe, heavier than any like
                  affliction would have proved to almost any other person, from the circumstance of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">my dear son’s</a> character, and the peculiar habits of my life.

                  </div> The joyousness of my disposition has received its death-wound; but there are still
                  so many blessings left me, that I should be most ungrateful did I not feel myself
                  abundantly rich in the only treasures which I have ever coveted. Three months ago,
                  when I looked around, I knew no man so happy as myself, that is, no man who so entirely
                  possessed all that his heart desired, those desires being such as bore the severest
                  scrutiny of wisdom. The difference now is, that what was then the flower of my earthly
                  happiness is now become a prominent object of my heavenly hopes, – that I have this
                  treasure in reversion, instead of actually possessing it; but the reversion is indefeasible,
                  and when it is restored to me it will be for ever; the separation which death makes
                  is but for a time.</p>

            <p class="indent1">These are my habitual feelings, not the offspring of immediate sorrow, for I have
               felt sorrow ere this, and, I hope, have profited by it.</p>

               <p>The Roman Catholics go too far in weaning their hearts from the world, and fall in

                  God. Far otherwise! They develop virtues, of the existence of which in our own hearts
                  we should else be unconscious; and binding us to each other, they bind us also to
                  our common Parent.</p>

In my communication with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke White</a>, and with poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DusautoyJames">Dusautoy</a>, I have blamed myself for repressing the expression of interest concerning them,
                  when it has been too late. Perhaps they have thought me cold and distant, than which
                  nothing can be farther from my nature; but may your years be many and prosperous.
