The book was a presentation

               him by fleeing to Aragon and claiming the right to be charged under Aragonese judicial
               processes. This led to a prolonged constitutional crisis in Spain during 1590–1591.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               based around Olinda and merchants in Recife (backed by the colonial government). The

               Koster’s manuscript was decidedly favourable to the colonial government – he had sent
