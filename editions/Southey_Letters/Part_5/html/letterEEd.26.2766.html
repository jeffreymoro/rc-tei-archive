                  </div> The affliction which has befallen me is heavier than any person can conceive who had
                  not seen the habits of my domestic life, – how closely they were connected with the
                  studies &amp; the amusements of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">the child whom I have lost</a>, &amp; how he became as naturally my companion as I became his playmate. There is but
                  one source of consolation, – but that source is all-sufficient, &amp; I have drank of
                  it largely. My happiness can never again be what it has been; – yet will the difference
                  be rather in kind than in degree; – there will be less of earth about it, less that
                  is insecure &amp; perishable. He was the main object of my hopes, – those hopes have now <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> no fears to alloy them (for this calamity was always before my eyes) &amp; at this moment
                  with a feeling of perfect resignation at <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> his removal, I thank God for having during so many years blest me with a son who was
                  in every quality of disposition &amp; intellect entirely after my own heart. No mother
                  could possibly have behaved with more admirable fortitude than <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> did during the whole severe trial. We are both as you would wish to see us under such
                  a dispensation, – resigned to the will of God, &amp; grateful for the blessings which
                  we still possess, – blessings such as fall to the lot of few.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am very much reduced in body &amp; in strength. But I am taking all care of myself,
               &amp; a short time will recruit me. I employ myself incessantly, &amp; find not only relief
               in mental exertion, but even pleasure.</p>
            <p class="indent1">God grant that you may never be visited with a sorrow of this kind. My love to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillCatherine">my Aunt</a> &amp; the children. I cannot love <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</a> more than I already loved him, – but as far as is possible he will be to me hereafter
               in the place of my son.</p>
            <div class="closer">God bless you.
