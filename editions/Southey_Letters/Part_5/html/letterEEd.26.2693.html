            <p class="indent2">As this is the first letter which I have addressed to you since the entrance of the
               new year, let me begin, according to good old custom, with wishing you as many returns
               as you can enjoy, &amp; as happy ones as you deserve, <span class="strikethrough">which will xxxx</span> or to express the same thing in other words as I desire.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A kalender month has now elapsed since my return, – I have settled into my usual pursuits,
               &amp; this corpus of mine with an adaptability which is more remarkable than that of the
               mind, &amp; for which I have great reason to be thankful, conforms <span class="strikethrough">as</span> {perfectly} well to the almost total inactivity to which inclination, <span class="strikethrough">x</span> avocation, &amp; bad weather have combined to tempt it. I who <span class="strikethrough">scarcely ever walked</span> during my whole stay in town was every morning on my feet till the hour of a late
               dinner, &amp; scarcely ever walked less than ten or twelve miles per day, have certainly
               not walked ten miles since I returned to Cumberland; – the soles of my shoes have
               been spared at the expence of the seat of my pantaloons.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>During this time I have almost exclusively been occupied upon my poem,

                  </div> – &amp; when you hear that I have written above 800 lines you will not think that I have
                  made an ill use of my time; – the season is past when I could have written that quantity
                  in a week. The subject has grown under my hands, &amp; without departing from my original
                  plan, much more has been introduced into it than it was <span class="strikethrough">at</span> my <span class="strikethrough">orig</span> first intention to have introduced. The title which I have fixed upon is A Poets Pilgrimage
                  to the Field of Belle Alliance.

                           but he was persuaded to refer to it as ‘Waterloo’.</span></div>
                  </div> I now think of adapting to it the first part of the introduction which was written
                  for the marriage poem, – which is to the same metre, &amp; accords perfectly with the
                  tone &amp; manner.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In 1814 Southey, as Poet Laureate, had started a poem celebrating the forthcoming
                           marriage of the Prince Regent’s only child, Princess Charlotte, to the Hereditary
                           Prince of Orange, William (1792–1849; King of the Netherlands 1840–1849). The poem
                           had not been published because the royal engagement was broken off in June 1814. Southey
                           did not reuse these stanzas in The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo; instead he reworked
                           them into The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale (1816) to celebrate Charlotte’s
                           marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790–1865; DNB).</span></div>
                  </div> And I think also of addressing the poem rather than the Tale of Paraguay to you, for
                  two reasons, – first because the address to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</a> has in itself something the character of a dedication,

                           Southey’.</span></div>
                  </div> – &amp; secondly, the first in weight, this work will first be ready, – &amp; life is so uncertain
                  a thing, that it is never prudent to wait for a second opportunity of doing what we
                  are desirous to do.

                  till it is compleated. There will be six parts beside the Proem, &amp; a concluding Hymn
                  for Victory. The Journey, Brussels, the Field of Battle (these are written) – <span class="strikethrough">Belgium</span> the New Kingdom (or some such title, – this I am now writing) – the Return, (a home

                           was abandoned and the ‘Return’ became the ‘Proem’.</span></div>

               marriage of the Prince Regent’s only child, Princess Charlotte, to the Hereditary
               Prince of Orange, William (1792–1849; King of the Netherlands 1840–1849). The poem
               had not been published because the royal engagement was broken off in June 1814. Southey
               did not reuse these stanzas in <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em>; instead he reworked them into <em>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</em> (1816) to celebrate Charlotte’s marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790–1865; <em>DNB</em>).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               and was elected a Fellow in 1792. The review’s author was Charles James Blomfield,

               Gaylard, only eight miles from Sherborne. These references to him may be connected
