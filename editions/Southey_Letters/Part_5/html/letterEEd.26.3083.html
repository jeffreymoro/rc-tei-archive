               landowners, at Summerhill, near Ulverston 1817–1819. Robert Gregge Hopwood (1773–1854)
               had married in 1805 Cecilia Elizabeth Byng (1770–1854), daughter of John Byng, 5th
               Viscount Torrington (1743–1813). She was a first cousin of Georgiana Byng (1768–1801),
               first wife of Lord John Russell, later the 6th Duke of Bedford (1766–1839; <em>DNB</em>). Lady Russell had lived in Lisbon for two years for her health and was known to
               Herbert Hill. Derwent Coleridge was tutor to the Hopwoods’ sons: Edward (1807–1891);
               Frank (1810–1890); and Hervey (1811–1881). He continued in this post until December
               1819, later becoming an undergraduate at St John’s College, Cambridge.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               the course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the woods, frequently
               entered the houses of the Kamtschdales; in many places have attacked and devoured
               the inhabitants; nay traces have even been found of their having killed and devoured
               each other; at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of hunger.
               In several settlements they have killed from two to three hundred bears, the oldest
               Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty.
               The cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past
               there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well
               known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters,
               they easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately
               felt in the Peninsula.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Spa Fields, Islington to hear the radical speaker, Henry ‘Orator’ Hunt (1773–1835;
               <em>DNB</em>). A small group of revolutionaries broke away and attempted to storm the Tower of
               London, looting a gun shop on the way. They were dispersed by troops at the Royal
               Exchange.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note17"><span class="noteLabel">16.. </span><span class="noteBody">A general election was imminent, though the House of Commons was not dissolved until
               10 June 1818. It was already clear, though, that there would be a contest in Westmorland,
               which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were supporters of the government –
               the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790–1867), MP for Westmorland
               1812–1867 and William, Viscount Lowther (1787–1872), later 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and
               MP for Cockermouth 1808–1813, MP for Westmorland 1813–1831 and 1832–1841. So complete
               was the Lowthers’ dominance that the last contested election in Westmorland had been
               in 1774. However, in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller landowners had
               brought forward Henry Brougham to challenge the Lowthers – Brougham’s family home
               was Brougham Hall near Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as a local candidate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
