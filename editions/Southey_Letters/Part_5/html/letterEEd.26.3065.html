                  perhaps an overfine thread, – partly for want of straight forward matter; &amp; partly
                  to take off common attention from the main argument, by the garnish with which it
                  was drest up, – like gilding a pill, or sugaring the cup from which a child takes
                  bitter physic. Not that it is mere garnish, – on the contrary it may make a wholesome
                  &amp; substantial dish by itself in a following number. –</p>
