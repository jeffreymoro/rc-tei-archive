               <p>My estimate of human life is more favourable than yours. If death were the termination
                  of our existence then indeed I should wish rather to have been born a beast, or never
                  to have been born at all; – but considering <span class="strikethrough">more</span> nothing more certain than that {this} life is <span class="strikethrough">a state of</span> preparatory to a higher state of being I am thankful for the happiness which I have
                  enjoyed, – for the blessings which are left me, – &amp; for those to which I look on with
                  sure &amp; certain hope. With me the enjoyments of life have more than counterbalanced
                  its anxieties &amp; its pains: no man can possibly have been happier; &amp; at this moment
                  when I am suffering under the severest loss which could have fallen me, I am richer
                  both in heart &amp; hope than if God had never given me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">the child</a> whom it hath pleased him to take away.

                  determined not to injure a work which has cost me so much labour, by attempting to

                  ever consulted their taste, my reputation would not now have been what it is. You
                  will see that the story of Cardenas is not an episode, – it is the beginning of the
                  great struggle with the Jesuits.
