               had first met Southey in Lisbon in 1796. He moved to London in 1806. Parliament had
               voted £100,000 in 1811 to relieve the sufferings of the Portuguese people following
               the French invasion of 1810–1811. The money was distributed by Commissioners, whose
               report was placed before the House of Commons on 6 July 1814.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               and defeated by Anglo-Portuguese forces under Wellington at Vimeiro on 21 August,
               was allowed to retreat intact, with its weapons, from Portugal. Wellesley, who did
               not sign the Convention, had been superseded in command by Dalrymple and by Sir Harry
               Burrard (1755–1813; <em>DNB</em>). These veteran generals, just arrived in Iberia, were content to make peace. After
               a national outcry in Britain, a Court of Inquiry was appointed, which failed to punish
               Burrard and Dalrymple. They were, however, never afterwards given command.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
