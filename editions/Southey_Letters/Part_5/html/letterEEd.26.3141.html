            <p class="indent1">The remarks with which you have favoured me upon the events of the Peninsular War
               will be highly serviceable. In most points they fully confirm the judgement which
               I had previously formed, – in some they correct, &amp; in others they will lead me to
               reconsider it. But it is a great satisfaction to find my own views generally in perfect
               accord with those of so competent an observer.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In availing myself of these remarks, as in every other instance where I am guided
               by private documents, I shall <span class="strikethrough">of cou</span> be especially careful to give no intimation of the source from whence they proceed.
               Great confidence has been placed in me, of which I should prove myself unworthy, if
               I were not always to bear in mind the propriety of this caution.</p>
