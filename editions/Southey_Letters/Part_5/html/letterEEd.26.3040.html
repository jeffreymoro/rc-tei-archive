               Brunswick (1768–1821; <em>DNB</em>). Such proceedings were very difficult and would require either: an annulment of
               the marriage under the Church of England’s canon law; or the Prince to sue his wife’s
               alleged lover for ‘criminal conversation’, followed by a trial in an ecclesiastical
               court and finally a private Act of Parliament if the Prince wished to marry again.
               The latter proceeding was certainly as arcane as that concerning Abraham Thornton
               (d. c. 1860). On 8 August 1817 he was found ‘not guilty’ by a jury at Warwick Assizes
               of the rape and murder of Mary Ashford on 27 May 1817. Her brother, William Ashford
               (d. 1867), launched a ‘criminal appeal’ (a medieval form of private prosecution) against
               Thornton, which was heard in London at the Court of King’s Bench on 17 November. Thornton
               pleaded ‘not guilty’ again and challenged his accuser, William Ashford, to trial by
               combat. A lengthy legal argument followed, but the Court found that the case against
               Thornton was not so overwhelming that he could be denied the right to trial by combat.
               As Ashford declined to fight him, Thornton was finally acquitted on 20 April 1818.
               The case led to the abolition in 1819 of both trial by combat and criminal appeals.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
