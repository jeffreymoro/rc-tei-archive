               <p>Thank you for the half notes. Had I known the state of my own affairs at the time
                  there would have been no occasion to have written for them. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a> account up to midsummer <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> arrived here on Monday, – &amp; for the first time since there has been a current account
                  between us, (which is ever since I first came into this country) the balance is in
                  my favour. The Pilgrimage <span class="strikethrough">has</span> produced 215 £ by the first edition, &amp; as this was gone at Midsummer I conclude that
                  a second has been printed, tho it has not been advertised in the Courier, nor in Longmans
                  Monthly List.

                  </div> – The tide of my affairs seems thus to have turned. – I know nothing of the Lay, neither
                  how many were printed, nor how many have been sold, but I conclude that so much abuse
                  cannot have been without a proportionate good effect, – &amp; your review will give it
                  a lift.

                  in essential points, as I am ready to yield it in unimportant things. But when I read
                  to him the first canto, he was much struck with it. I tried it upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RogersSamuel">Rogers</a><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                  meanwhile has been ripening, I scarcely know how, while it has lain almost forgotten,
