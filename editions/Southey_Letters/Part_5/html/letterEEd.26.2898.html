                  of these evils I shall throw out, – such as Protestant nunneries, in which women may

                  be leased like Church or College lands, &amp; thus contribute to the revenue. Perhaps

               Southey, Thomas Spence (1750–1814; <em>DNB</em>), <em>Constitution of Spensonia, a Country in Fairy Land Situated between Utopia and Oceana</em> (1801) and <em>The Important Trial of Thomas Spence</em> (1807), and Thomas Evans (1766–1833; <em>DNB</em>), <em>Christian Policy, the Salvation of Empire</em> (1816). The ‘Society of Spencean Philanthropists’ comprised a number of small groups
               of radicals who met at various London public houses. Their political ideas were modelled
               on the writings of Thomas Spence, the radical journalist and campaigner for communal
               ownership of land. By this time they contained a number of revolutionaries, who had
               attempted to lead part of the crowd at the Spa Fields meeting on 2 December 1816 in
               storming the Bank of England and the Tower of London.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
