               <p>I have received no further communications from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a>, – which is very well, as I must finish some few things &amp; rid my hands of them before

                  </div> Meantime the subject occupies my mind in all intervals of employment. Thank you for
                  the papers: – when we talk these things over it will be found that you &amp; I shall not
                  differ upon any material subject; concerning the extent &amp; nature of existing evils
                  my estimates may perhaps be modified by your knowledge, – &amp; you will perhaps agree
                  with me that Government will gain strength by correcting as far as possible acknowledged
                  evils, – instead of letting the Anarchists have the advantage of enlisting good feelings
                  on their side. – I shall take a wide range, &amp; I feel just now as if it were in my
                  power to produce a work which, whatever might be its immediate effect, should be referred
                  to hereafter as a faithful estimate of these times.

                  with his own eyes the state of the manufacturers on the continent. He returned with
                  a conviction that it was necessary to <span class="strikethrough">reduce his own</span> draw in; reduced his produce in time, &amp; in consequence is doing well while his neighbours
                  are breaking all around. – Certain it is that manufactures, as depending upon machinery,
                  advanced very rapidly on the continent during the last war: – no prohibitions &amp; no
                  penalties however severe <span class="ital">can</span> prevent machinery &amp; workmen from finding their way abroad; – <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> to this we must make up our mind, – &amp; it is better that it should be so. – A little

               <p>I incline to think that there will come a time when public <span class="strikethrough">opin</span> opinion will no more tolerate the extreme of poverty as existing in a large class
                  of the community, than it now tolerates slavery in Europe. Meantime it is perfectly
                  clear that the more we can improve the condition of the lower classes the greater
                  number of customers we procure for the home market, – &amp; that if we can make people
                  pay taxes – instead of claiming poor rates the wealth as well as the security of the
                  State is increased. The poor rates <span class="strikethrough">x</span> are a momentous subject, <span class="strikethrough">in which</span> {&amp;} I have long believed you were the only man who could grapple with it.
