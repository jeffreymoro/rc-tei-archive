               Drummers Wife, much afflicted with a Wolf in her breast. The poor woman lived with
               her husband at a town called by the Indians Casco but by the English, Famouth, where
               for some time she swaged the pain of her sore by bathing it with strong malt beer,
               which it would suck in greedily, as if some living creature. When she could come by
               no more beer (for it was brought from Boston along the coasts by merchants) she made
               use of Rhum, a strong water drawn from Sugar Canes, with which it was lulled asleep;
               at last, to be rid of it altogether, she put a quantity of arsenic to the rhum, and,
               bathing of it as formerly she utterly destroyed it &amp; cured herself: but her kind husband,
               who sucked out the poison as the sore was healing, lost all his teeth, but without
               farther danger or inconvenience.</p>

               – On catching a fresh cold, his disorder returned; &amp; was attended with so violent
               a pain in his left side, that it was with the utmost difficulty he drew his breath;
               &amp; was thought to be in great danger of a Consumption. On this I advised him to apply
               the Brimstone plaister to his side. He did so on going to bed, &amp; was much better the
               next morning. This encouraged him to keep it on, &amp; in four or five days (changing
               it once a day) his pain was entirely gone. Since then his health is amazingly restored.
