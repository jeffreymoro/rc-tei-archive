                  the inconvenience of involving myself in a correspondence which could not be satisfactory
                  to him &amp; would be very painful to myself.

                           215–275, especially at 242–243, Southey had criticised the conduct of Dalrymple when,
                           arriving in Portugal as commanding officer, he had, at the Convention of Cintra, signed
                           30 August 1808, allowed a defeated French army free passage out of the country with
                           its weapons and supplies intact. Dalrymple responded by sending papers giving his
                           version of events; see Robert Southey to John Murray, 31 January 1816, Letter 2706.
                           Southey was unable to avoid the correspondence that he here wished to escape; see

                           not sign the Convention, had been superseded in command by Dalrymple and by Sir Harry

                  was; proceeding less from a want of local knowledge than from a want of political
                  wisdom, &amp; a total ignorance of the means by which alone the contest in which we were
                  engaged could be brought to a happy termination. I will <span class="strikethrough">speak of</span> say every thing what can be said in his behalf, to represent things as they appeared
                  to him: I will speak of him where I can (one of the letters which he has transmitted
                  will enable me to do it) with commendation, – never with disrespect. But in this work
                  I take a higher moral ground &amp; a wider political scope than historians have usually
                  done; – &amp; write as I must answer for it to posterity &amp; to my own soul.</p>
