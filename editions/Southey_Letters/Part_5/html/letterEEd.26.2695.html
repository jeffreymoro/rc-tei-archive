            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Did you ever watch the sands of an hour-glass? When I was first at Oxford, one of
                  these old-fashioned measurers of time was part of my furniture. I rose at four o’clock,
                  and portioned out my studies by the hour. When the sands ran low, my attention was
                  often attracted by observing how much faster they appeared to run. Applying this image
                  to human life, which it has so often been brought to illustrate, (whether my sands
                  run low or not, is known only to Him by whom this frail vessel was made, but assuredly
                  they run fast), it seems as if the weeks of my youth were longer than the months of
                  middle age, and that I could get through more in a day then, than in a week now. Since
                  I wrote to you, I have scarcely done anything but versify;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                  </div> and certain it is that twenty years ago, I could have produced the same quantity of
                  verses in a fourth part of the time. It is true they would have been more faulty;
                  but the very solicitude to avoid faults, and the slow and dreaming state which it
                  induces, may be considered as indications that the season for poetry is gone by, –
                  that I am falling into the yellow leaf, or, to use a more consoling metaphor, and
                  perhaps a more applicable one, that poetry is but the blossom of an intellect so constituted
                  as mine, and that with me the fruit is set, – in sober phrase, that it would be wisely
                  done, if henceforth I confined myself to sober prose. And this I could be well content
                  to do, from a conviction in my own mind that I shall ultimately hold a higher place
                  among historians (if I live to complete what is begun)

                  treatment of his wife for having done her duty.

                           (1769–1821; Emperor of the French 1804–1814, 1815), had been condemned to death by
                           the Bourbon regime on 21 November 1815. Louis XVIII (1755–1824; King of France 1814–1824)
                           refused to pardon him. However, Lavalette had escaped from prison on 20 December 1815,
                           on the eve of his execution, by changing clothes with his wife, Émilie de Beauharnais

                  </div> The king ought not to have pardoned him, and the law ought to have condemned him:
                  both did as they ought, and, as far as depended upon them, his civil life was at an
                  end. I should have had no pity for him if the axe had fallen; but a condemned criminal
                  making his escape becomes a mere human creature striving for life, and the Devil take
                  him, say I, who would not lend a hand to assist him, except in cases of such atrocious
                  guilt as make us abhor and execrate the perpetrator, and render it unfit that he should
                  exist upon earth.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Of home politics, I grieve to say that the more I think of them, the worse they appear.
               All imaginable causes which produce revolution are at work among us; the solitary
               principle of education is the only counteracting power; and God knows this is very
               partial, very limited, and must be slow in its effects, even if it were upon a wider
               scale and a more permanent foundation. If another country were in this state, I should
               say, without hesitation, that revolution was at hand there, and that it was inevitable.
               If I hesitate at predicting to myself the same result here, it is from love or from
               weakness, from hope that we may mercifully be spared so dreadful a chastisement for
               our follies and our sins, and from fear of contemplating the evils under which we
               should be overwhelmed. God bless you!</p>
