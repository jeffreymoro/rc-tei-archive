               <p>Had there been the slight probability of your doing any good I should have desired
                  you to come, – but this has long been impossible. There has been a great diminution
                  of strength today,

                  </div> &amp; a total loss of the little inclination for food that remained. We believe that an
                  abscess is forming somewhere in the left side of the breast, &amp; you will perceive how
                  little hope there can be in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">his</a> state of utter weakness. The only favourable circumstance is that wine can be given
                  in almost any quantity, &amp; thus it is that he is chiefly supported. I am as well as
                  I can be under such affliction, expecting the worst &amp; perfectly resigned to it. –
                  I think this event, cutting off as it does the very head &amp; blossom of my earthly happiness
                  – will <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> determine me to leave <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> when my lease expires, – it has just one year more to run. Composed I shall be any
                  where, – but I fear it will be impossible for me ever to feel any enjoyment in this
                  place, when every object both at home &amp; abroad will perpetually remind me of my loss.</p>
