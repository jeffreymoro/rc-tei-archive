               – seeing no other possible reason why they should wish to talk with me. This proposal
               I suppose has been so properly entertained by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</a> – that it has <span class="strikethrough">t</span> not been communicated to me in any way that requires an answer. Fools not to perceive
               that I am doing them ten times the service already, that it would be possible for
