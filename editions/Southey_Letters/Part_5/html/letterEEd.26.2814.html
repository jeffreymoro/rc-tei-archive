                  could you have gratified me more. They bear your stamp – the stamp of the lawful mint

                  </div> I cannot forgive the Dissenters for leaguing with the Catholicks against the Church,
                  – the original cause of dissent being that the Church retained so many Popish ceremonies.
                  They have no common principle, but that of hatred to the Establishment &amp; a union formed
                  upon that principle is abominable. But Church &amp; State will both be overthrown before
                  this generation pass away, unless the Government awakens to a sense of its danger.
