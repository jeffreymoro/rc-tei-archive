               Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty.
               The cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past
               there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well
               known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters,
               they easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately
