               <p>I would not answer your letter till every enquiry had been made in this neighbourhood,
                  – very sorry I am that the result should be unfavourable! There is but one house here
                  which would be large enough for your accommodation, Ormathwaite, formerly D<sup>r</sup> Brownriggs,

                  </div> now belonging to Sir John Benn Walsh.

                           had inherited Ormathwaite. He changed his name to Walsh on inheriting a fortune from
                           his wife’s uncle. His main estates were in Berkshire and he rented Ormathwaite out.</span></div>
                  </div> It is a mile &amp; quarter from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, – two miles from the Lake. The furniture is little &amp; bad, but enough would be added
                  to render it habitable. It would not however be possible to engage it for the month
                  of August, as a tenant in the meantime may very likely be found.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The regular lodging houses are very small, – the best of them has only three beds
               pour maitres, &amp; those for servants are not such as any other part <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> of the family could put up with, being in every respect inconvenient. The case is
               the same about <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a>, – there is no large house, &amp; smaller ones cannot be engaged at that distance of
               time. Ormathwaite would do, if it should be disengaged when you want it, – &amp; tho something
               too far from the waterside, its home view is the finest in this whole vale. As August
               approaches I can inform you whether it be still vacant.</p>
