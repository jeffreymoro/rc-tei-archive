            <p class="indent1">I am almost as much a fixture as my great neighbour <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> himself, – so that whenever you visit <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> you will be certain of finding me. Last Saturday was the first wet day which we have
               had since the first week in May; – a longer continuance of fine weather in this country
               than any person can remember. And yet we have had no drought as in the South, – just
               rain enough for the fields &amp; gardens, which in other places are parched up. The clouds
               have risen this evening, &amp; we have at this moment some of those beautiful appearances
               which a stranger would think well purchased by a wet day. I hope this is indicative
               of another change.</p>
