                           1817, when he contrasted the unwillingness of the government to prosecute Southey’s
                           early radical play, Wat Tyler, for sedition, with its eagerness to pursue radical
                           publications.</span></div>
                  </div> But as calumny Sir has not been your vocation it may be useful, even to yourself,
                  if I comment upon your first attempt.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">First, as to the Quarterly Review. You can have no other authority for ascribing any
               particular paper in that journal to one person or to another than common report; in
               following which you may happen to be as much mistaken as I was when upon the same
               grounds I supposed M<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Smith to be a man of candour, incapable of grossly &amp; wantonly <span class="ital">insulting</span> an individual.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The Quarterly Review stands upon its own merits. It is not answerable for any thing
               more than it contains. What I may have said, or thought in any part of my life no
               more concerns that journal than it does M<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Smith or the House of Commons, &amp; I am as little answerable for the Journal, as the
               Journal for me. What I may have written in it is a question which you, Sir, have no
               right to ask, &amp; which certainly I will not answer. As little right have you to take
               that for granted which you cannot possibly know. The <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> question as respects the Quarterly Review is not who wrote the paper which happens
               to have excited M<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Smiths displeasure, but whether the facts which are there stated are true, the quotations
               accurate, &amp; the inferences just. The Reviewer, whoever he may be, may defy you to
               disprove them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Secondly as to Wat Tyler. Now Sir though<span class="strikethrough">t</span> you are not acquainted with the full history of this notable production, yet you could
                  not have been ignorant that the person whom you attacked at such unfair advantage
                  was more sinned against than sinning. You knew that this poem had been written very
                  many years ago in his early youth. You knew that a copy of it had been surreptitiously
                  obtained, &amp; made public by some skulking scoundrel, who had found booksellers not
                  more honourable than himself to undertake the publication.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note13" id="Note13_return"><sup class="super">
                           (12)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In 1795 Southey visited James Ridgway (1755–1838) and Henry Symonds (1741–1816), radical
                           booksellers, in Newgate prison, to discuss the publication of his Jacobin drama Wat
                           Tyler; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12 January 1795], The Collected Letters
                           of Robert Southey. Part One, Letter 123. Ridgway and Symonds did not publish it and
                           it remained in manuscript until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass the now
                           anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817. Having taken advice from Rickman, Wynn and
                           Turner, Southey launched a suit in Chancery in order to gain an injunction suppressing
                           …</span></div>
                  </div> You knew that it was published without the writers knowledge, for the avowed purpose
                  of insulting him, &amp; with the hope of injuring him if possible. You knew that the transaction
                  bore upon its face every character of baseness &amp; malignity. You knew that it must
                  have been effected either by robbery or by breach of trust. These things M<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Smith you knew! If I am rightly assured indeed, when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">M<sup>r</sup> Wynn</a> reminded you of them, your countenance &amp; gestures indicated that you were uneasy upon
                  your seat. And well, Sir, you might be so! I verily believe that if it were possible
                  to revoke what is irrevocable, you would at this moment be far more desirous of blotting
                  from remembrance the unfortunate speech which stands upon record in your name, than
                  I should be of cancelling the boyish <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> composition which gave occasion to it. Wat Tyler is full of errors, but they are the
                  errors of youth &amp; ignorance; they bear no indication of an ungenerous spirit, or of
                  a malevolent heart.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">For the book itself, I deny that it is a seditious performance, for it places in the
               mouths of the personages who are introduced, nothing more that a correct statement
               of their real principles. That it is a mischievous publication, I know; the errors
               which it contains being especially dangerous at this time. Therefore I came forward
               without hesitation to avow it, to claim it as my own property which had never been
               alienated, &amp; to suppress it. And I am desirous that my motives in thus acting should
               not be misunderstood. The piece was written under the influence of opinions which
               I have long since outgrown, &amp; repeatedly disclaimed, but for which I have never affected
               to feel either shame, or contrition; they were taken up conscientiously in early youth,
               they were acted upon in disregard of all worldly considerations &amp; they were left behind
               in the same straight-forward course as I advanced in years. It was written when republicanism
               was confined to a very small number of the educated classes, when those who were known
               to entertain such opinions were exposed to personal danger from the populace, &amp; when
               a spirit of Anti-Jacobinism was predominant, which I cannot characterize more fully
               than by saying that it was as unjust &amp; as intolerant, tho not quite as ferocious as
               the Jacobinism of the present day. Had the poem been thus published during any quiet
               state of the public mind, the act of dishonesty in the publisher would have been the
               same, but I should have left it unnoticed, in full confidence that it would have been
               forgotten as speedily as it deserved. But in these times when it may be doubted whether
               the publication has not proceeded <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> as much from mischief as from malignity, it was incumbent upon me to come forward
               as I have done {&amp; as I would have done} even if I could have foreseen the <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> audacious defence which was to be made, &amp; the false &amp; injurious <span class="strikethrough">counter claim</span> {pretension} which was to be cast into the scale against my solemn oath. It <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> became me to disclaim whatever had been erroneous &amp; intemperate in my former opinions
               as frankly &amp; as fearlessly as I once maintained them. And this I did not <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> as one who felt himself in any degree disgraced by the exposure of the crude &amp; misdirected
               feelings of his youth (feelings right in themselves, wrong only in their direction)
               but as one whose life may set malice at defiance, whose name is honourably distinguished
               abroad as well as at home, &amp; who is unremittingly endeavouring to deserve well of
               his country &amp; of mankind.</p>

               upon certain points as he did in his youth, he informed that legislative assembly
               of nothing more than what the author has shown during very many years in the course
               of his writings, – that while events have been moving on upon the great theatre of
               human affairs, his intellect has not been stationary. But when the Member for Norwich
