            <p class="indent1">When I tell you that I never saw clearer proofs of feeling &amp; power in the verses of
               a young Poet, you will not suppose that I wish to discourage you from the pursuit
               of poetry, when I disuade you from publishing. Far from it; genius like yours cannot
               fail of success if it be wisely directed; but premature publication would inevitably
               bring with it every disappointment, nor could it possibly accomplish the purpose for
               which it is designed. In what manner then can that purpose be effected? This is what
               I am desirous to find out. –</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The university {will} obviously be the place in which you might have the fairest &amp;
                  surest means of establishing yourself, if means could be found for placing you there;
                  – but if you have been only 18 months acquiring Latin &amp; Greek, it seems scarcely possible
                  that you should have made such progress as would enable you to get on there, if the
                  first great difficulty were removed. – Why the intention of your friends upon the
                  first were frustrated you have not explained; and I should be most unwilling to hurt
                  your feelings by enquiring more than you may be disposed to avow. But if you think
                  it might be of service to you were I to write to the Dean of Canterbury,

                           one of three benefactors who financed Knowles’s education at Richmond Grammar School
                           by providing £20 per year; Knowles’s relations had provided a further £30 per year;
                           and James Tate, the headmaster, had offered help in kind. The plan had been to, eventually,
                           send Knowles to St John’s, Cambridge, as a Sizar. However, his relations had had to
                           withdraw from their part of the arrangement, possibly through financial constraints;
                           see Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 20 November 1816, Letter 2866.</span></div>
                  </div> or any other of those friends, and consult with them concerning the manner in which
                  your interests might best be promoted – I will readily do so.–</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">With regard to your own plan – would <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TateJames">M<sup>r</sup>. Tate</a> like you to remain with him as long as you propose, and at what expence could this
               be accomplished? And have you looked fairly at the prospect which would then be before
               you, supposing you could obtain ordination? Have you any other probability of preferment
               than what you found upon your own talents and deserving? I would not undervalue this,
               – but you must not place too much dependence upon it, and a curacy would afford but
               a bare maintenance. –</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Yet on the whole if there be no prospect of establishing yourself at the University,
                  this seems the most feasable plan; – for if you were only secure of a maintenance,
                  you would live in hope of distinguishing yourself and certainly would do so, if the
                  fruit should bear any proportion to the Blossom. You speak of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TateJames">M<sup>r</sup>. Tate</a> as if you loved and respected him. I should like to know what he most recommends for
                  you. Shall I write to him?

                  placed in a situation which would hold out hope equal to your desert. –</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">But you will ask me why do I advise you not to publish the poem, if it contain indisputable
               marks of genius? Because there is not the smallest likelihood of emolument from it;
               – full of genius it certainly is, and its faults are only Exuberancies which evince
               the vigour of the root from whence they have sprung; – in a very few years you will
               perceive these faults and perceive also the crudity of the plan; – no poet ever published
               in his youth, without wishing in his maturer life that it was possible to recall the
               premature publication. – It is less likely that you would make friends by this publication
               than that they may be made for you without it, by a fair representation of what may
               be expected from you. – And you would certainly make enemies by the attack upon the
               inhabitants of Richmond.</p>
