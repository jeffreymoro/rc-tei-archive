                  past events &amp; in other countries than with the current politics of our own. Heaven
                  knows I have no predilection for a train of thought which brings with it nothing elevating
                  &amp; nothing chearful. But I cannot shut my eyes either to the direct tendency of the

            <p class="indent1">The state of religious feeling appears to differ much in different parts of France,
               – in most places we found {that} the churches were very ill attended, – but at Auxonne
               they were so full, that we literally could not decently walk in to examine them as
               we wished to have done. – In Switzerland the Protestant Cantons have suffered more
               than the Catholic ones. I had good opportunities of enquiring into this in the Pays
               de Vaud, – &amp; the state of religion <span class="strikethrough">of</span> {in} Geneva is now notorious. Upon the banks of the Rhine all the inhabitants who
               were not actually employed in the fields seemed to be busy in performing a pilgrimage
               – it was a most striking sight to see them, men women &amp; children, toiling along bareheaded,
               under a July sun, singing German hymns. I suspect that the progress of irreligion
               has kept pace with the extent of French books in {the} Catholic part of Europe, &amp;
               that where they have not found their way, the people remain in the same state as before.
               But if things remain quiet for one generation the Catholic Church will recover its
               ascendancy – its Clergy are wise as serpents; – &amp; with all their errors, one cannot,
               considering all things, but heartily wish them success.</p>
