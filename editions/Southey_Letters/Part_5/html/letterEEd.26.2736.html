               Parthenon in Athens. Finding himself in debt, he sought to sell them to the British
               Museum. Considerable controversy ensued about their worth, artistic and monetary,
               and a parliamentary committee decided in 1816 that they should be purchased for £35,000.
               The controversy was compounded when the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> (25 (October 1815), 285–310) published accusations that Elgin had, when Ambassador
               Extraordinary in Constantinople in 1799–1803, appropriated the papers (and valuable
               artefacts) of the classicist John Tweddell (1769–1799; <em>DNB</em>), after his death in Athens. The accusations were criticised in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 14 (October 1815), 257–273. In 1816, Elgin was defended by his chaplain in Constantinople,
               Dr Philip Hunt (1772–1838), who published a <em>Narrative of What is Known Respecting the Literary Remains of the Late John Tweddell</em>.

               1831–1865) married Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent. The Prince’s
               arms are described in the epithalamion Southey wrote for the wedding, <em>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</em> (1816), ‘The Dream’, stanzas 19–21. Southey was particularly concerned about the
               Prince’s arms because he wanted to reuse sections of the poem he had initially drafted
               in 1814 for the Princess’s engagement to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (1792–1849;
               King of the Netherlands 1840–1849). The sections in question included stanzas in which
               Princess Charlotte appeared with the lion who is one of the supporters of the British
               Royal Coat of Arms and Prince William with the lion who is a supporter of the Netherlands
               Coat of Arms. Comparing the published text with this draft in Keswick Museum and Art
               Gallery, Box B/414, shows that Southey was fortunately able to change Prince William’s
               ‘Belgic’ lion into Prince Leopold’s ‘Saxon’ lion, as the lion was also a supporter
               on the coat of arms of the House of Saxe-Coburg.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
