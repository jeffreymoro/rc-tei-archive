               <p>You have probably learnt from the newspapers that at the time when your packet arrived
                  we were suffering under the severest of all afflictions, – the loss of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">our only son</a>, &amp; that son one of the most hopeful in every respect that ever parents were blest
                  with.

                  </div> Under such a sorrow it is only a firm, a lively &amp; an abiding faith which could support
                  us.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I wish it were in my power to render any service to your friend M<sup>rs</sup> Steele,

                           (2)

                           (dates unknown), published the poem Southey criticises here, at her own expense: Eva:
                           an Historical Poem, with Notes, Accompanied by Some Lyric Poems (Dublin, 1816). Sarah
                           Steele was, like the Lovells, from a Quaker family, the Manlys of Tullamore.</span></div>
                  </div> or to offer her any useful advice. She certainly possesses great genius, &amp; many parts
                  of her poem are very beautiful both in feeling &amp; expression; – I would not say this
                  unless I thought so. But London booksellers are not fond of publishing poetry unless
                  it comes from some known name, for otherwise not one volume in fifty pays the expense
                  of publication.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Eva is defective in story. The best way, as it appears to me in which your friend<span class="strikethrough">s</span> could exercise &amp; improve her talents, is by taking some story from Romance, Eastern
               or Fairy Tales, &amp; clothing it in verse: – great poets have not disdained to do this.
               In this way I feel confident that with her powers she would <span class="strikethrough">attain</span> distinguish herself greatly, &amp; the habits of narrative invention &amp; arrangement would
               gradually be acquired. It would be doing injustice to my own feelings if I did not
               repeat that this present volume bears the best marks of promise, – &amp; that every person
               to whom I have shown it has admired it very much.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerMary">Mary</a> is a sad invalid, – the greater part of her time is past in a state of suffering
               from complaints which in no degree endanger life, – but deprive it of almost all enjoyment.
               There are however intervals when it appears as if she ailed nothing. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobertJr">Robert</a> is still with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PopleWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Pople</a>, his apprenticeship will expire next year, &amp; then of course we shall be anxious concerning
               him. He has been seriously indisposed this spring with an obstinate cough of some
               months standing, – which is now giving way.</p>

               <p>For ourselves till this late affliction (the heaviest which could possibly have befallen
                  us) no persons were more abundantly blessed. And we have still more blessings than
                  falls to the lot of the greater part of mankind, – tho the flower of our hopes &amp; happiness
                  is cut off. We are both beginning to show the hand of time, – my own head is thickly
                  sprinkled with grey hairs, – but the last two months have done more toward depriving
                  me of a youthful hilarity of spirits, – than the course of years perhaps would ever
                  have accomplished. We have four girls, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">the eldest</a> has just compleated her twelfth year, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">the youngest</a> is about three:
