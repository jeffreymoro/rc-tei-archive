                  has been in his manhood, and is now in the decline of his life; who, blessed be God,
                  has little to be ashamed before man, of any of his thoughts, words, or actions, whatever

               and it is possible that the postscript he published as part of this letter ([c. 24
               March 1817]) did not belong to it, but was taken from another letter of Southey’s
               which does not appear to have survived but dated from late March or early April 1817.
               This is suggested by the postscript’s mention of Southey’s pamphlet <em>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.</em>, which was not begun until 26 March 1817; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams
               Wynn, 26 March 1817, Letter 2957.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
