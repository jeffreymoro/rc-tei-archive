               he had confused an earlier paragraph on Richelieu with the account of this incident
               in George Ensor (1769–1843), <em>The Independent Man: Or, An Essay on the Formation and Development of Those Principles
                  and Faculties of the Human Mind Which Constitute Moral and Intellectual Excellence</em>, 2 vols (London, 1806), II, p. 321. The libeller was actually Pierre-François Guyot
               Desfontaines (1685–1745), who defamed the minister Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy,
               Comte d’Argenson (1696–1764) and, when questioned, gave the explanation Southey records.
               D’Argenson replied that he did not see the necessity of Desfontaine living.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
