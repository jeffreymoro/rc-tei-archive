            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thank you for your list of Governors and Bishops,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For the third volume of Southey’s History of Brazil (1810–1819).</span></div>
                  </div> for all you have done for me, and all you are doing. I am hard at work as usual, and
                  have at this time the 48th sheet of the third volume lying before me: when the volume
                  reaches you, you will see in more parts than one of what you use you have been. The
                  end of my long labours is at last fairly in view, there is a great pleasure in completing
                  anything, more especially a work of such extent and difficulty as this, which I verily
                  believe to be the most laborious history in our language. As soon as it is finished
                  I go to press with the History of the Peninsula War,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                  </div> which will excite much more immediate attention. But I am far from regretting that
                  so much time and labour has been bestowed upon a subject for which few English readers
                  (such as readers now are) can be expected to feel much interest. No other person could
                  have brought the same industry and the same advantages to the task: – an Englishman
                  would have wanted the wide scope of Portuguese knowledge and the Portuguese feeling
                  to which so many years conversance with Portuguese literature had given me; and on
                  the other hand a native of Portugal or Brazil would have been shackled by many prejudices
                  or political considerations, and his ignorance on some points would have counter-balanced
                  his superior knowledge which he would have possessed on others. What I have done is
                  in many parts very imperfect; it is nevertheless even now a great achievement, as
                  long as I live I shall carefully correct and enlarge it from whatever documents written
                  or printed, may come to my hands, and centuries hence, when Brazil shall have become
                  the great and prosperous country which one day it must be, I shall be regarded there
                  as the first person who ever attempted to give a consistent form to its crude, unconnected
                  and neglected history.</p>

                  for Para must be the chief port for Mato Grosso, and the facilities of water communication
                  in all directions seem to offer an interminable field for enterprise and commerce.
