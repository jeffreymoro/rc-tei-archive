                  talents. I doubt the extent of his foresight, &amp; the wisdom of many of his measures:
                  – perhaps there would be little difference in our opinions, now that we must look
                  back upon his administration as a part of past history.</p>

                  </div> I consider him as the most influential mind of the last century, – the man who will
                  have produced the greatest effects centuries, or perhaps millenniums hence, if the
                  present race of men should continue so long. The early excesses of Methodism I can
                  account &amp; allow for. I admire his tolerant &amp; truly catholic spirit; &amp; I accord so
                  far with his opinions, as they are expressed in his latter years, that where he goes
                  beyond me in his belief I feel a conviction it is because I have not {yet} advanced
                  far enough. I wish he had been less credulous, – his credulity weakens the effect
                  of his testimony, &amp; the weight of his opinion. For instance, – I am as deeply &amp; fully
                  persuaded as he was that the spirits of the departed are sometimes permitted to manifest
                  themselves; – there is a body of evidence upon this subject <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> which it is impossible for me to disbelieve; besides it is good that it should be
                  so, &amp; this with me (in such matters) is sufficient reason for concluding that it is
                  probable, – but it is also probable upon the strictest reasoning. But I do not believe
                  in witchcraft, &amp; very much doubt the reality of demoniacal possession, – even however
                  if both were admitted the absurd stories which he credited impeach his judgement,
                  &amp; consequently weaken the force of his authority when he is right.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I shall very soon begin upon an essential &amp; interesting part of the work, – a view

                  </div> Even now after all that the Methodists have done, &amp; all that they have caused the

                  – &amp; then we wonder to find that a more active spirit has been sowing tares! I am not
                  surprized at the result of these late trials, – they are a fit &amp; proper example of
