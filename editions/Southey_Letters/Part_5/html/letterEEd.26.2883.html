                           Bloomfield, who had been reduced to poverty by the bankruptcy of his publishers and
                           by illness. </span></div>

                  feeling in the case, – we might reckon upon some sense of shame, &amp; a wholesome consciousness
                  of the obloquy attendant upon a refusal. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> agreed with me that this would be the best plan if it could be effected. But the letter
