               <p>I thank you very sincerely for your letter. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> attaches more importance to my intent, &amp; more meaning also than belonged to it. But
                  I have no wish to affect singularity, &amp; no disposition to run counter to friendly
                  admonition. The title therefore shall be A Pilgrimage to Waterloo.

                  </div> It seems to me that he has been circumcised to very little purpose, – it was not worth
                  while to pay that price for admission into a few mosques, &amp; permission to sweep the
                  temple at Mecca. He writes in his assumed character for the sake of indulging in grave
                  irony upon Catholic subjects. I can easily conceive the pleasure a Spaniard must feel
                  in thus defying the Holy Office.
