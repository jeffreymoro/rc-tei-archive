                  the Protestant Cantons of Switzerland, where I had an opportunity of seeing some of
                  the Clergy. During these late years which have dislocated the whole fabric of civil
                  society it has not escaped serious injury. The power of the clergy has been lessened,
                  – it was not too great, &amp; it was used discretely. Their influence has diminished with
                  it, &amp; a visible deterioration of morals is the consequence. Geneva has become a school
                  of Socinianism: it was never a good school, &amp; we in England have sustained much <span class="strikethrough">injury</span> {evil} from it in former times:

                           on the predestination of souls to damnation or salvation and believed this theology
                           had inspired many Parliamentarians in the English Civil War and Commonwealth 1642–1660.</span></div>
