                  </div> at that price, – not that they should be worth no more. But when the sale of a book
                  is decidedly over, they think it better to sell the remaining copies for waste-paper
                  than to give them warehouse room, – &amp; in reality it is necessary to do this. Nevertheless
                  I think your consent should have been asked before they went so very low.</p>

            <p class="indent1">As for coming to you it is quite impossible. It is no exaggeration to say that I have
               more to do than any other three writers ever undertook in one time, – &amp; loss of time
               with me is loss of every thing, for I have no crops growing while I keep holyday.
               In the course of a week I will send you 25£, – which indeed I should have done if
               your <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> letter had not arrived. Would that I could mend your affairs in any more permanent
               way than by <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> such supplies from time to time – You may be assured that I have tried more than
               I ever should have done for myself. While this resource is sufficient all is well,
               &amp; while it lasts, – but depending as it must do not on my life alone, – but on my
               health, – &amp; on my chances in the lottery of literature I am fully sensible how precarious
               it is.</p>
