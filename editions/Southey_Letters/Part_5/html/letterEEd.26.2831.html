                           in supporting the Registry Bill, a measure proposed by Wilberforce in 1815, and requiring
                           West Indian planters to submit accurate records of the slaves they owned. He may also
                           have feared that the Quarterly’s conservative readership and the government would
                           be hostile to an abolitionist article.</span></div>

                  </div>) I thought it likely that you had been prepossessed by hearing only one side, – that
                  you had not had occasion to examine <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> into the merits of the question, &amp; that the Review was perfectly free upon that subject.
                  Why you should have taken it for granted that I was in favour of the Planters I am
                  utterly at a loss to imagine; abhorring the Slave Trade as I do, &amp; having taken every
                  opportunity of expressing that abhorrence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Quarterly has sometimes agreed with the Edinburgh; sometimes in praising good
                  books, – sometimes in extolling very worthless ones, – &amp; once upon a great political
                  question, – the Bullion controversy, – when both were so totally in the wrong, that
                  had their advice been followed this country would instantly have been rendered incapable
                  of continuing the war.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The question of whether to restore the convertability of the wartime paper currency
                           to gold bullion had been hotly debated in 1811, with Parliament eventually rejecting
                           the idea. Southey had been opposed to convertability on the grounds that it would
                           restrict the country’s ability to fund the war against France, Edinburgh Annual Register,
                           for 1811, 4.1 (1813), 104–113.</span></div>
                  </div> It would be truly disgraceful if because the Edinburgh had taken the one side, the
                  Quarterly for that reason should take the other; &amp; if I were <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> always to think differently from Mess<sup>rs</sup><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</a>, merely from the spirit of opposition, I should prove myself to be as devoid of principles
                  as I believe them both to be. If there be one subject upon which all persons might
                  be expected to agree (except those who are influenced by a mistaken principle of self–interest,
                  or who act openly in contempt of any other ruling principle) it is the Slave Trade.
                  And this is the question, which under the name of the Registry Bill is to be tried
                  again.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I have often wished some mark might be affixed to the different papers in the Review,
