               <p>We manufacture Scrap volumes in this family with great success; – that is to say books

                           of the poem: one was bound in blue marbled paper (now Keswick Museum MS 224.1), and
                           the other in brown marbled paper (now Keswick Museum MS 224.2).</span></div>
                  </div> Now I want you to procure for me two quires of pink paper – such as the covers of
                  magazines are printed upon, &amp; two quire of green paper of the same inferior quality;
                  the size that <span class="strikethrough">of the</span> which makes the common octavo. The reason why as follows – Books of this kind would
                  sell at great price in a sale, – for which reason it is proper to make sundry <span class="ital">sets</span> rather than one long one. But I make them for my own <span class="ital">use</span> primarily. &amp; I page them, – which enables me to make memoranda of references for use;
                  &amp; this is facilitated by having the sets of different colours, – to wit – the blue
                  – the olive – the pink &amp; the green. And two quires of each will make three volumes
                  of each.</p>

               <p>The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Grand Murray</a> has displeased me. He offered 100 £ for six stated articles, – of which the Works
                  on England are one. And last night he send me thro <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> a draft for a hundred guineas as payment for <span class="ital">both</span> my articles in this last numbers.
