            <p class="indent1">Your last note makes me apprehend that you are not in your usual health, – &amp; indisposition
               is apt to throw a dark hue over every thing. I was therefore glad to hear that you
               were going into the country, – for notwithstanding the longevity which belongs to
               your office, there are better atmospheres than that of Palace Yard, &amp; you would be
               the better for more air &amp; more bodily exercise than are within your power during the
               sessions. I sometimes try to persuade myself that mine is a Turkish sort of constitution,
               &amp; that exercise &amp; out-of-doors air are not needful for its well-being: – but the body
               begins to require better management than it did, – it will not take care of itself
               so well as it did twenty years ago, &amp; I need not look <span class="strikethrough">at the</span> in the glass for a memento that I <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> have begun the down hill part of my journey. So be it. – There is so much for my
               heart – &amp; hope – &amp; curiosity at the end of the stage, that if I thought only of myself
               in this world, I should <span class="strikethrough">hav</span> wish <span class="strikethrough">the journey be</span> I were fairly there.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is a strange folly – or fatality that men in power will not see the prudence of <span class="strikethrough">x</span> anticipating public feeling sometimes <span class="strikethrough">instead</span> &amp; doing things with a grace for the sake of popularity, which must be done with ignominy
                  upon compulsion. For instance in that vile Lord Cochranes affair. It was wrong to
                  condemn him to the pillory; – but if that part of the sentence had been annulled before
                  popular opinion was expressed, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Prince</a> would have gained credit instead of being supposed to yield to the newspapers.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775–1860; DNB). Cochrane, a naval hero and
                           radical MP for Honiton 1806–1807 and Westminster 1807–1818, was convicted on 9 June
                           1814 of involvement in an attempt to defraud the Stock Exchange. Cochrane’s sentence
                           was a year’s imprisonment, a £1000 fine and an hour in the pillory. Subsequently he
                           was dismissed from the navy, expelled from parliament and his knighthood was withdrawn.
                           Cochrane was re-elected for Westminster unopposed on 16 July 1814 and the sentence
                           to stand in the pillory was withdrawn for fear of a riot.</span></div>
                  </div> Here will be another case in the suicide-laws, – which seem in this Spaniards case
                  to have been so executed as if the object were to insult common humanity, &amp; provoke
                  public indignation.

                           Marquez de Castro (1788–1818), who had, on 3 December 1818, shot himself in London.
                           The coroner’s jury deciding he was not insane at time of death, Castro’s body was
                           buried at night at a crossroads; see the report in the Morning Chronicle, 7 December
                           1818. Crossroads burial for suicides was prohibited in 1823.</span></div>
                  </div> And again in the matter of forgery. The laws must be altered, – &amp; that not from the
                  judgement of the legislature – but by the will of the London juries!

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In 1817, in an effort to defend the paper money on which the economy now depended
                           from forgery, the Bank of England prosecuted one hundred and forty two people in connection
                           with forging banknotes, or handling forged banknotes. Because the penalty was death,
                           juries were reluctant to convict. See, for instance, Morning Chronicle, 7 December
                           1818, for the acquittal of John Williams and William Connor because the jury did not
                           accept that the banknotes they had passed on were definitely forgeries.</span></div>
                  </div> The Juries however if they go on in their present course will do more than this, –
                  they will prove that the very institution of juries on which we have prided ourselves
                  so long, is inconsistent not only with common sense, but with the safety of society
                  &amp; the security of government. I wish, when this question of forgery comes before the
                  House, (as it surely must do) that some thing may be said, &amp; done also, for restoring
                  that part of the system which makes the jurymen <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> punishable for a false verdict.

                           the jury’s decision was reviewed by a grand jury of attaint. If they found the verdict
                           was false, it was overturned and the jury punished. Though this procedure had not
                           been used since 1670 it was not finally abolished until the Juries Act (1825) – and
                           even then it was theoretically retained for the crime of ‘embracery’, i.e. corruptly
