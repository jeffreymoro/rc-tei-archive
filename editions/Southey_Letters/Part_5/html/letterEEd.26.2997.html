                  secondly to an act of French tragedy at another (I pray you admire our economy of

                  any of the three speak, and I had to make my way in French which I did to admiration.
                  M. Beaudouin is like his brother, but considerably taller, very fond of his child,
                  a fair presumption that he is not less fond of his wife. She on her part (and her
                  mother also) speaks of him as the best of husbands. We parted sworn friends, and I
                  was stopt on the way down stairs to take leave of the baby, who had been pleased to
                  smile very graciously upon us and take me into favour. They live in small lodgings
                  pleasantly situated. I breakfasted in their fashion upon meat pie, gruyere cheese,
                  and white wine, after which the mother made me drink coffee, would have made me drink
                  tea also if I had not obstinately refused, and proposed <span class="ital">punch</span>. This was a curious visit. It lasted about two hours, after which I returned home
                  and began this letter. I have been walking again since for about three hours, buying

               of the <em>Times</em> 1814–1816. After he was dismissed from that post in 1816, he edited a new pro-ministry
               paper, the <em>New Times</em> 1817–1826. His note to Chateaubriand probably concerned their collaboration in a
               short-lived Anglo-French conservative journal,<em>The Correspondent</em>, which Stoddart had just launched.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
