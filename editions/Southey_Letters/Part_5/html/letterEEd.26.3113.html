                           1812–1818 and so was able to provide this information from the College’s registers.
                           Southey included this snippet in a footnote to his The Life of Wesley; and the Rise
                           and Progress of Methodism, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, pp. 7–8, thanking ‘a fellow of
