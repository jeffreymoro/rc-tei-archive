                  table must of course be imputed to the transcriber – or printer, rather than to him.
                  You who understand these things will see at a glance if it be as full of errors as
                  it appears to me who knows nothing of them, – &amp; if it be so you had better mention
                  it to M<sup>r</sup> Rose that he may a new one printed. I wanted to make use of the Table to day, &amp; discovered
                  immediately in the first line that the compound interest had been forgotten; – but
                  there were other blunders for which I could not find a key.</p>

               <p>These Banks seem to me a sort of Sinking Fund which may extinguish the poor rates
                  in time. – I wish your last Tables had contained the number of Paupers in each county,
                  – &amp; the average of the poor rates.
