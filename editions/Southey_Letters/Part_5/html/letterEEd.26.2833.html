The <em>Examiner</em>, 449 (4 August 1816), 489–490 carried Hunt’s parody of Southey’s <em>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</em> (1816), ‘The Laureate Laid Double’, including the lines ‘Here I enjoy, amidst my
               haws and hips,/ The friendship of wise Grosvenor and good Croker: –/ The battles of
               the Kings and Priests I fought ye ‘em,/ And so at last they’ve crowned my caput mortuum.’
               Southey felt this parodied <em>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</em> (1816), ‘Proem’, stanza 9, line 4, ‘The friendship of the good and wise is mine’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
