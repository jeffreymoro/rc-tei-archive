               on 12 January 1795 to arrange publication of <em>Wat Tyler</em>; see Southey to Edith Fricker [c. 12 January 1795], <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</em>, Letter 123. Ridgway shared his rooms at Newgate with his fellow-publisher Henry
               Symonds (1741–1816), and William Winterbotham. Ridgway and Symonds had been imprisoned
               for four years in 1793 for publishing Thomas Paine’s <em>The Rights of Man</em> (1791–1792), but continued to publish works from Newgate, including Winterbotham’s
               <em>An Historical, Geographical, Commercial, and Philosophical View of the American United
                  States </em>(1795).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               his copyright to the work. But Southey was particularly aggrieved at the case made
               by his lawyers, Sir Anthony Hart (c. 1754–1831; <em>DNB</em>) and Sir Lancelot Shadwell (1779–1850; <em>DNB</em>), as reported in e.g. <em>Morning Post</em>, 19 March 1817, ‘it was of the utmost importance that the dissemination of a work,
               professing such wicked and mischievous sentiments, both as it regarded the public
               welfare, and the character of the individual, who had long since disavowed the sentiments

               of the <em>Courier</em> [19 March 1817] (Letter 2946). These two letters were sent to Charles Watkin Williams
               Wynn, on 17 and 19 March 1817 (Letters 2944 and 2948), for him to approve and forward
               to the newspaper. In the event, Wynn’s absence from home led to a delay in his receiving
               the letters. By the time he did so, the public debate had moved on and Southey therefore
               decided not to publish them in the <em>Courier</em>, but instead to incorporate them into his pamphlet <em>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.</em> (1817).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
