               <p>The motives which induce me to intrude upon you with this letter will I trust suffice
                  both for introduction and apology. Your pupil <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert Knowles</a> has sent a Poem

                           asking permission to dedicate it to him. Following Knowles’s early death, Southey
                           himself published the poem as ‘Lines Written in the Churchyard of Richmond, Yorkshire’
                           in his article ‘Cemeteries and Catacombs of Paris’, Quarterly Review, 21 (April 1819),

                  </div> for my perusal, – and that perusal has excited in me a very strong desire that such
                  endowments as those which providence seems to have gifted him, might be cultivated
                  in the best manner, both for his own advantage and for that of society. – The poem
                  is crudely planned, as might be expected, &amp; had all the exubrance of a Juvenile performance,
                  – but it bears with it the most unequivocal marks of feeling &amp; genius. – May I request
                  you sir to favor me with some account of this youth? Feeling and Genius are not the
                  only qualities to be descried; – but when they are united with a good disposition
                  they cannot be prized too highly, nor too carefully cultivated. I learn from him that
                  his way of life seems full of difficulties: – are his attainments such as would enable
                  him to make his way at the University, and what are your wishes concerning him and
                  your opinion concerning the course which he should pursue? It is not from mere curiosity
                  that I trouble you with these questions. As an individual I am little favored by fortune,
                  but is very possible that I might find some means of serving him, if the way were
                  pointed out.
