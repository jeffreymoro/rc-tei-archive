                  obtain for us the esteem of all well-thinking men.” – He only meant that we should
                  avoid all <span class="ital">party</span> politics. – I wish he did mean this, &amp; could be made to perceive how greatly it would
                  be for his interest to let me give the review its political tone. However for the
                  present we have got a most important paper, – most important in two points, for strengthening
                  authority as much as for its remedy for the evil of the Poor Laws. No doubt it will
