                  evil incur another which is sometimes not less fatal. They look out for a wife when
                  they think themselves rich enough, &amp; this is like going to market for one; the choice
                  on their part is not made from those feelings upon which the foundation of happiness
                  must be laid, &amp; on the other part they are accepted not for their own sakes, but for
                  the sake of the establishment which they offer. Similarity of disposition is not consulted,

               landowners, at Summerhill, near Ulverston 1817–1819. Robert Gregge Hopwood (1773–1854)
               had married in 1805 Cecilia Elizabeth Byng (1770–1854), daughter of John Byng, 5th
               Viscount Torrington (1743–1813). She was a first cousin of Georgiana Byng (1768–1801),
               first wife of Lord John Russell, later the 6th Duke of Bedford (1766–1839; <em>DNB</em>). Lady Russell had lived in Lisbon for two years for her health and was known to
               Herbert Hill. Derwent Coleridge was tutor to the Hopwoods’ sons: Edward (1807–1891);
               Frank (1810–1890); and Hervey (1811–1881). He continued in this post until December
               1819, later becoming an undergraduate at St John’s College, Cambridge.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
