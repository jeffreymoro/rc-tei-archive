                  &amp; thus be turned adrift by having the whole comfort &amp; beauty of the residence destroyed.
                  To make short of the story I chose the former part of the alternative, upon an understanding
                  that the great mortgage upon it may remain, &amp; in the reasonable expectation that in
                  the course of three years I may be able to pay off the whole sum, – having nothing
                  to begin with at present. The matter is in suspense at present, M<sup>r</sup> Harding (the <span class="ital">Extentor</span>) being gone to Carlisle to negociate with Tolson, upon the plain proposition that
                  I will give him what he gave for it, which is 2000£ with incumbrances of legacies
                  &amp; annuities amounting to 800£ more.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Here then are my travels frustrated, – &amp; heaven knows by no wish or desire of my own.

               from which I had anticipated much pleasure, – vexed at having any {thing} to do with
               business, – for which I am of all men the most compleatly unfit. – Excuse me I pray
