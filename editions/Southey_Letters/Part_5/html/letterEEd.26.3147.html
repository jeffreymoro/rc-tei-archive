               <p>Do you know any thing of a D<sup>r</sup> William May, who has introduced himself here as being well known to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">D<sup>r</sup> Southey</a>, &amp; having the honour to be a member of the same College?

                           in Leyden in 1787 and became an Extra–Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians
                           in 1788 (Henry Herbert Southey became a Licentiate in 1812). He practiced in Truro
                           and Plymouth and published an Essay on Pulmonary Consumption (Plymouth, 1792). Henry
                           Herbert Southey’s Observations on Pulmonary Consumption had appeared in 1814.</span></div>
                  </div> From more circumstances than one I am led to suspect that there is <span class="ital">something the matter</span> with this well-bronzed M.D. He professes to be writing a book upon consumption, for
                  which he prescribes high living &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> half killed one poor girl by giving her 70 drops of laudanum in the course of a day.
                  I believe he is trying to establish himself somewhere in this country, &amp; his coming
                  upon such a scheme without any introduction whatever, looks very much as if there
                  were some reasons why he could not procure any.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">We like the carpet well. Yesterday there came a present from the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">Imperial Guard</a>, a lamp intended I suppose for me to write by, – with one of those ground-glass half
               globes to soften the light. A handsome thing, – but troublesome. My writings are not
               likely to smell of it: if they smell of any thing, it will be of a tallow candle.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am tormented with my summer catarrh. The best remedy for it would probably be the
               warm bath at its commencement, but the sun does not heat Derwentwater sufficiently
               for it to serve that purpose, – however it is an admirable tepid bath at this time,
               &amp; I have enjoyed it accordingly. Our weather for the last month has been the finest
               possible, but visitors never will come to the Lakes early enough in the year.</p>

                           Theatre was overseen by a Board of Directors, and a sub–committee that managed its
                           affairs. Several important literary figures were members of the sub–committee (including,
                           briefly, Byron), but Southey was not one of them. By 1818 the Theatre was in severe
