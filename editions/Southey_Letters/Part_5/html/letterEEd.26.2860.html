               <p>I am inclined to think it would be better to shorten what is said about the Carmen

                           suggests shortening quotations from Carmen Triumphale (1814) in order to insert stanzas
                           from the main section of The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale (1816), ‘The Dream’.</span></div>
                  </div> characterizing it briefly as a <span class="strikethrough">th</span> strain of solemn thanksgiving, – &amp; leaving out quotations from it, to make room for
                  one from the Lay at the end which may lead to a good home stroke. <span class="strikethrough">I w</span> Could you not quote Stanzas 74–75 78 &amp; then from 80 to the end {(leaving out 79 perhaps)}

                  to do – put the question something in this way. If any man in exercising the part
                  of a public critic were to say of such lines as these that they were like Sternhold

                           imitation of Sternhold and the Daily Advertiser’. Thomas Sternhold (1500–1549; DNB)
                           and John Hopkins (d. 1570) were translators of the metrical Psalms of David; their
                           version was often bound together with the Book of Common Prayer (1662) and used in
                           Church of England services.</span></div>
                  </div> (quoting the words) – such a man if he believed what he said must labour under the
                  most pitiable incapacity; – but if there were a writer who could say this without
                  believing it, – with a secret consciousness that what he was saying was as opposite
                  to truth as it is to common sense – then indeed his <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> case would be more pitiable. men <span class="strikethrough">x</span> are only ridiculous when they play the fool for love, – but when they lose their senses
                  for hatred the malady excites a very different feeling.” – Something to that turn
