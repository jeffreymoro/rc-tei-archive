               part of it: the best colour which you see is that of clean soap suds, – the more common
               one that of <span class="strikethrough">dirty</span> the same mixture when dirty. But the rivers have a power might &amp; majesty which it
               is scarcely possible to describe, especially the Ares which comes down the Maurienne
               from M Cenis. Indeed I should consider my journey as well repaid if it was only for
               the images which I treasured up in ascending this part of Savoy.</p>
