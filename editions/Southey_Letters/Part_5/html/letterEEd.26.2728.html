               <p>The letter which I inclose to be directed by your hand relates to a melancholy subject.
                  A youth by name <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DusautoyJames">James Dusautoy </a>wrote to me to submit samples of his poetry &amp; ask my advice respecting his pursuits
                  in life. In consequence of that advice &amp; of my interference he was placed as a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> sizer at Emanuel;
