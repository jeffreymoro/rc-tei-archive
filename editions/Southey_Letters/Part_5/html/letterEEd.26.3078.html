               <p>The Courier which ought to have arrived yesterday, came to day, – &amp; tells me that
                  the Q R is advertised for the 23<sup>d</sup>.

                  </div> So it does not chuse to wait for me. – I do not know that I have much reason to be
                  offended at this, because when I withdrew the article which they had half-printed,
                  I promised the new one by the beginning of this month.

                           18 (October 1817) (the issue published on 21 February 1818), so as to have more time
                           incorporating Rickman’s work on the subject. The fruits of Rickman’s analysis appeared
                           in ‘On the Poor Laws’, Quarterly Review, 18 (January 1818), 259–308.</span></div>
                  </div> But the Q. R. does not understand its own interest; – &amp; sometimes is as little judicious
                  in its treatment of me, as in its foolish subserviency to others. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> must have received the <span class="ital">last half</span> of the article on Friday. I would send off the beginning this night if I were sure
                  it were <span class="ital">lawfull</span>. The importance of the matter might teach them the fitness of inserting it even yet,
                  if there were any reason for calculating upon wisdom in that quarter. But this I must
                  not do, – &amp; I suppose indeed every thing is printed &amp; ready. – This is the first time
                  I believe, that the Review was ever out a week before three months had elapsed since
                  the last publication.
