               a humorous connection between the baby and the most famous ‘Hill’ of the day, the
               Army commander Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill (1772–1842; <em>DNB</em>): Oliver and Roland were two legendary knights in the 11th century <em>Le Chanson de Roland</em>.

               There he met Elisabetha Grossmann (1795–1858), a shopkeeper’s wife who had gained
               some fame with visitors from rowing them on the local lake. She was known as ‘La Belle
               Bateliere’ or the ‘beautiful Elizabeth of Brientz’. Southey compared her to Mary Robinson
               (1778–1837; <em>DNB</em>), the ‘Maid of Buttermere’, another local beauty.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               he saw the eight-miles long ‘Slide of Alpnach’, erected to convey logged spruce trees
               from the mountain-side to the lake below. The trough, a feat of engineering supported
               on a timber frame over several ravines, was so angled as to transport the tree trunks
               from forest to shore in no more than six minutes.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               lie the bones of this fourth-century British saint who, according to legend, was killed,
               with her eleven thousand virginal handmaids, on a pilgrimage to Cologne, by the Huns
               besieging the city. The reliquary is extraordinary because, in addition to its size,
               it displays the bones arranged in patterns and so as to form letters and words. Southey
               visited Cologne on the return leg of his tour of 1817.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
