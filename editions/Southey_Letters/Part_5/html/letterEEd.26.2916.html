               <p>Your letter followed me to the house of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">a friend</a>, where I had turned myself loose for a week in an old library. – There I chewed the
                  cud at leisure upon your remarks as to the certain &amp; wide circulation of the Review
                  &amp; the precariousness of any other mode of publication for writings of a political
                  character. They had their weight, &amp; perhaps would have <span class="ital">entirely</span> instead of <span class="ital">almost</span> persuaded me, had not the last Number which I found on my return in a great degree
                  counteracted your arguments, by proving that whatever advantage this powerful Journal
                  affords for the diffusion of political opinions, – the writer who avails himself of
                  it must express none which are not perfectly in accord with those of the Government,
                  let him be as zealous as he will in their cause.

               <p>I am therefore undecided in what form to bring forward some observations upon the
                  real evils of society, &amp; some speculations as to the possible means of removing or
                  alleviating them. Perhaps the better place may be to put together Espriellas Travels,

                           By Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella (1807), but Longmans had been attempting to boost
                           the sales of the third edition of 1814 by announcing a sequel, e.g. Morning Chronicle,
                           8 September 1814, ‘Also speedily will be published. TRAVELS in ENGLAND. By Don Manuel
                           Alvarez Espriella. In 3 vols. Duodecimo.’</span></div>
                  </div> – &amp; for which ample materials have long since been collected. This would ensure a
                  considerable sale, &amp; it would also enable me to speak with much more freedom because
                  it would rest with the Reader to <span class="strikethrough">discover when</span> distinguish when I was writing <span class="ital">in</span> a fictitious character, &amp; when <span class="ital">thro</span> one; – &amp; this would be very advantageous in treating of the Established Church.</p>

            <p class="indent1">In whatever manner this may be determined, it is beyond a doubt desirable that I should
               make as much use as I can of your journal. With temporary politics I hope there will
               be little more to do. If Government, as they appear to intend, should check the licentiousness
               of the press, all will do well; – if they do not, – the question will <span class="ital">soon</span> come to be settled between the Mob &amp; the Military <span class="ital">soon enough</span> to ensure success to the Government. But this, even with such an issue is a dismal
