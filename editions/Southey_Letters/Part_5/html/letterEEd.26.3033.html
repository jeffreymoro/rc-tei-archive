            <p class="indent1">During this fine autumn (the finest which we can remember in this country) I have
               frequently regretted that you were not with us, upon our mountain excursions; and
               thought sometimes how busily your hammer would have been at work among the stones,
               over which I was treading as ignorantly as the cart-horse in our company.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have not estimated <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville White</a> more favourably than he deserves. There does not breathe a better or a nobler heart.
                  Men are sometimes strangely out of their place in this world: there, for instance,
                  is a man living in Milk Street,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> and busied about Nottingham goods, who, if he were master of a palace and a princely
                  fortune, would do honour to the one, and make the best possible use of the other.
                  I felt towards him just as you have done, at first sight; and recognising instantly
                  the character, scarcely perceived that the individual was a stranger. There is more
                  in these sympathies than the crockery class of mankind can conceive, or than our wise
                  men have dreamt of in their philosophy.

                           than in Arabia.</span></div>

                  </div> It was the unbroken horizon which impressed me, appearing so much wider than at sea;
                  and the skyscapes which it afforded. I had the same impression in passing through
                  Picardy;

                  as I do here upon the earth. Anywhere I could find food for the heart and the imagination,
                  at those times when we are open to outward influences, except in great cities. If
                  I were confined in them, I should wither away like a flower in a parlour window. Did
                  you notice the cry of the bittern in that country? I heard it between <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</a>. Its spiral flight, when it takes wing, is as remarkable and as peculiar as its cry.
                  This bird has been extirpated here; only one has been seen since I have resided at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, and that was shot by a young Cantab, who ate it for his dinner, and had no more
                  brains in his head than the bittern.

               <p>Having nothing to hope in this world, and nothing to desire in it for myself, except
                  as quiet a passage through it as it may please God to grant, my mind, when it takes
                  its course, recurs to the world which is to come, and lays as naturally now the scenes
                  of its day-dreams in Heaven, as it used to do upon earth. I think of the many intimacies
                  I have made among the dead, and with what delight I shall see and converse with those
                  persons whose lives and writings have interested me, to whom I have endeavoured to
                  render justice, or from whom I have derived so much pleasure and benefit of the highest
                  kind. Something perhaps we shall have to communicate, and oh I how much to learn!
                  The Roman Catholics, when they write concerning Heaven, arrange the different classes
                  there with as much precision as a master of the ceremonies could do. Their martyrs,
                  their doctors, their confessors, their monks and their virgins, have each their separate
                  society. As for us poets, they have not condescended to think of us; but we shall
                  find one another out, and a great many questions I shall have to ask of Spenser and
                  of Chaucer. Indeed, I half hope to get the whole story of Cambuscan bold; and to hear
                  the lost books of the Faëry Queen.
