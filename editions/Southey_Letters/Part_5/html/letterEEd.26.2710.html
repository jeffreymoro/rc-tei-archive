                  of this size therefore the view of Waterloo Church should be, &amp; the three views of
                  Hougoumont, (i.e. the two internal &amp; the one outside view.) – I give up Ligny, because
                  it is better to confine the illustrations to the British subjects exclusively.

                           Waterloo). Waterloo Church appeared as the frontispiece to The Poet’s Pilgrimage to

                  of the question unless they were affixed to each canto, &amp; the subject of the different

                  these an ode or Song of Victory if I can make one, – but the sample which you have
