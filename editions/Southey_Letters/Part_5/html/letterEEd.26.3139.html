               <p>“A most extraordinary piece of intelligence reached us yesterday (his letter has no
                  date) – that the Princess of Wales &amp; five of her rascals had been poisoned.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Princess Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821; DNB), estranged wife of the Prince of Wales,
                           had been living in Italy with an entourage of servants, with one of whom she was thought
                           to be having an affair. The Rome newspapers of 15 May had carried reports that it
                           was being rumoured that the servant in question, Bartolomeo Pergami (1783/4–1842),
                           had been poisoned; see the Morning Post, 8 June 1818. But Landor’s account is composed
                           of a mixture of gossip and wild exaggeration and it is not possible to clearly identify
                           who he is referring to in the Princess’s household.</span></div>
                  </div> Such is the profound ignorance of the English character among this most degraded &amp;
                  infamous people, that it is considered as a thing beyond all doubt that the English
                  have committed this atrocity. I could not refrain from making the following remark,
                  – there is only one nation in Europe accused of such villainy, &amp; that nation is far
                  removed in all its institutions &amp; feelings from the English. Altho the report is circulated
                  among the best informed, I am inclined to disbelieve it. Surely it is more probable
                  that the sudden &amp; violent heats have inflamed the blood of creatures who are always
                  half-drunk. – Or that Syphilis or the remedies of Syphilis are preying on their constitutions.
                  It is not indeed quite impossible that those who are implicated in the forgery of
                  the two letters of exchange have dispatched a wretch capable both of employing &amp; betraying
                  them: nor that jealousy, not arising from the enjoyment of personal charms, but from
                  the disposal of pecuniary favours, has precipitated some of the scoundrels in her
                  service to commit this atrocious deed. She has a known &amp; convicted assassin in her
                  household, – &amp; who knows but some such untoward accident has befallen her as befell
                  Cesar Borgia,

                           Cesare survived (though it was claimed his skin peeled off as a result of the medicines
