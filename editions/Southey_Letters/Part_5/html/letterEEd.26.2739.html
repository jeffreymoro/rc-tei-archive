                  Upon this subject I hold it equally a crime to foster the military spirit in time
                  of peace, as it is to deaden and depress it in time of need. While Buonaparte

                  of the human race, to which his system (exclusively military as it was) directly,
                  and almost avowedly, tended. We may shudder at a field of battle with safety now,
                  and instruct others to shudder at it.</p>

                  growing fast in your favour; when they begin to know you, and you can handle their
                  soft frames without fear, they very soon lay fast hold upon a father’s heart, and

                  There is neither impiety nor nonsense there – there is much mysticism. This evening
                  I came upon a text in the Wisdom implying pre-existence in the belief of its writer:
                  ‘For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit. Yea rather, being good, I came into
                  a body undefiled.’
