               <p>There is, unluckily, a very sufficient reason for not disclaiming Wat Tyler, – which

                  left to themselves, as dependent upon the sale.

                           of Robert Southey. Part One, Letter 123. Ridgeway shared his rooms at Newgate with
                           his fellow-publisher Henry Symonds (1741–1816), and William Winterbotham. Ridgway
                           and Symonds had been imprisoned for four years in 1793 for publishing Thomas Paine’s
                           The Rights of Man (1791–1792), but continued to publish works from Newgate, including
                           Winterbotham’s An Historical, Geographical, Commercial, and Philosophical View of

                  </div> This was the substance of our conversation; for nothing but words passed between us.
                  From that time till the present, I never heard of the work: they of course, upon better
                  judgment, thought it better left alone; and I, with the carelessness of a man who
                  has never thought of consequences, made no inquiry for the manuscript. How it has
                  got to the press, or by whose means, I know not.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The motive for publication is sufficiently plain. But the editor, whoever he may be,
               has very much mistaken his man. In those times and at that age, and in the circumstances
               wherein I was placed, it was just as natural that I should be a Republican, and as
               proper, as that now, with the same feelings, the same principles and the same integrity,
               when three-and- twenty years have added so much to the experience of mankind, as well
               as matured my own individual intellect, I should think revolution the greatest of
               all calamities, and believe that the best way of ameliorating the condition of the
               people is through the established institutions of the country.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The booksellers must be disreputable men, or they would not have published a work
                  under such circumstances. I just feel sufficient anger to wish that they may be prosecuted
                  for sedition.
