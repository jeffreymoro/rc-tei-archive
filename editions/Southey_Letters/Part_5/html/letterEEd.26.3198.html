            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have taken, I see, Cornano for your physician.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Turner, who was anxious about his health, was emulating the dietary restraint practised
                           by Luigi Cornaro (1467/84–1566). The latter adopted a restricted diet, initially comprised
                           of 14oz of solid food and 17oz of wine, and lived into advanced old age. Southey,
                           though not a follower of Cornaro’s system, owned a 1768 edition of his Art of Living
                           Long, no. 533 in the sale catalogue of his library.</span></div>
                  </div> Had I made the same experiment, I should have been disposed to prefer a diet of roots,
                  fruits, and esculent plants to bread, which is so likely to be adulterated. There
                  is as much difference in the stomachs of men as in their tempers and faces; severe
                  abstinence is necessary for some, and others feed high and drink hard, and yet attain
                  to a robust old age; but unquestionably the sparing system has most facts in its favour,
                  and I have often remarked with wonder the great length of life to which some of the
                  hardest students and most inveterate self-tormentors among the monastic orders have
                  attained. Truly glad shall I be if you derive from your system the permanent benefit
                  which there seems such good reason to expect. Both you and I must wish to remain as
                  long as we can in this ‘tough world’ for the sake of others. Thank Heaven it is no
                  rack to us, though we have both reached that stage in our progress in which the highest
                  pleasure that this life can afford is the anticipation of that which is to follow
                  it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have made a wise determination for your son William, for I believe that medical
