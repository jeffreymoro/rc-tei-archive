                           in the Brazil trade. His letters to Southey may have referred to continued conflicts

                  </div> – I had indeed {believed} you were sailing in a quiet sea, in no danger of shoals
                  or tempests. – By what principle, – or what strange want of principle is it, that
                  mercantile men so often for the sake of the shortest reprieve from bankruptcy involve
                  their nearest friends &amp; connections with them! – I write to you in a frame of mind
                  which you will easily conceive, looking back upon the year which has just closed,
                  &amp; reflecting on the trials with which we have both been visited during its course.
                  Your loss I would fain hope may not prove <span class="strikethrough">so xx</span> altogether so great as you apprehend, – &amp; I would hope also that some prize in the
                  lottery of life, full of chances as it is, may one day or other replace it. Even at
                  the worst, it leaves you heart-whole: – it will be long before I shall find myself

                  the sake of any enjoyments which it can possibly have in store. I have the same sort
                  of feeling that a man who is fondly attached to his family has when absent from them,
                  – as if I were on a journey, – &amp; yearn perhaps more than I ought to do to be at home
                  &amp; at rest. – Yet what abundant cause have I for thankfulness; possessing as I do so
                  many blessings that I should think no man could possibly be happier, – if I had not
                  been so much happier myself! – Do not think that I give way to such feelings – far
                  less that I encourage them, – or am <span class="strikethrough">indeed</span> weak enough to repine: – what is lost in possession is given me in hope.</p>

                  saved me from any anxiety on this score, &amp; there happily exists no cause for anxiety
                  when I have no longer the same preservative. My house is in order, &amp; whenever the

                  has been <span class="strikethrough">xx xx</span> a fair pretext, if not a just cause for this seclusion. Never was there such a succession
                  of storms, sometimes with snow, sometimes with rain. The floods have been higher than
