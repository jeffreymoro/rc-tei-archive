               publication, on the grounds that it breached his copyright. The case was, in his view,
               lost because of perjury in an affidavit given to the court by William Winterbotham,
               who swore that Southey had, when visiting Newgate prison, where Winterbotham, Ridgway
               and Symonds were all confined, given him and Daniel Isaac Eaton (1753–1814; <em>DNB</em>), the radical publisher, the manuscript of <em>Wat Tyler</em> to do with as they liked.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               originally hoped to publish in the <em>Courier</em>: Southey to William Smith, 17 March 1817 (Letter 2943) and Southey to the Editor
               of the <em>Courier</em> [19 March 1817] (Letter 2946). These two letters were sent to Charles Watkin Williams
               Wynn, on 17 and 19 March 1817 (Letters 2944 and 2948), for him to forward to the newspaper.
               In the event, Wynn’s absence from home led to a delay in his receiving the letters.
               By the time he did so, the public debate had moved on and Southey therefore decided
               not to publish them in the <em>Courier</em>, but instead to incorporate them into his pamphlet <em>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.</em> (1817).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
