                           marriage of the Prince Regent’s only child Princess Charlotte to the Hereditary Prince
                           of Orange, William (1792–1849; King of the Netherlands 1840–1849). The poem had not
                           been published because the royal engagement was broken off in June 1814. Southey did
                           not use these stanzas in The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo; instead he reworked the
                           1814 poem into The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale (1816) to celebrate Charlotte’s
