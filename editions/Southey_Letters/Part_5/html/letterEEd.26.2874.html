               proposed to write a pamphlet, or book, with this title. This project was not realised
               and instead Southey wrote on ‘Parliamentary Reform’ in <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 16 (October 1816), 225–278, and the ‘Rise and Progress of Popular Disaffection’
               in <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 16 (January 1817), 511–552.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">6.. </span><span class="noteBody">On 27 April 1815, as war with France was about to be renewed, a meeting of the Mayor,
               Aldermen and Liverymen of the several Companies of the City of London in Common Hall
               assembled at the Guildhall, London, resolved that ‘the Livery of London have ever
               been, and now are, ready to support the honour, the character, and the interests of
               the British Empire, and to resist every act of aggression; but, seeing all the consequences
               of the late war, looking at the depressed state of the country, the burthens and privations
               of the people, the financial difficulties, the uncertainty and hazards of war, seeing
               likewise that France has disclaimed all intention of interfering in the concerns of
               other nations, that she has declared her determination to adhere to the Treaty of
               Paris, that she has made pacific overtures to the different Allied Powers, has already
               abolished the Slave Trade, and given other indications of returning to principles
               of equity and moderation; and holding, as we do, all wars to be unjust, unless the
               injury sustained is clearly defined, and redress by negociation cannot be obtained;
               and more particularly holding in abhorrence all attempts to dictate to, or interfere
               with, other nations in their internal concerns, we cannot but protest against the
               renewal of hostilities, as neither founded in justice nor necessity.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
