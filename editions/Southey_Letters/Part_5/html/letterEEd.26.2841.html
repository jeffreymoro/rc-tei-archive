               <p>There are but few points upon which you &amp; I should disagree when we understood each

                           published in the Quarterly Review, 15 (April 1816), 187–235.</span></div>
                  </div> Upon that of the farms we are perfectly agreed, – my position being that the smallest
                  which can be cultivated with adequate advantage to the cultivator is best. – Your
                  plan respecting the churches is so simple &amp; so good that one wonders it should not
                  have been hit upon before, – &amp; the very means proposed would include good in itself
                  – for the service is at present too long. I have not seen the E Review – but from
                  all I hear it seems <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> fit that I should regularly see it, for the advantage which it would give me. Some
                  day I shall come <span class="strikethrough">it</span> upon it with a heavy hand &amp; a whip of scorpions. Malthus’s proposal which this precious
                  Review has reviewed, you will see treated, exactly as you regard it, in my former
                  paper upon the Poor (N<sup>o</sup> 16.)

                           poor relief for children born after a certain date. Malthus was a Whig and his work
                           received a number of supportive comments from Whig journals, e.g. Edinburgh Review,
                           11 (October 1807), 100–116.</span></div>
