               <div class="salute">My dear Neville,</div>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thank you for your letter. I have had the prayers and the sympathy of many good men,
                  and perhaps never <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">child</a> was lamented by so many persons of ripe years, unconnected with him by ties of consanguinity.
                  But those of my friends who knew him loved him for his own sake, and many there are
                  who grieve at his loss for mine.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s son, Herbert, had died on 17 April 1816.</span></div>
                  </div> I dare not pursue this subject. My health is better, my spirits are not. I employ
                  myself as much as possible; but there must be intervals of employment, and the moment
                  that my mind is off duty, it recurs to the change which has taken place: that change,
                  I fear, will long be the first thought when I wake in the morning, and the last when
                  I lie down at night. Yet, Neville, I feel and acknowledge the uses of this affliction.
                  Perhaps I was too happy; perhaps my affections were fastened by too many roots to
                  this world; perhaps this precarious life was too dear to me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> sets me the example of suppressing her own feelings for the sake of mine. We have
                  many blessings left, – abundant ones, for which to be thankful. I know, too, to repine
                  because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> is removed, would be as selfish as it would be sinful. Yea, I believe that, in my
                  present frame of mind, I could lay my children upon the altar, like Abraham,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Genesis 22, tells how Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his only son Isaac to God.</span></div>
                  </div> and say, “Thy will be done.”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The Lord’s Prayer; Matthew 6: 10; and Luke 11: 2.</span></div>
                  </div> This I trust will continue, when the depressing effects of grief shall have passed
                  away. I hope in time to recover some portion of my constitutional cheerfulness, but
                  never to lose that feeling with which I look on to eternity. I always knew the instability
                  of earthly happiness; this woeful experience will make me contemplate more habitually
                  and more ardently that happiness which is subject neither to chance nor change.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Do not suppose that I am indulging in tears, or giving way to painful recollections.
               On the contrary, I make proper exertions, and employ myself assiduously for as great
               a portion of the day as is compatible with health. For the first week I did as much
               every day as would at other times have seemed the full and overflowing produce of
               three. This, of course, I could not continue, but at the time it was salutary. God
               bless you, my dear Neville! </p>
