               (c).<br> Unpublished.<br> Dating note: Easter Sunday fell on 22 March in 1818.<br> Note on MS: The letter is written onto the blank leaves of a copy of the ‘PROSPECTUS’
               for ‘ESSAYS IN DESIGN/ FROM/ SOUTHEY’S POEM OF THALABA./ DRAWN AND ETCHED/ BY/ WILLIAM
               HAWKES SMITH’. This reads as follows: ‘<span class="ital">In Royal Quarto, Price 10s. 6d.</span>// ESSAYS IN DESIGN/ FROM/ SOUTHEY’S POEM OF THALABA/ <span class="ital">DRAWN AND ETCHED</span> <em>/ </em>BY/ WILLIAM HAWKES SMITH/ PROSPECTUS.// When an unprofessional Artist, and one whose
               only opportunities of cultivating an acquaintance with the Arts, are the scanty portions
               of leisure allowed from the pressure of his daily occupations; when such a one ventures
               to submit the result of his labours to public notice, some apology is necessary, and
               it is accordingly, with becoming diffidence, that these attempts to embody the ideas
               of the Poet are given to the general eye.// The Sketches which form the proposed work,
               were chiefly made several years ago, and their revision and improvement have been
               the occasional occupation of the Artist’s leisure for some months past. Fully aware
               that numerous defects may be detected, he trusts that, under the unpretending title
               of ‘ESSAYS,’ his efforts may be candidly examined, and that if any merit be discernible
               in the <span class="ital">Conception</span>, those errors in <span class="ital">Drawing</span> which years of close study would alone instruct him to avoid, may be pardoned.//
               The work will consist of <span class="ital">Twenty-eight</span> outline Etchings, from what are deemed the most prominent and interesting situations
               in the Poem; they will be printed on fine Royal Drawing Paper, and accompanied by
               a sheet of Letter-press, containing ample explanatory quotations.// A specimen of
               the style of the designs, is given in the Plate worked at the back of this page.//
               The Names of Subscribers will be received by W. Hawkes Smith, Easy Row, Birmingham.//

                  known to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PembertonSophia">M<sup>rs</sup> Lloyd</a>. There is a great of cleverness in some of the sketches (specimens of eight or ten
                  have been sent me) not in all, – they are as may be expected very unequal, – this
                  is one of the best.
