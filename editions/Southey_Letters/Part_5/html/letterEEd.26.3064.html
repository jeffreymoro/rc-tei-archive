                           He was the son of John Taylor (c. 1742–1825), a well-known physician in Reading. Southey
                           did not complete this epitaph. Southey mentioned Taylor’s death in Edinburgh Annual

                  life which is worth noticing on his monument. – My intention is not to be in any hurry
                  with these poems, but to correct them at leisure, as severely as possible, &amp; print

                           the fifth in 1818. Longmans were convinced Lalla Rookh would be a great success, paying
                           Moore £3,000 before it was even completed; whereas Southey earned little more than
                           £700 from the sales of Roderick. But Longman’s judgement was correct; Lalla Rookh
                           sold 9,000 copies in the six editions published in 1817, despite Southey’s scepticism

                  that there is a <span class="ital">ruse de guerre</span> in it, – a stratagem of that war which bookseller carries on against another: – that
                  if I were to ask as large a sum for a poem as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MooreThomas">Moore</a> has obtained, they might reply to me there <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> is not the same sale to be expected, – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">for</span> this they {would} <span class="strikethrough">apparent</span> {support} by title pages putting probably <span class="strikethrough">a new</span> the <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> name of a new edition to every 500 or possibly a smaller number (for Lalla Rookh cannot
                  by possibility have had such a sale as is pretended) to his poems, – while the first
                  edition of Roderick was 500 only at a time; but the second 1500, the third 2000 &amp;

               Southey earned little more than £700 from the sales of <em>Roderick</em>. But Longman’s judgement was correct; <em>Lalla Rookh</em> sold 9,000 copies in the six editions published in 1817, despite Southey’s scepticism

               because he had recently completed an article for the <em>Quarterly Review</em> on Lord Holland, <em>Some Account of the Lives and Writings of Lope Felix de Vega Carpio, and Guillen de
                  Castro</em> (1817). This was held over and not published until 21 February 1818, when it appeared
               in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 18 (October 1817), 1–46. In its place in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 17 (July 1817), 369–403, was a review by John Bird Sumner (1780–1862; <em>DNB</em>), entitled ‘Malthus on Population’ and far more favourable to the ideas of Thomas
               Robert Malthus (1766–1834; <em>DNB</em>) about the poor than Southey had been when he discussed Malthus in <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 8 (December 1812), 319–356.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
