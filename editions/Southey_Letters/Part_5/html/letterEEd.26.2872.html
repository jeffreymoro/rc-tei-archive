               <p>Thank you for the Reports. I see much good in the Police Story, &amp; nothing but good,
                  – for the roguery of Merceron can do no farther injury to any person but himself.

                           ongoing disputes in Bethnal Green. Joseph Merceron (1764–1839; DNB) effectively controlled
                           local government through his influence as vestryman, treasurer of the poor rate and
                           magistrate and used his position to enrich himself and protect various criminal activities.
                           In 1818 he was convicted of misappropriation of funds but resumed his role in Bethnal
                           Green after only 18 months’ imprisonment.</span></div>

                           Whitbread had cut his own throat on 6 July 1815. Felix Calvert (1735–1802), another
                           London brewer, had shot himself in Don Saltero’s coffee house in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea
                           on the evening of 23 March 1802. His son, Charles (1768–1832) was Whig MP for Southwark
                           1812–1832.</span></div>
                  </div> But to say nothing of the amusing matter, &amp; the really valuable information which
                  the report contains, it is of great use for enforcing the most important fact that
                  men are paid too little by the public, &amp; for showing the consequence of unjust parsimony.</p>
