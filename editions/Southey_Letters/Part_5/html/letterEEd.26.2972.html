               <p>You will have seen my name pretty frequently in the newspapers, &amp; may perhaps like
                  to know the real circumstances of the business. I wrote Wat Tyler in the summer of
                  1794 before I was twenty years of age; – it was the <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> composition of two or three mornings, – thrown off at a heat &amp; without the slightest
                  correction or revision. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</a> took it to London in the autumn &amp; put it into Ridgeways hands, that he might consider
                  whether he would publish it. It was left in his hands, &amp; in the December of the same
                  year I went to town myself for three days, &amp; called on Ridgeway who was then in Newgate.

                           radical booksellers, for publication; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12
                           January 1795], The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One, Letter 123. Ridgway
                           and Symonds did not publish it and it remained in manuscript until a pirated publication,
                           designed to embarrass the now anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817. Having taken
                           advice from Rickman, Wynn and Turner, Southey launched an unsuccessful suit in Chancery
                           so as to gain an injunction suppressing the publication.</span></div>
                  </div> He &amp; Symonds (also a prisoner) <span class="strikethrough">sa</span> told me they would print it, &amp; if any profit accrued I was to have such a proportion
                  as they should think <span class="strikethrough">fit</span> equitable. There the matter ended. I returned to Bristol, no proof sheet ever came
                  to me, I concluded that upon farther reflection they thought the thing unfit for publication,
                  &amp; my own after thought coincided so entirely in this judgement, that I made no application
                  to know why the printing was delayed, nor ever enquired for the manuscript, thinking
                  in fact no more of it than of a college or school exercise.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>By whom this thing after an interval of three &amp; twenty years has been published I
                  know not. Upon seeing it announced I immediately gave instructions to apply for an
                  injunction in Chancery, – the case being as plain as day light, that the property
                  was mine, &amp; that a man might just as well take from me any of the papers in my writing
                  desk, as print that without my consent, &amp; in defiance of me. A counter-affidavit was
                  procured from a Dissenting Minister by name <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Winterbottom">Winterbottom</a>, which does not contain a single word of truth.

                  that he believes it to have been in the year 1796 (for the purpose of making it appear
                  that I was of age at the time) – &amp; that I <span class="ital">gave</span> him the Manuscript to do with it whatever he pleased, – &amp; he swears to persons being

                           could not grant an injunction in a court of equity because Southey had not unequivocally
                           established his ownership of the manuscript in question and he would need to do this
