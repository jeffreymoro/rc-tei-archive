               did not publish this until 1828, when it appeared as ‘Funeral Song for the Princess

               1509–1547; <em>DNB</em>), was also buried in St George’s Chapel, Windsor. He was present at the Field of
               the Cloth of Gold (1520), a lavish diplomatic exchange between Henry VIII and Francis
               I (1494–1547; King of France 1515–1547) held just outside Calais. But Southey’s verses
               also refer to the rhyme: ‘Cloth of Gold, do not despise/ To match thyself with Cloth
               of Frieze./ Cloth of Frieze, be not too bold,/ Though thou art matched to Cloth of
               Gold’. Brandon had these words inscribed on the trappings of his horse at a tournament,
               following his wedding in 1515 to Princess Mary (1496–1533; <em>DNB</em>), Henry VIII’s sister. Here ‘cloth of frieze’, a rough cloth worn by the poor, indicated
               Brandon’s humble background as the son of Sir William Brandon (1456–1485) an obscure
               Cambridgeshire gentleman; but one who was still ‘matched’ to Princess Mary, who is
               here represented as ‘Cloth of Gold’, the finest of fabrics.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
