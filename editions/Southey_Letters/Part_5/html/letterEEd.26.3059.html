                           an affair. The Princess’s behaviour was the subject of much gossip and in 1820 the
                           government unsuccessfully introduced a Bill of Pains and Penalties to dissolve her

                           Christian traditions was homosexuality, so Southey is implying that one of Caroline’s
                           attendants was homosexual. Again, this information is merely local gossip and it is

                           they would become radical heroes as associates of Princess Caroline, who was popular
                           with the opposition as an antagonist of the Prince Regent. Thus they would join Napoleon

                           1817. Popular grief (and dislike of the Prince Regent) was increased by the belief
                           that she had been ill-treated by her father in the past, and that news of her death

               e.g. <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 8 December 1817. One of the extracts reported that in the Kamchatka peninsula ‘in
               the course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the woods, frequently
               entered the houses of the Kamtschdales; in many places have attacked and devoured
               the inhabitants; nay traces have even been found of their having killed and devoured
               each other; at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of hunger.
               In several settlements they have killed from two to three hundred bears, the oldest
               Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty.
               The cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past
               there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well
               known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters,
               they easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately

               mount an expedition to search for the North West passage and offering fishermen a
               bounty to explore the area. Two Royal Navy expeditions were made. In April 1818 one
               commanded by David Buchan (1780–1838; <em>DNB</em>) and John Franklin (1786–1847; <em>DNB</em>) explored the Arctic sea around Spitsbergen; another commanded by John Ross (1777–1856;

               Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1768–1821; <em>DNB</em>), detailing the insolent behaviour of Bartolomeo Pergami (1783/4–1842), her major
               domo, with whom Caroline was rumoured to be having an affair. The Princess’s behaviour
               was the subject of much gossip and in 1820 the government unsuccessfully introduced

               traditions was homosexuality, so Southey is implying that one of Caroline’s attendants
               was homosexual. Again, this information is merely local gossip and it is not possible

               with the opposition as an antagonist of the Prince Regent. Thus they would join Napoleon
