               <p>Time passes on, – I employ myself, &amp; have recovered strength, – but in point of spirits
                  I rather lose ground. The cause perhaps is obvious,

                  painful; – but as from time they become endurable, less effort is made to avoid them,
                  &amp; the poignancy of grief settles into melancholy. Both with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> &amp; myself this seems to be the case. Certain I am that nothing but the fixed &amp; full
                  assurance of immortality could prevent me from sinking under an affliction which is
                  greater than any stranger could possibly believe; – &amp; thankful I am that my feelings
                  have been so long &amp; so habitually directed toward this point. You probably know my
                  poems better than most people, &amp; may <span class="strikethrough">recollect</span> perceive how strongly my mind has been impressed upon this most consoling subject</p>

               <p>Yesterday I finished the main part of the Lay, – there remains only six or eight stanzas

                  </div> I have said nothing about it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a>, – for I think it very probable that you may advise me not to publish the poem now
                  it is written, lest it should give offence; &amp; having satisfied myself by writing it,
                  it is quite <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> indifferent to me whether it appears now, or after my decease. The emolument <span class="strikethrough">is</span> to be derived from it is too insignificant to be thought of, – &amp; the credit which
                  I should gain (assuredly it would be great credit) I can very well do without. So
                  take counsel with any body you please, &amp; remember that I who am easily enough persuaded
                  in any case, am in this perfectly unconcerned. For were it a thing of course that
                  I should produce a poem on this occasion, – there is at this time, God knows, sufficient
                  reason why I might stand excused.</p>

               with the children, in frequent intervals of study, – as tho I were an idle man. Of
               this I am quite incapable, &amp; shall long continue so. No circumstance of my former
               life ever brought with it so great a change, as that which I daily &amp; hourly feel,
