                  &amp; I believe he supposes that I am as rich as himself, &amp; therefore able to purchase
                  them. But on the probability that they may be sold separately, I wish you would look
                  at one of them for me. They are at Bigg’s. 54 Parliament Street.

                  Abipones (which is one of my delights) – or if it be an original work by some other
                  Jesuit, as very probably it may be, – perhaps by the Jesuit Joseph Brigniel.

                  every thing relating to South America &amp; especially the centre of it, than by the marketable
                  value (as I should suppose) of such a manuscript.</p>

               <p>There is another work in the Catalogue which may be of great value. N<sup>o</sup> 58. Oviedo’s History of the Indias. He wrote this in 50 books, of which only 21 were
                  printed, but the whole work was known to exist in Nicolas Antonios time: he however
                  says it was in 7 volumes, &amp; this catalogue makes it in 3, – a difference of hand writing
                  may explain this.
