               <p>If I had answered your letter <span class="ital">instanter</span>, it would have peradventure been half angrily, – some of your arguments being more
                  of a nature to provoke than to dissuade. In truth it surprized me that you should
                  attach so much importance to what appeared to me of no public importance whatever,
                  – no person to whom I had mentioned the intended title having expressed the slightest
                  surprise at it.

                           wished, and preferred to name it ‘La Belle Alliance’, the designation favoured by
                           the Prussian commander, Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher (1742–1819); hence he initially
                           wished to designate his poem, The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo (1816) as ‘The Poet’s
                           Pilgrimage to La Belle Alliance’.</span></div>

                  dislike &amp; respect me in an equal degree, I cared nothing about displeasing them farther.

                  while to act in opposition to the wish of any person whom we like or respect. Be it
                  then A Pilgrimage to Waterloo, – the line about the wrongful name shall be altered,
