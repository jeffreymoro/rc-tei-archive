               his speech in the House of Commons on 11 March 1818 on the Indemnity Act (1818). The
               pamphlet, <em>A Letter to the Right Hon. George Canning</em>, was withdrawn the day after it was published, but circulated under blank covers
               by the radical bookseller and printer James Ridgway (1745–1838). Canning’s response
               was to write, via Ridgway, on 10 April 1818, effectively challenging the anonymous
               author to a duel. This letter became public on 12 April. Many thought the pamphlet
               to have been the work of John Cam Hobhouse, Baron Broughton (1786–1869; <em>DNB</em>), but no reply was received and a duel was avoided.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               it should make increased financial provision for several of his brothers, who were
               intending marriage. This matter had become urgent with the death in 1817 of Princess
               Charlotte, the only legitimate heir in the succeeding generation. Eventually, Adolphus
               Frederick, Duke of Cambridge (1774–1850; <em>DNB</em>) married Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel (1797–1889; <em>DNB</em>) on 7 May 1818; Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (1767–1820; <em>DNB</em>) married Victoria, Dowager Princess of Leiningen (1786–1861; <em>DNB</em>) on 11 July 1818; and William Henry, Duke of Clarence (1765–1837; King of the United
               Kingdom 1830–1837; <em>DNB</em>) married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (1792–1849; <em>DNB</em>) on the same day. The government initially suggested that the Duke of Clarence’s
               annual income should increase from £19,000 to £40,000, as he was second in line to
               succeed his brother, the Prince Regent; while the Dukes of Cambridge and Kent and
               Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland (1771–1851; <em>DNB</em>) – he had married in 1815 – should receive £30,000. But in the face of concerted
               opposition, the government retreated and offered to add only £10,000 to the Duke of
               Clarence’s income and £6,000 to that of his brothers. On 15 April the House of Commons
               reduced the Duke of Clarence’s raise to £6,000; on 16 April the Commons granted the
               Duke of Cambridge a similar raise, but the Duke of Cumberland nothing. Finally, once
               his marriage was formally announced, the Duke of Kent received an additional £6,000
               on 15 May. The Duke of Clarence initially declined the offer of another £6,000 and
               this was seen as a refusal to continue with his proposed marriage, but he relented
               and pressed ahead anyway.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
