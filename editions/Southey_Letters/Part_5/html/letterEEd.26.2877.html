               his former friends. Southey and Coleridge considered themselves betrayed by Hazlitt,
               having hosted him at Greta Hall in 1803 and assisted him in escaping from the anger
               of the townsfolk after he caused a furore in a Keswick inn by spanking a local woman
               when she laughed at his advances. Hazlitt had married Sarah Stoddart (1774–1843) in
