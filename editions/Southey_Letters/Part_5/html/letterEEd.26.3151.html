               Spanish explorer, during his travels in North Africa and Arabia. His narrative appeared
               in England as <em>Travels of Ali Bey: in Morocco, Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey,
                  Between the years 1803 and 1807</em> (1816). Southey reviewed the book in <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 15 (July 1816), 299–345.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               On his return, he published <em>Travels in Africa, Egypt and Syria, from the Years 1792 to 1798</em> (1799). He was killed in Iran during an expedition to Samarkand.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               lie the bones of this fourth-century British saint who, according to legend, was killed,
               with her eleven thousand virginal handmaids, on a pilgrimage to Cologne, by the Huns
               besieging the city. The reliquary is extraordinary because, in addition to its size,
               it displays the bones arranged in patterns and so as to form letters and words. Southey
               had seen the church on his continental tour of 1817.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
