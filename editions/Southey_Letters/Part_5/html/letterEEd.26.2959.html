               of the <em>Courier</em> [19 March 1817] (Letter 2946). These two letters were sent to Charles Watkin Williams
               Wynn, on 17 and 19 March 1817 (Letters 2944 and 2948), for him to forward to the newspaper.
               In the event, Wynn’s absence from home led to a delay in his receiving the letters.
               By the time he did so, the public debate had moved on and Southey therefore decided
               not to publish them in the <em>Courier</em>, but instead to incorporate them into his pamphlet <em>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.</em> (1817).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               publication, on the grounds that it breached his copyright. The matter was complicated
               because Southey’s ownership of the copyright was brought into doubt when William Winterbotham
               swore an affidavit in which he declared that Southey had, when visiting Newgate prison,
               where he, Ridgway and Symonds were all confined, given him and Daniel Isaac Eaton
               (1753–1814; <em>DNB</em>), the radical publisher, the manuscript to do with as they liked. When the case was
               heard in the Court of Chancery on 18–19 March 1817, Southey lost his application for
               an injunction.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
