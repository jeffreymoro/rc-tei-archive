               <p>I am afraid that the parcel has not reached you, as you have not written to acquaint

                  </div> In that case you had better desire the Brough carrier to make enquiry at Penrith,
                  where our carrier says it was duly deposited. It is somewhat remarkable that being
                  about to have added another quarto volume to the packet, I was withheld by recollecting
                  that carriers were only answerable to the amount of £5 &amp; that this quarto would make
                  it exceed that sum, – in case of accident.</p>

                  sending back a revise. There is no harm in this, for tho the poem may be late for

                  bound before it is presented, – for which operations another fortnight must be allowed,
                  after the printers, hot-pressers, folders &amp; stitchers have done their work. Some credit
                  I shall get by it among the few: – but in the way of profit, there can be little or
                  no doubt but that more will be lost by its interfering with the sale of the Pilgrimage,
                  than can be gained by its own. In matters of fashion, &amp; it is merely for fashion that
                  books are bought by multitudes of buyers, “the last poem” is what is asked for, “Southeys
                  last poem” – &amp; the poor <span class="ital">last but one</span>, is at once left in the lurch. This is so much the case, that <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> as a matter of prudence I did wrong in publishing the Pilgrimage.</p>
