                  </div> But the story is ill constructed, and the style has a vice analogous to that which
                  prevailed in prose about 170 years ago, when every composition was overlaid with strained
                  thoughts and far-fetched allusions. The faults here are a perpetual stretch and strain
                  of feeling; and the too frequent presence of the narrator, bringing his own fancies
                  and meditations in the foreground, and thereby – as in French landscape-engraving
                  – calling off attention from the main subject, and destroying the effect. With less
                  poetry Samor would have been a better poem. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MilmanHenryHart">Milman</a> has been endeavouring to adapt the moody and thoughtful character of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>’s philosophical poetry to heroic narration: they are altogether incompatible; and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> himself, when he comes to narrate in his higher strains, throws it aside like a wrestler’s
                  garment, and is as severe a writer as Dante,

                  it is a seductive manner, and I think that as our poetry in Cowley’s days

            <p class="indent1">This is a great error. That poetry (I am speaking of heroic narrative) which would
               reach the heart, must go straight to the mark like an arrow. Away with all trickery
               and ornaments when pure beauty is to be represented in picture or in marble; away
               with drapery when you would display muscular strength. Call artifices of this kind
               to your aid in those feebler parts which must occur in every narrative, and which
               ought to be there to give the other parts their proper relief.</p>

                  are, however, better fitted for the drama than for narration; the drama admits his
