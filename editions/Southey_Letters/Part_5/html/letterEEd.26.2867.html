                  practicable, – that is how the Church might employ those who will else be enlisted
                  against her. And if there be a mode by which the <span class="strikethrough">cause of</span> tithes could be placed upon such a footing, or so commuted,

               of the lower classes, &amp; giving them more wants with more means of gratifying them.
               We must extend establishments instead of diminishing them, – more clergyman, more
               colleges – more Courts of Law, &amp; lastly we must colonize upon the true principles

               (1773–1856; <em>DNB</em>), who had in 1816 been dismissed from the editorship of the <em>Times</em> for the intemperate Toryism of his articles. It was entitled <em>The Correspondent; Consisting of Letters, Moral, Political, and Literary, between
                  Eminent Writers in France and England; and designed by presenting to each Nation a
                  Faithful Picture of the Other, to Enlighten both to their True Interests, promote
                  a Mutual Good Understanding between them, and render Peace the Source of a Common
                  Prosperity</em>. Southey contributed a sketch of the life of John Wesley (1703–1791; <em>DNB</em>) to the first two numbers (1 (1817), 26–48; and 2 (1817), 157–176). However, the
               <em>Correspondent</em> lasted only one further number. Stoddart became the editor of a new ministry-supported
               paper, <em>The New Times</em> (1817–1828).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of the townsfolk after he caused a furore in a Keswick inn by spanking a local woman
