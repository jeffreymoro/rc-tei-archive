               <p>I congratulate you on the success of your endeavour for a commemoration of Shakespeare,
                  – everything of this kind is honourable to our country.

                           Avon. Britton’s pamphlet Remarks on the Monumental Bust of Shakespeare at Stratford-Upon-Avon
                           was published in 1816, but he was not able to organise a celebratory volume on Shakespeare

                  </div> With regard to myself I am truly sensible of the honour which is done to me by desiring
                  my cooperation, but for poems of this nature I have neither inclination nor power,
                  – &amp; tho the want of the former <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> requisite might be overcome, that of the latter could not. In these cases {indeed}
                  want of inclination arises from want of power. And indeed were it otherwise my present
                  engagements are too numerous &amp; too weighty to allow me leisure.</p>
