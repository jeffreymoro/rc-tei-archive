               <p>You will have seen by my last letters that I am not exhausting myself by over-exertion.
                  On the contrary for many days I have been forcing myself to the more difficult necessity
                  of bearing my own recollections; – time will soften them down, – indeed they now have,
                  &amp; always have had all the alleviation which an assured hope &amp; faith can bestow, –
                  &amp; when I give way to tears which is only in darkness or in solitude, they are not
                  tears of unmingled pain.

                  </div> I begin to think that change of place would not be desirable; &amp; that the pain of leaving
                  a place where I have enjoyed so many <span class="strikethrough">t</span> years of such great happiness, is more than <span class="strikethrough">should</span> it is wise to incur without <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> necessity. Nor could I reconcile either <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> or myself to the thought of leaving poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson</a>, – whose heart is half-broken already, &amp; to whom our departure would be a death stroke.
                  Her days {indeed} must necessarily be few; – &amp; her <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> life-lease will probably expire before the end of <span class="strikethrough">my first</span> {the} term to which we are looking on.</p>

               Remember this, &amp; look to it as a fitting arrangement which will benefit us both.</p>
