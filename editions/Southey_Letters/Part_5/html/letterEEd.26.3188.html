               <p>I send the inclosed packet unsealed that, if you have any curiosity for such things,
                  you may see some of John Welseys Epistles. They are perfectly worthless, except the
                  last, &amp; this is of some value, because it touches upon a point of doctrine {<span class="strikethrough">of</span>} which he preached very rashly during many years of his life, &amp; this letter was written
                  only a few weeks before his death, when his hand shook so that he could scarcely write
                  intelligibly.

                           Progress of Methodism, 2 vols (London, 1820), II, pp. 588–589. The letter concerned
                           Wesley’s doctrine of the ‘Perfection’ that believers might attain – a doctrine Southey
                           defined as ‘a constant communion with God, which fills the humble heart with love’
                           (p. 183), but which could easily be misunderstood as implying believers would enjoy
                           good health or infallible judgement, or that they were without sin, or could not transgress
                           against God’s laws.</span></div>
