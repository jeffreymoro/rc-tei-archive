               <p>I thank you for your letter, – for your sympathy &amp; for your prayers.

                  </div> We have been supported almost beyond my hopes, &amp; even according to our need. I do
                  not feel any return of strength, – but it will soon be restored, – anxiety has worn
                  me to the bone, – while that state continued I was incapable of any employment, &amp;
                  my time was past – day &amp; night, alternately in praying that the worst might be averted,
                  &amp; in preparing for it, if it should take place. Three things I prayd, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">the childs</a> recovery if it might please God, – that if this might not be, his passage might be
                  made easy, – &amp; that we might be supported in our affliction. The two latter petitions
                  were granted, – &amp; I am truly thankful. But when the event was over, then like David
                  I roused myself,

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I employ myself incessantly, taking however every day as much exercise as I can bear
               without injurious fatigue, – which is not much. My appetite is good, – &amp; I have now
               no want of sleep. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is perfectly calm &amp; resigned; – her fortitude is indeed exemplary to the highest
               degree, – but her employments do not withdraw her from herself as mine do, &amp; therefore
               I fear she has more to struggle with.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Perhaps we were too happy before this dispensation struck us. Perhaps it was expedient
               for us that our hearts should be drawn more strongly towards another world; – this
               is the use of sorrow, &amp; to this use I trust our sorrow will be sanctified</p>
