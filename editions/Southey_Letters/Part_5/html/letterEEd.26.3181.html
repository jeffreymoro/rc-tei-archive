                           on bringing it to publication. Southey sent it to Murray, who did not publish it;
                           Longmans did, in 1820.</span></div>

               <p>It is not well to rhyme upon the same vowel (if the sound be strongly marked) in succession,

                  </div> Perhaps my ear may be the more sensible of this because I am accustomed to Spanish
                  poetry in which the most popular metre requires no other similarity of sound than
                  that the {two} final syllables of the alternate lines should contain the same <span class="ital">vowels</span>.

            <p class="indent1">‘We’ll shroud in dark obscurity’. To shroud is one of those verbs which <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxxxxxxxxx after them</span> will not admit the omission of the word to which they apply. You mean to say shroud
               ourselves, – there is another fault in the line obscurity must be dark, &amp; therefore
               the epithet is superfluous. This is a case in which two faults are better than one,
               because <span class="strikethrough">both are</span> in getting rid of one you will amend the other.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I would rather call them children than cherubs, – we take the resemblance from tombstones
               only, – this is a mere matter of individual taste, – cottage children are generally
               chubby <span class="strikethrough">enough</span> for cherubs, but seldom clean enough.</p>
            <p class="indent1">To scan a vision is an awkward expression – nor is it well to speak of <span class="ital">gazing</span> on the forms of other days, which is confounding too much visible with ideal objects.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Have you not made your father too old? Having been a pastor sixty years he must be
               at least 82, – but you do not mean Ellen to be over one or two &amp; twenty. – ‘The parent
               <span class="ital">dove</span>’ seems an expression too obviously created by the rhyme. ‘<span class="ital">Clear</span>’ is not a happy epithet for the tones of infancy. – It is not from weeds that a germ
               requires guarding, so much as from other things – all this however is very pretty
               &amp; with a sweet flow of tender female feeling. I <span class="ital">doubt</span> whether in such circumstances the sort of illusion which you describe in looking
               at his grown daughter could arise, – man himself changes too much for it. – ‘And scattered
               times unresting feet, with blessings,’ – if I understand this rightly, it is an awkward
               passage. ‘Hope &amp; ‘spoke’ cannot be allowed as rhymes, tho I would always allow large
               license: moreover the word ought to be <span class="ital">spoken</span>. So also ‘wove’ ought to <span class="strikethrough">be</span> be ‘woven’.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You cannot say ‘the tide of the kettle’. Never force a word out of its appropriate
               meaning, unless there be a peculiar propriety in doing it: ‘Slumber seals his drowsy
               brain’ get rid of this if you can passages of this kind require an easiness of expression,
               – any thing forced or violent is out of place, &amp; here the strong metaphor is evidently
               produced for the sake of the rhyme. – ‘Wove’ is once more used instead of ‘woven’
               in this canto. – All that follows, till the last four lines, is evidently fresh from
               the heart.</p>
            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Where relief &amp; rest</div>
               <div class="l">And needful care might <span class="ital">wait</span> him best –</div>
            </div>
            <p>I am {not} sure that I read this word rightly, but if I do it is not well exprest.
               – And it would be better to say ‘whose lowly home to rest Now welcomed’ &amp;c – than
               to make rest the welcomer. It is one of the faults of modern poetry that it uses figurative
               language too lavishly, &amp; thus lessens its effect when it is required.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The lapse of time is marked with right poetical feeling. But the primrose bank &amp; the
                  Orchard cannot <span class="ital">pass away</span>.

                           ‘passed away’.</span></div>
                  </div> It is to such improprieties as these that I wish particularly to draw your attention;
                  – most persons are insensible to them &amp; yet they make one great part of the difference
                  between writing well or ill. – I doubt whether ‘<span class="ital">hoary hair</span>’ will not strike the reader as being improper, because we always speak of grey hair<span class="ital">s</span>. The line which presently follows about the sparrow is a bad one, &amp; appears worse
                  because it brings to mind the beautiful expression in the Gospel.

A Garlands votive <span class="ital">twine</span>, – alter this &amp; the whole passage is <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> very pleasing, – only in the beginning of the Canto Ellens youth should not be called
                  gay as well as buoyant, – there was an end of all its gaiety. ‘Disappointed misery’
                  is an odd combination of words – for misery is never disappointed. – ‘Spa<span class="ital">r</span>k’ will not do with ‘hea<span class="ital">r</span>t’, &amp; in the next couplet the metaphor is changed, which it ought not to be. – Womans
                  heart may be the seat of love, but you would not call it its clime, if the verse had
                  not betrayed you into it. This is the danger which you have to guard against when
                  you write in rhyme, – it continually tempts the writer to forced constructions &amp; a
                  violent use of words out of their proper place. ‘All forgot’ – should be ‘forgotten’.
                  – The conclusion of this Canto serves the metaphor so far, that at first I thought
                  she had thrown herself into the water. The fault may be as likely in the reader as
                  in the writer.</p>

               – for if I had not thought that {the} virtues <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> {greatly} preponderated I should never have bestowed a moments attention upon the
               faults – nor would I point them out for any other purpose than that they might be
