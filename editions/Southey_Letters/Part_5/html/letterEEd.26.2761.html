                  suffer me to recruit. I am seriously apprehensive for the shock which my health seems

                  &amp; those who are about me give me credit for a fortitude which I do not possess. Many
                  blessings are left me – abundant blessings, – more than I have deserved, more than
                  I had ever reason to expect, or even to hope. I have strong ties to life, &amp; many duties
                  yet to perform. Believe me I see these things as they ought to be seen. Reason will
                  do something, Time more, Religion most of all. The loss is but for this world; – but <span class="strikethrough">should I</span> as long as I remain in this world I shall feel it</p>
