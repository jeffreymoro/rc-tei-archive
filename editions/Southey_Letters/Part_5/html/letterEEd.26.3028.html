                  history of the country. He was a man of very superior abilities, much greater knowledge
                  than is usually found among the Portugueze, good intentions, a noble spirit, &amp; a generous
                  heart. But he <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> ran from the miserable superstitions of popery into a more deplorable state of utter
                  unbelief, – he was possessed by that revolutionary spirit which even at this time
                  is propagated every where by the English press, – &amp; he perished at last by his own
