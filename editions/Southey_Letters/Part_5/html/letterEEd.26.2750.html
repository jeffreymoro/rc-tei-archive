               <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> has been severely ill, &amp; tho there has been an amendment, there is still reason for
                  alarm. The first affection was a slight fever accompanied with pain in the right side,
                  – the pain not severe &amp; shifting. A pitch plaister seemed to relieve it, the fever
                  abated, &amp; for a few days I thought him well. Then came on a sudden cough which for
                  a fortnight I supposed to be the only disease – &amp; from then after it had lasted so
                  long, I thought him materially better tho he complained of occasional pain in the
                  chest &amp; on the back as if straight thro. One of his best days, the weather being too
                  bleak to be out of doors, I thought to amuse &amp; exercise him by whipping a large top.
                  In the evening he complained of great &amp; sudden pain in his breast when he attempted
                  to lie down on the ground as he was used <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxx</span> &amp; at night cried out with pain when he went to bed, – the pain evidently produced
                  by the act of lying down, &amp; going up soon afterwards <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> and I were inclined to think it was muscular proceeding from the too great exertion
                  with the top. Symptoms however soon appeared of a bilious obstruction, a grain of
                  calomel was given – observe that by this time he was very much weakened by the long
                  continuance of indisposition. It was given at night &amp; having produced no effect by
                  eleven the next <span class="strikethrough">day</span> morning, a second grain was given with as little effect – two ingestions proved unavailing.
                  Therefore at night <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> gave two grains more combined with James powder.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The popular fever cure invented by Robert James (c. 1703-1776; DNB)</span></div>
                  </div> This produced towards morning a natural motion, a second bearing marks of medicine,
                  – a third of the foulest nature <span class="strikethrough">x</span> – <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> looking like spinnage, – &amp; this was followed by tenesmus which an anodyne draught
                  greatly relieved. That night he lay down without pain, – &amp; I then felt at rest, believing
                  the cause had been removed. This was on Monday. Yesterday morning I found he had a
                  still fouler stool in the night with small white specks in it, looking like a cream
                  when it curdles in your tea. He had now a very great degree of fever, &amp; said that
                  he was much worse, – it was the calomel which now showed itself in having affected
                  his mouth a different purgative was given <span class="strikethrough">he grew</span> which did not operate till this morning, but he grew better towards evening – only
                  he complained at times of the old pain in his chest, &amp; cried out when he lay down
                  at night. This morning another bilious stool with the same specks – which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> &amp; I suppose to be brimstone, – an old purgative taken some fortnight ago. at least
                  we can think of nothing else but upon attempting to lie down he complained – &amp; shed
                  tears. There is some internal malady beyond all doubt: the fever continues &amp; is now
                  freshened, – he was better in the morning very considerably, – fatigue &amp; the little
                  food which he took at dinner (some fish) may easily explain this, – but how is the
                  pain explicable? It is a dismal thing being so far from any good medical aid in a
                  case of this kind. There is a liver affection I fear &amp; believe &amp; we cannot give calomel
                  which would immediately salivate him.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It is almost idle to write to you upon this subject – five days must elapse before
               your answer can arrive, – &amp; what can you tell me upon such a statement? There is no
               external soreness when he is touched; there have been no rigours &amp; sudden perspirations
               as if abscess were forming. But that something is very much deranged is but too certain.</p>
            <p class="indent1">For many days I have been incapable of any employment, alternately hoping &amp; fearing
               – today had been hopeful, till the return of this sudden pain in lying down has <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> made alarm again preponderate. And I write now rather that I may not have cause to
               reproach myself for not having written than from much expectation <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> that you can throw any light upon a case so imperfectly represented.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I cannot <span class="ital">ascertain</span> that the pain is <span class="ital">decidedly</span> toward the right side, but incline to think that it is. In the breast &amp; the back
               he complains sometimes one sometimes the other, &amp; generally lays his fingers in the
               middle of the sternum.</p>
