               80 cupolas, attended by 200 servants, a general physician &amp; a surgeon. All passengers
               (travellers I suppose) who fall sick are received in the hospital &amp; attended to. Twice
               a day they receive excellent dishes, so that pheasants, partridges &amp; other precious
               birds are by no means spared. If such provisions are not ready at the hospital, it
               is provided by the charters of foundation that such provisions are to be furnished
               by the Imarets (dining establishments) of S Soleman, of Prince Mahommed his son, of
               Sultan Ahmed 1, of Khasseke Sultan (near the womens market,) of Wesa Sultan, of Eyoob
               Sultan, of Prince Djehaungeer (at Tophana) of Mohammed Sultan at Scutari of the Walides
               mosque at Scutari. There are musicians &amp; players paid to divert the madmen, &amp; to cure
               by that means their madness. There is also a separate hospital for Infidels.</p>

            <p class="indent1">At Cayenne. On a eté long-tems que les esclaves me pouvoient pas se multiplier, parce
               qu’il n’étoit pas possible de pouvoir sauver aucun Négrillon; ils mouroient presqu’aussi-tôt
               qu’ils venoient au monde. Aujourd’hui même ces pauvres enfans sont encore sujets à
               cette maladie, qu’on appelle si improprement, dans le pays, <span class="ital">Catharre</span>. Ce mal, que l’on peut nommer le fleau des enfans, est une convulson universelle,
               ou un véritable <span class="ital">Tetanos</span>. It attaque principalement ceux qui sont nouvellement nés; &amp; les emporte, presque
               tous, en trois ou quatre jours. Il n’épargne pas même les grandes personnes, à quelque
               age qu’elles soient. On n’a jamais vu, ou du moins très rarement, qu’aucun Blanc,
               pour parler le langage du pays, aye été saisi de pareille maladie. On a constamment
               observé que les enfans sont plus sujets à ce cruel mal, le trois ou le quatre, jusques
               même au neuviéme jour après leur naissance; de sorte que s’ils passent neuf jours
               entiers sans en avoir aucune atteinte, les femmes les croyent hors de danger, &amp; les
               exposent hardiment à l’air. Il en est qui, en naissant, apportent cette maladie, &amp;
               meurent aussi-tôt. On connoit ordinairement quand les enfans ont le <span class="ital">Tethanos</span>, qu’on nomme aussi tout court la Maladie, par la difficulté qu’ils ont à succer le
               lait, par la convulsion de la mâchoire: leur cri est tout-à-fait gêné, &amp; diférent
               de celui des autres enfans. Enfin la mâchoire se serre de plus en plus; les extrémités
               deviennent roides; &amp; des mouvemens convulsifs, qui sent l’avant-coureur de la mort,
               venant coup sur coup, enlevent en peu de tems le malade.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A l’égard det adultes, ils résistent à la vérité plus long-tems que le enfans; mais
               ils ont toujours le malheur d’éprouver le méme sort. La maladie le manifeste par une
               espéce de Torticolis; ou une douleur qu’on sent au col, &amp; que les malades comparent
               à une corde qui les preffe: la mâchoire se serre ensuite, &amp; empêche d’avaler la nourriture;
               les bras &amp; les jambes deviennent si roides, qu’en prenant la malade par un pied, ou
               par la tête, on le leve comme une piéce de bois. La roideur des membres n’est pas
               si continuellement soutenue, qu il n’arrive plusieurs fois le jour quelques contractions
               involuntaires. Ces accidens fatiguent si fort les malades, qu’ils jettent des hauts
               cris; ils demandent qu’on les soutienne; &amp; on est même obligé de leur tenir la tête
               un peu élevée, pour leur faciliter la respiration, qui est fort gênée. Ce qu’il y
               a de plus particulier dans cette maladie, c’est une faim insatiable; dont les malades
               sont quelquefois si fort pressés, qu’ils mangeroient à tout moment, si on vouloit
               les satisfaire, &amp; s’ils avoient d’ailleurs la liberté d’avaler. La fiévre ne manque
               jamais de survenir; des sueurs copieuses se répandent dans toute l’habitude du corps;
               &amp; le mal augmentant de plus en plus, le malade meurt avec des mouvemens convulsifs
               horribles.</p>
            <p class="indent1">La précaution la plus sure pour arrêter le progrès d’un si cruel mal, est d’arroser
               les malades plufieurs fois par jour avec de l’eau la plus fraiche qu’on puisse trouver,
               &amp; sur tout dès le moment que l’on s’apperçoit que les enfans ne peuvent téter qu’avec
               peine, &amp; que leur mâchoire commence a se serrer. If faut réiterer ces aspersions,
               jusques à ce que ces fâcheux accidens foient dissipés, &amp; que les parties du corps
               ayent repris leur premiere souplesse. Il est necessaire de soutenir les forces du
               malade; sur tout des grandes personnes, par des bons bouillons, qu’il faut donner
               peu &amp; souvent, dans l’intervale desquels on doit leur faire prendre quelques eueillerées
               de vin. Il ne faut pas manquer non plus de mettre en usage le Mercure doux, ou l’Etioph
               minéral, en le mêlant avec des purgatifs, comme la Rhubarbe, le Diagrede, le Jalap.
               L’Extrait d’Aloës m’a aussi réussi dans cette rencontre. Et supposé que le malade
               n’eut pas assez de liberté d’avaler des Bolus, en ce cas, on doit y sustituer une
               infusion de Sené, avec la Manne &amp; les autres purgatifs ordinaires. Les esclaves que
               j’ai eu le bonheur de guérir dans la Colonie, sont autant de témoins du succès &amp; de
               la bonté de cette méthode. Les Négresses, aujourd’hui, dès qu’elles s’apperçoivent
               que leurs enfans sont menacés de la Maladie, elles les baignent, sans autre façon,
               &amp; les arrosent avec des grands <span class="ital">Couyes</span> (gourds) pleins d’eau.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Hospital of Sultan Bayazet at Adrianople, with a medical academy.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There are 8 rooms here, which ‘are ever full of sick people, poor and rich. In some
                  of these rooms fire is lighted at winter time according to the desire of the sick,
                  &amp; they are fondled with silk cushions, good beds, &amp;c. for the spring when madness
                  is particularly raging. the madmen sick of mystic love (religious madmen) are seen
                  to lie here chained like lions in their dens, looking to the basin (the fountain I
                  suppose), &amp; speaking in the cant of Kalenders. Others dispersing in the garden amongst
                  the flower beds, yell &amp; shout to the song of the nightingale, without measure or art.
                  In the season of the flowers the sick are often cured only by the sight &amp; smell of
                  them; &amp; some lose their wits by the sweet scent of them (perhaps this is German for
                  fainting). The greater number of the madmen enchained here are lovesick, &amp; their sight
                  may cure those who are in danger to become mad by the number of pretty faces to be
                  seen here. Some of the mad are cured by music; and therefore Sultan Bayazet, the founder,
                  established a living for some musicians, who come thrice a week, &amp; play in the winter
                  &amp; summer rooms to the sick &amp; mad. The mad begin then to jump like apes at the tunes, <span class="ital">Rast, Neva, Sigah, Bhehargeh</span>, but above all to the tunes <span class="ital">Zevgoole </span>&amp; <span class="ital">Boslik</span>, which being accompanied by the great kettledrum gives particular pleasure to the
                  mad. Briefly there is no hospital &amp; no madhouse in the whole world like that of Adrianople.
                  The sick &amp; mad receive three times in four &amp; twenty hours, not only common food, but
                  birds &amp; all kinds of aviary dainties from the kitchen founded for that purpose. Twice
                  in the week the apothecary’s room is opened, &amp; medicines are distributed to all those
                  who ask for them; preparations of cardamom, caryophils, &amp; all kind of aromatic spices.
                  On the door of the room a curse is written against those who without being sick should
                  ask for such medicines, that they should fall sick immediately.’ Eulia Effendi

               manuscript to advise on whether it should be published in England. However, a translation
               did not appear until <em>Narrative of Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, in the Seventeenth Century</em> (1834). The translator was probably Joseph Freiherr von Hammer-Purgstall (1774–1856),
               who had published a German version in 1814.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               a long time, we were of the opinion that slaves could not multiply, especially since,
               being unable to save a single Negro, they were dying almost as soon as they were born.
               Today, these poor children are still subject to the disease that is so improperly
               referred to in this country as Catharre. This evil, that we may call the scourge of
               children, is a universal convulsion or the fully-fledged Tetanus. It primarily affects
               those who are newly born, &amp; it takes the lives of most of them in three or four days.
               Not even the adults, no matter their age, are spared from this disease. We have never,
               or at least very rarely, seen whites, as the people of this country call them, that
               were seized by such a disease. We have consistently observed that children are more
               prone to this cruel evil, but even so, some of them do not show any signs of the disease
               until the third or the fourth or even up to the ninth day after birth, which is why
               the women, believing them to be out of danger, boldly expose them to the elements.
               There are those who, at birth, bear this disease and die instantly. We usually know
               when children have Tetanus, also referred to as the Disease, by the difficulty they
               have in suckling their mother’s milk and the convulsions of their jaw: their cry is
               usually stunted and different from that of other children. Finally, the jaw tightens
               even more, the extremities become stiff &amp; the convulsions, the harbingers of death,
               now coming in quick succession, are quick to take the patient’s life. With regard
               to the adults, they resist much longer than the children, but they still have the
               misfortune of experiencing the same fate. The disease manifests itself as a kind of
               torticollis, or a pain that is felt at the neck, one that the patients compared to
               a rope that <span class="ital">presses</span>: their jaw then tightens, and it prevents them from swallowing food, the arms &amp; the
               legs become so stiff that taking the patient by a foot or by the head is like lifting
               a plank of wood. The stiffness of the limbs is not continually sustained, as they’ll
               often experience involuntary contractions several times a day. These incidents are
               so tiresome that the sick cry out asking us to prop them up, &amp; we even have to hold
               their head a little higher to facilitate breathing, which is very uncomfortable. What
               is especially particular in this disease is an insatiable hunger that sometimes leaves
               patients so hard-pressed that they would eat all the time if their wishes were met,
               and if they had also freedom to swallow. The fever never fails to occur, profuse sweating
               spreads all throughout the body, and the pain increases more and more until the disease
               ends in horrible convulsions. The safest precaution to stop the progress of such a
               cruel pain is to sluice the sick several times a day with the coolest water we can
               find, and especially as soon as we notice that the children are suckling with difficulty,
               or when their jaw starts to tighten. If necessary, we repeat the spraying of water
               until these unfortunate symptoms dissipate, and until the body parts have returned
               to their initial flexibility. It is necessary to help maintain the patient’s strength,
               especially the adults, by giving them good broth, often and in little doses, as well
               as by making them drink spoonfuls of wine in the meantime. It is important to also
               use sweet Mercury or <span class="ital">Ethiopian minerals</span> by mixing it with purgatives like rhubarb, powdered scammony and Jalap. Aloe extracts
               also worked for me in these kinds of situations. And assuming that the patient is
               not able to swallow a bolus, then we must substitute it with an infusion of Senna,
               Manna &amp; other ordinary purgatives. The slaves that I had the pleasure of healing in
               the Colony all testify to the success &amp; the goodness of this method. Today, as soon
               as black women notice that their children are at risk of the disease, they do nothing
               else but bathe and sprinkle them with great Couyes (gourds) full of water.'</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
