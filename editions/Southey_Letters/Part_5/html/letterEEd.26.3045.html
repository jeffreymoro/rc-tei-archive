            <p>MS: MS untraced; text taken from Lady Knighton, <em>Memoirs of Sir William Knighton</em>, 2 vols (Paris, 1838)<br> Previously published: Lady Knighton, <em>Memoirs of Sir William Knighton, Bart., G.C.H. Keeper of the Privy Purse during the
                  Reign of His Majesty George the Fourth</em>, 2 vols (Paris, 1838), I, pp. 83–84 [in part; undated].<br> Dating note: The letter was probably written in late November 1817, as Southey turned
               to the task of marking the death, from post-partum haemorrhage, on 6 November 1817,
               of Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales. Similarities in phrasing suggest a composition
               date close to Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 26 November 1817, Letter
               3042.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The death of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WalesCharlottePrincess">Princess Charlotte</a> has been felt in a manner very honourable to the national character. Individuals,
               as far as my observation goes, feel concerning it as they would upon a similar case
               occurring in private life, and within the circle of their own acquaintance.</p>

                  </div> spoken of on the occasion impressed me a good deal: he was called ‘poor <span class="ital">man</span>’ and ‘poor <span class="ital">fellow</span>.’ His affliction has brought him down to our level, and rank was forgotten in the
                  sympathy of humanity.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I do not like to write anything upon the mournful occasion in the common-place form
                  of threnodial verses, which would be read only to be criticised and forgotten, and,
                  under the appearance of respect, are in reality the most disrespectful of all things.
                  But I would fain so treat the subject as to combine with it something which might
                  aim at present utility, and possess some permanent value, as far as I am capable of
                  giving it. I hope I see the way of doing this; but I compose slowly, and not without
                  some previous meditation.

            <p class="indent1">Many causes have led me to look far forward and widely around me: and if I could teach
               others to see things as they appear distinctly to myself, it would be doing the State
               some service. Great changes in the very constitution of society are going on – almost
               as great as the human system undergoes when all its physical powers are developed,
               and the time is as critical. In proportion as this is properly understood, government
               will be strengthened or endangered – perhaps overthrown: and in that word ‘government’
               the best interests of the human race are at this time included. If I can assist in
               strengthening it, I shall not be an unprofitable servant: and I am a very disinterested
               one, for I look for no reward. </p>
