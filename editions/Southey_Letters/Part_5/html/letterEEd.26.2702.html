               <p>Ali Bey will be cried down. A man who thought it worth while to be circumcised before
                  he set out on his travels, should have explored something of more consequence than
                  the temple of Mecca. He has added very little to our stock of knowledge; – the character
                  in which he appears raises expectations which are not fulfilled, &amp; for that reason
                  less credit is likely to be given him than he deserves. There is curious matter in

               Finding himself in debt, he sought to sell them to the British Museum. Considerable
               controversy ensued about their worth, artistic and monetary, and a parliamentary committee
               decided in 1816 that they should be purchased for £35,000. The controversy was compounded
               when the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, 25 (October 1815), 285–310, published accusations that Elgin had, when Ambassador
               Extraordinary in Constantinople in 1799, appropriated the papers and valuable artefacts
               of John Tweddell (1769–1799; <em>DNB</em>). The accusations were criticised in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 14 (October 1815), 257–273.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               12,1774, at Bristol, where his father carried on an extensive business as a wholesale
               linen draper. The son was educated first under Mr. Foote a baptist minister of great
               ability, but at that time very aged. After a short time young Southey was removed
               to a school at Carston, where he remained about two years, and was then entered at
               Westminster School in 1787, where, in 1790, he fell under censure for his concern
               in the rebellion excited against the master, Dr. Vincent. In 1792 he became a student
               of Baliol College, Oxford, with a view to the church, but Unitarian principles and
               the revolutionary mania put an end to that design. So strongly did he imbibe the new
               opinions on politics which the explosion in France had produced, that he, with his
               friends Lovell and Coleridge, projected a plan of settling on the banks of the Susquehannah
               in North America, and of there founding a new republic. This Utopian scheme was soon
               dissolved for the want of means, and in 1795 Mr. Southey married Miss Tricker, soon
               after which event he accompanied his maternal uncle the Rev. Mr. Hill to Portugal,
               that gentleman being appointed Chaplain to the Factory at Lisbon. In 1801 Mr. Southey
               obtained the appointment of Secretary to the Right Hon. Isaac Corry, Chancellor of
               the Exchequer for Ireland. On retiring from office with his patron, our author went
               to reside in a cottage near Keswick, where also dwelt under the same roof the widow
               of his friend Lovell and the wife of Mr. Coleridge, both which ladies are sisters
               to Mrs. Southey. In 1813 he succeeded Mr. Pye as Poet Laureat, and it must be confessed
               that, with some slight exceptions, his subsequent performances are such as do credit
               to the appointment.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
