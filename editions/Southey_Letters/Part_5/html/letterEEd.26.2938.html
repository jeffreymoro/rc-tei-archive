                           (and with no acknowledgement) from it; see Southey to John May, 6 October 1815, The
                           Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four, Letter 2660. Southey later publicised
                           the plagiarism in his History of Brazil, 3 vols (London, 1810–1819), II, p. viii.
                           Beauchamp had also borrowed from the writings of others in his Histoire de la Guerre

                  it, I do not despair of convincing you that philosophy and freedom have suffered much
                  more from their inconsistent friends than from their bigotted enemies. In spite of
                  both, I hope they will prosper. But we shall not agree so well in our definition of
                  philosophy as we shall of freedom. In my judgment, any philosophy that weakens our
                  belief of immortality is a curse to mankind. Of this I am assured, that, were it not
                  for that belief, the burthen of life would be heavier than I could bear, although

               it; see Southey to John May, 6 October 1815, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</em>, Letter 2660. Southey later publicised the plagiarism in his <em>History of Brazil</em>, 3 vols (London, 1810–1819), II, p. viii. Beauchamp had also borrowed from the writings
               of others in his <em>Histoire de la Guerre de la Vendée et des Chouans, depuis son Origine jusqu’à la Pacification
                  de 1800</em>, first published in 1806, with corrected second and third editions following in 1807
               and 1809. Southey had pointed this out in an article in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 15 (April 1816), 1–69, describing Beauchamp as one who ‘when plagiarism fails him,
               makes as little scruple of supplying the want of knowledge by invention as he does
               of appropriating to himself the labours of others’ (13).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of France 1814–1824), the monarchy had been obliged to concede the Charter of 1814,
               which instituted a bicameral Parliament. This had not prevented a ‘White Terror’ in
               1815–1816 in which the administration was purged of officials loyal to the Revolution.
               About 6,000 people were tried for various political offences and there were 300 mob
               lynchings in the South of France. The Cortes had ruled those parts of Spain not occupied
               by France in 1810–1813 and created the liberal Constitution of 1812. Southey felt
               its doctrinaire hostility to the Church, nobility and monarchy had made it difficult
               to create a stable Spanish political system.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
