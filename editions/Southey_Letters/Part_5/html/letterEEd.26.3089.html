            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your last letter reached me in London, when I was just setting out for the Continent.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In early May 1817.</span></div>
                  </div> Three months of continual movement, exertion &amp; excitement were of great use both to
                  my health &amp; spirits. During that time I saw the outside of Paris, the best parts of
                  Switzerland, crost the Alps twice, got as far as Milan, returned by way of the Black
                  Forest &amp; Frankfort, &amp; so from Mentz to Cologne by the left bank of the Rhine, bringing
                  back a store of recollections for the rest of my life. Few persons have ever had a
                  stronger appetite for travelling than I have, tho I sit at home till I almost grow
                  to my chair.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Our home scenery was somewhat diminished by the comparison, yet less so than might
               have been expected, &amp; this impression soon wore off after my return. The poverty of
               our vales was more striking after the chesnuts on the Italian side of the Alps &amp; the
               magnificent walnuts of Switzerland. Switzerland is certainly the country in which
               an Englishman who should chuse to live abroad would find manners &amp; feelings the least
               unlike his own, – that is, in the Protestant cantons: but I did not go far enough
               South for the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> blessings of a climate which would vie with that of Portugal.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am glad that the first tidings which informed me of your illness, told of your recovery
               also. There is an enjoyment of our absent friends, – even of those from whom we are
               far distant, – in talking &amp; thinking of them, which make a large part of the happiness
               of life. It is a great thing to be in the same place with a friend – it is something
               to be in the same planet. And whenever you are removed to a better, there are few
               men whose loss will be more widely felt in this, – for I know no one who had administered
               so much delight to so extensive a part of the public. – I <span class="strikethrough">if</span> {hope} your illness has left no weakness behind it. We stand in need sometimes of
               visitations which may lead us to look toward eternity, – &amp; in such cases the stroke
               is merciful when it falls upon the body. There is a joyousness too in the sense of
               returning health, a freshness of <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> sensation such as <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> one might expect from a draught from the fountain of youth.</p>

               Archibald Constable (1774–1827; <em>DNB</em>), publisher of Scott and the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, had agreed to take over some of their concerns. What Scott did not reveal to Southey

               10 June 1818. It was already clear, though, that there would be a contest in Westmorland,
               which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were supporters of the government –
               the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790–1867), MP for Westmorland
               1812–1867 and William, Viscount Lowther (1787–1872), later 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and
               MP for Cockermouth 1808–1813, MP for Westmorland 1813–1831 and 1832–1841. So complete
               was the Lowthers’ dominance that the last contested election in Westmorland was in
               1774. However, in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller landowners had brought
               forward Henry Brougham to challenge the Lowthers – Brougham’s family home was Brougham
               Hall near Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as a local candidate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
