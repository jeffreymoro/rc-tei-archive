                  the winter in the great city, which tho’ the ugliest of all capitals, is nevertheless,
                  take it for all in all, without an equal either in ancient or modern times. I hope
                  you will not have left London before the middle of April, – by which time it is my
                  intention (if no unforeseen circumstances should occur to prevent me) to be there,
                  – for two or three weeks, &amp; probably I may visit Paris before my return.
