                  recommend as the only means of <span class="strikethrough">prevent</span> averting it that the batteries which are now playing breach upon the Government be
                  silenced, – in other words that the punishment for sedition be made such as to prevent
                  a repetition of the offence; – &amp; if verdicts cannot be procured that the H Corpus

                  </div> be suspended &amp; the Anarchists silenced by that means. I have endeavoured to make the
                  necessity of these measures felt, &amp; shown that for my own part I cannot be better
                  employed any where <span class="strikethrough">else</span> than here, &amp; that if it be thought advisable that I should either covertly or openly
                  give up some time to political writing, it would counteract in great measure the effect
                  of any thing which might proceed from me, <span class="strikethrough">if I</span> were I to accept of any thing in shape of office or augmented pension;

                  </div> – this therefore I have decidedly declined, – but have offered to employ my pen zealously
                  in recommendation &amp; defence of vigorous measures. – Should I therefore be again desired
                  to visit London, my journey will pass as an ordinary occurrence, – &amp; nothing extraordinary
                  will occur in it, except that I shall be introduced to {some of} the first officers
                  of Government – instead of the second to whom my acquaintance has hitherto been limited: <span class="strikethrough">I can only repeat in conversation what I have said in writing</span> – &amp; this may pass for a very natural occurrence. I can only repeat in conversation
                  what I have already said in writing; &amp; perhaps concur in arranging a journal, of which
                  most certainly I will not undertake the management: – that office is beneath me, &amp;
                  would require a sacrifice of character as well as time. The matter of danger is one
                  which could not fail to present itself, – as for that matter I know very well what
                  I have at stake in the event of a revolution, – were the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HuntLeigh">Hunts</a> &amp; the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HazlittWilliam">Hazlitts</a> to have the upper hand. There is no man whom the Whigs &amp; the Anarchists hate more
                  inveterately, because there is none whom they fear so much. Nothing that I could do
                  would increase their good disposition towards me, – &amp; it would be folly to dream of <span class="strikethrough">lessening</span> abating it. If the G. will but act vigorously &amp; promptly all may yet be well, – if
                  they will not – I shall have no time to spare from my history of Brazil:
