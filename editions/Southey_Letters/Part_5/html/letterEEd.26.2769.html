               <p>You remember the two remedies for grief of which Pelayo speaks.

                           hath assigned/ Two sovereign remedies for human grief; -/ Religion, surest, firmest,
                           first and best,/ Strength to the weak and to the woundéd balm;/ And strenuous action
                           next’. Southey's son Herbert had died on 17 April.</span></div>
                  </div> I practise what I preach, &amp; have employed <span class="strikethrough">x</span> myself with a power of exertion at which I myself wonder; – taking care so to vary
                  my employments as not for any one to possess my mind too fully. – I take regular exercise,
                  – I take tonics – I eat, drink &amp; sleep. See if this be not doing well. I converse
                  as usual, – or nearly as usual, – &amp; can at times be chearful, – but my happiness can
                  never again be what it has been. Many blessings do I possess – but the prime blessing
                  – the flower of my hopes – the central jewel of the ring – is gone. – An early admiration
                  of what is good in the Stoical philosophy, &amp; an active &amp; elastic mind have doubtless
                  been great means of supporting me, – but they would have been insufficient without
                  a deeper principle – &amp; I verily believe that were <span class="strikethrough">no</span> it not for the consolations which religion afford – consolations which in time will
                  ripen into hope &amp; joy, – I should sink under an affliction, – which is greater than
                  any man can conceive. – You best can judge what the privation must be, – &amp; you can
                  but judge imperfectly.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Enough of this. I shall soon find a better mode of at once indulging &amp; regulating
               these feelings. Upon this subject I have thoughts in my head which will, by Gods blessing,
               produce good &amp; lasting fruit.</p>

               <p>At present one of my daily employments is the Carmen Nuptiale, – which is now nearly
