                           18 months of marriage, on 6 November 1817. Southey intended his ‘Funeral Song for
                           the Princess Charlotte’ to serve as the Poet Laureate’s New Year’s Ode for 1818, with
                           a selection of verses set to music by William Shield, the Master of the King’s Music
                           (though no performance of such an ode had taken place since 1810). Southey did not
                           publish his poem until 1828, when it appeared in Friendship’s Offering: A Literary
