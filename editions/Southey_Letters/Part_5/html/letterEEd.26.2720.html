                  </div> The history of the book is a very melancholy one. Poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> is a man with whom I have been intimately acquainted for twenty years, – during all
                  that time there has been a tendency to insanity about him, – of which for the last
                  ten years he has been fully conscious, – &amp; this translation was undertaken as an object
                  which by employing his mind might direct its diseased activity from self-contemplation.
                  It <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxx xxx time</span> was during the first decided attack of the disorder that I suggested it to him, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PembertonSophia">his wife</a> had sent for me, at his desire, he was sensible of his state, &amp; conversed upon it
                  with a degree of acuteness peculiar to himself. He desired me to recommend him some
                  author whom he might translate, &amp; I could recollect none but Alfieri.

                  is now in confinement, – one of the last things he said upon leaving his own house
                  was to express a hope that I should sometimes <span class="strikethrough">remember</span> {think of} him with respect. He said this in tears, – &amp; I cannot repeat it without
                  them. – God only knows whether he may ever be able to read what I have said of his
                  Alfieri. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">His father</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PembertonSophia">his wife</a> (one of the most admirable women I have ever known) will have a melancholy pleasure

                  my watch, he is tried for the theft, &amp; says <span class="ital">he found it</span>, – I send my watch by another to the watchmaker, – he sells it upon the way, &amp; says <span class="ital">he lost it</span>. The <span class="ital">losing</span> in one case is as obvious an excuse as the <span class="ital">finding</span> in the other. – Perhaps I am not altogether unprejudiced upon the subject. Tho I know
                  nothing of Tweddell personally I have lived much with <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> {his} friends, &amp; saw many of his letters to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LoshJames">Losh</a> as they arrived.
