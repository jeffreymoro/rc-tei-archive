                  </div> – It is the <span class="ital">shaft</span> that rankles, not the smart, – which is the object of the rankling. The simplest &amp;
                  surest criticism is to bring every expression thus to the test of reason, – ‘Many
                  a filial prayer she <span class="ital">traced</span>.’ – This word ought not to be used in this sense: <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> &amp; there is an ambiguity in these six lines: the impression which they convey is literally
                  that <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> a prayer had been rejected, – <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> &amp; in the succeeding couplet it rather surprized me to find the meaning to be that
                  letters had been supprest. These latter circumstances indeed cannot be very easily
                  related in verse – ‘Task’ &amp; ‘past’ are not allowable as rhymes. A monument of snow
                  would be modelled or moulded, not sculptured. ‘That the warm blood <span class="ital">forbid</span> to start’, – ‘forbidden’ is the proper word. – ‘By sickness &amp; <span class="ital">exaction</span> drained’; – better not interrupt the sense of natural distress by this word which
                  for a moment diverts attention to common roguery in the hardheartedness of vulgar
                  life. ‘Unbro<span class="ital">k</span>e by sight or sound’; ‘<span class="ital">unbroken</span>’</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The feeling which keeps Ellen from entering the Church is strikingly conceived, but
                  it is too violent a figure to <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxx</span> represent a gate speaking. – You describe the warm red beams of evening upon the painted
                  windows of the church <span class="ital">before</span> evening service which nowhere I believe begins at a later hour than three.

                  </div> is so well introduced <span class="strikethrough">that</span> &amp; so naturally, that any embarrassed or forced expression becomes particularly unpleasant,
                  &amp; what would be past over without notice in a less interesting passage, would be painfully
                  felt there. The awkwardness is in these words, – “&amp; bade to deck – his form.”</p>

            <p class="indent1">The long pilgrimage <span class="ital">lay</span> before her. – Unbro<span class="ital">k</span>e(n) by hamlet &amp;c.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The widow speaks of a bloom glowing on Ellens cheek, &amp; compares it to the glow of
               health &amp; youth. This is an oversight.</p>
            <p class="indent1">These remarks are not worth much in themselves; but it is of some consequence to remove
               any grammatical inaccuracies however slight, &amp; it is of far more to impress upon a
               writer the necessity of adhering as strictly to sound sense in verse as in prose.
               For however brilliant a poem may be in parts, &amp; however popular it may be because
               of that brilliance, if the poet either from a false system or from the want of system,
               writes nonsense, his works will inevitably be forgotten, or only remembered to his
               dispraise.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The <span class="ital">judgement</span> therefore must always be exercised in writing, – &amp; it is the last thing which a poet
               learns to exercise. The world may put up for awhile with something that looks like
               sense if it be flashy &amp; striking, – &amp; thus it is that every age has had its favourites,
               whose reputation passes away like that of <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> an actor or a beauty in high life when anyone with equal pretensions comes forward.</p>
            <p class="indent1">When you have revised the poem send it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a>, &amp; if you do not like that he should know your name &amp; address, say in a note that
               you send for his inspection the poem concerning which I had written to him, &amp; desire
               him to make known his determination concerning it to me. And then if he chuses to
               print it, I will refer him to you. Whether he will or no, or what the reception of
               the poem may be, if he should, I cannot pretend to augur. The last thirty years have
               produced a great change in these things. Even when I began to write there was a fair
               field, &amp; whoever appeared in it was sure to obtain notice. Now it is so crowded, that
               poems are entirely neglected which would then have been regarded with wonder &amp; applause.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Tell me what else you have written (for you must have written other things) – &amp; what
               you think of writing, if you have any thing planned. A happy subject may attract attention,
               – &amp; a word of advice respecting the plan may be worth fifty <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxxxx</span> after it is executed. – I wish you may be able also to tell me that your health is
               improved &amp; that with it your heart is recovering strength &amp; genial feelings.</p>
