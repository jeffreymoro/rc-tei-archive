                  the Weymouth (I think the ship was) He published two voyages – one to Guinea, Brazil
                  &amp; the W Indies, – which I have, &amp; a good book it is in its way, – but all he says
                  about Brazil in it is, that what he observed in that country was published in a separate
                  volume: – &amp; I have been looking for that volume the last ten years without success.
