                           ‘New Year’s Ode’ for 1816, The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four, Letter
                           2688. This was a duty of the Poet Laureate, but one which Southey suspected had become

               William Parsons to set to music and, if necessary, perform at Court as the monarch’s
               ‘New Year’s Ode’ for 1816, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</em>, Letter 2688. This was a duty of the Poet Laureate, but one which Southey suspected
               had become futile, as no Laureate odes had been performed at Court since 1810.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">2.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey also hoped that his ‘New Year’s Ode’ for 1816 might form part of the projected
               ‘Hymn of Victory’ with which he hoped to conclude <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> (1816). The published poem ultimately omitted the ‘Hymn of Victory’ and concluded

               when the engagement was broken off, but he was able to reuse most of it, not in <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage</em> but in his <em>Lay of the Laureate</em>. <em>Carmen Nuptiale</em> (1816), which celebrated Charlotte’s marriage to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld
