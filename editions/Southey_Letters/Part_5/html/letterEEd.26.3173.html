            <p class="indent1">There are many lodging houses in &amp; near this place, some of which in all likelihood
               will be vacant when you want them, tho at present they are all, or almost all occupied.
               Of late years it has become a fashion for Cambridge men to come in flocks to this
               country during the long vacation, to study for their degree, – &amp; the house which would
               best have accommodated you is filled by a covey of them. But when the time comes we
               will report what lodgings are then to be had, &amp; perhaps you will drive over &amp; look
               at them yourself.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The heat of the summer is abated, &amp; we are enjoying sun &amp; shower, with just such a
               temperature as makes exercise pleasant &amp; allows one to enjoy a little fire at night,
               – I am as true to the hearth as a cricket or a favourite spaniel, &amp; reckon it a privation
               when the weather is too hot for enjoying this indulgence.</p>
            <div class="closer">Believe me my dear Sir most respectfully &amp; truly yours 
               <div class="indent3">Robert Southey.</div>
