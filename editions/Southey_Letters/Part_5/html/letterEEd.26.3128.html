               on the road. This irregularity of the carriers is a great grievance, &amp; I heartily

               of letters.</p>

                  Today {Monday} we have warm rain, &amp; gleams of sunshine, &amp; the Birds are telling us
                  how they like the change. And now <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> that the country is likely to afford some enjoyment you had better come, &amp; bring with

                  </div>, so little are books in that unlucky language known beyond their own country. It

                           Principle of Population (1817) by John Bird Sumner (1780–1862; DNB) that was far less
