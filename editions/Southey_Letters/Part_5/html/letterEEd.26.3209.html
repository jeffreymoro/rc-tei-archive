               <p>I expect this night to finish a paper, – in the prosecution of which I have been interrupted
                  by the illness of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">one of my children</a>. The child is recovering, &amp; I have regained health &amp; spirits, – both which were suffering.
                  The paper will be dispatched by tomorrows post. It is upon the New Churches &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HaydonBenjamin">Haydons</a> Letter. The Catacombs I must strike off from the list in the heading, – &amp; send you <span class="strikethrough">forth</span> by themselves for the present number: for it is better to make two comparatively short
                  articles, than one long one, when there would have been no necessary connection between
                  the one half &amp; the other.
