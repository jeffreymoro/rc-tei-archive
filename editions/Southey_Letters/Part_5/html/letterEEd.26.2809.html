                  </div> – the most sensible of all our periodical publications, if books are to be estimated
                  by the useful matter which they contain. It is not heathen Greek to me, – tho as remote
                  as possible from all my own pursuits. Doubtless a number of curious results would
                  arise from due consideration of this laborious summary, I could find many questions
                  to propound therein. The net product per family in Bedford is given at 30 £, in Hereford
                  at 40 £ – the agricultural population in both counties because at an exact proportion.
                  I should have expected from the state of agriculture in the two counties to have found
                  the advantage on the side of Bedford at least <span class="strikethrough">or pa</span> as 4 : 3 – instead of the difference lying the other way. Is there any roguery in
                  the returns of the rental which may account for this?</p>
