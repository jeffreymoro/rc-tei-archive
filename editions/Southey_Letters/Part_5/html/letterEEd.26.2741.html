                  </div> that your first letter, sharing the fate of too many others, has remained unanswered.
                  What shall I say to it now? – You must be aware how difficult or how impossible, it
                  is when you communicate the state of your mind to communicate the circumstances which
                  have altogether produced the impression that disturbs you; – strong as their aggregate
                  evidence may appear to you, they would be deemed ‘light as air’ by others. I am myself
                  fully persuaded that your feelings &amp; imagination delude themselves; – &amp; that <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> such a combination as that with which your mind is haunted, cannot possibly exist,
                  &amp; could not possibly be so carried on.</p>

                  at the end, – but throughout the execution is original &amp; striking. I do not remember
                  ever to have seen the female heart so faithfully &amp; so delicately delineated; &amp; hence
                  the poem derives a marked character, &amp; a permanent value. – I expect much pleasure
                  from your smaller pieces which I will carefully peruse whenever they arrive.
