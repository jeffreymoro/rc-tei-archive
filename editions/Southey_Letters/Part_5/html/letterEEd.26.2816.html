            <p>MS: Trinity College, Cambridge, Dawson Turner Papers, Correspondence. The letter survives
               in an undated copy in an unknown hand, probably a member of the Turner family; it
               is endorsed ‘Original is among Autographs Series A’, and is placed after a copy of
               Mary Dawson Turner’s 1815 etching of Southey. TR; 2p.<br> Unpublished.</p>

               <p>Your letter of the third has reached me by this day’s post. I cannot but feel honored

                  </div> (&amp; none can tell what it is but those who have experienced it) know also that under
                  all afflictions there is but one source of consolation. The loss which, in its kind,
                  is common to all parents has been, in its degree, peculiarly severe, because the boy
                  was in every thing what my heart desired: so entirely so, that I had often gazed upon
                  him with the ominous feelings that he was fitter for a better world than this. In
                  that world we shall meet; &amp; as this dispensation contributes to fix my heart &amp; hopes
                  more fervently upon a future state, I feel &amp; acknowledge its use.</p>
