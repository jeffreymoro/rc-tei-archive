                  settled to my winters work, with the probability of as few interruptions from without,
                  as Bruin has when he rolls himself up in his cave, &amp; trusts to his paws till the spring.
                  You probably heard of my travels.

                  when the season also happened to be remarkably backward, – we changed our route, &amp;
                  visiting the Grande Chartreuse

                  </div> This deviation from our first purposed course I regard as very fortunate; for we saw
                  nothing finer than the Chartreuse, – indeed in its kind it cannot be surpassed; &amp;
                  the Mount Cenis road, of which it has not been the fashion to say anything, is much
                  more strange &amp; impressive than the Simplon. As you advance up the valley of the Maurienne,
                  the Alps are around are crumbling to pieces; the Arco which rushes down the valley
                  with a force &amp; fury beyond anything which I had ever before witnessed carries with
                  it nearly as much earth, or rather decomposed stone, as water; &amp; the towns &amp; villages
                  on the way are as ragged as the scenery about them. On the summit of M. Cenis, where
                  we breakfasted, I could have fancied myself in Cumberland had not richer flowers been
                  under my feet than our climate will produce. There is a tarn opposite the inn, with
                  all the features of our own mountain scenery. The first part of the descent is more
                  ruinous than any thing on the Savoy side. Indeed the mountains are in so crumbling
                  a state, that it has been found necessary to abandon the new line of road (only a
                  year or two since it was made at enormous expense), &amp; follow the old line, &amp; this
                  line leads you four times over the same waterfall, one turn <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> as closely under another as it can possibly be made. But when you get beyond this
                  desolation, where you have nothing but masses of loose earth &amp; perishing stone on
                  every side, the descent into Piedmont is beyond description delightful. We went no
                  farther than Milan; – from thence to the Lakes of Como &amp; Lugano, then across the Lago
                  Maggiore, &amp; back by the Simplon into Switzerland, turning aside on the way for three
                  days to visit the vale of Chamounix, &amp; the Mer de Glace.</p>

                  circumstance, &amp; we halted with him two nights on our way out, &amp; four on our return.
                  Having reached Bern we sent the carriage on to Zurich, &amp; struck into what is called
                  the Oberland, making our way as we could, sometimes by land – sometimes by water,
                  on horseback or on foot. Thus we spent the most adventurous ten days of our journey,
                  &amp; the most delightful. From Zurich our way was to Schaffhausen &amp; Donauschingen, where
                  the Danube rises: thence through the Black Forest to Friburg in the Brisgau. We crost
                  the Rhine to look at Strasburg, &amp; returned the same night into Germany; &amp; so by way
                  of Heidelberg, Manheim &amp; Frankfort to Mentz, – &amp; then down the left bank to Cologne,
                  &amp; so to Brussels, Lisle &amp; Calais. The whole journey was the work of thirteen weeks,
                  about three of which we were stationary at different places. I made a copious journal,
                  which was no slight exertion, &amp; my companions were very diligent in the use of the
                  pencil; – so that few persons could have brought back more.</p>

                  a manner would be an excellent recipe for one who had some to spare. Certain however
                  it is that the continual <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> exercise, change of air, &amp; excitement agreed admirably with me, to say nothing of
