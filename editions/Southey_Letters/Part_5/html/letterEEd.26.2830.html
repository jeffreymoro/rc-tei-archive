            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I was from home for a few days’ absence when your letter arrived. I have seen too
                  many instances of unjust prepossession to be surprised at them now. Much of my early
                  life was embittered by them when I was about your age; and in later years I have been
                  disinherited by two uncles in succession, for no other assignable or possible reason
                  than the caprice of weak minds and misgoverned tempers.

                           paternal uncles: John Southey (d. 1806) and Thomas Southey (d. 1811).</span></div>
                  </div> In this manner was I deprived of a good property, which the ordinary course of law
                  would have given me. These things never robbed me of a moment’s tranquillity, – never
                  in the slightest degree affected my feelings and spirits, nor ever mingled with my
                  dreams. There is little merit in regarding such things with such philosophy. I suffered
                  no loss, no diminution of any one enjoyment, and should have despised myself if anything
                  so merely external and extraneous could have disturbed me. It is not in the heel,
                  but in the heart, that I am vulnerable; and in the heart I have now been wounded:
                  how deeply.

                  you have formed. No man has ever written more faithfully from his heart; but my manners
                  have not the same habitual unreserve as my pen. A disgust at the professions of friendship
                  and feeling and sentiment in those who have neither the one nor the other, has, perhaps,
                  insensibly led me to an opposite extreme; and in wishing rather <span class="ital">esse quam videri</span>,

                  </div> My college years were the least beneficial and the least happy of my life; but this
                  was owing to public and private circumstances, utterly unlike those in which you will
                  be placed. The comfort of being domesticated with persons whom you love, you will
                  miss and feel the want of. In other respects, the change will bring with it its advantages.
                  To enter at college, is taking a degree in life, and graduating as a man. I am not
                  sure that there would be either schools or universities in a Utopia of my creation;
                  in the world as it is, both are so highly useful, that the man who has not been at
                  a public school and at college feels his deficiency as long as he lives. You renew
                  old acquaintances at college; you confirm early intimacies. Probably, also, you form
                  new friendships at an age when they are formed with more judgment, and are therefore
                  likely to endure. And one who has been baptized in the springs of Helicon,
