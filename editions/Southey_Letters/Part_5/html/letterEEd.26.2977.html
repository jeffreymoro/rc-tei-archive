                  your parents, in possessing them so long, – &amp; in losing them so easily, – both having
                  lived out their days &amp; then fallen asleep in a manner <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> {more} nearly resembling what the Greeks called ενδαυασια

                  coat, – not having intended to go beyond the garden &amp; orchard when I left the house.
                  The wind struck into my intestines, – &amp; from that time I have had just so much inflammation
                  of the bowels as to make me perfectly aware of the necessity of great attention to
                  a complaint which any moment might render very seriously alarming. Certainly I must
                  not venture upon a mail coaching of 42 hours till some days after it has been entirely
