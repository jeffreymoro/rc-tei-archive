               in acquiring trading bases in South America. They pressed hard for some suitable concessions
               during the negotiations of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which was signed shortly
               before the death of Queen Anne (1665–1714; Queen of Great Britain 1702–1714; <em>DNB</em>), and which brought Britain’s participation in the War of the Spanish Succession
               (1701–1714) to a close. One of the many plans at this time to gain a base in South
               America was put forward by the merchant Thomas Bowrey (d. 1713; <em>DNB</em>), who in 1711 suggested taking Valdivia in Chile and possibly also a port on the
               Atlantic coast. This may be the source of the garbled report Southey had read in his
               Portuguese sources. The incident is mentioned in Southey’s <em>History of Brazil</em>, 3 vols (London, 1810–1819), III, p. 131.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
