            <p class="indent1">Yesterday we entered Switzerland, &amp; reached this place after a weeks journey from
               Paris without let, hindrance accident, or inconvenience of any kind.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We left Paris at six o clock on the <span class="strikethrough">Tuesday</span> Wednesday, not having been able to see the Thulleries on Tuesday as we had proposed.

                  what is minutely related in my journal. <span class="strikethrough">Tuesday</span> {Wednesday} to Fontainbleau, <span class="strikethrough">Tuesday</span> Thursday to Joigny Friday to Rouering, Saturday to Dijon, Sunday to Besançon, Monday

                  our unclean wardrobe to the Blanchisseuses, are taking a days rest. The season is
                  unusually backward &amp; cold. On the way to Paris we found the country in great want
                  of rain, &amp; since we left Paris it has been equally in want of sunshine, yet our weather
                  has been so far favourable that we have lost nothing in consequence of the occasional
                  showers. Here there is not the appearance of a leaf upon the vines; in other respects
                  the country is in full beauty, the trees having their richest verdure. Tomorrow we
                  go to Yverdon &amp; see Pestalozzi.

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It is with the greatest difficulty that I find time to keep a journal. We rise at
               five, &amp; have travelled from ten to twelve hours every day, going about twenty miles
               before breakfast. Hunger would hardly permit us to do any thing in the way of writing
               before dinner, if there were not always something to see while dinner is preparing;
               – &amp; after dinner it requires an effort of heroic virtue to resist the pleasures of
               wine &amp; conversation, &amp; it becomes almost impossible upon taking the pen in hand to
               resist sleep. This morning we lay in bed till seven, that we might have the full enjoyment
               of a whole holyday. I remember at Westminster <span class="strikethrough">this was</span> the chief gratification which a whole holyday or a Sunday afforded, was that of lying
               abed till breakfast was ready at nine o clock.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Our windows are within a stones throw of the Lake, &amp; we see the Alps across it. The
               Lake is like a sea in its colour, its waves, &amp; its voice, – of which we are of course
               within hearing. The Alps of which we have the whole extent in view, cannot be less
               than fifty miles distant in the nearest point, directly across the Lake, &amp; Mont Blanc,
               which is at the extremity on the right, about fourscore. If our horizon at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> were wide enough I could sometimes show you the Alps in the clouds. They have precisely
               the appearance of white cumulated clouds at the verge of the sky, resting upon the
               earth, &amp; silvered with sunshine; &amp; from such clouds they are only to be distinguished
               by their definite outline &amp; permanent forms. It is idle to compare this country with
               our own, – or rather it would be worse than idle to form any comparison for the purpose
               of depreciating either. Part of our yesterdays journey was so like Cumberland, that
               I could have fancied myself within an hours walk of home; &amp; this forced upon me such
               a sense of time, distance &amp; separation, that the tears were more than once ready to
               break loose. The mountains through which we passed from Pontarlier to this place,
               rise behind the town, &amp; in that direction the view, as <span class="strikethrough">for xx</span> {to its} natural objects might be English. A huge harbour, or still better an arm
               of the sea, with such a sky as I have described will give you a full idea of the rest.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We hear dismal stories of famine &amp; distress, – but the scene continually recedes as
               we approach it, nor have we seen any indication of it whatever. From all that I can
               collect, the bad harvest of last year has acted here as it does in England &amp; must
               every where, it presses severely upon that class of persons who stood in need of economy
               before, &amp; who with economy had a little to spare for others. There are plenty of beggars
               throughout France, &amp; much squalid poverty, but the children of the peasantry are as
               hale, &amp; apparently as well fed, as far as all appearances of flesh &amp; blood may be
               trusted, as those in our own country. – What I have seen of France, – about 500 miles,
               from Calais to Pontarlier, is on the whole, less <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> interesting than an equal distance in G Britain would appear to a foreign traveller,
               I mean that he would meet with a country more generally beautiful, finer parts, &amp;
               better towns. But there have been very fine parts upon this journey, with a character
               &amp; beauty of their own. In Switzerland every step must be interesting, &amp; go in what
               direction you will, it is impossible to go wrong.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Nothing surprised me more in France than that there should be no middleaged women
               among the peasantry; they appear to pass at once from youth to hagged old age, &amp; it
               is no exaggeration to say that they look like so many living &amp; moving mummies. Fond
               as they are of finery in youth <span class="strikethrough">&amp; xxxxx xxx</span> for they are then tricked out in all the colours of the rainbow, in old age their
               dress is as wretched &amp; squalid as their appearance. I see nothing among them of the
               gaiety of which we have heard so much in former times. Not a single party have we
               seen dancing throughout the whole journey, – the weather indeed has been unusually
               cold, but certainly not such as would check the propensities of a light-heeled generation,
               if they <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> were as fond of a dance as their light hearted progenitors. I must say to their credit
               that we have uniformly met with civility, – not the slightest insult or incivility
               of any kind has been offered to us, &amp; if some extortion has been practised rather
               generally at the Hotels, it is no more than what is done every where, &amp; perhaps more
               in England than any where else.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But I must conclude. It is now three o clock &amp; I have been closely employed since
               breakfast in bringing up my journal &amp; in writing only this letter, – which however
               you must remember in any common handwriting would make two or three respectable epistles.
               My wolf is in great force &amp; devours every thing which is set before him. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a> performs tolerably well, &amp; as for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</a> he eats five eggs at breakfast.</p>
