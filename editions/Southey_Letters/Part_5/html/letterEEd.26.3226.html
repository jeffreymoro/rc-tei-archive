            <p>MS: Victoria University Library, Toronto, Coleridge Collection. ALS; 2p. (c).<br> Unpublished<br> Note on MS: only a fragment of the MS survives.<br> Dating note: Dating from content; references to Hartley Coleridge’s recent success
               at Oxford and to Derwent’s proposed translation of Dobrizhoffer suggest that the letter
               belongs to late December 1818. Derwent did not return to Greta Hall for the Christmas
               and New Year season and his mother, accompanied by her daughter and Edith May Southey,
               left for an extended visit to the Wordsworths on 31 December. This letter was probably
               written shortly before their departure.</p>
