                           On 27 November, the day following this letter, Southey drafted ‘Lines Written Upon

                  </div> – the only occasion perhaps in which a public mourning ever carried with it so real
                  a sense of sorrow. As soon as you left us, I finished the paper upon Lope de Vega,
                  of which <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> merely the beginning was written before.

                  should prevent) of doing something to it (however little,) every day, till it is compleated.
                  I have corrected four sheets, &amp; hope to keep the press going without intermission:
                  the better to effect this I rise as soon as it is light, &amp; transcribe before breakfast.

                  the matter, which you may be sure I have been going (even in fact at the time when
                  I would willingly have persuaded myself that it was {not} a matter of necessity to
                  undertake the task) a notion laid strong hold upon me, of producing something in distant

                  </div> An obvious objection to this is that I make use of an event which ought to be my subject,

                  by frequently recurring to it, &amp; bringing it again prominently forward at the end.
                  You will perhaps hardly comprehend my scheme unless I <span class="strikethrough">explain</span> {open} it a little more fully. There would be a mixture of verse as in Boethius, but
                  the <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> bulk of the composition in prose, &amp; in colloquy between Sir T More &amp; Meipsum:

                  perceive that no fitter personage could be introduced, he {having} taken pretty much
                  the same view of affairs in his age, as I do in mine. – The <span class="ital">tone</span> would of course be funereal, relieved by such imaginative parts as the introduction
                  of one from another world would produce. And the main object is to show that we are
                  rapidly approaching a <span class="ital">crisis</span> in society (if indeed we have not actually reached it,) as <span class="ital">critical</span> as that which the restoration of letters &amp; the discovery of printing brought with
                  them in the days of Sir Thomas More. The extent about as much as a long paper in the
                  review, – a little volume from 150 to 200 pages. These digressions are not very convenient
                  for one who has so many huge undertakings in hand, &amp; has to provide for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murraymagne</a> also – I hope you like his new title.</p>
