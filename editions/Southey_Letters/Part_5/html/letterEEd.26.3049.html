                  </div> – of course it is impossible that he should ever return there.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A very erroneous notion has got abroad that I who dwell at the foot of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a>, who associate more with the dead than <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> with the living, &amp; who have set my heart &amp; hopes upon the next world – not upon this,
               – am very much engaged in political affairs: &amp; possess in consequence some political
               influence. This draws upon me a great deal of abuse to which I am properly indifferent;
               tho it induces likewise occasional applications from which I would willingly be spared.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In writing to you upon this occasion I mean merely to <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> say that if this Consulship in Maranham, or any similar situation in Brazil at any
               future time, could be obtained for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterHenry">Henry Koster</a>, the interest of the British merchant, &amp; the honour of the British nation would be
               in safe, upright &amp; conscientious keeping. But I am perfectly aware that the claims
               upon you must be numerous, &amp; the applications with which you are troubled, ten times
               more so. And I am also aware that your parliamentary interest, when you might chuse
               to exert it, is probably by no means commensurate with the weight which your opinion
               carries to the public, – this being, I believe, far greater than that of any other
               individual.</p>

                  </div> with which you promised to favour me. It is not I think from any clinging prejudice
                  that I am unable to regard M<sup>r</sup> Pitt as a great statesman. His conduct of the war appears to me to have been miserable,
                  &amp; his domestic policy perilously erroneous in some momentous points – more especially
                  in the Catholic question. I do however full justice to his intrepidity, his talents,
                  &amp; his English feeling, – in which last &amp; most essential quality for a British minister <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">M<sup>r</sup> Fox</a> was lamentably wanting. – But I am better qualified to deliver an opinion upon Ignatius
