               the course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the woods, frequently
               entered the houses of the Kamtschdales; in many places have attacked and devoured
               the inhabitants; nay traces have even been found of their having killed and devoured
               each other; at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of hunger.
               In several settlements they have killed from two to three hundred bears, the oldest
               Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty.
               The cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past
               there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well
               known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters,
               they easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately
               felt in the Peninsula.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note22_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
