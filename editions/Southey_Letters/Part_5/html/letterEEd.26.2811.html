               were called and she was bled. But the publication of the poem was probably delayed
               because Longman did not want it to interfere with sales of <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> (1816).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Southey declared all the accounts, including Charlevoix’s, to ‘bear the grossest and
               most ridiculous marks of partiality. Several manuscripts respecting Nova Colonia are
