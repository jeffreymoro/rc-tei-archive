            <p class="indent1">We have had an Avalanche from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a>, of which so little has been heard that tho it is two months old I never went to
               see it till this day. An immense mass of snow came rolling down, &amp; a mass of wreck
               after it, sufficient to bury Applethwaite beck for two or three hundred yards, the
               stream is now making its way under this mass, – that is under an arch of snow, – the
               crust in many places has fallen in, &amp; the scene is a very singular one. The Avalanche
               was large enough to have buried a village had there been one there [remainder of MS
               missing]</p>
