                           sent to James Ridgway (1755–1838) and Henry Symonds (1741–1816), radical booksellers,
                           for publication; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12 January 1795], The Collected
                           Letters of Robert Southey. Part One, Letter 123, recounting Southey’s subsequent visit

                           Wat Tyler and it remained in manuscript until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass

                  </div> My own opinion is, that if I do not act now the men who have published the work will
                  compel me to do so at last, by inserting my name in such a manner as to render the
                  measure unavoidable. Indeed it was inserted as a paragraph in the Chronicle, which
                  I suppose they paid for as an advertisement.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Therefore I think it best to take the short and open course, believing that in most
                  cases such courses are the best. However, I have sent <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry’s</a> letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a>, and, if his arguments convince him, have desired him to let you know. This was done
                  yesterday, and if you have not heard from him before this reaches you, it may be concluded
                  that he thinks it best to proceed. I suppose there can be no doubt of obtaining the
                  injunction. The statement is perfectly accurate; I know not whether it be of any use
                  to let you know that at the time the transaction took place I was under age. I was
                  just twenty when the poem was written, and saw these booksellers about four months
                  afterwards.</p>

               <p>I fully assent to what you say concerning political discussions, and intermeddle with

                  </div> It is not for any men, or set of men, that I am interested; nor for any particular

                  traced the ground of my apprehensions in Espriella, in the Edinburgh Register, and
                  in the Quarterly, more especially in a paper upon the Poor about four years ago.

                           3 vols (London, 1807), III, p. 133; Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809, 2.1 (1811),

                  </div> It is now come to this question, – Can we educate the people in moral and religious
                  habits, and better the condition of the poor, so as to secure ourselves from a mob-revolution;
                  or has this duty been neglected so long, that the punishment will overtake us before
                  this only remediable means can take effect? The papers which I shall write upon the
                  real evils of society will, I hope, work for posterity, and not be wholly forgotten
                  by it; they proceed from a sense of duty, and that duty discharged, I shall gladly
                  retire into other ages, and give all my studies to the past and all my hopes to the
                  future.

                  showered upon me, fell off like hail from a pent-house. That spring is dried up; I
                  cannot now preserve an appearance of serenity at all times without an effort, and

               or borrowing from Methodism so much of it as is good, and thereby regenerating the
               Establishment. There is little hope in such schemes, except that in process of time
               they may produce some effect. But were it effected now, and would the Church accept
               the volunteer services of lay coadjutors, I should feel strongly inclined to volunteer
               mine. This is a dream, and I fear the whole fabric will fall to pieces even in our
