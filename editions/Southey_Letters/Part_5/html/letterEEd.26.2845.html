            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Never, I entreat you, think it necessary to apologise for, or to explain any long
                  interval of correspondence on your part, lest it should seem to require a like formality
                  on mine, and make that be regarded in the irksome character of a debt, which is only
                  valuable in proportion as it is voluntary. We have both of us business always to stand
                  in our excuse, nor can any excuses ever be needed between you and me. I thank you
                  for your letter and your inquiries. Time is passing on, and it does its healing work
                  slowly, but will do it effectually at last. As much as I was sensible of the happiness
                  which I possessed, so much must I unavoidably feel the change which the privation
                  of that happiness produces. My hopes and prospects in life are all altered, and my
                  spirits never again can be what they have been.

                  and perfectly resigned), thankful for what has been, and happy in the sure and certain
                  hope of what will be, when this scene of probation shall be over.</p>

               <p>I shall be glad to receive your communications upon the distresses of the manufacturers;
                  they might probably have been of great use had they reached me when the last Quarterly
                  was in the press. But I may, perhaps, still turn them to some account. There is another
                  paper of mine upon the poor in the sixteenth number of the Quarterly,

                  </div> written when the Luddites, after their greatest outrages, seemed for a time to be
                  quiet. In that paper I had recommended, as one means of employing hands that were
                  out of work, the fitness of forming good footpaths along the road side, wherever the
                  nature of the soil was not such as to render it unnecessary. This was (foolish enough)
                  cut out by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">the editor</a>; but when the great object is to discover means of employing willing industry, the
                  hint might be of some service wherever it is applicable. In the way of palliating
                  an evil of which the roots lie deeper than has yet, perhaps, been stated, your efforts
                  should be directed towards finding employment, and making the small wages that can
                  be afforded go as far as possible; the reports of the Bettering Society show what
                  may be done by saving the poor from the exactions of petty shopkeepers;

                  </div> Believe me, that person who should instruct the poor how to prepare cheap food in
                  the most savoury manner would confer upon them a benefit of the greatest importance,
                  both to their comfort, health, and habits; for comforts produce good habits, unless
                  there be a strong predisposition to evil. I have much yet to say upon this subject,
                  which may perhaps furnish matter for a third paper in the Review. Sooner or later
