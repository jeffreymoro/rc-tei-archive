                           by Murray in 1817, having been prepared for the press by the meteorologist John Martin

                           Ocean, with an Original Grammar and Vocabulary of their Language (1817). Southey reviewed
                           the book in Quarterly Review, 17 (April 1817), 1–39.</span></div>
                  </div> I saw it in Manuscript, – &amp; only wish Mariner had written it himself. It is absurd

                  – for the first time since they were a people, – in imitation of their neighbour.
                  – I suspect also the poem Vol 1. p. 307.
