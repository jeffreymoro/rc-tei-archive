            <p class="indent1">Your letter travelled by the wagon, &amp; did not reach me till Wednesday last; – I answer
               it by the first post, – the will &amp; the desire to be instrumental in bringing about
               so great an object are not wanting, – but <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> you will not suspect me of any affectation of diffidence when I express a distrust
               of my competence for the task. I have arrived at that time of life &amp; that state of
               mind in which men learn to know their own weakness &amp; their own ignorance, if they
               are ever capable of attaining to that knowledge. In matters of art I am entirely ignorant.
               For altho I never should be pleased with a bad picture, &amp; can <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> {feel} (I believe) <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxx xx xxxx xx xxxxxxxxx xxxx xxx xxxxx</span> the full merits of certain pictures, – as far as relates to their conception &amp; affect,
               other works which are acknowledged to be of the highest excellence, have <span class="strikethrough">none</span> little or none to me, – a decisive proof that I have not the faculty required for
               appreciating them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This however is in my power. I can take your pamphlett for my text, – repeat its arguments
                  &amp; enforce them as well as I am able, &amp; then cast the bread upon the waters. Furnish
                  me therefore with the needful facts, &amp; no time shall be lost.

                  of this glorious country in art, as well as in arms, &amp; in general happiness as well
                  as in arts, if we can but preserve it from that bestial mob-rule which <span class="strikethrough">will</span> would involve every thing in one common destruction. I see the danger distinctly,
                  &amp; while I <span class="strikethrough">have life</span> {live} will stand up manfully against it. But I have hitherto had little reason to
                  distrust my own foresight in political affairs, reasoning from the past to the future,
                  – &amp; the more I regard the aspects of these times, the worse they appear. And yet were
                  there but one vigorous mind at the helm all might be well, – one man who had full
                  confidence in himself, &amp; therefore could claim &amp; command the confidence of the great,
                  well-meaning majority of the people. Alas all revolutions have been brought about
                  by a few knaves acting upon a multitude of fools, – while honest men have lain quiet,
                  till they became the victims.</p>
