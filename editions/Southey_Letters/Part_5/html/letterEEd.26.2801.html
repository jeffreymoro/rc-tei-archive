               <p>I thank you for your letter. You may remember that in my youth I had a good deal of
                  such practical philosophy as may be learnt from Epictetus;

                  he &amp; I have long been familiar. The loss of five brothers &amp; sisters (four of whom

            <p class="indent1">I was a great traveller last year, – from Waterloo my journey extended to Namur, Huy,
               Liege, Spa &amp; Aix-la Chapelle. From thence we turned back by way of Maestrecht, Tongres,
               Tirlemont, &amp; Louvain to Brussels: thence to Antwerp, Ghent, Courtray, Menin, Ypres,
               Bergues, Dunkirk &amp; Calais, – a six weeks journey, travelling leisurely. At Aix la
               Chapelle we were delayed five days by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughters</a> illness, – the scarlet fever, happily the attack was subdued, – but I have never
               past a more anxious time, &amp; the people of the Hotel were the most unfeeling wretches
               I ever met with in the course of my life.</p>
