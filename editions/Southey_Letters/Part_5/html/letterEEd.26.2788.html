                  it back by yesterdays post. It contains the first 15 stanzas of the dream. So that
                  all to which you or <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> object up to that point is irrevocable, – &amp; to let you into a secret had the case

               <p>If egotism in poetry be a sin God forgive all great poets! But perhaps it is allowable

                  that such passages be not made public {statute} till the {critical} limitation expires.

                  one person who can understand the strain &amp; enjoy it. Those persons indeed may who
                  live wholly in the present, – but I have taken especial care to make it known that
                  a faith in hereafter is as necessary for the intellectual as the moral character,
                  &amp; that to the man of letters (as well as the Xtian) the <span class="ital">present</span> forms but the slightest portion of existence. – He who would leave any durable monument
                  behind him must live in the past, &amp; look to the future. The poets of old scrupled
                  not to say this, – &amp; who is there that is not delighted with these passages whenever
