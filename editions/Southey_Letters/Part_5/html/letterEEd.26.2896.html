                  </div> The mixture of novel &amp; history is always unpleasant to a man who delights in historical
                  truth; – but it is absurd to quarrel with a book for being what it pretends to be,
                  – &amp; I have found some matters of fact in this which will appear to great advantage
                  in their proper place. For this history indeed I have not only one of the finest subjects
                  that has ever existed for historical narrative, but also the amplest materials, &amp;
                  access to the best authorities.
