               of Orange (1792–1849; King of the Netherlands 1840–1849). He had to abandon the poem
               when the engagement was broken off, but he was able to reuse most of it, not in <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage</em> but in his <em>Lay of the Laureate</em>. <em>Carmen Nuptiale</em> (1816), which celebrated Charlotte’s marriage to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld
               (1790–1865; King of the Belgians 1831–1865) on 2 May 1816.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
