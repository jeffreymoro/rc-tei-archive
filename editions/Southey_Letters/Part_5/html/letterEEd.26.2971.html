               <p>In the course of this business I have very often had occasion to remember the apologue
                  of the old man his son &amp; the ass: – for by listening to every body, I am likely to
                  please nobody, &amp; myself least of all.

                           up carrying the ass on his back. Southey was being offered advice about his A Letter

My anger has spent itself, &amp; I care not the turn of a straw. If on the other
               hand you wish it to appear, I will in the proof expunge certain passages that offend
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</a> sensitiveness, &amp; I will smooth down others so as to lessen their asperity but leave
               the whole edge, &amp; I will insert a passage about public expenditure from these papers
               which you have sent me. But I must tell you that with this letter I close the business
               on my part. Whatever reply may be attempted to it, I shall say nothing more. I will
               waste no more time upon an affair which did not from the beginning deserve from me

                  in a heyday of prosperity: – the evil may be indefinitely delayed, but sooner or later
