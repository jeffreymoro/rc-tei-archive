               those on relief aged 3–14 and the introduction of a loans system for those who had

               in 1815. Essentially, Britain wished for a weak Spanish government that could not
               challenge British influence in Portugal or the Mediterranean or prevent Britain dominating
               trade with the Latin American countries in revolt against Spain. Russia took the opposite
               view, hoping a stronger Spanish government would obstruct Britain in southern Europe
               and ensure that trade with Latin America was open to all powers equally. At this time
               there were widespread newspaper reports that Russia would aid Spain in regaining its
               Latin American colonies. These may have been stimulated by rumours concerning a secret
               agreement between Russia and Spain of 11 August 1817, under which Russia agreed to
               sell eight warships to Spain.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
