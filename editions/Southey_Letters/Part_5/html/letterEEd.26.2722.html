                           poem proved longer and harder to write than he had anticipated. It was not finished
                           until late March 1816 and was published in May 1816.</span></div>
                  </div> – such a snails pace have I travelled. With as boyish a heart as ever, I begin to
                  have a grey head, &amp; many symptoms that the noonday of life is gone by. In the year
                  1798 I once wrote 1200 lines in a week, Gualberto made part of them, the greater number
                  of the rest were in Madoc.

                           Review, 13 (July 1815), 448–526 (511): ‘“Bless thy eyes!” said a soldier in Spain,
                           when Lord Wellington passed by him for the first time after he had returned from Cadiz
                           to the army. “Bless thy eyes! I had rather see thee come back, than see ten thousand
                           men come to help us.” The bowdlerised anecdote came, fittingly, from Thomas Bowdler
                           (1754–1825; DNB), A Short View of the Life and Character of the Late Lieut.-General

                           30 August 1808, allowed a defeated French army free passage out of the country with

                           by the French regime in Spain in December 1808, but was reinstated by Ferdinand VII
                           (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833) on 21 July 1814 as part of his plan to

                           drew up the liberal Constitution of 1812, which Ferdinand abolished in May 1814. The
                           King’s reactionary policies produced a number of minor revolts in 1814–1815. The Constitution’s
                           supporters were known as ‘Liberales’.</span></div>

                           for a statue of the Virgin Mary. The report had produced widespread ridicule in Britain,
                           e.g. The Literary Panorama and National Register, n.s. 2 (1815), 89–90.</span></div>

                  is a matter which I can judge with entire impartiality; – for certainly had I been
                  born a Spaniard, &amp; bred under such a Government &amp; such a Church, – the first wish

                           he opposed) supported them. However, he now backed the same patriots’ cause against
                           Ferdinand VII. Indeed, Brougham had spoken in the Commons on 15 February 1816, calling
                           on the British government to do more to defend the Spanish liberals from Ferdinand

               had anticipated. It was not finished until late March 1816 and was published in May
               1816.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">3.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey had included the following anecdote in his article ‘Life of Wellington’, <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 13 (July 1815), 448–526 (511): ‘“Bless thy eyes!” said a soldier in Spain, when
               Lord Wellington passed by him for the first time after he had returned from Cadiz
               to the army. “Bless thy eyes! I had rather see thee come back, than see ten thousand
               men come to help us.” The bowdlerised anecdote came, fittingly, from Thomas Bowdler
               (1754–1825; <em>DNB</em>), <em>A Short View of the Life and Character of the Late Lieut.-General Villettes</em> (Bath, 1815), p. 120.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of Dalrymple when, arriving in Portugal as commanding officer, he had, at the Convention
               of Cintra, signed 30 August 1808, allowed a defeated French army free passage out
               of the country with its weapons and supplies intact.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               had a notorious reputation in Protestant Europe and among Enlightenment thinkers.
               Southey was a determined opponent of its activities. The Inquisition was abolished
               by the French regime in Spain in December 1808, but was reinstated by Ferdinand VII
               (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833) on 21 July 1814 as part of his plan to
               restore absolutism in Spain.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">9.. </span><span class="noteBody">While Ferdinand VII was under arrest in France, those areas of Spain that were not
               under French control acknowledged the authority of the Cortes elected in 1810. It
               drew up the liberal Constitution of 1812, which Ferdinand abolished in May 1814. The
               King’s reactionary policies produced a number of minor revolts in 1814–1815. The Constitution’s
               supporters were known as ‘Liberales’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in Spain, had claimed that the King passed his time embroidering a silk gown and petticoat
               for a statue of the Virgin Mary. The report had produced widespread ridicule in Britain,
               e.g. <em>The Literary Panorama and National Register</em>, n.s. 2 (1815), 89–90.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">11.. </span><span class="noteBody">In Southey’s eyes Brougham was an opportunist. Brougham had belittled the patriots
               who fought against the French invasion of Spain, because the British government (which
               he opposed) supported them. However, he now backed the same patriots’ cause against
               Ferdinand VII. Indeed, Brougham had spoken in the Commons on 15 February 1816, calling
               on the British government to do more to defend the Spanish liberals from Ferdinand
               VII.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Division, although his reputation was tainted by accusations that he ordered the torture
               of prisoners when Governor of Trinidad, 1797–1803. Southey celebrated him in <em>The Poet’s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</em> (1816), Part One, Book 3, stanzas 29–30.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
