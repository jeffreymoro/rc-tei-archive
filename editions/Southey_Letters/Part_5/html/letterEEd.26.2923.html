                           at 35 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, had delivered a letter to Southey in c. 1797–1798
                           which had been misdirected to him. He had gone bankrupt in 1809 and had written to
                           Southey asking for money. It is possible that he was from Somerset and a very distant
                           relative of Southey’s.</span></div>
