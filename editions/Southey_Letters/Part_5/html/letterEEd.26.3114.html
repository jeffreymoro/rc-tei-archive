               <p>What I would do about <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HaydonBenjamin">Haydons</a> pamphlett requires no knowledge of the Art, &amp; will have the better effect as manifestly
                  coming from one who is no artist, &amp; therefore above all suspicion of interested motives.
                  I want only to enforce the call for public patronage, – that is to say national &amp;
                  government-patronage, without which the highest branch of the art can only be pursued
                  in this <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> country, by men so careless of every thing but their art, that they go headlong to
                  ruin &amp; misery with their eyes open. I want to get pictures into our churches &amp; public
                  buildings, – &amp; to press this upon those <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> in whose power it is (&amp; who I verily believe do not want the inclination) by eulogizing
                  them for what they have done, – for what they are doing, – &amp; for what they will do.
                  Not to complain of neglect; – not to reproach the age, or any person or set of person,
                  – but to put them in good humour with themselves by that sort of deserved panegyric
                  {of} which every man will take his share, &amp; so to <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> win their good will to the proposals – or rather hints, which <span class="strikethrough">will be</span> {are} administered in such a form. Half a dozen pages will do this, – something like
                  a triumphal oration upon the glories of this our Country in this our ages, – &amp; saying
                  that <span class="ital">this</span> is the only thing wanting to make us the first people in every thing.

               an edition of some of the manuscripts in the library at Stowe. O’Conor was the chaplain
               of Mary, Marchioness of Buckinghamshire (d. 1812). Her husband, George Nugent-Temple-Grenville,
               1st Marquess of Buckingham (1753–1813; <em>DNB</em>), provided financial support for the project. The catalogue was <em>Bibliotheca MS. Stowensis. A Descriptive Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Stowe Library</em> (1818–1819). Southey is being a little disingenuous here – he had not met O’Conor
               or Buckingham, but Buckingham’s nephew, Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, was one of his
               best friends and he had promised Wynn he would try and promote O’Conor’s edition.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
