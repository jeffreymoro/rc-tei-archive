                  it produces the evil under which we are now suffering, – when every nation manufactures
                  for itself all that it is capable of manufacturing no danger of this kind will exist.
                  But it is obvious that as we improve in machinery – (observe – I fully admit that

                  improvement which facilitates the production of goods lessens the employment for workmen.
                  Over such things Government can have no controul, – but (as at Lanark) the condition
                  of the workmen may be bettered, &amp; when men are contented, they are good subjects.
