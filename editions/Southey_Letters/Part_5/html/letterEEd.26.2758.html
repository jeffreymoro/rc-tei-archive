               <p>If you have seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> of late, you will anticipate the intelligence which a black seal announces. It has
                  pleased God to visit me with the severest of all afflictions, by removing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">my son</a>, – my only son, – who was the very flower and crown of all my happiness; for never
                  was man blest with a child more entirely after his own heart’s desire.

            <p class="indent1">I am very thankful for having had him during ten years. During those years he has
               been the joy of my life; and my deepest pleasure hereafter will be in the sure and
               certain hope that this separation is only for a time. I feel, also, that the removal
               is for his good; that he was perfectly fit for a better scene of existence: he had
               learnt all of good that this world could teach him, – all kind affections, all good
               feelings, all generous hopes; and he is gone before the world has sullied his pure
               spirits, without a spot or stain, never having known a thought of evil, never having
               felt a single affliction. His life has been past in love, and he has fallen asleep
               to wake in immortality.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In this frame of mind, you will believe that I am as composed and as resigned as becomes
               a man and a Christian; but I am fully aware that in this place I shall never be able
               to overcome the recollections which must everywhere haunt me. My morning walks, my
               summer excursions on the lake, &amp;c. &amp;c., – all are associated with him, who was my
               constant companion. I will therefore, if it be possible, remove from Cumberland. My
               lease expires in twelve months from this time. I wish to be near London, and, if it
               may be, near you. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> will talk to you about this.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has supported herself through this long and severe trial with exemplary fortitude.
               I trust God will support her now. For myself, it is a relief to know that the worst
               is over. For full five weeks I have never known an hour’s peace of mind, perpetually
               dreading this; and even when I gave way to the hopes with which others flattered me,
               it was hoping against belief. His whole demeanour was, like his whole life, almost
               beyond belief for calmness, collectedness, and obedience.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Pray for us, my dear friend, that we may be supported in our affliction. My heart
               is strong, and I can answer for controlling all outward excess of grief; but I pray
               that my health may not fail me. I have many ties to life, and am duly mindful of them
               at this hour.</p>
            <div class="closer">God bless you. Yours most affectionately, 
               <div class="indent2">ROBERT SOUTHEY.</div>
