               <p>On Monday I shall see you, – a pleasure to which I have looked on during my whole
                  journey as the highest which it was to afford me. I received your letter by Cornaghi,

               <p>I have two companions, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">the one an artist a deformed man</a>, with a kind heart, &amp; a gifted hand. The other the only Cumberland Gentleman whom
                  I have found with a love of things which deserve to be loved .. – he met with you
                  many years ago, tho you may probably have forgotten him. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</a> is his name. We have come over M Cenis, &amp; are returning by the Simplon. We arrived
                  at Milan this morning, &amp; my first business was to enquire for you. I long to see you.
                  My heart has been well nigh broken, – but it is not changed. I have come abroad to
                  try what change of scene, &amp; new images of external nature might do for me, &amp; expect
                  to find permanent benefit when I shall have returned, which will be as speedily as
                  possible.
