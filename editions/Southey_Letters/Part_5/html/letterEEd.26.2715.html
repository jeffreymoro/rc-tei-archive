                  are twenty stanzas of it written, such as will put good readers in good humour with
                  me, &amp; with what is to follow. Tomorrow you shall a second portion of equal bulk, containing
                  ‘Brussels’ &amp; as much of ‘The Field of Battle’ as the number will hold. It is not yet
                  compleated for it grows under my hands – the section which I thought to have comprized
                  in one part will fill two. – The second I began this morning; it will be well if I
                  can make this second part stand in place of an ode. In these latter cantos you will
                  see that I take a higher tone.

                           intended to be the conclusion to the poem, entitled ‘The Return’. The first book of

                           Field of Battle’. The sections Southey was writing grew into Part Two of the poem,
                           consisting of ‘The Tower’, ‘The Evil Prophet’, ‘The Sacred Mountain’ and ‘The Hopes

                           pp. 62–63. Southey was able to use a sketch by Nash and so did not have to resort

                           his exhibition of panoramas at his purpose-built hall in Leicester Square, London.
                           Barker drew the scenes for his Waterloo panorama at the battlefield and visitors to

                  page I grant, – but not so as to be remarkable, – the numbering the stanzas occupying
                  the place of two lines to each, thus making the complement in the printers form 16
