                  at different times, &amp; in different places written upon the state of affairs at home,

               entering fully into each of these questions, – &amp; putting those parties who maintain
               these propositions into my threshing machine.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I then show what the real evils of society are, – the <span class="ital">kind</span> of Poverty which exists – the state of the manufacturers, – condition of women in

               <p>But I require reform in this point, – that such seats as are bought &amp; sold be bought

                  a fund for public works, either national or local.
