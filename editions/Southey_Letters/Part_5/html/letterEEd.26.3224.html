                  last upon such a subject. The want of zeal in the Clergy has been one of the many
                  causes which has produced the present deplorable state of morals among the peasantry
                  &amp; the populace. You may have perceived that I have often adverted to this, &amp; if I

                  is no wonder than no attention was paid to those which really had some weight. – They
                  were abominably used, – but they seem to have entirely forgotten the use which they
                  themselves made of power when they possessed it. Baxter lays much of their sufferings
                  to Clarendons account.
