               coat of arms was indeed ‘guardant’ and Southey here correctly describes the meaning
               of this term in heraldry. Lions could be depicted as guardant in a number of postures,
               including (but not exclusively) ‘rampant guardant’ which means standing erect, with
               one forepaw raised; lions ‘passant guardant’ i.e. depicted walking, with one forepaw
               raised, are usually known as leopards in heraldry, as in the arms of England. ‘Guerdant’
               is not a word in heraldry (or English). In Southey’s <em>Poetical Works</em>, 10 vols (London, 1837–1838), X, pp. [1]–132, the error was silently corrected and
               ‘guardant’ reappeared.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
