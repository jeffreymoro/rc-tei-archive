               manufacturer in Paisley, had on 28 May 1812, given evidence to the House of Commons
               committee enquiring into the Orders in Council system, which enforced a trade blockade
               on territories controlled by France. The Whig opposition were campaigning for its
               repeal, on the grounds that it harmed British manufacturing. Brougham denounced M’Kerrell
               (though not by name) in the House of Commons on 16 June 1812, claiming he had told
               the committee that textile workers were overpaid and ‘oatmeal and water were good
               enough for Englishmen.’ M’Kerrell denied he had said this and published an acrimonious
               exchange of letters between himself and Brougham in <em>The Times</em> of 20 July 1812. Southey had been collecting material that could be used against
               Brougham in his election campaign in Westmorland.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               collection of Spanish texts. Bedford had reported that a manuscript on the Abipone
               tribe of South America was not an original work but a translation into Spanish of
               a book he already owned – an account of the Jesuit missions in Paraguay by Martin
