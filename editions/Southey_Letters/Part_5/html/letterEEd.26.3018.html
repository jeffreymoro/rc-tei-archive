               boy to make a shot with it, and desired another of his schoolfellows to hold his book
               before his face that he might shoot at him (their common mode of play.) The boy lowered
               the book at the moment that the arrow was on the way, and it entered the corner of
               his eye. A cataract was coming on in this eye,– this produced inflammation and ended
               in the loss of the eye. And for this the parents have been wicked enough to prosecute
               Martin criminally! The cause had been discussed in two courts, and by the last accounts
