               <p>I have not read <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> your epistle without pleasure, – nor the latter part of it without a deeper feeling.
                  Your brother was indeed one of my earliest &amp; dearest friends,

                  </div> I admired him &amp; esteemed him &amp; loved him, &amp; there were few persons for whom he had
                  a warmer affection than for me. These feelings never abated as long as we were within
                  reach of each other. Our intercourse at Oxford was frequent &amp; uninterrupted, &amp; I well
                  remember how earnestly &amp; sincerely he gave me advice when he thought I stood in need
                  of it. – The recollections of youth become dearer to us as we advance in life, – later
                  friendships seem almost to differ in kind as well as in degree from those of our younger
                  days, – I have experienced as many misfortunes &amp; wrongs as fall to the lot of most
                  men, but I regret nothing but the friends of my youth. Five &amp; twenty years (for so
                  long you may remember me) have changed me in many things, but my heart remains the
                  same.</p>
