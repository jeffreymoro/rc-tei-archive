But the birds of passage have all taken their departure now, premature winter has <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> set in, &amp; – with little heart to stir from it, or set foot beyond my own threshold,
                  – for there is an end of my morning walks. My spirits carry a fair outside, &amp; are
                  indeed as well as they will ever be; nor do I, nor ought I to complain of them. Not
                  an hour passes in which I do not feel the change – scarcely a circumstance occurs
                  that does not bring it home to my heart; but the result is a composure of mind – a
                  livelier faith – &amp; an habitual aspiration after that state of existing in which our
                  enjoyments shall be permanent.</p>

               <p>Part of that paper upon the lower classes which you are pleased to commend came from

                  – &amp; I am inclined to think that something of the kind would be the best means of preventing
                  her overthrow. Very easily might she have methodists of her own, – all of them would
                  else be enlisted against her. But I think seriously of girding up my loins for an
                  arduous undertaking. – That of writing upon the present state of things, – fully,
                  unreservedly &amp; with my whole heart:

                  </div> – What I have done in the Quarterly has been by piece meal, &amp; has generally suffered
                  something by repression on my part, &amp; much afterwards by the Editors mu{ti}lations.
                  But knowing as I do what has been in the world, – &amp; seeing, as I believe, farther
                  before me than most of my contemporaries, it may be in my power to produce such an
                  Estimate of the wants, as might possibly avert great dangers, &amp; lead to great benefit,
                  – &amp; if I have the power, the sin of omission would in this case be a heavy one. And
                  this month or six weeks will clear off immediate business &amp; provide for my ways and
                  means, – mean while these thoughts will ferment &amp; ripen. All here desire their loves.</p>
