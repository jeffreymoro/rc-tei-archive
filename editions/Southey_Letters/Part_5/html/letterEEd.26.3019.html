            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have no right to abuse you for not writing “by waggon” upon the direction of the
               box of books, because I myself was guilty of the same omission at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a>: the waggon goes from the same inn as the coach, &amp; the people there according to
               the usual roguery in their vocation have sent both by the most expensive mode of conveyance
               – so I have paid 1£ <span class="strikethrough">000</span> for the box from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a> &amp; £1–7- for that which you dispatched.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On my return I found some letters of compliment, some of abuse, &amp; one which is entitled
                  to a distinguished place among my curiosities. It is from a gentleman signing himself
                  N. T. P. who describes himself as being in the middle class of society, &amp; wanting
                  nothing – except a wife: Being in suit of one with the expectation of all other parties
                  &amp; in good hope of winning the Lady a Rival had stept in with a copy of verses, &amp; by
                  this means, the Lady ‘being passionately fond of the Muses” – outstript him in her
                  affections. He therefore thinking that if he could produce better verses he should
                  sans doubt win the prize, intreats that I will favour him with an acrostick upon the
                  word Rebecca, &amp; if I should be unable to include in seven lines all the ideas which
                  he has suggested – Rankin may be added – the place of her abode, (as he chuses to
                  say, thinking thus stupidly to disguise her name).

                  which were to be addressed to him at Rochford Essex. I have written him word that
                  his twenty shillings has been expended on giving four poor old women a flannel petticoat
                  each, – &amp; instead of the acrostick have given him a rap over the knuckles in prose.</p>
