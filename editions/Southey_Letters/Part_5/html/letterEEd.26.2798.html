                  </div> – but the sorrow is now different in kind as well as in degree, the death of an infant
                  seems repaired by the birth of another, &amp; you lose in it more of hope than of actual
                  enjoyment, – yet God knows even then the heart is wounded in its tenderest part. But
                  in our present case, the loss is irreparable. Were there the probability of our having
                  another son I am not sure that I should desire it; – so infinitely unlikely is it
                  that he should resemble <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> in those moral &amp; intellectual endowments which rendered him all that my heart desired.
                  No father was ever blest with a child more entirely such as he would have prayed for;
                  – &amp; therefore it was that I always apprehended the calamity which has befallen me:
                  I could not help feeling that when a creature of this kind came into the world, it
                  was not likely that he should be suffered to remain in it; he lived in it long enough
                  to know all that was good, – &amp; nothing but {what} was good, – &amp; he is removed before
                  a thought of evil has ever <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> risen in his heart, or a breath of impurity ever tainted his ears.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">For ourselves, I hope we bear the visitation with true submission to the unerring
               wisdom which has appointed it. <span class="strikethrough">In the course of</span> I have lost so many near &amp; dear friends that my thoughts have been long &amp; habitually
               directed toward the next world, as a point of hope, – as the place where we are to
               meet again, &amp; where we shall be separated no more. Meantime – tho the very head &amp;
               flower of all my earthly hopes &amp; happiness is cut off, – I have abundant blessings
               left: – for each &amp; all of these I am truly thankful, – but of all the blessings which
               God has given me this child who is removed, is the one which I <span class="ital">still</span> prize the most, – most thankful I am that I should have been favoured with such a
               son, &amp; most happy in the certain assurance that this privation is only for a time.
               But for this faith it is scarcely possible that we should have supported the blow.
               – The illness was of six or eight weeks continuance, there was hope till the last,
               – though from the first in my own mind fear predominated. It was found after death
               to be an accumulation of matter in the pericardium. – Part of my prayers were granted,
               – long as the decline was, &amp; total as the decay it was attended with the least possible
               suffering, – &amp; at the end he fell asleep. – One word more &amp; I will have done with
               this painful subject – his whole behaviour was in this as in all his life – beautiful.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I thank you my dear Sir, for your very friendly letter. – My tears even now are not
               without some portion of delight – such is the power of religion -</p>
