               <p>I hope, &amp; conclude from the temper of your letter, that your beauty is all that has
                  suffered any serious injury in these providential escapes. – A few lines I write in
                  haste, – because this is an opportunity of conveying them. It was desirable to include
                  in the book the matter of certain former articles: &amp; as it is proper to state this
                  in a prefatory advertisement that acknowledgement may cover as much or as little as
                  is convenient. So the present article goes first into the Review, &amp; then great part
                  of it is transferred to the book; – the first part with little alteration; the latter
                  with omissions, &amp; additions, &amp; in a different arrangement.
