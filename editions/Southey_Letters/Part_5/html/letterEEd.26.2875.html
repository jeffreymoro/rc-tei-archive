                           and Other Poems (1812), followed by The City of the Plague (1816), set during the
                           Great Plague of London in 1665.</span></div>
                  </div> is a man of such sensitive feelings that he suffers no poultry to be kept about his
                  house, because he could not bear to eat creatures which should have fed in his sight,
                  – &amp; he is – the greatest cockfighter in the country. He is a man of great genius who
                  delights in blackguard company, &amp; has more than once in his fits of drunken insanity
                  very nearly come to an untimely end. Withall he has some good qualities of which I
                  believe generosity is the best. I disapprove his mode of life so much that I have
                  shunned his society. And partly for this reason, partly because I did not chuse to
                  review his Isle of Palms in compliance with a request which, very improperly, was
                  made to me, with his knowledge he I believe bears me a respectful sort of dislike.</p>

               <p>With a great deal of genius his former volume is one continued string of plagiarisms
                  of the worst kind, – chiefly from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, whom he is constantly caricaturing by the most injudicious imitation. The great
                  fault of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> is regarding all things too much in one strain of mind, &amp; regarding the great &amp; the
                  little with equal force of passion, &amp; equal effort of thought. And this fault is carried
                  to a tenfold degree by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonJohn">Wilson</a> in that volume which alone I have seen; – with little or no strength of thought to
                  support him. His friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DeQuinceyThomas">De Quincey</a> tells me the plagiarism is quite as great in this. But my dear Wynn is there not something
                  monstrous in taking such a subject as the Plague in a great city – Surely it is out-Germanizing
                  the Germans. It is <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> bringing racks wheels &amp; red hot pincers upon the stage to excite pathos. No doubt
                  but a very pathetic tragedy might be written upon “the Chamber of the Amputation”

               impolicy. The immediate cause of that distress which was felt in the beginning of
               the year was an enormous diminution of national expenditure – the War, a customer
               of 50 millions, being taken out of the market; &amp; consequently a great number of hands
               put out of employ. Now surely <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxx Irish way to remedy the</span> to spend less, &amp; to turn off more hands, – is but an Irish way of remedying this.</p>
