               <p>We have usually a good many water-fowl offered for sale at this time of the year,
                  but this winter we have had none, from which I conclude that the season has been as
                  mild abroad as it is at home, and that the web-footed family, who direct their movements
                  by the temperature, and not by the almanac, are waiting till the winter begins. I
                  should very much enjoy this mild open weather if I had not some apprehensions for
                  what is to come. Vegetation is fearfully premature in this country. The children

                  been in full bloom for some time. It looks ill to see things thus out of time. If
                  the seasons continue out of order we may dread the failure of another harvest, and,
                  in the present state of men’s minds, such an evil is indeed to be dreaded. But for
                  one’s own personal feelings never was such a month of January. I was on Walla Crag
                  a fortnight ago, and a day in September could not have been warmer. And for <span class="ital">effects</span>, never have I witnessed finer than what have been almost daily displayed, from vast
                  masses of soft swelling cloud, hovering about the whole range of mountains from Borrowdale
                  to Grisdale, and the sun – who shouts to the god of painters as well as poets – moving
                  among them, and producing all imaginable glories. A few days back there was the most
                  striking effect I ever remember to have seen. The depth of Newlands was filled with
                  an exceedingly dark cloud, in form like a truncated pyramid, and the sun appearing
                  just upon the summit, shot its rays down on all sides, literally like streams of light.</p>

                  a sudden and enormous diminution of expenditure, – Government spending from forty

                  evil they are advised to diminish the expenditure still further! Nor does any person

                  be disbanded must either want employ himself, or deprive some other person of it:

                  harm. But if there were no other objection to removing them, the triumph which it
                  would give these vagabonds, in whatever manner the thing were done, is a very weighty
                  one. I well remember when the Talents

               of the Treasury. However, the law required him to give up the lucrative sinecure of
               Auditor of the Receipt of the Exchequer (a post he had held since 1794), as this role
               could not be held at the same time as the First Lordship. Grenville’s solution was
               an Act of Parliament to allow him to hold both offices together. This was felt to
               be particularly reprehensible because it placed Grenville in the position of auditing
               his own Department’s accounts. The Auditorship was merely part of the Grenville family’s
               group of sinecures, though. One of Grenville’s brothers, George Grenville, 1st Marquess
               of Buckingham (1753–1813; <em>DNB</em>) was Teller of the Exchequer (worth £23,000 in 1808 alone); while his other brother,
               Thomas Grenville (1755–1846; <em>DNB</em>), was Chief Justice of Eyre, south of the Trent (worth £2,316 per annum).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
