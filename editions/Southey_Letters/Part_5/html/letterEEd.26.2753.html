                  to be any other hope than that as we do not know what the complaint is, it may possibly
                  be one which is not necessarily fatal. Today <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">he</a> has been wholly confined to his bed for the first time, &amp; with an evident diminution
                  of strength, – on the other hand the frequent sweats which came over him during the
                  two last days have greatly diminished in frequency &amp; in violence, – he has been more
                  easily kept warm, &amp; has past good part of the day in sleep, – whether from mere exhaustion
                  or not I hardly dare ask myself. But it is useless to write more, – you cannot advise
                  at this distance, – nor is any advice needful, nothing is to be done but to support
                  life as long as we can. The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora</a> is with him night &amp; day, &amp; is of the utmost use – I know not what we should do without
