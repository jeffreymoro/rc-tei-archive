               the candidates favoured by Wordsworth’s patron, the Earl of Lonsdale, was reported
               to have attacked Southey and Wordsworth from the hustings. Southey decided to retaliate
               by publishing a pamphlet attacking Brougham and revealing his political opportunism.
               But he had second thoughts and only parts of the ‘Tender Epistle’ were published,
               minus Brougham’s name, in the second edition of <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> (London, 1821), pp. 45–53.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
