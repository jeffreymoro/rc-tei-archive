                  </div> From these &amp; another clergyman he was promised 20 £ a year, his relations promising
                  30 £ more, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TateJames">Tate</a> (the schoolmaster, a good &amp; able man) gave him <span class="strikethrough">his</span> the run of his school; – more he could not do for the valid reason that he has a wife
                  &amp; ten children; – so his boarding &amp;c were to be provided for. The plan was that when
                  qualified here he was to go as a Sizar to S<sup>t</sup> Johns.

                  </div> And this plan has been defeated by an inability on the part of his relations to fulfill
                  their engagement, owing to unforeseen circumstances – connected I suppose with the

                  </div> Accordingly he writes one, – &amp; introduces himself by letter to me, requesting leave
                  to dedicate it to my Worship – if upon perusal I think it worthy &amp; so forth. – Of
                  course I represented to him the folly of such a scheme, – but the poem is brimfull
                  of power &amp; of promise, – I have written to his master &amp; received the highest possible
                  character of him, both as to disposition &amp; conduct, – &amp; now I want to secure for him
                  that trifling assistance which may put him in the right path &amp; give him at least a
                  fair chance of rendering the talents with which God has endowed him, useful to himself
                  &amp; beneficial to others.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Of the 30 £ which are wanting for this purpose, I will give 10. And it is not for
               want of will that I do not supply the whole. Perhaps if you were to mention the circumstances

               next, &amp; by that time will be qualified for S<sup>t</sup> Johns.</p>
