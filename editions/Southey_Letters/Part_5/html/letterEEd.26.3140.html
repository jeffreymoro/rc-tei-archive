               <p>This day – &amp; not till this day – did I receive your manuscript &amp; the very interesting
                  letter by which it was introduced.

                  </div> You will have expected to hear from me ere this, &amp; I think I know how you will have
                  thought &amp; felt as a suspicion has arisen of something even less pardonable than the
                  brutal sort of repulse which you have done me the justice not to anticipate. – Parcels
                  lie for me at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Mess<sup>rs</sup> Longmans</a> till they have occasion to send to me; – they then travel by waggon, which owing to
                  the change of carriers is a business of eighteen days or sometimes three weeks. Your
                  packet has been fortunate in not having been longer in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#PaternosterRow">Paternoster Row</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I reply to your letter without the delay of a single post, – &amp; with sincere pleasure,
               –</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>for tho’ what I have to say may in some degree discourage <span class="strikethrough">hope</span> hope, in all other respects it will correspond entirely to your wishes. – The success
                  of a poem, indeed of any <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> composition whatsoever, does not depend upon its merit, – or less upon its merit than
                  upon any other cause. Of the volumes of poetry which are published not one in twenty,
                  – perhaps I might say in <span class="ital">fifty</span>, – pays the expense of publication, – tho there is not one of the whole number which
                  would not have excited attention &amp; secured <span class="strikethrough">or</span> a remuneration to the author had it been published thirty years ago. No persons therefore
                  should risque the publication of a poem on their own account unless the sacrifice
                  of the money so expended were a matter of indifference. For the same reason booksellers
                  will not purchase poetry, – unless from some writer who is in vogue. But I must not
                  leave you here, without trying what can be done. The “Caroline Bowles, to whose very
                  name &amp; existence I was a stranger” this morning, cannot now be to me an “insignificant”
                  person, – one <span class="strikethrough">of</span> whom I shall soon forget, – or by whom I would <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> willingly {be} forgotten.

            <p class="indent1">Booksellers are not the most liberal, nor the most amiable of men. They are necessarily
               <span class="ital">tradesmen</span>, – &amp; a constant attention to profit &amp; loss is neither wholesome for the heart nor
               the understanding. Of those with whom I have any dealings <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> is the one who would be least unlikely to risque the publication of your poem, &amp;
               the most likely to make the publication answer. He would perhaps take the risque upon
               himself, &amp; give you half the eventual profits. Shall I write to him upon the subject?
               <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> Poor as these terms may appear, they are the best that I have ever obtained {for}
               myself. – My recommendation ought to have some weight with him.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I do not like such poems, because I am old enough to avoid all unnecessary pain. Real
               griefs do not lessen the susceptibility for fictitious ones, but they take away all
               desire for them. There is a great deal of beauty in it, – <span class="strikethrough">a female fluency</span> a womanly fluency, a womanly sweetness, a womanly truth &amp; tenderness of feeling,
               which I have enough of my mother in me perfectly to understand. It is provoking to
               think that if the same powers had been displayed in prose instead of verse, in a novel
               instead of a poem, there would have been little or no doubt of finding a publisher,
               – for let the supply of novels be what it will, the demand is sure to outrun it.</p>

                  </div> I wish I were near enough now to see &amp; converse with you. It is in planning a work
                  that advice is useful; – a single remark may then induce an author to avoid a fault,
                  which <span class="strikethrough">would xxxx</span> cannot afterwards be got rid of by any laborious correction. I do not mean to say
                  that this poem has any such faults: – a few verbal alterations are all I should suggest
                  here, &amp; a few omissions where they can be made without injury, chiefly for the sake
                  of shortening it, because I foresee that its length will be a bookseller’s objection.
                  – But to the point; – if you think proper I will write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> &amp; ask him whether he will publish it, – this <span class="strikethrough">you must</span> {I would wish you to} consider as extremely doubtful, – but if the application fails,
                  it will not be for any want of warmth &amp; sincerity in the recommendation. And if it
                  should fail you must not be discouraged, but turn your thoughts to something else,
                  in prose or verse, – in which if I can assist you by any advice, or direct you<span class="strikethrough">xx</span> to any subjects which carry with them some attraction, I shall be very happy to <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx you</span> {show} that you have not honoured with your confidence one who is unfeeling &amp; therefore
                  unworthy of it. – for the present farewell, &amp; believe me</p>
