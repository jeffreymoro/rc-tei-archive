               <p>Upon mature deliberation I am clearly of opinion that it would be very imprudent &amp;
                  impolitic for me to receive any thing in the nature of emolument from Government at
                  this time, in any shape whatsoever. Such a circumstance would lessen the worth of
                  my services, – I mean it would render them less serviceable, – for whatever might
                  come from me would be received with suspicion, which no means would be spared to excite.
                  As it concerns myself personally this ought to be of some weight; but it is entitled
                  infinitely to greater consideration if you reflect how <span class="strikethrough">lar</span> greatly my influence <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> (whatever it may be) over a good part of the public would be diminished if I were
                  looked upon as a salaried writer.

                  </div> I must therefore in the most explicit &amp; determined manner decline all offers of this
                  kind, – but at the same time I repeat my offer to exert myself in any way that may
                  be thought best. The whole fabric of social order in this country is in great danger;
                  – the Revolution should it be effected will not be less bloody nor less ferocious
                  than it was in France; – it <span class="ital">will</span> be effected unless vigorous means be <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> taken to arrest its progress; – <span class="strikethrough">&amp; every m</span> &amp; I have the strongest motive both of duty &amp; <span class="strikethrough">self</span> prudence – say even self-preservation, – for standing forward to oppose it.

                  say) an effectual punishment.</p>

               advantage from them. – Do not argue that I suffer them to injure me if I refuse what
               might be offered me for fear of their censures. It is not their censures, – it is
               the loss of <span class="strikethrough">that</span> ostensible <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxx xx xxxxx</span> independence, however really independent I should be. At present, in defiance of
