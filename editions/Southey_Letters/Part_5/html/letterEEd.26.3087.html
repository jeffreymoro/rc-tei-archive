               forthcoming general election in Westmorland, where Brougham was standing against the

               manufacturer in Paisley, had on 28 May 1812, given evidence to the House of Commons
               committee enquiring into the Orders in Council system, which enforced a trade blockade
               on territories controlled by France. The Whig opposition were campaigning for its
               repeal, on the grounds that it harmed British manufacturing. Brougham denounced M’Kerrell
               (though not by name) in the House of Commons on 16 June 1812, claiming he had told
               the committee that textile workers were overpaid and ‘oatmeal and water were good
               enough for Englishmen.’ M’Kerrell denied he had said this and published an acrimonious
               exchange of letters between himself and Brougham in <em>The Times</em> of 20 July 1812.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               the course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the woods, frequently
               entered the houses of the Kamtschdales; in many places have attacked and devoured
               the inhabitants; nay traces have even been found of their having killed and devoured
               each other; at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of hunger.
               In several settlements they have killed from two to three hundred bears, the oldest
               Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty.
               The cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past
               there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well
               known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters,
               they easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately
