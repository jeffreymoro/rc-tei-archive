                  that this sorrow produces in both our cases that beneficial purpose for which such
                  visitations are appointed; &amp; in <span class="strikethrough">subtr</span> subtracting so large a portion of our earthly happiness fixes our hearts &amp; hopes with
                  more earnestness on the life to come. Nothing else, I am well assured, could have
                  supported me, tho I have no ordinary share of fortitude. But I knew where to look
                  for consolation, &amp; am finding it where only it can be found. – See my dear Cottle
                  the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> {instability} of human enjoyments! – You have read the Proem to my Pilgrimage, – &amp;
                  before the book was published the child of whom I had there spoken with such heart-felt
