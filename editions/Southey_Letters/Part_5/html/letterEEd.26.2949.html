                           anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817. Southey used the term ‘Uncle Wat’ for the
                           play because of his Tyler family connections – he had three uncles with the surname

                           so as to gain an injunction suppressing the publication of Wat Tyler, on the grounds
                           that it breached his copyright. The case was heard on 18–19 March 1817 and Southey’s
                           application for an injunction was rejected on the grounds that copyright in Wat Tyler
                           was disputed and would have to be determined in a common law court.</span></div>

                           there could be no copyright in the work because of its ‘libellous tendency’. Southey
                           suggests that if the Court accepted this view, then the publishers could be prosecuted
                           for seditious libel, on the authority of Sir William Garrow (1760–1840; DNB), Attorney-General

               in 1817. Southey used the term ‘Uncle Wat’ for the play because of his Tyler family

               hoped to publish in the <em>Courier</em>: Southey to William Smith, 17 March 1817 (Letter 2943) and Southey to the Editor
               of the <em>Courier</em> [19 March 1817] (Letter 2946). These two letters were sent to Charles Watkin Williams

               were, in Southey’s view, abusing the liberty of the press and thus provoking the possibility
               of revolution. He compared them to the journalists and revolutionaries Jacques Hébert
               (1757–1794), Jean-Paul Marat (1743–1793) and the radical politician Pierre Gaspard
               Chaumette (1763–1794). All three had met violent ends. Southey’s article did not mention
