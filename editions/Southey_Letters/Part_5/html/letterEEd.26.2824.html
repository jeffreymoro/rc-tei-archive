                  reach of you; but I would rather that chance should bring you to Cumberland, when

                  </div> You will find a bed, plain fare, and a glad welcome; books for wet weather, a boat
                  for sunny evenings; the loveliest parts of this lovely county within reach and within
                  sight; and myself one of the best guides to all the recesses of the vales and mountains.
                  As a geologist, you will enjoy one more pleasure than I do, who am ignorant of every
                  branch of science. Mineralogy and botany are the only branches which I wish that I
                  had possessed, not from any predilection for either, but because opportunities have
                  fallen in my way for making observations (had I been master of the requisite knowledge)
                  by which others might have been interested and guided. These two are sciences which
                  add to our out-door enjoyments, and have no injurious effects. Chemical and physical
                  studies seem, on the contrary, to draw on very prejudicial consequences. Their utility
                  is not to be doubted; but it appears as if man could not devote himself to these pursuits
                  without blunting his finer faculties.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This county is very imperfectly visited by many of its numerous guests. They take
                  the regular route, stop at the regular stations, ascend one of the mountains, and
                  then fancy they have seen the Lakes, in which, after a thirteen years’ residence,
                  I am every year discovering new scenes of beauty. Here I shall probably pass the remainder
                  of my days. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#CrosthwaiteChurch">Our church</a>, as you may perhaps recollect, stands at a distance from the town, unconnected with
                  any other buildings, and so as to form a striking and beautiful feature in the vale.
                  The churchyard is as open to the eye and to the breath of heaven as if it were a Druid’s
                  place of meeting. There I shall take up my last abode, and it is some satisfaction
                  to think so – to feel as if I were at anchor, and should shift my berth no more.

                  </div> A man whose habitual frame of mind leads him to look forward, is not the worse for
                  treading the churchyard path, with a belief that along that very path his hearse is
                  one day to convey him.</p>

               <p>Your comments upon the Castle of Indolence express the feeling of every true poet;

                  </div> I agree with you, also, as respecting the Minstrel, beautiful and delightful as it
                  is. It still wants that imaginative charm which Thomson has caught from Spenser, but
                  which no poet has ever so entirely possessed as Spenser himself.

                  </div> Among the many plans of my ambitious boyhood, the favourite one was that of completing
                  the Faery Queen.

                           a young writer and on the works he produced as Poet Laureate. As a youth, Southey
                           had planned a six–book continuation but abandoned the idea after writing three cantos,
                           which he destroyed; see Southey to William Taylor, 12 March 1799, The Collected Letters
                           of Robert Southey. Part Two, Letter 387.</span></div>
                  </div> For this purpose I had collected every hint and indication of what Spenser meant to
                  introduce in the progress of his poem, and had planned the remaining legends in a
                  manner which, as far as I can remember after a lapse of four or five-and-twenty years,
                  was not without some merit. What I have done as a poet falls far short of what I had
                  hoped to do; but in boyhood and in youth I dreamt of poetry alone; and I suppose it
                  is the course of nature, that the ardour which this pursuit requires should diminish
                  as we advance in life. In youth we delight in strong emotions, to be agitated and
                  inflamed with hope, and to weep at tragedy. In maturer life we have no tears to spare;
                  it is more delightful to have our judgment exercised than our feelings.</p>
