               10 June 1818. It was already clear, though, that there would be a contest in Westmorland,
               which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were supporters of the government –
               the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790–1867), MP for Westmorland
               1812–1867 and William, Viscount Lowther (1787–1872), later 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and
               MP for Cockermouth 1808–1813, MP for Westmorland 1813–1831 and 1832–1841. However,
               in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller landowners had brought forward Henry
               Brougham to challenge the Lowthers – Brougham’s family home was Brougham Hall near
               Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as a local candidate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Rumours of his extra-marital affairs were commonplace in the Lake District, but the
               real cause of his financial difficulties were increasing costs and declining profits
               in his collieries. His liabilities at his death exceeded £100,000.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in Kendal on 11 February, ‘much bespattered’ by missiles hurled by a drunken mob.

               much pleasure Mr. Southey’s classical and biographic sketch of Robert Lovell; a sketch
               equally honourable to the gentleman by whom it is drawn, as it is creditable to the
               gentleman who is the subject of it. So far as can at present be observed of Robert
               Lovell’s progress in the printing-office, Mr. Southey’s interesting trait is not overdrawn;
               and if the young man perseveres in the variety of trying scenes ever attendant upon
               a parliamentary business late and early, chiefly early hours, some cramfull to overflowing,

               of coming up to Mr. Southey’s and Mr. Rickman’s kind and solicitous wishes.’ For Lovell’s
               reluctance to take the job, see Southey to John Rickman, 14 March 1818, Letter 3091.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
