               not to exact more than the system will endure. I have certainly gained strength, –
               but as you may suppose every circumstance of spring &amp; reviving nature brings with
               it thoughts that touch me in my heart of hearts. Do not however imagine that I am
               unhappy – I know what I have lost, &amp; that no loss could possibly have been greater,
               – but it is only for a time, – &amp; you know what my habitual &amp; rooted feelings are upon

                           was still fresh because of the further royalist resistance in the area to the restoration

                  </div> He will act wisely if he does so, – for the freshness of the subject will else evaporate.
                  I shall finish it with all speed upon this supposition. It would surprize you were

                  mournful it must ever be to remember the proem; &amp; the delight which it gave when the
