                  the hands of various carriers. Such works as this would be of signal use if they could
                  be introduced into Catholic countries, where the Priests as well as the people are
                  miserably ignorant of the real nature of Christianity &amp; where no medium is to be found
                  between blank hopeless unbelief, &amp; the most grovelling superstition. Most of the Priests
                  I think would discourage its circulation, – it is not a little curious that those
                  among them who are Atheists retain as hearty a hatred of the reformed religion as
                  if they had imbibed all the prejudices &amp; passions of Douay or S<sup>t</sup> Omers,

                  they would regard as its sins of omission. However there are no authorities in Spanish
                  America which would interfere with it; it would have the better chance of being read
                  because books are not common in those countries, – &amp; as He who made the human soul
                  has not deserted it, we may rest assured that truths like these will sometimes, even
