               in the City of London and central to the world-wide trade in gold bullion and government
               bonds. Southey may have been put in touch with Rothschild by John Charles Herries,
               the former Commissary-in-Chief, who worked closely with Rothschild to ensure the transfer
               of funds to pay British troops during the Peninsular War. Rothschild’s key role in
               the financial aspect of the British war effort no doubt made Southey well-disposed
               towards him; and Rothschild’s network of agents, shippers and couriers made him ideally-placed
               to expedite the books Southey had bought in Brussels in 1817 through British customs.
               Southey had also bought some books for John May.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               10 June 1818. It was already clear, though, that there would be a contest in Westmorland,
               which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were supporters of the government –
               the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790–1867), MP for Westmorland
               1812–1867 and William, Viscount Lowther (1787–1872), later 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and
               MP for Cockermouth 1808–1813, MP for Westmorland 1813–1831 and 1832–1841. So complete
               was the Lowthers’ dominance that the last contested election in Westmorland was in
               1774. However, in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller landowners had brought
               forward Henry Brougham to challenge the Lowthers – Brougham’s family home was Brougham
               Hall near Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as a local candidate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
