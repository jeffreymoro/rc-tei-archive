                           gifts of money from radical sympathisers, which allowed them to avoid forced labour

               events Southey had condemned in his ‘To the Exiled Patriots ‘ (1794). Their time in
               Australia was easier than that of most deportees as they had received substantial
               gifts of money from radical sympathisers, which allowed them to avoid forced labour
               and buy plots of land. Southey may have had this experience in mind in formulating
               his policy.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
