               <p>You made the best use of your misfortune at Kendal. The most completely comfortless
                  hours in a man’s life (abstracted from all real calamity) are those which he spends
                  alone at an inn, waiting for a chance in a stage-coach. Time thus spent is so thoroughly
                  disagreeable that the act of getting into the coach, and resigning yourself to be
                  jumbled for four-and-twenty or eight- and-forty hours, like a mass of inert matter,
                  becomes a positive pleasure. I always prepare myself for such occasions with some
                  closely-printed pocket volume, of pregnant matter, for which I should not be likely
                  to afford leisure at other times. Erasmus’ Colloquies

                  long as I could say <span class="ital">omnia mea mecum</span>;

                  </div> that is, as long as I could carry with me an undivided heart and mind, and had nothing
                  to make me wish myself in any other place than where I was. The journey from London
                  to Bristol at the holidays was one of the pleasures which I looked for at breaking
                  up; and I used generally to travel by day rather than by night, that I might lose
                  none of the expected enjoyments I wish I had kept a journal of all those journeys;
                  for some of the company into which I have fallen might have furnished matter worthy
                  of preservation. Once I travelled with the keeper of a crimping-house

                  profession while I was supposed to be asleep in the corner. Once I formed an acquaintance
                  with a young deaf and dumb man, and learnt to converse with him. Once I fell in with
                  a man of a race now nearly extinct, – a village mathematician; a self-taught, iron-headed
                  man, who, if he had been lucky enough to have been well educated and entered at Trinity
                  Hall, might have been first wrangler,

                  </div> This man was pleased with me, and (perhaps because I was flattered by perceiving it)
                  I have a distinct recollection of his remarkable countenance after an interval of
                  nearly thirty years. He laboured very hard to give me a love of his own favourite
                  pursuit; and it is my own fault that I cannot now take the altitude of a church tower
                  by the help of a cocked hat, as he taught me, or would have taught, if I could have

                  into effect the fixed purpose of so doing; first by the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">General’s</a> dropping in to pass the last evening with me before his departure, then by letters
                  which required reply without delay. And this afternoon, just before the bell rang
