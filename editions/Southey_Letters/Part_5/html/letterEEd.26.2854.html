            <p>I have been surprised to see how well the peasants in the Morea could manage a putrid
               fever. Some glasses of generous wine, pomegranates &amp; limes are the things usually
               given to the patient, the beloved lancet being kept at a distance very cautiously.
               By these means I have known a patient recover very speedily. I have often seen intermittent
               fevers subdued entirely by a mixture of coffee &amp; lemon juice, which is the general
               remedy for them all over the country. The proportions are three quarters of an ounce
               of coffee ground very fine, two ounces of lemon juice, &amp; three of water; the mixture
               to be drunk warm &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> fasting.</p>

            <p>A fever attacked the French prisoners at Constantinople. Among those who recovered
               a singular aberration of mind &amp; stuttering came on between twenty &amp; thirty days after
               they were attacked, which did not wholly leave them again for a very long time; some
               of them totally lost their recollection, &amp; seemed to have no idea of the past events

            <p>Speaking of the coal pits in the north, M. Simond says “it is remarked that the men
               employed under ground enjoy better health than those on the surface, the regularity
               of temperature securing them against many disorders, &amp; the air constantly renewed
