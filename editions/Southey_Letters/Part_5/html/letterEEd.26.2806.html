                  from tyranny at school, till I outgrew it, and came to have authority myself. In one
                  respect, my fortune seems to have been better than yours, or my nature more accommodating.
                  Where intellectual sympathy was not to be found, it was sufficient for me if moral
                  sympathy existed. A kind heart and a gentle disposition won my friendship more readily
                  than brighter talents, where these were wanting . . . .</p>

               <p>I left Westminster in a perilous state, – a heart full of feeling and poetry, a head
                  full of Rousseau and Werter, and my religious principles shaken by Gibbon:

                  </div> many circumstances tended to give me a wrong bias, none to lead me right, except adversity,
                  the wholesomest of all discipline. An instinctive modesty, rather than any purer cause,
                  preserved me for a time from all vice. A severe system of stoical morality then came
                  to its aid. I made Epictetus, for many months, literally my manual.

                  </div> The French revolution was then in its full career. I went to Oxford in January, 1793,
                  a Stoic and a Republican. I had no acquaintance at the college, which was in a flagitious
                  state of morals. I refused to wear powder, when every other man in the university
                  wore it, because I thought the custom foolish and filthy; and I refused even to drink
                  more wine than suited my inclination and my principles. Before I had been a week in
                  the college, a little party had got round me, glad to form a sober society, of which
                  I was the centre. Here I became intimate with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</a>, whose death was the first of those privations which have, in great measure, weaned
                  my heart from the world. He confirmed in me all that was good. Time and reflection,
                  the blessings and the sorrows of life, and I hope I may add, with unfeigned humility,
                  the grace of God, have done the rest. Large draughts have been administered to me
                  from both urns. No man has suffered keener sorrows, no man has been more profusely
                  blest. Four months ago no human being could possibly be happier than I was, or richer
                  in all that a wise heart could desire. The difference now is, that what was then my
                  chief treasure is now laid up in Heaven.</p>

                  was made so delightful.
