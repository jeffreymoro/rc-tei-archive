                  one point, – in thinking that France had not suffered sufficient punishment, &amp; that
                  for the security of Europe her territory ought to have been lessened. Were I to judge
                  of the Prussian only by those whom I know, my opinion of them would be highly favourable;
                  but their general conduct throughout Belgium has been the worst possible. There is
                  but one character of them, – every one complains of their rapacity &amp; their insufferable
                  insolence, – qualities in which they were said to have equalled the French, &amp; never
                  to have palliated them, like the French, by their manners, – no monkey-moods, but
                  always the tyger. I was grieved to <span class="strikethrough">lear</span> hear this, – but so it is; &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> wherever the military spirit predominates as strongly as it does in Prussia, the result

                  where to command respect, attention &amp; kindness. We made two visits to the field of
                  battle; – the second was for the purpose of obtaining some views of the more important

               ground that for that reason I was glad to see it. otherwise it is very uninteresting,
               – the only fine object being the great square at Ypres; – that indeed, tho partaking
               of the dilapidated appearance of the city is exceedingly fine; – indeed there is nothing
               finer in the Low Countries. Of all the cities which I ever saw Bruges pleased me most,
               – &amp; I found great beauty in the proper Flemish landscape, – such as it about Bruges
               &amp; in the Pays de Wals between Antwerp &amp; Ghent. The only grand scenery {thro} which
               we past was upon the Meuse from Namur to Liege, – <span class="strikethrough">I</span> you probably know this line of country, – which excels any river scenery that I had
               ever seen before. I saw enough in the neighbourhood of Huy to convince me that this
               country is as fine in its detail, &amp; recesses, as in its general effect. With Spa I
               was disappointed, the armies who bivouacked about it in 1813 cut down the wood, &amp;
               have thus given a naked appearance to the country.</p>
