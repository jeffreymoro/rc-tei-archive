                  to <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> be sensible of the change in the business of the day, – in my relaxations, my pleasures,
                  hopes, plans &amp; prospects; – very long I fear will it be before a sense of that change
                  will cease to be my latest thought at night, &amp; my earliest in the morning. Yet I am
                  certainly resigned to this privation – &amp; this I say not in the spirit with which mere
                  philosophy teaches us to bear that which is inevitable, but with a Christian <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> conviction that this early removal is a blessing to him who is removed. – We read
                  of persons who have suddenly become grey from violent emotions of grief or fear. I
                  feel in some degree as if I had past at once from boyhood to the decline of life:
                  I had never ceased to be a boy in chearfulness till now: – all those elastic spirits
                  are gone, – nor is it in the nature of things that they should return; – I am still
                  capable of enjoyment, &amp; trust that there is much in store for me, – but there is an
                  end of that hilarity which I possessed more uninterruptedly &amp; in a greater degree
                  than any person with whom I was ever acquainted.</p>

               <p>You advised me to write down my recollections of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> while they were fresh. – I dare not undertake the task. Something akin to it, but

                  – &amp; as these effects cannot be concealed I must avoid, as much as possible, all that
                  would produce them. This believe me, is an effort of forbearance, for my heart is
                  very much set upon compleating what I have planned.</p>

            <p class="indent1">The effect upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> will be as lasting as upon myself, – but she had not the same exuberance of spirits
               to lose, &amp; therefore it will be less perceptible. The self–command which she has exercised
               has been truly exemplary, &amp; commands my highest esteem.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Your <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">god-daughter</a>, thank God, is well. Her daily lesson will long be a melancholy task on my part,

Of course this is not done without some
               assistance, &amp; some correction, – still while she improves herself, she is assisting
               me, – &amp; the pleasure that this gives me is worth a great deal. She is a good girl,
               with a ready comprehension, quick feelings, a tender heart, &amp; an excellent disposition.
               I pray God that her life may be spared, to make me happy while I live, &amp; some one
               who may be worthy of her when it shall be time for her to contract other ties &amp; other
