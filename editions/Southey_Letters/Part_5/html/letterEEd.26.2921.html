            <p class="indent1">If there be any evil connected with poetry, it is that it tends to make us too little
               masters of ourselves, and counteracts that stoicism, or necessary habit of self-control,
               of which all of us must sometimes stand in need. I do not mean as to our actions,
               for there is no danger that a man of good principles should ever feel his inclination
               and his duty altogether at variance. But as to our feelings. You talk of mourning
               the loss of your trees, and not enduring to walk where you were wont to see them.
               I can understand this, and I remember when I was little more than your age saying
               that</p>

                  </div> whom I have only lately known. Such men are not only eminently useful, but eminently
                  happy also; they live in an atmosphere of their own, which must be more like that

                  These resignations ought to have been made during the pressure of war, uncalled for,
                  when they would have purchased popularity.

                           especially in the army and navy, on 7 February 1817. As part of this programme, public
                           servants were urged to give up the rise in their salaries caused by the abolition
                           of income tax in 1816; and the Prince Regent agreed to return some of his income from
                           the Civil List, the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall. Castlereagh also

                  </div> They come now like miserable concessions forced from cowardice, and reap nothing but
                  contempt and insult for their reward. Nor ought they at any time to have resigned
                  part of their <span class="ital">official</span> appointments, because the appointments of office are in every instance inadequate
                  to its expenses, in the higher departments of state. They should take money from the
                  sinking fund, and employ it upon public works, or lend it for private ones, stimulating
                  individual industry by assisting it with capital, and thus finding work for idle hands,
                  and food for necessitous families. From the same funds they should purchase waste
                  lands, and enable speculators and industrious poor to <span class="ital">colonise</span> them; the property of the lands remaining in the nation, as a source of certain revenue,
                  improving in proportion to the prosperity of the country.</p>
