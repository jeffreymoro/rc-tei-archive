                  better than Thames water in a hot day. Do you remember those beautiful deep baths
                  of clear glassy water where you once bathed with me in Newlands, &amp; those still more
                  delightful ones which we reconnoitred after we came out of the water? It was in these
                  latter that I played the river God this morning.</p>

                  </div> He got so little credit by his challenge at Appleby that he is not likely to make
                  a second attempt at establishing a character for courage by such means. And it must
                  be allowed that he has some reason to think seriously of duelling, having lost a brother
                  in one.
