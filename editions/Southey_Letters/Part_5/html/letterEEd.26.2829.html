               <p>The date which I have just written reminds me that yesterday completed my forty-second
                  year. Few men have lived longer – if the expression may be allowed – in the same length
                  of time. I have been married more than twenty years, and have experienced, in no common
                  degree, both good and ill; wrongs and benefits, happiness and affliction, changes
                  of opinion, loss of dear friends, of parents, and of children. I am younger, perhaps,
                  in constitution than in years, but older in feelings than in either. Both <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">mother</a> died at the age of fifty. Their deaths, in both instances, were accelerated, if not
                  occasioned, by wasting anxieties; but the race is not long-lived, and I do not expect
                  to prove an exception to it. I used to pray for continued life; without being weary
                  of life, I have ceased to do this. No person could have supplied my place to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a>;

                  With what feelings I have long contemplated death many of my poems will indicate;
                  – it may be seen in “Thalaba,” in “Kehama,” and in “Roderick,”

                  </div> The late loss which I have sustained has not created these feelings, but it has rendered
                  them more vivid. The strongest root which fastened me to the world is broken, and
                  I have now more ties in heaven than upon earth, I have borne the loss with much self-command,
                  and perfect resignation. Common sense, common humanity, some little mixture of pride
                  perhaps, and the stoicism which I laid to my heart in youth might have produced the
                  first; and of all virtues there is surely none which deserves to be held so cheaply
                  as that of resignation to what is inevitable and irremediable. But I hope I have persuaded
                  myself feelingly that what has happened is best; that I acquiesce in the dispensation,
                  and neither indulge nor acknowledge a wish that it should have been otherwise. My
                  will is annihilated, and my heart is strong; but, in spite of that outward control
                  which I am constantly able to maintain, recollections will come upon me by day and
                  by night, and every hour, which make me feel the weakness of philosophy, and the inestimable
                  value of the faith which looks beyond the grave. The best teachers are Love and Affliction.
                  Enough, or too much of this. I thought to have sent you some remarks on some of your

               <p>When we see men doing their duty with heroic devotion, if a difference of opinion

                  suspect that our own opinions are not what they ought to be. I can feel equal respect
                  and equal compassion for Madame Roland and Madame Elizabeth, for the better part of
