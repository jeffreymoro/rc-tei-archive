                           of the government – the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790–1867),
                           MP for Westmorland 1812–1867, and William, Viscount Lowther (1787–1872), later 2nd
                           Earl of Lonsdale and MP for Cockermouth 1808–1813, MP for Westmorland 1813–1831 and
                           1832–1841. So complete was the Lowthers’ dominance that the last contested election
                           in Westmorland was in 1774. However, in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller
                           landowners had brought forward Henry Brougham to challenge the Lowthers – Brougham’s
                           family…</span></div>
                  </div> It so happens that I have not written a line either in prose or verse about the Westmorland
                  election, nor spoken of it, out of my family (for this plain reason – that I have
                  not been out of my own family (ie in any other company) for more than six months)
                  – nor thought of it with any more concern than of an election in Cornwall – certainly
                  not <span class="strikethrough">x</span> half so much as of that at Westminster.

                  with his proboscis. – I wish I had been present to have given him the lie upon the
                  hustings. If I notice him at all it will be to be considered whether it should be
                  by a short letter to the Courier or whether I should trouble him with a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SmithWilliam">WilliamSmithiad</a>.

               family home was Brougham Hall near Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as
               a local candidate. When he spoke on 29 June, Brougham attacked Wordsworth by name
               for supporting the Lowther cause, referring to him as ‘a man who wrote prose, and
               other compositions which he could not call prose, but which he wished were poetry’
               (<em>The Times</em>, 3 July 1818). But the <em>Courier</em> and <em>The Times</em> for 4 July carried Brougham’s speech at the hustings at Appleby on 30 June. In this
               address he attacked ‘The Wordsworths and the Southeys’ for spreading false rumours
