               <p>I have been asked for a letter of introduction to you by the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">elder Koster</a>, an old Lisbonian, &amp; a very estimable man, notwithstanding some wrong notions, &amp;
                  a contradictious manner. By no fault of his own he is at present a ruined man, – with
                  not merely an unsullied character, but a high one. I believe his business in town
                  is partly if not chiefly to try what interest he may have in procuring a consulship
                  in Brazil, – he has claims upon Government for having many years acted as Consul at
                  Lisbon, during Sir John Horts non-residence,
