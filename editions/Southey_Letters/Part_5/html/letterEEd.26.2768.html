                  with tears of sorrow what I wrote with tears of joy. And little did I think how soon
                  and how literally another part of this mournful poem was to be fulfilled, when I said

            <p class="indent1">I thank God for the strength with which we have borne this trial. It is not possible
               for woman to have acted with more fortitude than <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has done through the whole sharp suffering; she has rather set an example than followed
               it. My bodily frame is much shaken. A little time and care will recruit it, and the
               mind is sound. I am fully sensible of the blessings which are left me, which far exceed
               those of most men. I pray for continued life that I may fulfil my duties towards those
               whom I love. I employ myself, and I look forward to the end with faith and with hope,
               as one whose treasure is laid up in Heaven; and where the treasure is, there will
               the heart be also.</p>
            <p class="indent1">At present it would rather do me hurt than good to see you. I am perfectly calm and
               in full self-possession; but I know my own weakness as well as my strength, and the
               wholesomest regimen for a mind like mine, is assiduous application to pursuits which
               call forth enough of its powers to occupy without exhausting it. It is well for me
               that I can do this. I take regular exercise and am very careful of myself. </p>
            <p class="indent1">Many will feel for me, but none can tell what I have lost: the head and flower of
               my earthly happiness is cut off. But I am <span class="ital">not</span> unhappy.</p>
