               <div class="salute">My dear Sir</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">There is one advantage to set against the many inconveniences of living in these uttermost
               parts of the North, – it is that in going to or from London any part of the intermediate
               country whether East or West may be made in the road without going much out of the
               nearest line. There are three stage coach lines nearly of equal length. That by Stamford,
               Newark, Doncaster &amp; Greta Bridge to Penrith, this is the road which the Mail takes
               from London to Carlisle &amp; Glasgow, but I think it would afford you fewer opportunities
               of getting on by short stages than either of the others. The Western road is generally
               taken by those who do not prefer mail coach travelling; – this is by Oxford &amp; Birmingham,
               either to Manchester or Liverpool, &amp; thence to Lancaster &amp; Kendal. The third road
               is by way of Leeds, from whence there is a daily stage to Kendal. Kendal is thirty
               miles from this place, &amp; a coach runs every day from thence thro <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> to Whitehaven. Penrith is 18 miles from us, &amp; a coach (likewise to Whitehaven) runs
               thro this little town three times a week.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The first consideration must be whether you have any friends upon either of these
                  roads, – the second what places would be the pleasantest to halt at. But in case you
                  should take the Birmingham &amp; Liverpool road, &amp; wish to rest a day at those places
                  I will frank up letters of introduction to both. It is very unpleasant to be landed
                  in a large city without any acquaintance in it, especially as there are no <span class="ital">Commissionaires</span> in England. – The Birmingham letter is to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">M<sup>r</sup> Lloyd</a>, the banker, – a Quaker &amp; a very remarkable man, – who in his old age has amused
                  himself by translating Homer &amp; Horace into very respectable verse.
