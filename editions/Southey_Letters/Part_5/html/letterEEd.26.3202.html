               <p>I have been doing my best to impress upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">Wilberforces</a> mind a sense of the real dangers of the country. And I think if any feasable plan
                  could be struck out, it is very likely that he might be induced to act a very useful
                  part. What I propose is that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Fox’s</a> law of libel

                  curbed, – unless he &amp; I made haste to our graves we should both be sent to the scaffold.

                  coincided with us, both as to the evil &amp; the means of remedy. And sure I am that if
                  a proper law of libel were brought forward, &amp; a proper punishment for treason in its
                  first stages, they would be carried in spite of all clamour. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> would be an excellent man to come forward on such an occasion, – but tho he knows
                  the danger, I fear he would shrink from the remedy, – not from any obloquy to which
                  such a measure would expose him.</p>
