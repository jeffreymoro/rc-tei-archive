                           so, the public debate had moved on and Southey therefore decided to incorporate the
                           letter into his pamphlet A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P. (1817).</span></div>

                           home had delayed his receipt of the letter, which meant that it was not sent to the
                           newspaper for publication. This letter too was incorporated into Southey’s A Letter

                  me, &amp; if he were to, I should fight him nowhere but in the newspapers.</p>
