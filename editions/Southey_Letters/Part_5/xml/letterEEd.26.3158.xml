          <salute> My dear G.</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have sent me the Times of Friday July 3. &#8211; by mistake I suppose
               for Saturdays paper, &#8211; because in Saturdays Courier I find <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Broughams</ref> speech concerning me at
               Appleby, which you probably meant to communicate.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Westmorland constituency was dominated by the Lowther
                  family, who were supporters of the government &#8211; the two sitting MPs were the
                  brothers Henry Lowther (1790&#8211;1867), MP for Westmorland 1812&#8211;1867, and William,
                  Viscount Lowther (1787&#8211;1872), later 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and MP for Cockermouth
                  1808&#8211;1813, MP for Westmorland 1813&#8211;1831 and 1832&#8211;1841. So complete was the
                  Lowthers&#8217; dominance that the last contested election in Westmorland was in 1774.
                  However, in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller landowners had brought
                  forward Henry Brougham to challenge the Lowthers &#8211; Brougham&#8217;s family home was
                  Brougham Hall near Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as a local
                  candidate. When he spoke on 29 June, Brougham attacked Wordsworth by name for
                  supporting the Lowther cause, referring to him as &#8216;a man who wrote prose, and
                  other compositions which he could not call prose, but which he wished were poetry&#8217;
                     (<title>The Times</title>, 3 July 1818). But the <title>Courier</title> and
                     <title>The Times</title> for 4 July carried Brougham&#8217;s speech at the hustings
                  at Appleby on 30 June. In this address he attacked &#8216;The Wordsworths and the
                  Southeys&#8217; for spreading false rumours about Brougham and insulting the freeholders
                  of Westmorland.</note> It so happens that I have not written a line either in
               prose or verse about the Westmorland election, nor spoken of it, out of my family
               (for this plain reason &#8211; that I have not been out of my own family (ie in any other
               company) for more than six months) &#8211; nor thought of it with any more concern than of
               an election in Cornwall &#8211; certainly not <del>x</del> half so much as of that at
                  Westminster.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The constituency of
                  Westminster had a large electorate and contests were often widely-reported. In
                  1818 the Whigs Sir Samuel Romilly (1757&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>) and Sir Francis
                  Burdett narrowly defeated the naval commander and pro-government candidate, Sir
                  Murray Maxwell (1775&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>).</note> He is therefore a liar as
               well as a scoundrel. Whether it be worth while to take any notice of his falsehood
               will be better determined, when that propensity is somewhat abated which would lead
               the forefinger &amp; thumb of my right hand into close contact with his proboscis. &#8211;
               I wish I had been present to have given him the lie upon the hustings. If I notice
               him at all it will be to be considered whether it should be by a short letter to the
               Courier or whether I should trouble him with a <ref type="m" target="people.html#SmithWilliam">WilliamSmithiad</ref>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was dissuaded from publishing a retort to Brougham that he modelled
                  on his pamphlet <title>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M. P.</title> (1817). Part
                  of it finally appeared, without mentioning Brougham&#8217;s name, as a &#8216;Postscript&#8217; to
                  the second edition of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp.
                  45&#8211;53.</note> In the latter case the order of battle would be thus, &#8211; first <del>a

               hostility to me, &amp; here he may be made the representative of the whole herd of
