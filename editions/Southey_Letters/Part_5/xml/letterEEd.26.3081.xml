        <p rend="indent1"> Do you happen to have McKerrells (or what ever his name is) letters
               to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref>
          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert M&#8217;Kerrell (1761&#8211;1841), a textile merchant and manufacturer in Paisley,
                  had on 28 May 1812, given evidence to the House of Commons committee enquiring
                  into the Orders in Council system, which enforced a trade blockade on territories
                  controlled by France. The Whig opposition were campaigning for its repeal, on the
                  grounds that it harmed British manufacturing. Brougham denounced M&#8217;Kerrell (though
                  not by name) in the House of Commons on 16 June 1812, claiming he had told the
                  committee that textile workers were overpaid and &#8216;oatmeal and water were good
                  enough for Englishmen&#8217;. M&#8217;Kerrell denied he had said this and published an
                  acrimonious exchange of letters between himself and Brougham in <title>The
                     Times</title> of 20 July 1812. </note> &#8211; If so I wish you would send them to me
                  <hi rend="ital">vi&#226; </hi>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>. Just now they would figure in the
               Westmorland election. &#8211; His mob at Kendal have shown greater ferocity than was ever
               remembered in that county before.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A general
                  election was imminent, though the House of Commons was not dissolved until 10 June
                  1818. It was already clear, though, that there would be a contest in Westmorland,
                  which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were supporters of the government &#8211;
                  the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790&#8211;1867), MP for
                  Westmorland 1812&#8211;1867 and William, Viscount Lowther (1787&#8211;1872), later 2nd Earl of
                  Lonsdale and MP for Cockermouth 1808&#8211;1813, MP for Westmorland 1813&#8211;1831 and
                  1832&#8211;1841. So complete was the Lowthers&#8217; dominance that the last contested
                  election in Westmorland had been in 1774. However, in January 1818, a committee of
                  Whigs and smaller landowners had brought forward Henry Brougham to challenge the
                  Lowthers &#8211; Brougham&#8217;s family home was Brougham Hall near Penrith and he could
                  plausibly be presented as a local candidate. According to <title>The
                  Times</title>, 17 February 1818, the Earl of Lonsdale and other gentleman of his
                  party were, at the hustings in Kendal on 12 February, &#8216;much bespattered&#8217; by
                  missiles hurled by a drunken mob. </note>

        <p rend="indent1"> There are no other particulars about the Brussels books than that I
               bought them of Verbiest the bookseller, who was to send them according to the
               direction you gave me to Prince Esterhazy thro Rothschild.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The consignment of books Southey had bought from Jean-Baptiste
                  Ver Beyst (1770&#8211;1849), a famous bookseller in Brussels, in 1817. To assist in the
                  books&#8217; transit, Southey had enlisted the banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild
                  (1777&#8211;1836; <title>DNB</title>) and Prince P&#225;l Antal Esterh&#225;zy de Gal&#225;ntha

               sure Verbiest is an honest man, &#8211; much more of a book-worm than a bookseller, but I
