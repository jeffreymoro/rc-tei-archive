        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Church Returns.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">On 16 March 1818, Nicholas Vansittart (1766&#8211;1851;
                     <title>DNB</title>), Chancellor of the Exchequer 1812&#8211;1823, drew attention to
                  statistics collected on the deficiency of Church of England places of worship and
                  proposed &#163;1,000,000 be spent on constructing new churches. This proposal was
                  embodied in the Church Building Act (1818).</note> &#8211; The worst symptom of the
               times is that you &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">S.T.C.</ref> so

               reference joined to his natural sagacity make his authority of great weight with me.
               Well then, &#8211; so much the more needful is it to bestir ourselves, &#8211; we who can. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> has done
               his <hi rend="ital">devoir</hi> here,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In
                  the form of the pamphlet <title>Two Addresses to the Freeholders of
                     Westmorland</title> (1818).</note> &amp; you shall see that I will do mine, in
               more ways than one. &#8211; More of my Philippic in a day or two.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Philippic&#8217; was a satirical attack on Brougham, the draft
                  of which Southey was sending in instalments for Rickman to read. Brougham had
                  provoked Southey&#8217;s ire by, reportedly, attacking him at the hustings for the
                  Westmorland election on 30 June 1818. Southey was dissuaded from publishing this
                  retort to Brougham, which he modelled on his pamphlet <title>A Letter to William
                     Smith, Esq. M. P.</title> (1817) and termed the &#8216;Tender Epistle&#8217;. The sections
                  that were completed were published as a &#8216;Postscript&#8217; to the second edition of
                     <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp. 45&#8211;53 (without naming
                  Brougham).</note> I have some choice cases of slander for the middle part &#8211; M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kerrel,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert
                  M&#8217;Kerrell (1761&#8211;1841), a textile merchant and manufacturer in Paisley, had on 28
                  May 1812, given evidence to the House of Commons committee enquiring into the
                  Orders in Council system, which enforced a trade blockade on territories
                  controlled by France. The Whig opposition were campaigning for its repeal, on the
                  grounds that it harmed British manufacturing. Brougham denounced M&#8217;Kerrell (though
                  not by name) in the House of Commons on 16 June 1812, claiming he had told the
                  committee that textile workers were overpaid and &#8216;oatmeal and water were good
                  enough for Englishmen.&#8217; M&#8217;Kerrell denied he had said this and published an
                  acrimonious exchange of letters between himself and Brougham in <title>The
                     Times</title> of 20 July 1812.</note> Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Beaver,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">In the Commons on 16 July 1811 Brougham
                  cited, as an instance of the oppression and cruelty practised in the navy, the
                  flogging of a seaman. According to Brougham, the seaman, who had been flogged
                  before, declared he would jump overboard if flogged again. The captain then
                  decided to test whether he would carry out his threat and ordered a flogging. When
                  the sailor jumped overboard, no attempt was made to save him, by the captain&#8217;s
                  express order. Though Brougham did not name the captain or the ship, he was
                  referring to HMS <title>Acasta</title>, under the command of Captain Philip Beaver
                  (1766&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>). Southey described the incident in detail in
                     <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 85&#8211;88, noting
                  that the Admiralty had investigated the matter and declared Brougham&#8217;s accusations
                  to be unfounded.</note> the Essex Clergyman<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1816 Brougham had told the Select Committee on the Education of the Lower
                  Orders in the Metropolis that he had received a communication about a school in a
                  &#8216;neighbouring county&#8217; that had an income of &#163;1500&#8211;&#163;2000 per annum, which the
                  clergyman of the parish had misapplied and had refused to use to provide proper
                  teaching in the school. On 5 March 1818 he apologised in the Commons for
                  misstating the facts and admitted that whilst this might have been the situation
                  in the past, it was no longer the case. Though he did not name the cleric or the
                  school, he stated that his apology was the result of representations from an Essex
                  MP, to whom complaints had been made from &#8216;a respectable clergyman in
                  Essex&#8217;.</note> &amp; Manners.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Brougham
                  had asked a question in the House of Commons on 9 July 1817 as to whether the
                  George Manners appointed as Vice-Consul in Massachusetts in June 1817, was George
                  Manners (1778&#8211;1853; <title>DNB</title>), editor of <title>The Satirist</title>
                  1807&#8211;1812 and a pro-government journalist, &#8216;who had stood on the floor of the
                  King&#8217;s-bench, and received the sentence of the court for a slanderous attack on a
                  private individual&#8217;. Brougham was correct in his identification and a sturdy
                  defence of Manners by &#8216;Vindicator&#8217; appeared in the <title>Morning Post</title> on
                  11 July 1817. The same day, Lord Castlereagh (1769&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>),
                  Foreign Secretary 1812&#8211;1822, defended the appointment in the House of Commons,
                  pointing out that Manners had still been allowed to practice as a barrister,
                  despite his conviction in 1809 for libelling the opposition journalist Peter
                  Finnerty (c. 1766&#8211;1822), who had himself been imprisoned in 1811 for libelling
                  Castlereagh. But Castlereagh did not mention that Manners had also been found
                  guilty of libel by the Court of King&#8217;s Bench on 2 June 1811 and sentenced to three
                  months in prison &#8211; the victim was William Hallett (1784&#8211;1843), radical candidate
                  for Berkshire in 1812, whom <title>The Satirist</title> had accused of mistreating
                  his sister.</note>
