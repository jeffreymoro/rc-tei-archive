        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I return all the papers which came in your last inclosure, having, as you will see by the proof, made some use of them,
               &amp; especially in a note for the gratification of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Baber. Upon that subject I have added a little (from your
               letter) &#8211; to what <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> had inserted; &#8211; &amp; I suspect M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               Baber will have no very pleasant sensations when he <del>sees</del> {peruses} the next number of the Q.R.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s article, &#8216;Inquiry into the Copyright Act&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (January 1819), 196&#8211;213
                  (209). Here Southey severely criticised Henry Hervey Baber (1775&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>), Keeper of Printed Books at the British
                  Museum 1812&#8211;1837, for serving a writ on Murray because his firm had been dilatory in sending to the British Museum copies of four
                  books it had published, as the Copyright Act (1814) required. Southey made use of a good deal of material provided by Murray for
                  this article, including Murray&#8217;s testimony to the House of Commons Select Committee on the Copyright Act (1818).</note> I am very
               glad you sent the article to <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, &#8211; we are now safe about the points of law
               which are stated. He had struck out what was said of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrydgesSirEgerton">Sir Egerton Brydges</ref>
               &#8220;high family&#8221; because <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrydgesSirEgerton">Sir E.</ref>
          <del>had</del> failed in establishing his claim to the Chandos Barony:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Three of the pamphlets
                  reviewed in Southey&#8217;s article in his &#8216;Inquiry into the Copyright Act&#8217; were Sir Egerton Brydges, <title>Reasons for a Further
                     Amendment of the Act 54 Geo. III. C. 156. Being an Act to Amend the Copyright Act of Queen Anne</title> (1817); <title>A Summary
                     Statement of the Great Grievances Imposed on Authors and Publishers, and the Injury done to Literature, by the Late Copyright
                     Act</title> (1818); and <title>A Vindication of the Pending Bill for the Amendment of the Copyright Act, from the
                     Misrepresentations and Unjust Comments of the Syndics of the University Library at Cambridge</title> (1818). Brydges had
                  litigated, from 1790 to 1803, when his case was rejected, to prove that he was the heir to the Barony of Chandos. The litigation
                  brought humiliation upon him when it appeared that some of the evidence he produced was forged. Despite the rejection, Brydges
                  continued to style himself <hi rend="ital">per legem terrae Baron Chandos of Sudeley</hi>.</note> &#8211; I have however restored the
               words, because he is still of the same family, &#8211; the words themselves give a peculiar force to the sentence (the epithet <hi rend="ital">generous</hi> relating to them) &#8211; &amp; moreover the passage will be peculiarly gratifying to poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrydgesSirEgerton">Sir Egerton</ref>, who is sadly sensitive to praise or censure, &amp; really in this affair
               deserves all the praise that we can give him. I have no acquaintance with him.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey may not
                  have met Brydges, but he had corresponded warmly with him: see Southey to Brydges, 10 May [1807], <title>The Collected Letters of
                     Robert Southey. Part 3</title>, Letter 1320. The reference to Brydges&#8217;s &#8216;high family&#8217; did not appear in Southey&#8217;s review.</note>
               But I know that it is doing your Journal good service to gratify an individual when it can be done with perfect fitness, as it is doing
               it some injury ever to offend or exasperate one without <del>goo</del> just cause.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This puts me in mind of Morris Birbeck. Your statement about his leaving his farm was flatly contradicted in the Times,
               &#8211; &amp; in the style of Times-politics, &#8211; which are more rascally than even those of the M Chronicle.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Both <title>The Times</title> and the <title>Morning Chronicle</title> (1769&#8211;1862) were anti-government daily
                  newspapers. <title>The Times</title>, 23 October 1818, carried a letter flatly contradicting the assertions (by William Gifford) in
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 54&#8211;78, which reviewed the recent writings of Morris Birkbeck (1764&#8211;1825;
                     <title>DNB</title>). In particular, <title>The Times</title> rebutted the claim that Birkbeck had emigrated to America without
                  settling his obligations as a tenant of an estate at Wanborough, Surrey, which he leased from George Onslow, 1st Earl of Onslow
                  (1731&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>). Birkbeck came from a Quaker family based in Westmorland and was a radical. Leaving his farm, he
                  travelled to France and published <title>Notes on a Journey through France</title> (1814) and in 1817 emigrated to Illinois, bought
                  public land there and in 1818 established a new town &#8211; Wanborough. His <title>Notes on a Journey in America from the Coast of
                     Virginia to the Territory of Illinois</title> (1817), a book designed to inform would-be emigrants, and notable for its radical
                  views, went through eleven editions in two years. </note> Now I happen to <del>know</del> have heard something of this said Morris

        <p rend="indent1"> This man has not been treated a whit more severely than he deserves. But with regard to Fearons book, which <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> has just sent me, the case is different, &#8211; <hi rend="ital">that</hi> book
