        <p rend="indent1"> The Timour Khan of Mohammed 2 (at Constantinople) consists of 70
               rooms, covered with 80 cupolas, attended by 200 servants, a general physician &amp; a
               surgeon. All passengers (travellers I suppose) who fall sick are received in the
               hospital &amp; attended to. Twice a day they receive excellent dishes, so that
               pheasants, partridges &amp; other precious birds are by no means spared. If such
               provisions are not ready at the hospital, it is provided by the charters of
               foundation that such provisions are to be furnished by the Imarets (dining
               establishments) of S Soleman, of Prince Mahommed his son, of Sultan Ahmed 1, of
               Khasseke Sultan (near the womens market,) of Wesa Sultan, of Eyoob Sultan, of Prince
               Djehaungeer (at Tophana) of Mohammed Sultan at Scutari of the Walides mosque at
               Scutari. There are musicians &amp; players paid to divert the madmen, &amp; to cure
               by that means their madness. There is also a separate hospital for Infidels.</p>

               enfans sont encore sujets &#224; cette maladie, qu&#8217;on appelle si improprement, dans le
               pays, <hi rend="ital">Catharre</hi>. Ce mal, que l&#8217;on peut nommer le fleau des
               enfans, est une convulson universelle, ou un v&#233;ritable <hi rend="ital">Tetanos</hi>.
               It attaque principalement ceux qui sont nouvellement n&#233;s; &amp; les emporte, presque
               tous, en trois ou quatre jours. Il n&#8217;&#233;pargne pas m&#234;me les grandes personnes, &#224;
               quelque age qu&#8217;elles soient. On n&#8217;a jamais vu, ou du moins tr&#232;s rarement, qu&#8217;aucun
               Blanc, pour parler le langage du pays, aye &#233;t&#233; saisi de pareille maladie. On a
               constamment observ&#233; que les enfans sont plus sujets &#224; ce cruel mal, le trois ou le
               quatre, jusques m&#234;me au neuvi&#233;me jour apr&#232;s leur naissance; de sorte que s&#8217;ils
               passent neuf jours entiers sans en avoir aucune atteinte, les femmes les croyent hors
               de danger, &amp; les exposent hardiment &#224; l&#8217;air. Il en est qui, en naissant,
               apportent cette maladie, &amp; meurent aussi-t&#244;t. On connoit ordinairement quand les

               mouvemens convulsifs, qui sent l&#8217;avant-coureur de la mort, venant coup sur coup,
               enlevent en peu de tems le malade.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A l&#8217;&#233;gard det adultes, ils r&#233;sistent &#224; la v&#233;rit&#233; plus long-tems que
               le enfans; mais ils ont toujours le malheur d&#8217;&#233;prouver le m&#233;me sort. La maladie le
               manifeste par une esp&#233;ce de Torticolis; ou une douleur qu&#8217;on sent au col, &amp; que
               les malades comparent &#224; une corde qui les preffe: la m&#226;choire se serre ensuite, &amp;
               emp&#234;che d&#8217;avaler la nourriture; les bras &amp; les jambes deviennent si roides, qu&#8217;en
               prenant la malade par un pied, ou par la t&#234;te, on le leve comme une pi&#233;ce de bois. La
               roideur des membres n&#8217;est pas si continuellement soutenue, qu il n&#8217;arrive plusieurs
               fois le jour quelques contractions involuntaires. Ces accidens fatiguent si fort les
               malades, qu&#8217;ils jettent des hauts cris; ils demandent qu&#8217;on les soutienne; &amp; on
               est m&#234;me oblig&#233; de leur tenir la t&#234;te un peu &#233;lev&#233;e, pour leur faciliter la
               respiration, qui est fort g&#234;n&#233;e. Ce qu&#8217;il y a de plus particulier dans cette maladie,
               c&#8217;est une faim insatiable; dont les malades sont quelquefois si fort press&#233;s, qu&#8217;ils
               mangeroient &#224; tout moment, si on vouloit les satisfaire, &amp; s&#8217;ils avoient
               d&#8217;ailleurs la libert&#233; d&#8217;avaler. La fi&#233;vre ne manque jamais de survenir; des sueurs
               copieuses se r&#233;pandent dans toute l&#8217;habitude du corps; &amp; le mal augmentant de
               plus en plus, le malade meurt avec des mouvemens convulsifs horribles.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> La pr&#233;caution la plus sure pour arr&#234;ter le progr&#232;s d&#8217;un si cruel mal,
               est d&#8217;arroser les malades plufieurs fois par jour avec de l&#8217;eau la plus fraiche qu&#8217;on
               puisse trouver, &amp; sur tout d&#232;s le moment que l&#8217;on s&#8217;apper&#231;oit que les enfans ne
               peuvent t&#233;ter qu&#8217;avec peine, &amp; que leur m&#226;choire commence a se serrer. If faut
               r&#233;iterer ces aspersions, jusques &#224; ce que ces f&#226;cheux accidens foient dissip&#233;s, &amp;
               que les parties du corps ayent repris leur premiere souplesse. Il est necessaire de
               soutenir les forces du malade; sur tout des grandes personnes, par des bons
               bouillons, qu&#8217;il faut donner peu &amp; souvent, dans l&#8217;intervale desquels on doit
               leur faire prendre quelques eueiller&#233;es de vin. Il ne faut pas manquer non plus de
               mettre en usage le Mercure doux, ou l&#8217;Etioph min&#233;ral, en le m&#234;lant avec des
               purgatifs, comme la Rhubarbe, le Diagrede, le Jalap. L&#8217;Extrait d&#8217;Alo&#235;s m&#8217;a aussi
               r&#233;ussi dans cette rencontre. Et suppos&#233; que le malade n&#8217;eut pas assez de libert&#233;
               d&#8217;avaler des Bolus, en ce cas, on doit y sustituer une infusion de Sen&#233;, avec la
               Manne &amp; les autres purgatifs ordinaires. Les esclaves que j&#8217;ai eu le bonheur de
               gu&#233;rir dans la Colonie, sont autant de t&#233;moins du succ&#232;s &amp; de la bont&#233; de cette

               sont menac&#233;s de la Maladie, elles les baignent, sans autre fa&#231;on, &amp; les arrosent

          <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Pierre Barr&#232;re (c. 1690&#8211;1755), <title>Nouvelle
                     Relation de la France &#201;quinoxiale</title> (Paris, 1743), pp. 70&#8211;74, no. 116 in
                  the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. &#8216;For a long time, we were of the opinion
                  that slaves could not multiply, especially since, being unable to save a single
                  Negro, they were dying almost as soon as they were born. Today, these poor
                  children are still subject to the disease that is so improperly referred to in
                  this country as Catharre. This evil, that we may call the scourge of children, is
                  a universal convulsion or the fully-fledged Tetanus. It primarily affects those
                  who are newly born, &amp; it takes the lives of most of them in three or four
                  days. Not even the adults, no matter their age, are spared from this disease. We
                  have never, or at least very rarely, seen whites, as the people of this country
                  call them, that were seized by such a disease. We have consistently observed that
                  children are more prone to this cruel evil, but even so, some of them do not show
                  any signs of the disease until the third or the fourth or even up to the ninth day
                  after birth, which is why the women, believing them to be out of danger, boldly
                  expose them to the elements. There are those who, at birth, bear this disease and
                  die instantly. We usually know when children have Tetanus, also referred to as the
                  Disease, by the difficulty they have in suckling their mother&#8217;s milk and the
                  convulsions of their jaw: their cry is usually stunted and different from that of
                  other children. Finally, the jaw tightens even more, the extremities become stiff
                  &amp; the convulsions, the harbingers of death, now coming in quick succession,
                  are quick to take the patient&#8217;s life. With regard to the adults, they resist much
                  longer than the children, but they still have the misfortune of experiencing the
                  same fate. The disease manifests itself as a kind of torticollis, or a pain that
                  is felt at the neck, one that the patients compared to a rope that <hi rend="ital">presses</hi>: their jaw then tightens, and it prevents them from swallowing
                  food, the arms &amp; the legs become so stiff that taking the patient by a foot or
                  by the head is like lifting a plank of wood. The stiffness of the limbs is not
                  continually sustained, as they&#8217;ll often experience involuntary contractions
                  several times a day. These incidents are so tiresome that the sick cry out asking
                  us to prop them up, &amp; we even have to hold their head a little higher to
                  facilitate breathing, which is very uncomfortable. What is especially particular
                  in this disease is an insatiable hunger that sometimes leaves patients so
                  hard-pressed that they would eat all the time if their wishes were met, and if
                  they had also freedom to swallow. The fever never fails to occur, profuse sweating
                  spreads all throughout the body, and the pain increases more and more until the
                  disease ends in horrible convulsions. The safest precaution to stop the progress
                  of such a cruel pain is to sluice the sick several times a day with the coolest
                  water we can find, and especially as soon as we notice that the children are
                  suckling with difficulty, or when their jaw starts to tighten. If necessary, we
                  repeat the spraying of water until these unfortunate symptoms dissipate, and until
                  the body parts have returned to their initial flexibility. It is necessary to help
                  maintain the patient&#8217;s strength, especially the adults, by giving them good broth,
                  often and in little doses, as well as by making them drink spoonfuls of wine in
                  the meantime. It is important to also use sweet Mercury or <hi rend="ital">Ethiopian minerals</hi> by mixing it with purgatives like rhubarb, powdered
                  scammony and Jalap. Aloe extracts also worked for me in these kinds of situations.
                  And assuming that the patient is not able to swallow a bolus, then we must
                  substitute it with an infusion of Senna, Manna &amp; other ordinary purgatives.
                  The slaves that I had the pleasure of healing in the Colony all testify to the
                  success &amp; the goodness of this method. Today, as soon as black women notice
                  that their children are at risk of the disease, they do nothing else but bathe and
                  sprinkle them with great Couyes (gourds) full of water.'</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> Hospital of Sultan Bayazet at Adrianople, with a medical academy.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are 8 rooms here, which &#8216;are ever full of sick people, poor and
               rich. In some of these rooms fire is lighted at winter time according to the desire
               of the sick, &amp; they are fondled with silk cushions, good beds, &amp;c. for the
               spring when madness is particularly raging. the madmen sick of mystic love (religious
               madmen) are seen to lie here chained like lions in their dens, looking to the basin
               (the fountain I suppose), &amp; speaking in the cant of Kalenders. Others dispersing
               in the garden amongst the flower beds, yell &amp; shout to the song of the
               nightingale, without measure or art. In the season of the flowers the sick are often
               cured only by the sight &amp; smell of them; &amp; some lose their wits by the sweet
               scent of them (perhaps this is German for fainting). The greater number of the madmen
               enchained here are lovesick, &amp; their sight may cure those who are in danger to
               become mad by the number of pretty faces to be seen here. Some of the mad are cured
               by music; and therefore Sultan Bayazet, the founder, established a living for some
               musicians, who come thrice a week, &amp; play in the winter &amp; summer rooms to the
               sick &amp; mad. The mad begin then to jump like apes at the tunes, <hi rend="ital">Rast, Neva, Sigah, Bhehargeh</hi>, but above all to the tunes <hi rend="ital">Zevgoole </hi>&amp; <hi rend="ital">Boslik</hi>, which being accompanied by the
               great kettledrum gives particular pleasure to the mad. Briefly there is no hospital
               &amp; no madhouse in the whole world like that of Adrianople. The sick &amp; mad
               receive three times in four &amp; twenty hours, not only common food, but birds &amp;
               all kinds of aviary dainties from the kitchen founded for that purpose. Twice in the
               week the apothecary&#8217;s room is opened, &amp; medicines are distributed to all those
               who ask for them; preparations of cardamom, caryophils, &amp; all kind of aromatic
               spices. On the door of the room a curse is written against those who without being
               sick should ask for such medicines, that they should fall sick immediately.&#8217; Eulia
