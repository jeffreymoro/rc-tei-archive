          <salute>My dear friend</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent2"> As this is the first letter which I have addressed to you since the
               entrance of the new year, let me begin, according to good old custom, with wishing
               you as many returns as you can enjoy, &amp; as happy ones as you deserve, <del>which
                  will xxxx</del> or to express the same thing in other words as I desire.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A kalender month has now elapsed since my return, &#8211; I have settled
               into my usual pursuits, &amp; this corpus of mine with an adaptability which is more
               remarkable than that of the mind, &amp; for which I have great reason to be thankful,
               conforms <del>as</del> {perfectly} well to the almost total inactivity to which
               inclination, <del>x</del> avocation, &amp; bad weather have combined to tempt it. I
               who <del>scarcely ever walked</del> during my whole stay in town was every morning on
               my feet till the hour of a late dinner, &amp; scarcely ever walked less than ten or
               twelve miles per day, have certainly not walked ten miles since I returned to
               Cumberland; &#8211; the soles of my shoes have been spared at the expence of the seat of my
               pantaloons.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> During this time I have almost exclusively been occupied upon my
                  poem,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note> &#8211; &amp; when you
               hear that I have written above 800 lines you will not think that I have made an ill
               use of my time; &#8211; the season is past when I could have written that quantity in a
               week. The subject has grown under my hands, &amp; without departing from my original
               plan, much more has been introduced into it than it was <del>at</del> my
                  <del>orig</del> first intention to have introduced. The title which I have fixed
               upon is A Poets Pilgrimage to the Field of Belle Alliance.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey preferred the name of &#8216;Belle Alliance&#8217; for the battle
                  fought on 18 June 1815, but he was persuaded to refer to it as &#8216;Waterloo&#8217;.</note>
               I now think of adapting to it the first part of the introduction which was written
               for the marriage poem, &#8211; which is to the same metre, &amp; accords perfectly with the
               tone &amp; manner.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1814 Southey, as Poet
                  Laureate, had started a poem celebrating the forthcoming marriage of the Prince
                  Regent&#8217;s only child, Princess Charlotte, to the Hereditary Prince of Orange,
                  William (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). The poem had not been
                  published because the royal engagement was broken off in June 1814. Southey did
                  not reuse these stanzas in <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>;
                  instead he reworked them into <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen
                     Nuptiale</title> (1816) to celebrate Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Leopold of
                  Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>).</note> And I think also of addressing
               the poem rather than the Tale of Paraguay to you, for two reasons, &#8211; first because
               the address to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</ref> has in itself something the character of a
                  dedication,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825) was prefaced by a poem, entitled
                  &#8216;Dedication. To Edith May Southey&#8217;.</note> &#8211; &amp; secondly, the first in weight,
               this work will first be ready, &#8211; &amp; life is so uncertain a thing, that it is never
               prudent to wait for a second opportunity of doing what we are desirous to do.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (London, 1816), [unpaginated],
                  was dedicated to John May, &#8216;in testimony of the highest esteem and
                  affection&#8217;.</note> There may yet be 3 or 400 lines to write, &#8211; but I shall not
               take it off the anvil till it is compleated. There will be six parts beside the
               Proem, &amp; a concluding Hymn for Victory. The Journey, Brussels, the Field of
               Battle (these are written) &#8211; <del>Belgium</del> the New Kingdom (or some such title,

               have read those letters of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Yeatman<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Harry Farr Yeatman (1751&#8211;1796), Rector of Kilve 1784&#8211;1796. Kilve
                  was close to many of the sites of Southey&#8217;s childhood and youth in Somerset.
                  Yeatman was buried at Stock Gaylard, only eight miles from Sherborne. These
                  references to him may be connected to the fact that his son, Harry Farr Yeatman
                  (1786&#8211;1861), was about to publish <title>Brent Knoll, a Poem</title> (1817), which
                  mentioned Yeatman senior.</note> with great interest, &amp; a melancholy feeling
               which the recollection of names &amp; places could not fail to excite. He was
               evidently a very amenable &amp; a very accomplished man, I would not go thro
               Sherburne without looking for his grave. The perusal of these papers has given
               occasion to some feelings which I shall have a fit opportunity of expressing in the
               Memoir of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walpole, &#8211; my next employment in chief when this
               poem is off my hands.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Here Southey refers to
