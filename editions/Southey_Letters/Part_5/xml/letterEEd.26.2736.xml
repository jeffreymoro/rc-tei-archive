        <p rend="indent1"> I shall attend to your remarks always, &amp; profit by them where I can &#8211; as for party you need not fear that, &#8211; I have
               even done some little injustice to some of my own political <del>views</del> {apprehensions} in putting them into the Old Mans
                  mouth.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book 2, &#8216;The
                  Evil Prophet&#8217;, an Old Man who the poet encounters puts the case for the futility of the war against France in 1803&#8211;1814 and
                  1815.</note> But you will see that all this is subordinate to the philosophical views developed at the conclusion.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It will perhaps be convenient to prefix something like an analysis of this fact &#8211; in the way of an<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Changed from &#8216;arg&#8217;.</note> argument to the poem. The Tower upon the sand<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book 1, &#8216;The Tower&#8217;, stanza 9, line 1.</note> &#8211; is not emblematic
               of ambition, &#8211; but of philosophy built upon false principles. The principles of the revolutionary leaders are broadly stated in this
                  part,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Particularly <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book
                  1, &#8216;The Tower&#8217;, stanza 17, line 6, &#8216;Live whilst thou livest, for this life is all!&#8217;; and stanza 22, line 6, &#8216;Pleasure is the aim,
                  and Self the spring of all&#8217;.</note> as avowed by most of them, &amp; consistently acted upon by Buonaparte;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French 1804&#8211;1814, 1815).</note> &#8211; &amp; in this canto they are
               contrasted with the principles of duty. In the next canto<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book 2, &#8216;The Evil Prophet&#8217;.</note> those arguments are advanced
               which would prove that no good has resulted from the contest, &amp; that our victory has left the world worse than it found it, &amp;
               with these arguments as <del>rela</del> relating to Italy &amp; Spain, &amp; to domestic dangers,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The continued division of Italy after 1815 and its dominance by Austria and reactionary rulers; the restoration of
                  absolutist government in Spain in 1814; and the danger of revolution in Britain 1816&#8211;1819.</note> the old Gentleman takes his
               departure, leaving me more impressed by them than it would have been agreable to acknowledge to <del>him</del> {one} <del>upon
                  whom</del> who if he had been closely examined might have been found guilty of cloven feet &amp; a tail. In the third canto<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book 3, &#8216;The Sacred Mountain&#8217;.</note> which is far more
               visionary, the purport is that religion must be the foundation of philosophy, which can never judge rightly of human affairs unless the
               nature &amp; destination of man be felt &amp; understood: the two points upon which I rest are, that imperfection or disease in our
               nature, which is called original sin, (which I am very far from understanding in a Calvinistic sense<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> That all people, other than the elect who are saved by Christ&#8217;s death, are predestined to damnation from before
                  birth, because of Adam&#8217;s disobedience in the Garden of Eden (<title>Genesis</title> 3); as in the teachings of the French
                  theologian, Jean Calvin (1509&#8211;1564).</note>) &amp; the immortality of the soul. Upon these data whatever relates to individual man
               becomes clear &amp; satisfactory. And in the last canto<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book 4, &#8216;The Hopes of Man&#8217;.</note> this is applied: I then look
               at the general course of history, <del>&amp;</del> consider the question of national degeneracy; &amp; show that the degradation of
               Europe &#8211; that is of the only progressive part of the world, would have resulted from Buonapartes success. Thence the immeasurable
               importance of this Victory. All this ought to be perspicuous, if I have explained myself properly. I then proceed to show what England
               may be, taking the fair side <del>of the picture</del>, &#8211; &amp; then in a series of shifting pictures looking on for centuries, far
               &amp; wide, &amp; taking care to say that it depends upon herself whether they be realised or not. Then I shall wake &amp; conclude
               with a L&#8217;Envoy of rejoicing in which the bonfire upon old <ref type="m" target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref> is not to be
                  forgotten.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Though no formal envoy was included in the published poem, the Skiddaw bonfire
                  that Southey organised on 21 August 1815, to celebrate the victory at Waterloo on 18 June 1815, is described in <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book 4, &#8216;The Hopes of Man&#8217;, stanzas 26&#8211;28.</note> I have got on <del>26</del>
               {32} stanzas at the last canto, &amp; heartily glad shall I be to see the end.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The plan is now before you, &#8211; it is precisely the outline which I formed when my determination of writing upon the

               time which it has cost. The subject certainly would never have occurred to me as one of choice. However I am not out of humour with it

                  Kincardine (1766&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>) had removed in 1801&#8211;1803, and then brought to Britain, marble sculptures from the
                  Parthenon in Athens. Finding himself in debt, he sought to sell them to the British Museum. Considerable controversy ensued about
                  their worth, artistic and monetary, and a parliamentary committee decided in 1816 that they should be purchased for &#163;35,000. The
                  controversy was compounded when the <title>Edinburgh Review</title> (25 (October 1815), 285&#8211;310) published accusations that Elgin
                  had, when Ambassador Extraordinary in Constantinople in 1799&#8211;1803, appropriated the papers (and valuable artefacts) of the
                  classicist John Tweddell (1769&#8211;1799; <title>DNB</title>), after his death in Athens. The accusations were criticised in the
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 14 (October 1815), 257&#8211;273. In 1816, Elgin was defended by his chaplain in Constantinople, Dr
                  Philip Hunt (1772&#8211;1838), who published a <title>Narrative of What is Known Respecting the Literary Remains of the Late John

                  College of Arms. The holder of the office at this time was Joseph Hawker (c. 1766&#8211;1846), Richmond Herald 1803&#8211;1838, Norroy King of
                  Arms 1838&#8211;1839, Clarenceux Kings of Arms 1839&#8211;1846. His day job was as a Clerk in the Bank of England 1792&#8211;1834 and this may be how
                  he encountered Grosvenor Bedford.</note> for your enquiries, which promise to be of some service. I stand in special need of a
               supporter to keep company with the British Lion.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 2 May 1816. Prince Leopold of
                  Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) married Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent. The
                  Prince&#8217;s arms are described in the epithalamion Southey wrote for the wedding, <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen
                     Nuptiale</title> (1816), &#8216;The Dream&#8217;, stanzas 19&#8211;21. Southey was particularly concerned about the Prince&#8217;s arms because he wanted
                  to reuse sections of the poem he had initially drafted in 1814 for the Princess&#8217;s engagement to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange
                  (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). The sections in question included stanzas in which Princess Charlotte appeared with
                  the lion who is one of the supporters of the British Royal Coat of Arms and Prince William with the lion who is a supporter of the
                  Netherlands Coat of Arms. Comparing the published text with this draft in Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, Box B/414, shows that
                  Southey was fortunately able to change Prince William&#8217;s &#8216;Belgic&#8217; lion into Prince Leopold&#8217;s &#8216;Saxon&#8217; lion, as the lion was also a
                  supporter on the coat of arms of the House of Saxe-Coburg.</note>
