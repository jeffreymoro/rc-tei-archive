                Longman</ref>; &#8211; if they are willing to publish the book<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Landor&#8217;s <title>Idyllia Nova Quinque Heroum
                     atque Heroidum</title> (1815). He was dissatisfied with the edition produced by
                  Joseph Munday (c. 1773&#8211;1844). Longmans, however, did not publish the book.</note>
               (&amp; I can see no reason why they should not) you will most probably receive an
               answer from themselves.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had a letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">your brother</ref> three
               days ago, &#8211; he is more out of humour with the Ambrosian Library,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Biblioteca Ambrosiana, the main library in
                  Milan, opened in 1609. Southey had visited on 14 June 1817 on his continental
                  tour.</note> &#8211; or rather {with} the Librarians than I was; &#8211; perhaps this may be

                  Becker (1770&#8211;1843), German classical scholar. He had complained to Landor about
                  the difficulty of using the Biblioteca Ambrosiana&#8217;s collections and that the
                  library even lacked a catalogue.</note> who complained to him of his treatment
               there was a German, &amp; therefore less likely to be treated with attention at Milan
               than an Englishman would be. &#8211; It would not surprize me if the amusements of Como
               were to be brought forward ere long for public discussion, &#8211; &amp; the Scudiere the
               Knight &amp; the assassin to enjoy their deserved celebrity in this enlightened
                  country,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Landor had given Southey a
                  rather confused account of the scandal concerning another expatriate resident of
                  Como, the estranged wife of the Prince Regent, Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenb&#252;ttel
                  (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), detailing the insolent behaviour of Bartolomeo
                  Pergami (1783/4&#8211;1842), her major domo, whom Caroline claimed had been made a
                  Knight of the Order of Jerusalem in 1816 and with whom she was rumoured to be
                  having an affair. The Princess&#8217;s behaviour was the subject of much gossip and in
                  1820 the government unsuccessfully introduced a Bill of Pains and Penalties to
                  dissolve her marriage.</note> &amp; become as popular as Buonaparte &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HoneWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hone</ref>!<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the

                  after three trials held 18&#8211;20 December 1817. Southey coupled these two men with
                  Princess Caroline as heroes of the radical opponents of the government.</note>
