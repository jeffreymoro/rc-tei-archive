        <p rend="indent1"> I have two things to say to you, which would be reason enough for
               beginning a letter, even if I were not rather disposed at this time to pen-gossip
               with your worship than to go on working.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> First then, an accident (which tho it would not require much time to
               tell it, would yet take up rather too much to be told just now) induces me to resume
               my Inscriptions.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Inscriptions
                  Triumphal and Sepulchral Recording the Acts of the British Army in Spain and
                  Portugal&#8217;. He had planned thirty of these poems, but only sixteen were completed
                  in 1814&#8211;1815. They were not published together until they appeared (with two later
                  compositions) in <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), III,
                  pp. 122&#8211;156.</note> You I believe did not much like what you saw of them, &#8211; but I
               am persuaded that as pieces of composition they will more compleatly <del>show</del>
               exhibit my skill as an <hi rend="ital">artist</hi> than any other of my poems.
               Charles Taylor whom I remember at Westminster was killed at Vimeiro.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">On 21 August 1808 British forces defeated a French
                  army at Vimeiro, Portugal. Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Taylor (1772&#8211;1808) was
                  killed leading a charge of the 20th Light Dragoons. He was the son of John Taylor
                  (c. 1742&#8211;1825), a well-known physician in Reading. Southey did not complete this
                  epitaph. Southey mentioned Taylor&#8217;s death in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                     1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 363, and <title>History of the Peninsular
                  War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 558&#8211;559.</note> I knew nothing of
               him &amp; never exchanged a word with him, &#8211; but he is the only Westminster man who
               comes in my way, &amp; for that reason has a {sort of} double claim to <del>be in
                  t</del> a place in the series. He was a Reading man, &#8211; you have friends at
               Reading, &#8211; can you by their means learn what his services had been, &#8211; the Sepulchral
               inscriptions are of course epitaphs, &#8211; &amp; the epitaph should be a brief notice of
               all in a mans life which is worth noticing on his monument. &#8211; My intention is not to
               be in any hurry with these poems, but to correct them at leisure, as severely as
               possible, &amp; print them after the history<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> is
               published, as an accompaniment in the same form.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Secondly. I learn from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref>
               that his brother<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Westall
                  (1765&#8211;1836; <title>DNB</title>), William&#8217;s elder brother and mentor, a popular
                  artist whose drawings would illustrate Southey&#8217;s <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title>
                  (1825).</note> has a great desire to make drawings from my operas, more especially
               from Thalaba.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall did not publish
                  illustrations of Southey&#8217;s <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801). </note>
               However much I might like this, my liking can be of no avail, and the matter of
               course must rest between him &amp; the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longi
               Homines</ref>, who I suspect will be like deaf adders. They will object that
               the poems are not new, &amp; have no great sale. And perhaps the size in which they
               are printed would be a serious objection to the artist. What the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longi Homines</ref> should do, if they listened to him, should
               be to print an edition of my poetical works collectively in octavo, with the prints

               This would never interfere with the sale of the costlier form, &amp; would get into
               circulation when even the <del>xxxx</del> current editions cannot. But the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longi Homines</ref> do not understand their own trade.

        <p rend="indent1"> Yet between ourselves I cannot help suspecting something very like a
               trick about the sale of <ref type="m" target="people.html#MooreThomas">Moores</ref> poem, &amp; the
               suspicion is not a comfortable one. A sixth edition of Lalla Rookh<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Moore, <title>Lalla Rookh</title> (1817).
                  It was published by Longman, the sixth edition appearing in 1817. The fourth
                  edition of <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> appeared in 1816 and the
                  fifth in 1818. Longmans were convinced <title>Lalla Rookh</title> would be a great
                  success, paying Moore &#163;3,000 before it was even completed; whereas Southey earned
                  little more than &#163;700 from the sales of <title>Roderick</title>. But Longman&#8217;s
                  judgement was correct; <title>Lalla Rookh</title> sold 9,000 copies in the six
                  editions published in 1817, despite Southey&#8217;s scepticism about its sales.</note>
               is advertised in the course of eight months, Roderick in three years is only on the
               fourth. Now I am perfectly certain it is no feeling of vanity (&amp; you know how I
               feel upon such subjects well enough to believe me) which makes me think there cannot
               possibly have been this difference in the sale. How then do I explain the fact? By an
               apprehension that there is a <hi rend="ital">ruse de guerre</hi> in it, &#8211; a stratagem
               of that war which bookseller carries on against another: &#8211; that if I were to ask as
               large a sum for a poem as <ref type="m" target="people.html#MooreThomas">Moore</ref> has obtained,
               they might reply to me there <del>xxx</del> is not the same sale to be expected, &#8211;

               500 or possibly a smaller number (for Lalla Rookh cannot by possibility have had such
               a sale as is pretended) to his poems, &#8211; while the first edition of Roderick was 500
               only at a time; but the second 1500, the third 2000 &amp; the fourth 2000.</p>
