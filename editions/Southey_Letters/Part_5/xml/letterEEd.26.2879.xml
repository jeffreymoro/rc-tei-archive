          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Without preface or apology, let me tell my story. Some little time
               ago I received a letter requesting me to peruse a manuscript poem, &amp; allow <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">the writer</ref> to dedicate it to me, if I
               thought it worthy of publication,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Three
                  Tabernacles&#8217;. Knowles was hoping to publish it and had written to Southey asking
                  permission to dedicate it to him. Following Knowles&#8217;s early death, Southey himself
                  published the poem as &#8216;Lines Written in the Churchyard of Richmond, Yorkshire&#8217; in
                  his article &#8216;Cemeteries and Catacombs of Paris&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>,
                  21 (April 1819), 359&#8211;398 (396&#8211;398).</note> &#8211; the writer stated himself to be very
               young, &amp; that his reason for publishing was necessity. &#8211; I received the poem, it
               was brimfull of genius, with more of <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> in it
               than of any other writer, &#8211; but no more than showed a proper &amp; discriminating
               sense of <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</ref> powers. It was crude, exuberant,
               &amp; ill-planned, &#8211; had it not been so I should have thought it far less hopeful.
               Enquiring into the circumstances of the author I find that his name is <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert Knowles</ref>, that he is an orphan, taken from a very low
               situation &amp; placed at an excellent school at Richmond in Yorkshire<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Richmond School, which had been transformed into a
                  powerhouse for classical education by its reforming headmaster James Tate.</note>
               by the contributions of some persons who had discovered his uncommon talents, the
               Dean of Canterbury<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Gerrard Andrewes
                  (1750&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), Dean of Canterbury 1809&#8211;1825.</note> giving ten
               pounds a year, two other clergymen<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> five pounds each; his relations had promised among them
               thirty more, &amp; it was intended when he was fit for college to place him upon this
               allowance as a sizar at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Johns.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">St John&#8217;s College, Cambridge. A sizar was a student in receipt
                  of benefits such as free meals or reduced fees, in return for performing set
                  tasks.</note> These times have pressed heavily upon his relations, &amp; they
               could not fulfil their promise; so that his hopes were struck down at once, &amp; he
               was advised to go as usher to some school. In abhorrence of such a situation he
               thought of authorship. Of course I pointed out the impracticability of this scheme. I
               wrote to <ref type="m" target="people.html#TateJames">his Master</ref>,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to [James] Tate, 3 November 1816, Letter 2858.
               </note> &amp; obtained the highest possible character of the youth, in every respect:
               my next thought was how to supply the thirty pounds annually for the next four years,
               &#8211; <del>as</del> it will be one year before he is ready for Cambridge. Ten I will give
               myself, I think you will not be displeased with me for having thought of you. And if
               <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> had been in England I would have asked
               you to apply to him &#8211; amid all that storm &amp; tumult of unhappy passions &amp; more
               unhappy opinions there must be good &amp; generous feelings, &#8211; it is wholesome for
               him that they should be exercised, &amp; proud as he is it might gratify him to have
               them acknowledged &amp; appealed to by one who condemns &amp; pities him as I do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Sure I am that Poets can best appreciate each others merits, &#8211; &amp;
               in looking for friends for this unfledged Eagle (indeed I think he is of Eagle breed)
               &#8211; of whom could I think more properly than you? Among all the pleasures of
                  Memory<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey plays on the title of
                  Rogers&#8217;s best-selling poem <title>The Pleasures of Memory</title>, first published
                  anonymously in 1792.</note> there is none so lasting as that of the good which we
               have done.</p>
