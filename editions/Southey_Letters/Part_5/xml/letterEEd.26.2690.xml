        <p rend="indent2">Those verses will do for the fiddlers if they are wanted for
                  them,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had sent Grosvenor Bedford
                  on 25 December 1815 three draft stanzas for Sir William Parsons to set to music
                  and, if necessary, perform at Court as the monarch&#8217;s &#8216;New Year&#8217;s Ode&#8217; for 1816,
                     <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2688.
                  This was a duty of the Poet Laureate, but one which Southey suspected had become
                  futile, as no Laureate odes had been performed at Court since 1810.</note> whether
               they will do for the Hymn of Victory with which I purpose at present to conclude my
               poem, I do not as yet know, &#8211; in that case they will stand for the beginning
                  only.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey also hoped that his &#8216;New
                  Year&#8217;s Ode&#8217; for 1816 might form part of the projected &#8216;Hymn of Victory&#8217; with which
                  he hoped to conclude <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816). The
                  published poem ultimately omitted the &#8216;Hymn of Victory&#8217; and concluded with the
                  &#8216;Hopes of Man&#8217;.</note> The first stanza has the accidental merit of being very
               well adapted for music, &#8211; so the <ref type="m" target="people.html#BarkerMary">Senhora</ref> says who understands these things.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> When the first stanza of these verses was published as
                  &#8216;Thanksgiving for Victory&#8217; in Southey&#8217;s <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols
                  (London 1837&#8211;1838), II, p. 248, he, unusually, drew attention to the fact that
                  they were &#8216;Written for Music&#8217;.</note> Your objection to the word sometimes as
               being twice used would occur to nobody who was not unlucky enough to have some
               burlesque verses in his head.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Sometimes&#8217; was
                  retained in lines 7 and 11 of &#8216;Thanksgiving for Victory&#8217;. The final two stanzas
                  have not survived.</note> For Almighty One read Almightiness, &amp; praise instead
               of joy thro the second stanza till you come to the last five lines where the original
               word must remain. &#8211; Walk the earth is not the best expression (very very far the
               best) but you will find the word <hi rend="ital">live</hi> immediately before it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Quoad title, if you like &#8220;A Pilgrimage to La Belle Alliance&#8221;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey strongly objected to referring to the
                  battle on 18 June 1815 as &#8216;Waterloo&#8217;, as Wellington wished, and preferred to name
                  it &#8216;La Belle Alliance&#8217;, the designation favoured by the Prussian commander,
                  Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher (1742&#8211;1819).</note> better, I am willing enough to
               alter it to your liking, &#8211; such things being so entirely indifferent to me, that it
               is reason enough for alteration, if any person wishes it. For a verse writer to call
               himself the Poet, is nothing more than for a prose writer to call himself the author
               or the writer, &#8211; as is constantly done. Pilgrimage it must be; &#8211; the word journey
               would never do, &#8211; a journey to such a spot is in the nature of a pilgrimage
               sufficiently to justify the expression, &amp; moreover the poem has a slight
                  Spenserian<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the manner of Edmund Spenser
                  (1552&#8211;1599; <title>DNB</title>), a poet Southey greatly admired.</note> tinge of
               language in keeping with it. I believe the arrangement will be improved by placing
               what I had written for the introduction elsewhere, &#8211; &amp; substituting as a Proem
               the first part of what you saw, as having been designed for the marriage of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WalesCharlottePrincess">the Princess</ref>.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had written, in March&#8211;June 1814, fifty
                  stanzas celebrating the engagement of Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince
                  Regent, to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (1792&#8211;1849; King of the
                  Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). He had to abandon the poem when the engagement was broken
                  off, but he was able to reuse most of it, not in <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage</title> but in his <title>Lay of the Laureate</title>. <title>Carmen
                     Nuptiale</title> (1816), which celebrated Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Prince
                  Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) on 2
                  May 1816.</note> Between six &amp; seven hundred lines are written; &#8211; I shall not
               make a transcript till the whole is done, then it shall pass thro you to the
               printer.</p>
