                  affliction;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The death of Southey&#8217;s son,
                     <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>, on 17
                  April 1816.</note> there is but one source of consolation, and of that source
            I have drunk largely. When you shall see how I had spoken of my happiness but a few
            weeks ago, you will read with tears of sorrow what I wrote with tears of joy. And little
            did I think how soon and how literally another part of this mournful poem was to be
            fulfilled, when I said in it &#8211; </p>
        <lg type="stanza">
          <l rend="indent3"> &#8216;To earth I should have sunk in my despair, </l>
          <l rend="indent3"> Had I not claspt the Cross, and been supported there.&#8217;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A slight misquotation from Southey&#8217;s <title>The
                        Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part Two, Book 3, &#8216;The Sacred
                     Mountain&#8217;, stanza 43, lines 5&#8211;6.</note>
          </l>
        </lg>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank God for the strength with which we have borne this trial. It
               is not possible for woman to have acted with more fortitude than <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has done through the whole
               sharp suffering; she has rather set an example than followed it. My bodily frame is
               much shaken. A little time and care will recruit it, and the mind is sound. I am
               fully sensible of the blessings which are left me, which far exceed those of most
               men. I pray for continued life that I may fulfil my duties towards those whom I love.
               I employ myself, and I look forward to the end with faith and with hope, as one whose
               treasure is laid up in Heaven; and where the treasure is, there will the heart be
               also.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At present it would rather do me hurt than good to see you. I am
               perfectly calm and in full self-possession; but I know my own weakness as well as my
               strength, and the wholesomest regimen for a mind like mine, is assiduous application
               to pursuits which call forth enough of its powers to occupy without exhausting it. It
               is well for me that I can do this. I take regular exercise and am very careful of
               myself. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Many will feel for me, but none can tell what I have lost: the head
               and flower of my earthly happiness is cut off. But I am <hi rend="ital">not</hi>
               unhappy.</p>
