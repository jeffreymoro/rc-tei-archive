          <salute> My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I duly received your letter from Milan, &amp; by the following post
                  Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hoares<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">C. Hoare
                  &amp; Co., Peachy&#8217;s bankers.</note> remitted to me 70 &#163;, of which Clarke<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Clark (dates unknown), a Keswick
                  nurseryman, who rented some of the land around Greta Hall. He was in severe
                  financial difficulties and was made bankrupt in March 1817. He was undertaking
                  work for Peachy in connection to his property Derwentwater Island.</note> has
               received 50 &#163;, being what he thought sufficient. I did not tell him what sum was in
               my hands, &#8211; but said he might have what he wanted; &#8211; I fear he is very much
               embarrassed, &#8211; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Smail<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mrs Smail (dates unknown), unidentified beyond the information Southey provides
                  here.</note> (that I think is your house keepers name) could get of him only a few
               shillings at a time, &amp; when we saw her last, which was after he had received the
               money, she had obtained but a small part of what was due to her. She was desired to
               say that if he had {not} money in his hand he might have more by applying to me for
               it, &#8211; this I thought better than paying her at once (which I would otherwise have
               done,) &#8211; because that would have been interfering with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clarke
               &amp; might have hurt him. This was some week or ten days ago, &amp; we have not seen
               her since, &#8211; so she has probably been paid. &#8211; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clarke was
               informed yesterday of my intention of writing by this days post, &#8211; last night it blew
               a tremendous gale, &amp; he came up this morning with the welcome assurance that no
               injury had been done on the island; &#8211; &amp; this was all he had to say. I have not
               been on the island this year, &amp; indeed but once upon the Lake, &#8211; so little
                  <del>favour</del> did the weather tempt us to such excursions. &#8211; No change has
               taken place in this neighbourhood since you left England: when you hear that we have
               had a plentiful crop of summer visitors, &amp; a scanty one of every thing else, you
               have the history of <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> for the
               last six months.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You my dear Sir will have much to tell us when we meet, &#8211; not indeed
               of the Anthropophagi &amp; men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Othello</title>, Act 1, scene 3, lines
                  144&#8211;145.</note>, but of countries where all institutions have been put out of
               joint; all orders jostled by others, &amp; public &amp; private happiness destroyed
               during a whole generation. And the first news which you will find on your arrival is
               that a tolerably bold attempt has been made to confer upon us all those blessings at
               home, &amp; that the tricolor flag has been hoisted in London.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A political rally held at Spa Fields, London, on 2
                  December 1816 had been used by a small group of revolutionaries to try to try to
                  storm the Bank of England and the Tower of London. A horizontal tricolour flag of
                  red, white and green, an adaptation of the French revolutionary tricolour, was
                  displayed at Spa Fields and much commented upon.</note> By good fortune there was
               such consummate folly on the part of the incendiaries, that there was no serious
               danger; &amp; if Government take advantage of this overt act to suppress seditious
               meetings, &amp; make transportation the punishment for seditious libel, &#8211; there will
               be great reason to rejoice that the crisis has been thus accelerated. If they do not
               act thus, instead of proving critical, it will be only a symptom of a more general
               &amp; violent eruption. It is more than four years since I distinctly pointed out the
               danger in the Quarterly Review (N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 16) &#8211; &amp; in the Edinburgh
               Register, &#8211; &amp; I have touched more than once upon the same momentous topic during
               your absence.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Inquiry into the Poor Laws&#8217;,

                  warned of the dangers of revolution, especially from the radical press (341&#8211;343);

               aggravate it. No folly was ever greater than the cry for retrenchment. The main evil
               arises directly from an enormous diminution of public expenditure, a customer of 50
               millions having <del>been taken</del> suddenly left the market.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Here Southey returns to his argument in &#8216;Works on

               Can stupidity go farther than to recommend <hi rend="ital">spending less</hi> as the
               remedy! &#8211; One striking instance of this oeconomy occurs to me &#8211; the ministry were
               obliged to reduce the military establishment by discharging 10,000 men whom they
               wished to have kept in arms. What is the consequence? there was already a want of
               employment for the numerous hands whom peace inevitably threw out of work, &amp; here
               were ten thousand men <del>mor</del> sent to <del>a in</del> increase the number
                  <del>of those a</del> so instead of paying them <del>for</del> as soldiers you
               must support them as paupers, &#8211; &amp; you have them in the mob instead of in the
               ranks. The country is in a very critical state, &#8211; &amp; yet I think there are bright
               prospects before us. My mind is full of this subject. &#8211;</p>
