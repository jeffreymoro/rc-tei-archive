        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your letter.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Rickman&#8217;s letter to Southey, 29 October 1817; see
                  Orlo Williams, <title>Lamb&#8217;s Friend the Census Taker. Life and Letters of John Rickman</title> (Boston and New York, 1912), pp.
                  196&#8211;197. The main subject was the Poor Laws.</note> You have I think made me clearly comprehend the subject; (one of those, as you
               must needs know, not very congenial to my mind) &#8211; its importance is self-evident, &#8211; &amp; I hope I shall be able to place the matter in
               a clear point of view, &amp; play the battery with effect.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was working towards the
                  articles &#8216;On the Poor Laws&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (January 1818), 259&#8211;308, and &#8216;On the Means of Improving the

                     <title>Considerations on the Poor Laws</title> (1817).</note> I just looked at his plan, which he himself would acknowledge to be
               much inferior to yours if he saw them compared; &#8211; &amp; I sufferd <ref type="m" target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  Bell</ref> to take it in his pocket last night to his lodgings. Davison however is a good ally. &#8211; The beginning is always the most
               difficult part of any composition with me, &#8211; I must beat about for one without delay, &amp; when that is accomplished the work will go
               on smoothly &amp; steadily.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am holding my course as steadily as an East India-man in the track of the trade winds; &amp; God willing shall make
               great way during the winter.</p>

               my thanks in course.</p>

               next I write.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly <title>First Establishment under the Auspices of the Ladies&#8217;
                     Association</title> (1817).</note> The scheme is well meant, &amp; well patronized, but likely (I think) to fall to pieces for

                  provided a home for impoverished gentlewomen.</note> will readily answer.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have been a friend in deed (as the proverb has it) to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LovellRobertJr">R
                  Lovell</ref>. The lad has a right spirit, &amp; will do well, &#8211; the better for his difficulties. I do not doubt of his success in
               life, &amp; when the time comes will do my utmost to promote it. The prospect is very different where there is neither the same spirit
               nor the same steadiness, but a pride of the wrong sort instead, &amp; that too in close alliance with inordinate vanity.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a reference to Lovell&#8217;s cousin, Hartley Coleridge.</note> You will understand me. In this case
               I can do nothing &#8211; &amp; can neither look on with comfort, nor forward with hope.</p>
