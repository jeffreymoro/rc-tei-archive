               length by about 2&#190;; of this size therefore the view of Waterloo Church should be,

               view.) &#8211; I give up Ligny, because it is better to confine the illustrations to the

                  Church at Waterloo, the farmhouse Chateau d&#8217;Hougoumont (the site of fierce
                  fighting), and the Battle of Ligny on 16 June 1815 (two days before the Battle of
                  Waterloo). Waterloo Church appeared as the frontispiece to <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (London, 1816), Hougoumont between pp. 58&#8211;59,
                  pp. 68&#8211;69 and pp. 70&#8211;71, and Ligny between pp. 90&#8211;91. Ligny was not a &#8216;British&#8217;
                  subject because it was a battle between French and Prussian forces.</note> There
               remain as points of great historical interest &amp; no beauty whatever La Haye

                  Hougoumont&#8217;, between pp. 58&#8211;59, which was taken from one by Charles Bell

               Vignettes are out of the question unless they were affixed to each canto, &amp; the
               subject of the different cantos will not allow of this. I think they must be given in
               the same size as the others, but in a slighter manner, &#8211; etching, or mere outline, &#8211;
               the others being well engraved.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The sooner they are in hand the better. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> left me this morning, &#8211; I

               stand still with me unless I am alone, or feel as if I were so. Now I go on again.
               There will be six cantos. The Journey, Brussels, the Field of Battle, Belgium, The
               Vision &#8211; &amp; the Return, besides these an ode or Song of Victory if I can make one,
               &#8211; but the sample which you have seen is not very encouraging. I am disposed to let
               the Proem stay where it is, &amp; reserve it for its original destination, if that
               should ever be accomplished.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The published
                  poem featured a &#8216;Proem&#8217;, and two Parts, each containing subsections. Part One,
                  &#8216;The Journey&#8217;, contained &#8216;Flanders&#8217; &#8216;Brussels&#8217;, &#8216;The Field of Battle&#8217; and &#8216;The
                  Scene of War&#8217;; Part Two, &#8216;The Vision&#8217;, contained &#8216;The Tower&#8217;, &#8216;The Evil Prophet&#8217;,
                  &#8216;The Sacred Mountain&#8217; and &#8216;The Hopes of Man&#8217;. It did not include a &#8216;Hymn of
                  Victory&#8217;, of which Bedford had seen three stanzas, which Southey had submitted as
                  the Poet Laureate&#8217;s &#8216;New Year&#8217;s Ode&#8217; for 1816. &#8216;The Return&#8217; became the &#8216;Proem&#8217; to
                  the poem and Southey abandoned his intention to reuse the fifty stanzas he had
                  written, in March&#8211;June 1814 to celebrate the engagement of Princess Charlotte,
                  only child of the Prince Regent, to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange
                  (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). He had to abandon the poem when
                  the engagement was broken off, but he was able to reuse most of it, not in
                     <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage</title> but in his <title>Lay of the
                     Laureate</title>. <title>Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816), which celebrated
                  Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of
                  the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) on 2 May 1816.</note> About 100 lines of the fifth canto

            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816) featured 35 pages of
                  notes; they did not include gibes at Francis Jeffrey, as the notes to
