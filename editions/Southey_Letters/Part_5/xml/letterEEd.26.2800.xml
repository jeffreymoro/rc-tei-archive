        <p rend="indent1"> There is one advantage to set against the many inconveniences of
               living in these uttermost parts of the North, &#8211; it is that in going to or from London
               any part of the intermediate country whether East or West may be made in the road
               without going much out of the nearest line. There are three stage coach lines nearly
               of equal length. That by Stamford, Newark, Doncaster &amp; Greta Bridge to Penrith,
               this is the road which the Mail takes from London to Carlisle &amp; Glasgow, but I
               think it would afford you fewer opportunities of getting on by short stages than
               either of the others. The Western road is generally taken by those who do not prefer
               mail coach travelling; &#8211; this is by Oxford &amp; Birmingham, either to Manchester or
               Liverpool, &amp; thence to Lancaster &amp; Kendal. The third road is by way of Leeds,
               from whence there is a daily stage to Kendal. Kendal is thirty miles from this place,
               &amp; a coach runs every day from thence thro <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> to Whitehaven. Penrith is 18 miles from
               us, &amp; a coach (likewise to Whitehaven) runs thro this little town three times a
               week.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The first consideration must be whether you have any friends upon
               either of these roads, &#8211; the second what places would be the pleasantest to halt at.
               But in case you should take the Birmingham &amp; Liverpool road, &amp; wish to rest a
               day at those places I will frank up letters of introduction to both. It is very
               unpleasant to be landed in a large city without any acquaintance in it, especially as
               there are no <hi rend="ital">Commissionaires</hi> in England. &#8211; The Birmingham letter
               is to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lloyd</ref>, the banker, &#8211; a
               Quaker &amp; a very remarkable man, &#8211; who in his old age has amused himself by

               home, enquire for his partner M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> James,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">James Lloyd (1776&#8211;1853), the second son of Charles Lloyd
                  Senior. In the 1790s he had tried his hand at military life and as a farmer. By
                  1801 he had joined the family bank and was made a partner in 1802. He eventually
                  rose to the rank of senior partner.</note> &amp; desire him to open the letter; &#8211;
               either of them will, I am sure, be most happy to show you any attention in their
               power. The Liverpool letter is to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Martin<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Martin (1769&#8211;1850) the Liverpool merchant
                  and Secretary of the Liverpool Royal Institution. Southey had first met him in
                  1798 when he was a Unitarian Minister in Great Yarmouth; in 1804 he married
                  Frances Julia Smith (1776&#8211;1854) and Southey had known the couple since his visit
                  to Liverpool in 1808.</note> whose wife is the sister of <del>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smith the Bot</del> Sir James (or Sir Edward) Smith<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir James Edward Smith (1759&#8211;1828;

                  (1788). He was knighted in 1814. He was a friend of William Taylor.</note> the
               Botanist, &#8211; he is so lately knighted that I am not sure about his christian name. &#8211; I
               believe I have directed to the right street, &#8211; but the firm of the house is either
               Martin, Hope &amp; Co or Hope &amp; Martin. &#8211; &amp; the Directory which you will find
               at the inns will put you right. The letters are mere letters of introduction, to be
