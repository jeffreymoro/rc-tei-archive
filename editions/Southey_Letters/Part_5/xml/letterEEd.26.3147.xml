        <p rend="indent1"> Do you know any thing of a D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> William May, who has introduced himself here as being well known to
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey</ref>, &amp; having the honour to be a member
               of the same College?<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William May (1763&#8211;1827) from East Looe, Cornwall, who received a medical
                  qualification in Leyden in 1787 and became an Extra&#8211;Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1788 (Henry Herbert Southey
                  became a Licentiate in 1812). He practiced in Truro and Plymouth and published an <title>Essay on Pulmonary Consumption</title>
                  (Plymouth, 1792). Henry Herbert Southey&#8217;s <title>Observations on Pulmonary Consumption</title> had appeared in 1814.</note> From
               more circumstances than one I am led to suspect that there is <hi rend="ital">something the matter</hi> with this well-bronzed M.D. He
               professes to be writing a book upon consumption, for which he prescribes high living &amp; <del>xxx</del> half killed one poor girl by
               giving her 70 drops of laudanum in the course of a day. I believe he is trying to establish himself somewhere in this country, &amp;
               his coming upon such a scheme without any introduction whatever, looks very much as if there were some reasons why he could not procure
               any.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We like the carpet well. Yesterday there came a present from the <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">Imperial Guard</ref>, a lamp intended I suppose for me to write by, &#8211; with one of those ground-glass half globes to soften the
               light. A handsome thing, &#8211; but troublesome. My writings are not likely to smell of it: if they smell of any thing, it will be of a
               tallow candle.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am tormented with my summer catarrh. The best remedy for it would probably be the warm bath at its commencement, but
               the sun does not heat Derwentwater sufficiently for it to serve that purpose, &#8211; however it is an admirable tepid bath at this time,
               &amp; I have enjoyed it accordingly. Our weather for the last month has been the finest possible, but visitors never will come to the
               Lakes early enough in the year.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Today I have a letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> in style Edwardic. He is
               strolling <del>xx</del> in Cornwall, &amp; wants a humble engagement at <del>xxx</del> Drury Lane,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">That is, Edward, a strolling player, hoped that Southey would get him a place in the company of actors at the Theatre
                  Royal, Drury Lane &#8211; London&#8217;s premier company. The Theatre was overseen by a Board of Directors, and a sub&#8211;committee that managed its
                  affairs. Several important literary figures were members of the sub&#8211;committee (including, briefly, Byron), but Southey was not one
                  of them. By 1818 the Theatre was in severe financial difficulties and owed over &#163;80,000.</note> supposing that I have some interest
               with the Committee, &amp; not knowing that Drury Lane is in a state of dissolution.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Both the Press &amp; I are getting on straitly with Brazil &#8211; a third of the volume is printed, &amp; as much more in
                  forwardness.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> Before I see you
               in the winter I shall have brought forth this &amp; the Life of Wesley<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Life of
                     Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism </title>(1820).</note> of which five sheets are printed &amp; the printer has
               about ten more in his hands, including what <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</ref> has probably by this
               time left with you for <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">G.C.B.</ref> &#8211; It will be some interruption if I go
               into Scotland this year, this depends upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> motions of which I shall soon
               be informed.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Scottish tour with Rickman was delayed until August&#8211;September 1819.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I live in daily hope of the deliverance of All the Saints from Limbo, &#8211; from whence they will most properly pass to
               Pater Noster.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">That is, to the delivery to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref>, in Paternoster Row, London, of the 53&#8211;volume set of lives of the saints, <title>Acta Sanctorum</title>
                  (1643&#8211;1794), that Southey had bought in Brussels in 1817. They became no. 207 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note>
               What an arrival it will be when they reach their ultimate destination, &#8211; ultimate as far as concerns me I hope, &#8211; for then there must
               be many changes &amp; removals in store. With proper care there is no reason why a book should not last as the world itself is
               habitable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Is there any chance of seeing <ref type="m" target="people.html#GonneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Gonne</ref> at the
