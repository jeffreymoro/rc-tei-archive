               till this day.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I know nothing of Quintanas present condition, &#8211; for I have
                  <del>not</del> had no communication with Spain since my poor correspondent <ref type="m" target="people.html#AbellaManuel">Abella</ref> was disgraced &amp;
               banished from Court, in one of those capricious changes of favourite which have
               repeatedly taken place since Ferdinands return.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Spanish poet and man of letters Manuel Jos&#233; Quintana
                  (1772&#8211;1857) had written patriotic odes and proclamations during the French
                  occupation, but from 1814&#8211;1820 was imprisoned by Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of
                  Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833).</note> One of the last books which issued from the Spanish
               press while it was free, &#8211; or rather while it <del>xxx</del> was {under} the tyranny
               of the Cortes instead of the crown was a collection of Quintanas poems, &#8211; with a
               preface in which he expresses an ominous apprehension of the coming change.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Manuel Jos&#233; Quintana, <title>Poes&#237;as</title>
                  (Madrid, 1813); his prefatory comments ran from pp. i-vi. The volume was no. 3463
                  in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will see that <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> has attacked me in the
               House of Commons for having been as erroneous (but <del>more</del> much more sincere)
               in the year 1794 &amp; at the age of 20 <del>than</del> as he is in 1817.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">On 24 February 1817 Brougham, speaking in the
                  House of Commons on the Cabinet&#8217;s Seditious Meetings Bill, had contrasted the
                  prosecution of radical writers with the government&#8217;s refusal to act against
                  Southey for the pirated publication of <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817) the radical
                  play he had written in 1794.</note> To what baseness will men descend when they
               are possessed at the same time by faction &amp; malignity! </p>
