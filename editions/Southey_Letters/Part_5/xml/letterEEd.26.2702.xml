               consequence than the temple of Mecca. He has added very little to our stock of
               knowledge; – the character in which he appears raises expectations which are not

               the cave receiving no other light than what past thro the water. In this cave a woman
               is said to have been for some time concealed. How was it supplied with air fit for
               respiration? There must have been some communication with the atmosphere, &amp;

                  1810 after the local people attacked his ship and killed his crewmates. The
                  manuscript was published by Murray under the editorship of the meteorologist John
                  Martin (1789–1869; <title>DNB</title>), as <title>An Account of the Natives of the

                  the cave was in I, pp. 268–279; and the question of the air supply in the cavern
                  was dealt with at length by Martin on pp. 277–279. Southey reviewed the book in

                  the Parthenon in Athens. Finding himself in debt, he sought to sell them to the
                  British Museum. Considerable controversy ensued about their worth, artistic and
                  monetary, and a parliamentary committee decided in 1816 that they should be
                  purchased for £35,000. The controversy was compounded when the <title>Edinburgh

                  1816), pp. 324–325, describes Southey thus: ‘Poet Laureat. He was born August
                  12,1774, at Bristol, where his father carried on an extensive business as a
                  wholesale linen draper. The son was educated first under Mr. Foote a baptist
                  minister of great ability, but at that time very aged. After a short time young
                  Southey was removed to a school at Carston, where he remained about two years, and
                  was then entered at Westminster School in 1787, where, in 1790, he fell under
                  censure for his concern in the rebellion excited against the master, Dr. Vincent.
                  In 1792 he became a student of Baliol College, Oxford, with a view to the church,
                  but Unitarian principles and the revolutionary mania put an end to that design. So
                  strongly did he imbibe the new opinions on politics which the explosion in France
                  had produced, that he, with his friends Lovell and Coleridge, projected a plan of
                  settling on the banks of the Susquehannah in North America, and of there founding
                  a new republic. This Utopian scheme was soon dissolved for the want of means, and
                  in 1795 Mr. Southey married Miss Tricker, soon after which event he accompanied
                  his maternal uncle the Rev. Mr. Hill to Portugal, that gentleman being appointed
                  Chaplain to the Factory at Lisbon. In 1801 Mr. Southey obtained the appointment of
                  Secretary to the Right Hon. Isaac Corry, Chancellor of the Exchequer for Ireland.
                  On retiring from office with his patron, our author went to reside in a cottage
                  near Keswick, where also dwelt under the same roof the widow of his friend Lovell
                  and the wife of Mr. Coleridge, both which ladies are sisters to Mrs. Southey. In
                  1813 he succeeded Mr. Pye as Poet Laureat, and it must be confessed that, with
                  some slight exceptions, his subsequent performances are such as do credit to the
                  appointment.’</note> But how should such a work be otherwise than inaccurate?</p><closer><salute rend="indent1">Believe me my dear Sir</salute><salute rend="indent2"> Yrs very truly</salute><signed rend="indent3"> R Southey.</signed></closer><postscript><p><address><placeName><ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick.</ref></placeName></address><date when="1816-01-20">20 Jan<hi rend="sup">y</hi> 1816.</date></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
