        <p rend="indent1"> Your papers are in good course, &amp; I am very well pleased to find,
               that where I had been taking the same road, I had not been going wrong, &#8211; for I had
               prepared a large portion of matter, a little of which I am incorporating with yours,
               &amp; the rest will be remodelled into a paper for the next number, &#8220;upon the means
               of improving the people&#8221;.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and
                  Rickman&#8217;s article, &#8216;On the Poor Laws&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18
                  (January 1818), 259&#8211;308. Southey placed the remaining material in &#8216;On the Means of
                  Improving the People&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818),
                  79&#8211;118.</note> These are subjects upon which we must make the QR go as far with us
               as we can, &#8211; because thro that channel we have a sure &amp; favourable audience,
               (12000 are printed at this time.)<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In fact
                  14,000 copies of the <title>Quarterly Review</title> were printed and at least
                  13,000 sold.</note> For bolder matter, there is my old friend Espriella, who may
               say any thing, &#8211; <del>because</del> such is the advantage of speaking sometimes in
                  <del>x</del> a fictitious character, sometimes <hi rend="ital">thro</hi> it. Here
               I <del>can</del> shall be uncontrolled, &amp; I have a plentiful assortment of
               trappings &amp; trifles; &#8211; goose feathers for keen arrows that will fly right to the
                  mark.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey never published a second
                  instalment of the travel narrative of his fictional visitor to Britain,
                     <title>Letters from England: By Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella</title>
                  (1807).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As much of preliminary matter as you please, &#8211; <del>xx</del> research
               here will give weight, showing that the author is master of the historical part of
               his subject. &#8211; You refer to the Report upon the Insolvent Act,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Insolvent Debtors Act of 1813 attempted to reduce the
                  number of debtors languishing in jail by providing means for a compact to be
                  reached with creditors. The Report from the Select Committee on the Insolvent
                  Debtors Act (1816) recommended alterations in its operations. &#8216;On the Poor Laws&#8217;,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (January 1818), 264, condemned the
                  operation of the Act without referring to the Report.</note> &#8211; which I have not
               got. Nor have I any account of the Ely Riots,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Ely, or Littleport, riots, 22&#8211;24 May 1816, over wages and the price of
                  bread. They were mentioned in &#8216;On the Poor Laws&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>,
                  18 (January 1818), 303&#8211;304 and 307, with the injunction, &#8216;The insurrection, if so
                  it may be termed, in the Isle of Ely ought to be held in perpetual remembrance by
                  those who have to legislate in any affairs connected with the situation or
                  feelings of the multitude&#8217; (303).</note> &#8211; but of the place &amp; localities I
               know enough to feel the force of what you say. &#8211; You are perfectly right about the
               sort of temper to be observed, &#8211; this is not a question upon which there can be any
               occasion to invite enmity: &#8211; yet I doubt whether they who ought to provide against
               the certain consequences are in any degree aware of the danger, &amp; think it by no
               means unlikely that what relates to precaution may be expunged; it is however
               something to have it seen, &#8211; for having seen it, they cannot but chew the cud.</p>

                     (1817) for proposals that would deny relief to parents for any children born
