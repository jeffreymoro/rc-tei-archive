            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title>
                  (1814), Book 14, lines 1&#8211;5: &#8216;Count, said Pelayo, Nature hath assigned/ Two
                  sovereign remedies for human grief; -/ Religion, surest, firmest, first and best,/
                  Strength to the weak and to the wound&#233;d balm;/ And strenuous action next&#8217;.
                  Southey's son <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> had died on 17 April.</note> I practise what I preach, &amp;
               have employed <del>x</del> myself with a power of exertion at which I myself wonder;
               &#8211; taking care so to vary my employments as not for any one to possess my mind too
               fully. &#8211; I take regular exercise, &#8211; I take tonics &#8211; I eat, drink &amp; sleep. See if
               this be not doing well. I converse as usual, &#8211; or nearly as usual, &#8211; &amp; can at
               times be chearful, &#8211; but my happiness can never again be what it has been. Many
               blessings do I possess &#8211; but the prime blessing &#8211; the flower of my hopes &#8211; the
               central jewel of the ring &#8211; is gone. &#8211; An early admiration of what is good in the
               Stoical philosophy, &amp; an active &amp; elastic mind have doubtless been great
               means of supporting me, &#8211; but they would have been insufficient without a deeper
               principle &#8211; &amp; I verily believe that were <del>no</del> it not for the
               consolations which religion afford &#8211; consolations which in time will ripen into hope
               &amp; joy, &#8211; I should sink under an affliction, &#8211; which is greater than any man can
               conceive. &#8211; You best can judge what the privation must be, &#8211; &amp; you can but judge
               imperfectly.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Enough of this. I shall soon find a better mode of at once indulging
               &amp; regulating these feelings. Upon this subject I have thoughts in my head which
               will, by Gods blessing, produce good &amp; lasting fruit.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At present one of my daily employments is the Carmen Nuptiale, &#8211;
               which is now nearly compleated. It will extend to about <del>xx</del> 110 stanzas &#8211;
               the same metre as the Pilgrimage,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

               same manner may run to 70 pages &#8211; say three sheets. Its English title The Lay of the
               Laureate, &#8211; which is not only a <hi rend="ital">taking</hi> title for an
               advertisement, &#8211; but a remarkably good one. It is for <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> to determine in what form he will
               print it, &amp; what number of copies &#8211; quarto pamphletts I think are not liked for
               their inconvenient size.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Lay of the

                  as <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo </title>(1816), was a wedding gift
                  celebrating the marriage of Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent,

               presently. It comes too close upon the Pilgrimage &#8211; but &#8211; whatever may be thought of
               it at court &#8211; it will <del>xx</del> do me credit now &amp; hereafter. I am very
               desirous of having compleated it that I may have leisure for what lies nearer my
               heart.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will have a copy for <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, bound exactly like the
                  Court-copy.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The copy of <title>The Lay of
                     the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816), no. 2694 in the sale catalogue of
                  Southey&#8217;s library, was described as &#8216;elegantly bound in morocco, lined with silk,
                  richly tooled, and gilt leaves.&#8217;</note> What would it cost to have both these
               printed upon vellum? &#8211; more I suspect than the fancy <del>x</del> is worth.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Press upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> my earnest desire that the article of which the first portion
               accompanies this note, may appear in the present number.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">In his letters to Bedford of 20 and 22 April 1816 (Letters 2763 and
                  2765), Southey had requested him to ask Gifford to make space in the next issue of
                  the <title>Quarterly Review</title> for a review by him. The review, of a series
                  of memoirs of the French Revolutionary wars, including the royalist rising in La
                  Vend&#233;e, 1793&#8211;1796, appeared in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (April
                  1816), 1&#8211;69. The subject was still fresh because of the further royalist
                  resistance in the area to the restoration of the Napoleonic regime in 1815.</note>
               It is of consequence to me, &#8211; &amp; the subject is in danger of becoming stale if it
               be delayed &#8211; dwell upon this point. It will be as interesting a paper as he has ever
               received from me</p>
