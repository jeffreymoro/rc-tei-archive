        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for offering to correct the press,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Of <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note> &#8211; but I must see the proofs for two reasons, &#8211; first because it is the best
               opportunity for correcting the poem as well as the press, &#8211; &amp; secondly because the pleasure of having a proof sheet is one which I
               cannot afford to forego. There is plenty of time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Three stanzas I have told <ref type="m" target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</ref> to <del>p</del> allot to the
               page. At this allowance there will be not less than 100 pages of text, &amp; I shall rather have to select notes than to rummage for
                  them.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poem was published with notes, two stanzas per page, in a duodecimo volume of
                  232 pages, of which 35 pages were notes.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not object to births &amp; Bertha in succeeding stanzas.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The
                     Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), &#8216;Proem&#8217;, stanza 11, line 1, &#8216;births&#8217; was changed to &#8216;twain&#8217;; and &#8216;Bertha&#8217; retained
                  in stanza 10, line 2. The word before &#8216;births&#8217; was &#8216;younger&#8217;, and &#8216;wonder&#8217; occurred just afterwards, making &#8216;pair&#8217; an inappropriate
                  substitute.</note> Because you do I would substitute pair, were there not a word ending in r just before, &amp; another just after.
               The great art in versifying lies in avoiding faults of this kind which common writers know nothing about.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> has made up a drawing of La Haye Sainte.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> An engraving of La Haye Sainte (a farmhouse that was fiercely contested in the Battle of Waterloo, 18 June 1815)
                  appeared between pp. 62&#8211;63.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am in the last part, being the third part of the vision &#8211; busy with high matter.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The sections Southey was writing grew into Part Two of the poem, consisting of no fewer than four sections, &#8216;The
                  Tower&#8217;, &#8216;The Evil Prophet&#8217;, &#8216;The Sacred Mountain&#8217; and &#8216;The Hopes of Man&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do learn for me this Leopolds arms, &#8211; for I must finish that subject as soon as the present is off my hands. The title
               will be Carmen Nuptiale or The Lay of the Laureate.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 2 May 1816. Prince Leopold of
                  Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) married Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent. The
                  Prince&#8217;s arms are described in the epithalamion Southey wrote for the wedding, <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen
                     Nuptiale</title> (1816), &#8216;The Dream&#8217;, stanzas 19&#8211;21. Southey was particularly concerned about the Prince&#8217;s arms because he wanted
                  to reuse sections of the poem he had initially drafted in 1814 for the Princess&#8217;s engagement to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange
                  (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). Comparing the published text with the draft in Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, Box
                  B/414, shows that Southey was fortunately able to change Prince William&#8217;s &#8216;Belgic&#8217; lion into Prince Leopold&#8217;s &#8216;Saxon&#8217; lion as both
                  the royal houses of the Netherlands and Saxe-Coburg used lions as their supporters.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I trust <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> is out of danger, &#8211; relief in such cases
               being the same <del>xx</del> as cure.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Quoad Jehephary you are right about the conclusion of the second chapter, &amp; I will alter it accordingly. Send the
               first only to the Times &amp; let it take its chance;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s parodic attack on Francis
                  Jeffrey, the &#8216;Book of the Prophet Jehephary&#8217;, was, on the advice of his friends, not published in his lifetime. It appeared in John
