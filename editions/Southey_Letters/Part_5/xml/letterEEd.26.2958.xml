                     married to Harriot Cunliffe (d. 1825), the sister of Wynn&#8217;s wife.</note> has
                  occasioned this change of plan.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey
                     had written two letters which he originally planned to publish in the

                     2943) and Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title> [19 March 1817]
                     (Letter 2946). These two letters were sent to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, on
                     17 and 19 March 1817 (Letters 2944 and 2948), for him to forward to the
                     newspaper. In the event, Wynn&#8217;s absence from home had led to a delay in his
                     receiving the letters. By the time he did so, the public debate had moved on
                     and Southey therefore decided not to publish them in the
                     <title>Courier</title>, but instead to incorporate them into his pamphlet
