        <p rend="indent1"> You may be sure that I should be very glad to follow your advice
               &amp; give myself no trouble about an affair which would give me no concern &#8211; if
               trouble were out of the question.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                  Jacobin drama, <title>Wat Tyler</title>, which he had written in 1794 and sent to
                  James Ridgway (1755&#8211;1838), and Henry Symonds (1741&#8211;1816), radical booksellers, for
                  publication; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12 January 1795], <title>The
                     Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 123. Ridgway and
                  Symonds did not publish it and it remained in manuscript until a pirated
                  publication, designed to embarrass the now anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817.
                  Having taken advice from Rickman, Wynn and Turner, Southey launched a suit in
                  Chancery so as to gain an injunction suppressing the publication, on the grounds
                  that it breached his copyright. </note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> argument <hi rend="ital">is</hi>
               perfectly convincing but if the rascals who publish it find that I take no <hi rend="ital">notice</hi> of the thing, they will in all likelihood compel me to do
               so, by affixing my name to it in the advertisement, as they did in a paragraph in the
               M Chronicle.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Morning
                     Chronicle</title>, 12 February 1817, revealed Southey had written <title>Wat
                     Tyler</title> and drew attention to the contrast between his previous and
                  current opinions.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As to the mischief I agree in the main with <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, &#8211; moreover the law will probably speedily put a stop to the
               circulation of such books with impunity. As to myself I have no objection to
               acknowledging old Uncle Wat,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                  nickname for his play referenced his family connections: his mother&#8217;s mother,
                  Margaret Bradford (1710&#8211;1782) had married firstly William Tyler (1709&#8211;1747), and
                  Southey had no fewer than three uncles with the surname of &#8216;Tyler&#8217;.</note> not
               being fool enough to be ashamed of what I was at the age of 20. <del>or to
                  suppress</del> My enemies might indeed triumph if I were. The boldest policy seems
               to me the best, which it at once to claim it &amp; stop the sale. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has seen Ridgeway who professed to remember
               nothing about it, &#8211; perjury from him therefore is out of the question: &#8211; Symonds is
               dead, &#8211; these rascals succeeded to his business &amp; so I suppose found the MS. of
               course however they might be disposed to swear about it, they have not the
                  opportunity.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;rascals&#8217; were the
                  publishers, William Sherwood (1776&#8211;1837), Samuel Dunbar Neely (dates unknown) and
                  Robert Jones (dates unknown). This firm had succeeded to Symonds&#8217;s business when
                  he retired (Neely had married Symonds&#8217;s daughter), but Sherwood denied they had
                  found the play among Symonds&#8217;s papers.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thinking of Uncle Wat rising up after he had been forgotten for three
               &amp; twenty years! &#8211; It will cost me a journey to Cockermouth tomorrow to make the
                  affidavit.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had to make his
                  affidavit in the presence of a solicitor approved by the Court of Chancery.</note>
               Meantime I will inclose your letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, &amp; if its arguments convince him, I
               will desire him to stop <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> from proceeding.
               The affadavit will be a post later. But I think he will be of opinion, as I am
               myself, that the boldest &amp; manliest way of proceeding is best. Any sale
               subsequent to the injunction is at the sellers peril, &amp; I should care nothing
               about it, having done all that it became me to do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I dare say this will given some of my friends more concern than it
               has me, &#8211; for my thoughts just now are pretty equally divided between the present
               state of the country, &#8211; &amp; the Minas Geraes <del>of</del> {in} Brazil.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was writing the &#8216;Rise and Progress of

               Switzerland &amp; the Rhine, allowing time from six weeks to two months. </p>

                  had sent Southey the papers of his brother, Thomas Sydenham (1780&#8211;1816), a soldier
                  who served in India and then Spain 1811&#8211;1812, before ending his career as Minister
                  Plenipotentiary at Lisbon 1814&#8211;1816. He also was a close friend of Marquess
                  Wellesley, with whom he served in India. The papers were to help Southey with his

               expedition to Cockermouth will prevent me from dispatching them before Tuesday. I

                  consideration. The second week in April I hope to arrive or the third at latest.
