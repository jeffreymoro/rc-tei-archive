               (&amp; you perhaps among others) yet certainly the subject is one which R. S. would
               never have chosen, but which the Laureate could not with propriety let pass. Moreover

                  Wilson was critical of Wellington&#8217;s conduct of the Peninsular War and provided
                  advice to opposition politicians; he was later radical MP for Southwark 1818&#8211;1831.
