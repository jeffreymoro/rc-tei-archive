               the magazines; – &amp; indeed it would surprize me less to find that some villain

                  Chancery on Southey’s application for an injunction on 18–19 March 1817. As a
                  court dealing with equity, the Court of Chancery could use its discretion and
                  apply justice in accordance with natural law, rather than being bound by the
