          <salute> My dear Turner,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have taken, I see, Cornano for your physician.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Turner, who was anxious about his health, was
                  emulating the dietary restraint practised by Luigi Cornaro (1467/84&#8211;1566). The
                  latter adopted a restricted diet, initially comprised of 14oz of solid food and
                  17oz of wine, and lived into advanced old age. Southey, though not a follower of
                  Cornaro&#8217;s system, owned a 1768 edition of his <title>Art of Living Long</title>,
                  no. 533 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> Had I made the same
               experiment, I should have been disposed to prefer a diet of roots, fruits, and
               esculent plants to bread, which is so likely to be adulterated. There is as much
               difference in the stomachs of men as in their tempers and faces; severe abstinence is
               necessary for some, and others feed high and drink hard, and yet attain to a robust
               old age; but unquestionably the sparing system has most facts in its favour, and I
               have often remarked with wonder the great length of life to which some of the hardest
               students and most inveterate self-tormentors among the monastic orders have attained.
               Truly glad shall I be if you derive from your system the permanent benefit which
               there seems such good reason to expect. Both you and I must wish to remain as long as
               we can in this &#8216;tough world&#8217; for the sake of others. Thank Heaven it is no rack to
               us, though we have both reached that stage in our progress in which the highest
               pleasure that this life can afford is the anticipation of that which is to follow
               it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have made a wise determination for your son William, for I
               believe that medical studies are of all others the most unfavourable to the moral
                  sense.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Turner&#8217;s second son William (b.
                  1804). Southey was speaking from experience. He had briefly considered a medical
                  career during his time at Oxford; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 2 [&#8211;5]
                  February 1794, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>,
                  Letter 81. His youngest brother, Henry Herbert, was established in medical
                  practice.</note> Anatomical studies are so revolting, that men who carry any
               feeling to the pursuit are glad to have it seared as soon as possible. I do not
               remember ever in the course of my life to have been so shocked as by hearing <ref type="m" target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref> relate some
               bravados of young men in this state when he was a student himself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wonder you should have any qualms at going to the press,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Turner was worried about the reception of his
                     <title>Prolusions on the Present Greatness of Britain; on Modern Poetry; and on
                     the Present Aspect of the World</title> (1819) &#8211; the third of the three
                  &#8216;Prolusions&#8217; was addressed to Southey. This diversion from history to poetry was
                  not well-received; e.g. &#8216;his book is very prosaic, while it professes to be
                  poetical&#8217;, <title>Monthly Review</title>, 95 (May 1821), 94&#8211;96 (95).</note>
               knowing, as you do, how capriciously at best, and in general with what injustice and
               impudent partiality, praise or blame is awarded by contemporary critics, and how
               absolutely worthless their decrees are in the court of posterity, by which the merits
               of the case must be finally determined. I am so certain that any subject which has
               amused your wakeful hours must be worthy to employ the thoughts of other men, and to
               give them a profitable direction, that, without knowing what the subject is, I exhort
               you to cast away your fears.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Remember me most kindly to your household. </p>
