                  was, on the advice of his friends, not published in his lifetime. It appeared in
                  John Wood Warter (ed.), <title>Selections from the Letters of Robert
                     Southey</title>, 4 vols (London, 1856), III, pp. 35&#8211;42.</note> in a wanton mood

               part of the day on the sopha because of a sore throat. It is meant either for the
               Times or the Courier, &amp; divided as you see into three doses, that each may
               operate separately upon the patient, who, you must know, is exceedingly sore under
               the lash. But it is as well perhaps that it should not go out in my hand writing,
               which is known at both places: so I wish you would take the trouble to transcribe
               &amp; send it, either to one or the other; &#8211; one chapter at a time, with the promise

               what relation he is to the General who defeated Dumourez at Tirlemont, &amp; <hi rend="ital">what his arms are</hi>.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> On
                  2 May 1816. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the
                  Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) married Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent.
                  The General concerned was Frederick Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1737&#8211;1815),
                  Leopold&#8217;s great-uncle; his troops defeated the French army of General
                  Charles-Fran&#231;ois du P&#233;rier Dumouriez (1739&#8211;1823), on 18 March 1793 at Neerwinden
                  in Belgium, after a setback at Tirlemont on 16 March. The Prince&#8217;s arms are
                  described in the epithalamion Southey wrote for the wedding, <title>The Lay of the
                     Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816), &#8216;The Dream&#8217;, stanzas 19&#8211;21. Southey
                  was particularly concerned about the Prince&#8217;s arms because he wanted to reuse
                  sections of the poem he had initially drafted in 1814 for the Princess&#8217;s
                  engagement to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (1792&#8211;1849; King of the
                  Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). Comparing the published text with the draft in Keswick
                  Museum and Art Gallery, Box B/414, shows that Southey was fortunately able to
                  change Prince William&#8217;s &#8216;Belgic&#8217; lion into Prince Leopold&#8217;s &#8216;Saxon&#8217; lion (stanza
                  19, line 2), as the arms of the royal houses of the Netherlands and Saxe-Coburg
                  both contained lions as their supporters.</note> An easy weeks work will compleat
               what you saw in London, &#8211; which I will take care to publish at<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Initially &#8216;in&#8217;.</note> the right time, &amp; call it Nupti&#230;

               to be so well married, &#8211; &amp; the sooner the better.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Be the merits of my &#8216;Pilgrimage&#8217; what they may, the book will owe its
               sale very much to the prints &amp; derive not a little value from them. I long to
