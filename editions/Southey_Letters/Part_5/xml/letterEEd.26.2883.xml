        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have left your letter too long unacknowledged, &#8211; but it is only this day that I have received one which ought to have
               answered an application made in consequence of it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had received a letter from Tillbrook
                  soliciting help and advice for Robert Bloomfield, who had been reduced to poverty by the bankruptcy of his publishers and by
                  illness. </note> &#8211; I write to learn what had been done, &amp; where subscriptions were received, &amp; to propose, as what appeared
               to me the surest &amp; every way the best mode of raising a sum adequate to the exigence, or rather the merits of poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#BloomfieldRobert">Bloomfield</ref> that an edition of his poems should be published for this purpose.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s suggestion of a new edition of Bloomfield&#8217;s poems was not adopted and instead donations were
                  collected on his behalf by Samuel Rogers.</note> Into whatever hands the copyright may have past after Vernor &amp; Hoods<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield&#8217;s publishers Vernor and Hood failed in 1811, leaving ownership of his copyrights
                  unclear.</note> failure I do not think any objection could be made on the part of the booksellers to such a mans making this use of
               his <del>xxx</del> own works under such circumstances. If there were no sense of justice, or any kindly feeling in the case, &#8211; we might
               reckon upon some sense of shame, &amp; a wholesome consciousness of the obloquy attendant upon a refusal. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> agreed with me that this would be the best plan if it could be effected. But
               the letter which should have brought me information upon this subject says not a word about it, &#8211; so I must repeat the enquiry.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for examining D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Beaumonts papers.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Beaumont

        <p rend="indent1"> Have you seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Kosters</ref> book? &#8211; the plain, full, satisfactory
               account of an unlearned, unscientific, right-minded &amp; all-observing man.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Koster,
                     <title>Travels in Brazil</title> (1816), reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (January 1817),
                  344&#8211;387.</note> The state of society which he describes is very curious, &amp; on the whole hopeful, in every respect infinitely
               better than that of the Spanish Americans in any of their widely different states. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We saw a great deal of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref> during the autumn, &amp; were
               much interested with him. He has given me a drawing of most extraordinary execution, &#8211; a view from the top of Saddleback.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">An aquatint engraving of &#8216;Keswick Lake, from Saddleback&#8217; was published in Westall&#8217;s <title>Views of the
                     Lake and of the Vale of Keswick</title> (1820), with a Preface by Southey.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I was with him when he made the sketch, &amp; the effect could not be more admirably represented. By this time he is
               probably at Coleorton,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">The seat, in Leicestershire, of the Beaumonts.</note> &#8211; where my poor
               friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Nash</ref> has been enjoying himself these five weeks, &#8211;
               working away at <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George&#8217;s</ref> pictures. That word reminds me of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref>, who is painting with great industry &amp; great success, &#8211; so much so that if she
               perseveres she is in a fair way of attaining to a very distinguished rank in the art.</p>
