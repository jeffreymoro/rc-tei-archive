               finding it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">On 7 August 1818 Coleridge had married Mary Buchanan (1788–1874).</note> Men in your
               station <del>are</del> too <del>xxx</del> frequently let the proper season go by, waiting till they can afford to start with a showy
               establishment, among those who have not more than an ordinary share of good principles this is a very common cause of libertine habits,
               &amp; they who escape this evil incur another which is sometimes not less fatal. They look out for a wife when they think themselves
               rich enough, &amp; this is like going to market for one; the choice on their part is not made from those feelings upon which the
               foundation of happiness must be laid, &amp; on the other part they are accepted not for their own sakes, but for the sake of the
               establishment which they offer. Similarity of disposition is not consulted, &amp; there is generally in such cases a disparity of years
               which is not very likely to produce it. You have chosen a better course, &amp; may God bless you in it.</p><p rend="indent1"> The most profitable line of composition is reviewing. You have good footing in the Quarterly, &amp; I am heartily glad
               of it, for heretofore there has been vile criticism in that journal upon poetry &amp; upon fine literature in general. This connection
               need not <del>xxxx </del>preclude you from writing for the British Review; – &amp; I think our excellent friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> could introduce you to it, thro its quondam Editor Weyland,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Weyland (1774–1854; <title>DNB</title>), barrister and MP for Hindon 1830–1832, was the founding editor, in
                  1811, of the <title>British Review and London Critical Journal</title>. </note> or if that channel should be closed it is possible
               that I might find one. Translation is of all literary labour the worst paid, – that is of all such labour as is paid at all: &amp; yet
               there are so many poor hungry brethren &amp; sisters of the grey goose quill upon the alert, that new books are sent over from France
               &amp; Germany by the sheet as they pass thro the press, lest the translator should be forestalled.</p><p rend="indent1"> Any thing which is not bargained for with the booksellers is of course matter of speculation; &amp; success is so much
               a matter of accident (that is to say <hi rend="ital">temporary</hi> success) in literature, that the most knowing of the Cormorant
               tribe themselves are <del>xxx</del> often <del>xx</del> as grievously deceived as a young author upon his first essay. Biography
               however is likely to succeed, &amp; with the London libraries at hand the research required for it would be rather pleasurable than
               toilsome. History, which is the most delightful of all employments (experto crede<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Believe me;
                  I’m expert’.</note>) is much less likely to be remunerated, – I have not yet received so much for the History of Brazil as for a
               single paper in the QR.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">By 1816, Southey was often receiving £100 per article in the
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>. The first volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810–1819) had as yet not produced
                  £100 for its author.</note> But there are many fine subjects, which if well handled might prove prizes in the lottery. A history of
               Charles I &amp; the Interregnum, – or of all the Stuart Kings upon a scale of sufficient extent, &amp; written upon such principles as
               you would bring to it, <del>xxx</del> would be a valuable addition to the literature of our country &amp; useful to others as well as
               honourable to yourself.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A history of the reign of Charles I (1600–1649; King of Great Britain

               also is a country fruitful in splendid &amp; memorable events: for this indeed it would be necessary to acquire the Norse languages. –

                  in 1805 Cecilia Elizabeth Byng (1770–1854), daughter of John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington (1743–1813). She was a first cousin of
