               but the Brazil packet goes to the Rio; &amp; there is no communication with
               Pernambuco except by merchant ships. The best plan therefore will be to consign your
               packet to the care of his father <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">John Theodore Koster</ref>,
                  Liverpool.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had interested
                  Wilberforce in Koster&#8217;s proposal to translate into Portuguese, and thereby aid the
                  abolition of slavery campaign in Brazil, Thomas Clarkson&#8217;s <title>History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the
                     African Slave&#8211;Trade by the British Parliament</title> (1808).</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> This part of the country scarcely feels the existing distress, &#8211;
               Westmoreland (being wholly an agricultural country) not at all. <del>The only
                  xxx</del> We have some cotton mills here, poisoning the health &amp; morals of the
               people, &#8211; &amp; some coarse weaving which is not so mischievous, because only men are
               employed in it. These suffer something, but not much; &#8211; a collection was made several
               weeks ago; &#8211; the amount must have been very trifling, &#8211; but nothing more has been
               called for, &amp; no complaints are heard. Our population is in a deplorable state
               both as to law &amp; gospel; &#8211; the magistrates careless to the last degree &amp; the
               Vicar who is one of them, has the comprehensive sin of omission to answer for.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Isaac Denton (c. 1758&#8211;1820), Vicar of
                  Crosthwaite, Keswick, 1786&#8211;1820 and a local magistrate.</note> The next generation
               I trust will see fewer of these marrying &amp; christening machines. The morals of
               the people here have dreadfully worsened during his long slumbers; &#8211; even within my
               remembrance there has been a great change.</p>
