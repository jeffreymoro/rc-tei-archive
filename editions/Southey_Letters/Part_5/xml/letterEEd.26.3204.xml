               been consumed by interruptions of which I ought not to complain, seeing they must
               needs be beneficial to my health however they may be felt in the sum total of the
               years work. I have had for a guest <ref type="m" target="people.html#TownshendChauncyHare">the son of Hare

                  3rd Baron Coleraine (1693&#8211;1749; <title>DNB</title>). Her husband was James
                  Townsend (1737&#8211;1787; <title>DNB</title>), elected Alderman of the City of London
                  in 1769 and Lord Mayor 1772&#8211;1773, MP for West Looe 1767&#8211;1774, MP for Calne
                  1782&#8211;1787. James Townsend was an important supporter of John Wilkes (1725&#8211;1797;

               Her housekeeper having broken her leg, she was exceedingly indignant at not being
               able to convince her that there was no thing as pain; &amp; when the poor woman
               complained that the children disturbed her by playing in a room over her head, she
               insisted upon it that that was impossible, because it was the nature of sound to
               ascend, &#8211; &amp; therefore she could not be disturbed unless they played in the room
               under her. This good Lady bred up her children as nearly as she could upon Rousseaus
                  maxims,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean-Jacques Rousseau
                  (1712&#8211;1778), Swiss philosopher. Southey is probably referring to his book on

                  sections.</note> &amp; was especially careful that they should receive no

               she ever entered a Church, &amp; then she earnestly intreated a friend to take her
               there, from motives of curiosity. This daughter has become a truly religious woman.
