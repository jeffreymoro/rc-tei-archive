          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your pay is very liberal,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had received &#163;150 (and advice from Murray on how to plan his
                  articles) for his review of <title>Memoirs, Illustrative of the Life and Writings
                     of John Evelyn</title> (1818), which appeared in <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 1&#8211;54, and his essay &#8216;On the Means of Improving
                  the People&#8217;, which also appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April
                  1818), 79&#8211;118 (published 26 September 1818).</note> &amp; the price which I
               receive for my writings is by no means a matter of indifference to me, but it can
               make no difference in the manner of my writing. The same diligence, the same desire,
               &#8211; &amp; the same power (whatever that may be) were brought to the task when you paid
               me ten guineas per-sheet, as <del>xxx</del> when you <del>xxx</del> raised it to 100&#163;
               per-piece. This last is a great price, &amp; it is very convenient to me to receive
               it. But I will tell you with that frankness which you have always found in my
               correspondence &amp; conversation, that <del>even at that price</del> I
                  <del>may</del> suspect my time might be more profitably employed (as I am sure it
               might be more worthily) than in writing for your Journal <del>at the</del> even at
               that price.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You yourself offered me 400&#163; for the journal of my last years tour on
               the continent.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey never published the
                  journal of his three-month continental tour in May&#8211;August 1817.</note> It would
               have taken me much less time to have prepared that for the press than to have written
               four papers for the QR.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> You offered me 1000 guineas for a
               {blank verse} poem not exceeding Thomsons Seasons<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey began, but did not finish, such a poem, entitled
                  &#8216;Consolation&#8217;. Sections were published after his death as &#8216;Fragmentary Thoughts
                  Occasioned by his Son&#8217;s Death&#8217; in <title>Oliver Newman: A New-England Tale
                     (Unfinished): With Other Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp. 93&#8211;95,
                  and &#8216;Additional Fragment, Occasioned by the Death of his Son&#8217;, <title>Poetical
                     Works of Robert Southey. Complete in One Volume</title> (London, 1850), p. 815.
                  The models for this poem were two other works in blank verse: Edward Young
                  (1681&#8211;1765; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Night Thoughts</title> (1742&#8211;1745) and
                  William Cowper (1731&#8211;1800; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Task</title> (1785).
                  James Thomson (1700&#8211;1748; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Seasons</title>
                  (1726&#8211;1730) exceeded 5,000 lines.</note> in length. I could produce that poem in
               less time than I could write ten papers for the QR, &amp; with tenfold more
               satisfaction. With the plans &amp; preparations which have been lying by me for years
               &amp; ripening during that time, I could in the course of twelvemonths produce a poem
               of the calibre of Roderick or Kehama,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814) and <title>The Curse
                     of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> &amp; I leave you to judge what price I should
               be entitled to demand for it at this time, with the reputation which those poems have
               obtained for me, aided as it undoubtedly is by that for which I am beholden to your
               Review. Less time than is required for ten articles in the QR. would suffice for the
               Age of George 3:<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write a
                  history of the reign of George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820;
                     <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; which I am confident would prove a standard book.
               &#8211; The QR. can do perfectly well without me, &amp; when I shall have compleated those
               papers which are now in hand, it will be better that I should become only an
               occasional contributor at long intervals.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall send off the Catacombs ushered in by the New Churches as soon
               as a crowd of visitors will allow me.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Haydon, <title>New Churches, Considered with Respect to

                  attacked Southey and Wordsworth from the hustings. Southey decided to retaliate by
                  publishing a pamphlet attacking Brougham and revealing his political opportunism.
