                  reviewed a series of volumes by travellers in England, under the title &#8216;Works on England&#8217;. This issue appeared on 12 November 1816.
                  Southey warned of the dangers of revolution at 569&#8211;574.</note> So far so good; &#8211; I am busy upon the remaining part; &#8211; &amp; estimate
               the extent of the whole at not more than two sheets &amp; a half: the conclusion turns upon the state of political opinions in this

               knows how necessary it is that these things should be exposed. I shall touch also upon the subject of relieving the poor by employing
               them in agriculture, &#8211; instead of manufactures, &amp; adverts to Owens plans as far as they are practicable.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Owen (1771&#8211;1858; <title>DNB</title>), manager and owner of the mills and model community at New Lanark in

               this book. With my earliest leisure I shall finish the introductory chapter to the Hist: of the War:<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 3&#8211;62.</note> &#8211; if that
               were done there is enough ready in sequence to keep the press going, &#8211; &amp; unless I get into the press I shall never get out of it. &#8211;
               My second vol. of Brazil<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> is
               nearly finished, &amp; I shall carry the concluding one thro the press without intermission, a work of prodigious labour which can
               never be adequately remunerated, but which has been written <hi rend="ital">con amore</hi>,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8217;with love&#8217;.</note> &amp; will gain me a permanent name in that rising country.</p>
