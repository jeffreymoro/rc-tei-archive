          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">My
               brother</ref> has written to dissuade me strongly from
               proceeding in this business.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to
                  Southey&#8217;s Jacobin drama <title>Wat Tyler</title>, which he had written in 1794 and
                  sent to James Ridgway (1755&#8211;1838) and Henry Symonds (1741&#8211;1816), radical
                  booksellers, for publication; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12 January
                  1795], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter
                  123, recounting Southey&#8217;s subsequent visit to Ridgway and Symonds in Newgate
                  prison. However, Ridgway and Symonds did not publish <title>Wat Tyler</title> and
                  it remained in manuscript until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass the
                  now anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817. Having taken advice from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, Wynn and Turner, Southey launched a suit in
                  Chancery so as to gain an injunction suppressing the publication, on the grounds
                  that it breached his copyright.</note> My own opinion is, that if I do not act now
               the men who have published the work will compel me to do so at last, by inserting my
               name in such a manner as to render the measure unavoidable. Indeed it was inserted as
               a paragraph in the Chronicle, which I suppose they paid for as an advertisement.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had learned of the publication of Wat
                  Tyler from a short article in the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 12 February
                  1817.</note> Therefore I think it best to take the short and open course,
               believing that in most cases such courses are the best. However, I have sent <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry&#8217;s</ref> letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, and, if his arguments convince him, have desired him to
               let you know. This was done yesterday, and if you have not heard from him before this
               reaches you, it may be concluded that he thinks it best to proceed. I suppose there
               can be no doubt of obtaining the injunction. The statement is perfectly accurate; I
               know not whether it be of any use to let you know that at the time the transaction
               took place I was under age. I was just twenty when the poem was written, and saw
               these booksellers about four months afterwards.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I fully assent to what you say concerning political discussions, and
               intermeddle with them no farther than as they are connected not only with the future
               good, but as appears to me with the immediate safety of society.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">As in, for example, his review essay
                  &#8216;Parliamentary Reform&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816),
                  225&#8211;278 (published 11 February 1817).</note> It is not for any men, or set of men,
               that I am interested; nor for any particular measures. But with regard to the fearful
               aspect of these times, you may perhaps have traced the ground of my apprehensions in
               Espriella, in the Edinburgh Register, and in the Quarterly, more especially in a
               paper upon the Poor about four years ago.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey lists a series of works in which he warned of the dangers from
                  industrialisation and revolution. See, for instance: <title>Letters from England:
                     By Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella</title>, 3 vols (London, 1807), III, p. 133;
                     <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811),
                  229; &#8216;Inquiry into the Poor Laws&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (December
                  1812), 319&#8211;356.</note> It is now come to this question, &#8211; Can we educate the
               people in moral and religious habits, and better the condition of the poor, so as to
               secure ourselves from a mob-revolution; or has this duty been neglected so long, that
               the punishment will overtake us before this only remediable means can take effect?
               The papers which I shall write upon the real evils of society will, I hope, work for
               posterity, and not be wholly forgotten by it; they proceed from a sense of duty, and
               that duty discharged, I shall gladly retire into other ages, and give all my studies
               to the past and all my hopes to the future.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was currently engaged in writing his &#8216;Rise and Progress of Popular
                  Disaffection&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (January 1817),
               511&#8211;552.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> My spirits, rather than my disposition, have undergone a great
                  change.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The key to this change in
                     Southey&#8217;s spirits had been the death of his son, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>, on 17 April 1816.</note> They used to be exuberant
               beyond those of almost every other person; my heart seemed to possess a perpetual
               fountain of hilarity; no circumstances of study, or atmosphere, or solitude affected
               it; and the ordinary vexations and cares of life, even when they showered upon me,
               fell off like hail from a pent-house. That spring is dried up; I cannot now preserve
               an appearance of serenity at all times without an effort, and no prospect in this
               world delights me except that of the next. My heart and my hopes are there.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have a scheme to throw out somewhere for taking the Methodists into
               the Church; or borrowing from Methodism so much of it as is good, and thereby
               regenerating the Establishment. There is little hope in such schemes, except that in
               process of time they may produce some effect. But were it effected now, and would the
               Church accept the volunteer services of lay coadjutors, I should feel strongly
               inclined to volunteer mine. This is a dream, and I fear the whole fabric will fall to
               pieces even in our days.</p>
