        <p rend="indent1"> Your Lordships letter with its inclosure, followed me to this place,
               where I am on the eve of departing for the Continent. The intended time of my absence
               does not exceed two months, &amp; immediately on my return I shall go to press with
               the first volume of my historical work.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832). The Earl
                  of Sheffield had offered Southey information to help him in writing this
                  work.</note> As yet I have no materials whatever respecting the operation of our
               army on the Eastern coast of Spain, except such scanty information as has appeared in
               print, &#8211; how defective this is, especially during the latter months of the war, your
               Lordship must well know. I have however the prospect of obtaining some, French as
               well as English. If I may be allowed to point out the manner in which your Lordships
               offered communications would be most advantageous, it would be in a military sketch
               of the operations of the army, however brief. Keeping this as a chart before me, I
               would draw up my own narrative from all the documents which I may be able to collect,
               &amp; when this was done, submit it to the perusal of your Lordship &amp; of Sir
               Henry Clinton,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">General Sir William Henry
                  Clinton (1769&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>), commander of the 1st Division in Spain
                  1812&#8211;1813 and commander-in-chief of British forces in eastern Spain 1813&#8211;1814.
                  Clinton had married in 1797 Louisa Dorothea Baker Holroyd (1776&#8211;1854), daughter of
                  the Earl of Sheffield.</note> that what was erroneous might be corrected, &amp;
               that which should be deficient, supplied.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It has sincerely gratified <del>xxx</del> me to learn that my reply
               to a most base &amp; cowardly attack has met with your Lordships approbation.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Smith had denounced Southey in the House of
                  Commons on 14 March 1817 in the debate on the Seditious Meetings Bill, condemning
                  &#8216;the settled, determined malignity of a renegado&#8217; and comparing Southey&#8217;s
                  arguments against radical views in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16
                  (October 1816), 227, with those expressed in <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817), Act
                  2, lines 103&#8211;112. Southey&#8217;s response was his <title>A Letter to William Smith,

                  House of Commons debate on 7 May 1817 on a case of potential breach of privilege,
                  Smith had said: &#8216;he had always considered it to be a kind of duty in every member
                  to withhold himself from defence out of doors of any expressions he might have
                  used within. On that duty he had acted strictly and bona fide&#8217;. This might be
                  interpreted as a declaration by Smith that he would not respond to Southey.</note>
