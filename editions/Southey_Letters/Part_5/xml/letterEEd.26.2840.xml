        <p rend="indent2"> Upon mature deliberation I am clearly of opinion that it would be very imprudent &amp; impolitic for me to receive any
               thing in the nature of emolument from Government at this time, in any shape whatsoever. Such a circumstance would lessen the worth of
               my services, &#8211; I mean it would render them less serviceable, &#8211; for whatever might come from me would be received with suspicion, which
               no means would be spared to excite. As it concerns myself personally this ought to be of some weight; but it is entitled infinitely to
               greater consideration if you reflect how <del>lar</del> greatly my influence <del>xxxx</del> (whatever it may be) over a good part of
               the public would be diminished if I were looked upon as a salaried writer.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey&#8217;s letters
                  to Bedford of 7, 8 and 10 September 1816 (Letters 2835, 2836 and 2839) for the ministerial suggestion that Southey should be
                  employed to write or edit a journal attacking the government&#8217;s critics.</note> I must therefore in the most explicit &amp;
               determined manner decline all offers of this kind, &#8211; but at the same time I repeat my offer to exert myself in any way that may be
               thought best. The whole fabric of social order in this country is in great danger; &#8211; the Revolution should it be effected will not be
               less bloody nor less ferocious than it was in France; &#8211; it <hi rend="ital">will</hi> be effected unless vigorous means be
                  <del>xxxx</del> taken to arrest its progress; &#8211; <del>&amp; every m</del> &amp; I have the strongest motive both of duty &amp;
                  <del>self</del> prudence &#8211; say even self-preservation, &#8211; for standing forward to oppose it. Let me write upon the State of
                  Affairs,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey considered writing, but did not produce, a work on the &#8216;State of the
                  Nation&#8217;.</note> &#8211; (<del>&amp; indeed</del> &#8211; the freer I am the better I shall write, &#8211;) &amp; let there be a weekly Journal
               established where the villainies <del>of the</del> &amp; misrepresentations of the Anarchists <del>&amp;c</del> &amp; Malignants may be
               detected &amp; exposed; &amp; where we may break <ref type="m" target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#HuntLeigh">Hunt</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#HazlittWilliam">Hazlitt</ref> &amp;c upon the wheel.
               But all will be in vain unless there be some check given to the licentiousness of the press, by one or two convictions, &amp; an
               adequate (that is to say) an effectual punishment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It would be superfluous to <del>te</del> assure you that in declining any immediate remuneration I act from no false
               pride, or false delicacy, &#8211; proof enough of this <del>t</del> is that at first I was willing to accept it. But I feel convinced that it
               would (however undeservedly) discredit me with the public, <del>&amp; thus before the ve</del> Every effort, even now, is making to
               discredit me, as if I had sold myself for the Laureateship. While I am as I am these efforts recoil upon the enemy, &amp; I even derive
               advantage from them. &#8211; Do not argue that I suffer them to injure me if I refuse what might be offered me for fear of their censures. It
               is not their censures, &#8211; it is the loss of <del>that</del> ostensible <del>xx xxxx xx xxxxx</del> independence, however really
               independent I should be. At present, in defiance of all that malignity can effect I have a weight of character, &amp; the rascals fear
               me while they hate me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Between ourselves I shall bear part in a journal which Stoddart has planned &amp; which is to appear in French &amp;
               English at the same time,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1817 a new journal was launched, published by Longmans and edited
                  by John Stoddart (1773&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>), who had in 1816 been dismissed from the editorship of the <title>Times</title> for
                  the intemperate Toryism of his articles. It was entitled <title>The Correspondent; Consisting of Letters, Moral, Political, and
                     Literary, between Eminent Writers in France and England; and designed by presenting to each Nation a Faithful Picture of the
                     Other, to Enlighten both to their True Interests, promote a Mutual Good Understanding between them, and render Peace the Source
                     of a Common Prosperity</title>. The French edition does not seem to have appeared. Southey contributed a sketch of the life of
                  John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) to the first two numbers (1 (1817), 26&#8211;48; and 2 (1817), 157&#8211;176). However, the
                     <title>Correspondent</title> lasted only one further number. Stoddart became the editor of a new ministry-supported paper,
                     <title>The New Times</title> (1817&#8211;1828).</note> Chateaubriand &amp; the Duc de Levis who has written a <hi rend="ital">good</hi>
