          <salute> My dear R.</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your last note makes me apprehend that you are not in your usual
               health, &#8211; &amp; indisposition is apt to throw a dark hue over every thing. I was
               therefore glad to hear that you were going into the country, &#8211; for notwithstanding
               the longevity which belongs to your office, there are better atmospheres than that of
               Palace Yard, &amp; you would be the better for more air &amp; more bodily exercise
               than are within your power during the sessions. I sometimes try to persuade myself
               that mine is a Turkish sort of constitution, &amp; that exercise &amp; out-of-doors
               air are not needful for its well-being: &#8211; but the body begins to require better
               management than it did, &#8211; it will not take care of itself so well as it did twenty
               years ago, &amp; I need not look <del>at the</del> in the glass for a memento that I
                  <del>xxx</del> have begun the down hill part of my journey. So be it. &#8211; There is
               so much for my heart &#8211; &amp; hope &#8211; &amp; curiosity at the end of the stage, that if
               I thought only of myself in this world, I should <del>hav</del> wish <del>the journey
                  be</del> I were fairly there.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is a strange folly &#8211; or fatality that men in power will not see
               the prudence of <del>x</del> anticipating public feeling sometimes <del>instead</del>
               &amp; doing things with a grace for the sake of popularity, which must be done with
               ignominy upon compulsion. For instance in that vile Lord Cochranes affair. It was
               wrong to condemn him to the pillory; &#8211; but if that part of the sentence had been
               annulled before popular opinion was expressed, <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Prince</ref> would have
               gained credit instead of being supposed to yield to the newspapers.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald
                  (1775&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>). Cochrane, a naval hero and radical MP for Honiton
                  1806&#8211;1807 and Westminster 1807&#8211;1818, was convicted on 9 June 1814 of involvement
                  in an attempt to defraud the Stock Exchange. Cochrane&#8217;s sentence was a year&#8217;s
                  imprisonment, a &#163;1000 fine and an hour in the pillory. Subsequently he was
                  dismissed from the navy, expelled from parliament and his knighthood was
                  withdrawn. Cochrane was re-elected for Westminster unopposed on 16 July 1814 and
                  the sentence to stand in the pillory was withdrawn for fear of a riot. </note>
               Here will be another case in the suicide-laws, &#8211; which seem in this Spaniards case to
               have been so executed as if the object were to insult common humanity, &amp; provoke
               public indignation.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The radical newspapers
                  aroused public anger by highlighting the story of the treatment meted out,
                  according to the common law, to the corpse of a Spanish exile, Mariano Marquez de
                  Castro (1788&#8211;1818), who had, on 3 December 1818, shot himself in London. The
                  coroner&#8217;s jury deciding he was not insane at time of death, Castro&#8217;s body was
                  buried at night at a crossroads; see the report in the <title>Morning
                     Chronicle</title>, 7 December 1818. Crossroads burial for suicides was
                  prohibited in 1823.</note> And again in the matter of forgery. The laws must be
               altered, &#8211; &amp; that not from the judgement of the legislature &#8211; but by the will of
               the London juries!<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1817, in an effort
                  to defend the paper money on which the economy now depended from forgery, the Bank
                  of England prosecuted one hundred and forty two people in connection with forging
                  banknotes, or handling forged banknotes. Because the penalty was death, juries
                  were reluctant to convict. See, for instance, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 7
                  December 1818, for the acquittal of John Williams and William Connor because the
                  jury did not accept that the banknotes they had passed on were definitely
                  forgeries.</note> The Juries however if they go on in their present course will do
               more than this, &#8211; they will prove that the very institution of juries on which we
               have prided ourselves so long, is inconsistent not only with common sense, but with
               the safety of society &amp; the security of government. I wish, when this question of
               forgery comes before the House, (as it surely must do) that some thing may be said,
               &amp; done also, for restoring that part of the system which makes the jurymen
                  <del>xx</del> punishable for a false verdict.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">An obsolete practice in English law was the &#8216;writ of attaint&#8217;
                  against a jury. If the Crown, or any of the parties to a suit, believed a jury had
                  delivered a false verdict, the jury&#8217;s decision was reviewed by a grand jury of
                  attaint. If they found the verdict was false, it was overturned and the jury
                  punished. Though this procedure had not been used since 1670 it was not finally
                  abolished until the Juries Act (1825) &#8211; and even then it was theoretically
                  retained for the crime of &#8216;embracery&#8217;, i.e. corruptly influencing a
               juror.</note>
