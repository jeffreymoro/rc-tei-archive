        <p rend="indent1"> I have just received <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> reply, which is very much what might be expected.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had sent Murray the manuscript poem &#8216;Ellen
                  Fitzarthur&#8217; that Bowles had sent to him, seeking advice on bringing it to
                  publication. Murray did not publish it; Longman did, in 1820. </note> It is in
               these words &#8220;I will have great pleasure in reading the Ladys MSS poem though unless
               it be very striking indeed, it will not have the smallest chance of succeeding. I
               receive at least 500 poems every year, out of which I cannot venture to print six,
               &amp; of those not one half defray the expences of publication.&#8221;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Times are very much changed in this country with regard to
               literature, &#8211; or perhaps I should rather say fashions are changed. A book seller
               would formerly take the opinion of some man of letters, &amp; be guided by his
               private &amp; unbiased judgement, of the merit of the work. The Trade are grown wiser
               now they have discovered that the success of poetry does not depend upon its merit,
               but upon the humour of the season; &amp; they have discovered also, what is not less
               true that being upon the spot, &amp; being dealers in the commodity, they themselves
               are the best judges of what <hi rend="ital">will</hi> take.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If it were possible I would read this poem with you &amp; explain as
               we went thro it <del>why</del> {wherein} any expression is faulty, &amp; why any part
               or passage requires alteration. Generally speaking women write letters better than
               men, &amp; they write novels better; &#8211; I do not mean as to the construction of the
               story, or the conception of the characters, &#8211; but their language is easier &amp;
               happier, &#8211; they express their feelings more readily &amp; therefore more naturally, &#8211;
               &amp; they write the real language of life, when men would be thinking of fine
               composition, &#8211; which has much the same effect upon a mans style, as it would have
               upon his manners if he were always to be thinking of his clothes. But verse requires
               a precision <del>of language</del> both of thought &amp; language (very rarely indeed
               attained, <del>by</del> scarcely by two writers in a generation,) to which women are
               less accustomed &amp; to which <del>indeed</del> their education has not trained
               them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have the eye, the ear &amp; the heart of a poetess. What is
               wanting in you is that which I was twenty years in learning, &amp; had hardly
               acquired when evening prospects &amp; autumnal feelings unfitted me for what requires
               ardour &amp; an expenditure of spirits <del>xx</del> which I can no longer support
               with impunity. C[MS obscured] criticism might most materially have abridged my
               course, &#8211; but it was not my fortune to meet with it. &#8211; Your poem deserves to be
               carefully corrected. The first <del>xx</del> point to observe is to strike out
               whatever is superfluous, whatever adds no strength of beauty to the sentence, or
               repeats what is clearly implied before. For instance &#8211; &#8216;The stone was full, &#8211; no
               vacant space was there.&#8221;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">This line was
                  changed to &#8216;Bursts from her heart &#8211; another name is there&#8217; in <title>Ellen
                     Fitzarthur: a Metrical Tale, in Five Cantos</title> (London, 1820), p.
                  115.</note> &#8211; This line exemplifies the fault. The whole of the catastrophe is
               very finely conceived, &#8211; I do not remember a situation more truly or deeply tragical.
               Here therefore especially any thing unnecessary or feeble should be avoided: &#8220;<del>at
                  length</del> &#8220;<hi rend="ital">conviction came</hi> &#8211;&#8221; is an expression better out
               of the way.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Another fault to be looked for with a suspicious eye is that of using
               words, which convey a different meaning from that into which they are pressed for the
               convenience of the verse. The word <hi rend="ital">have</hi> is thus used at the
               opening of the poem, &amp; the couplet in which it occurs had better be expunged. The
               only error of diction which I observe is in the use of the word <hi rend="ital">laid</hi> instead of <hi rend="ital">lay</hi>; the mistake is not infrequently
               made <hi rend="ital">laid</hi> is the perfect tense of to <hi rend="ital">lay</hi>,
               not of to <hi rend="ital">lie</hi> &#8211; (lie &#8211; lay &#8211; lay &#8211; laid)</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do not be discouraged at what I say, I am sure you would not if I

               go thro the poem, &amp; resolutely weed out whatever displeased you. I myself <hi rend="ital">rewrote</hi> two of my long poems, &amp; a very considerable part of
               two others.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey extensively revised
                     <title>Joan of Arc</title> (1796) in the second edition of 1798;
                     <title>Madoc</title> (1805) was very different from the first version written
                  in 1797&#8211;1799. <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810) and <title>Roderick, the
                     Last of the Goths</title> (1814) both had a long gestation that involved much
                  rewriting.</note> The best passages of a poem are those which have been
               felicitously produced in the first glow of composition; but I have found in my own
               experience that those which have {been} inserted in place of something faulty, have
               been next to them in merit.</p>

               near Christ Church, that I lodged first for one summer, &amp; afterwards took a

               you will correct your poem valiantly, &#8211; &amp; if you will make up your mind by this
               resolution, I will go thro it severely, book by book</p>
