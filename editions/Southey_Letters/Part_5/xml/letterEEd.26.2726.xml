            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816) of which Southey had sent a draft to Bedford.</note> &amp; am not a little
               pleased at having them removed. The Proem I was pretty sure about, &#8211; for whoever likes me will like it, &#8211; but respecting the rest I did
               not feel certain.</p>

                  engagement of Princess Charlotte to William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849).</note>
