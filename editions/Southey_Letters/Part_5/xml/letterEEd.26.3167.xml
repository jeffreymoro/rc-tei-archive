                My dear friend</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In clearing out the accumulated papers of my desk this morning, this
               sheet came to light, with a memorandum made long since for the purpose of asking
               whether you know to what it alludes. It seems as if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walpole
               had held some situation about Court, of which there is no trace in any of the papers
               in my possession. You will be glad to hear that I have been working with much success
               at these papers, extracting &amp; arranging matter for Brazil,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note>

               for the Memoir. For the first of these I have found something, &#8211; for the two latter a
               great deal in the extracts from the correspondence of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W&#8217;s
               predecessors (as far back as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Worsley<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Worsley (1672&#8211;1740), MP for Newtown, Isle of Wight

                  1722&#8211;1731.</note>) &amp; of the ministers at Madrid.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This was my main employment, as soon as I had settled the important
               business of Ways &amp; Means for the quarter, (a paper upon Evelyns Memoirs<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of <title>Memoirs, Illustrative

                  June 1818 Brougham, when campaigning for the parliamentary seat of Westmorland
                  against the candidates favoured by Wordsworth&#8217;s patron, the Earl of Lonsdale,
                  attacked Southey and Wordsworth.</note> This is certainly not worth replying to, &#8211;
               for the only reply would be that I had neither written a line concerning the
               election, nor meddled in it more than you have done; but it is a very proper
               opportunity for chastising a man who has then slandered me in the face of my
               neighbours, &amp; exposing him, as he deserves to be exposed. &#8211; I have got about

                  from publishing the retort to Brougham that he modelled on his pamphlet <title>A

                  Epistle&#8217;. Parts of it were printed, without mentioning Brougham&#8217;s name, in a
                  postscript to the second edition of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London,

                  last election had been in 1812. There was only one polling station in each
                  constituency, involving a great deal of travel for voters, especially in county
