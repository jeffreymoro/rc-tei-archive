        <p rend="indent1"> In the course of this business I have very often had occasion to
               remember the apologue of the old man his son &amp; the ass: &#8211; for by listening to
               every body, I am likely to please nobody, &amp; myself least of all.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to Aesop&#8217;s (620&#8211;564 BC) &#8216;The Miller,
                  His Son, and Their Ass&#8217; in which, after listening to the conflicting advice of
                  different passers-by, the old man ends up carrying the ass on his back. Southey
                  was being offered advice about his <title>A Letter to William Smith, Esq.,
                     M.P.</title> (1817).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> exhorts me most earnestly not to write
               arrogantly. <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> I think would not have me
               write at all, &#8211; &amp; perhaps this may be <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> opinion. &#8211; You &amp; the <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Doxtor</ref> say write &#8211; &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</ref> here think

        <p rend="indent1"> You have the whole now, &amp; if you &amp; your Counsellors &#8211; by
               which I mean <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> (&amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> if you
               please) think it better that the whole should be suppressed: so let <del>xx</del> it
               be. My anger has spent itself, &amp; I care not the turn of a straw. If on the other
               hand you wish it to appear, I will in the proof expunge certain passages that offend
               <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref> sensitiveness, &amp; I will smooth
               down others so as to lessen their asperity but leave the whole edge, &amp; I will
               insert a passage about public expenditure from these papers which you have sent me.
               But I must tell you that with this letter I close the business on my part. Whatever
               reply may be attempted to it, I shall say nothing more. I will waste no more time
               upon an affair which did not from the beginning deserve from me the sacrifice of a
               single hour. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The best answer which could have been made to him would have been to
               have reprinted certain of my papers from the QR together with certain excerpts from
               the Register;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Edinburgh Annual
                     Register, for 1808&#8211;1811</title> (1810&#8211;1813), for which Southey wrote the
                  historical sections.</note> or better still; if I had made a book as was my full
               intention instead of yielding to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref>

                  writing a book on the &#8216;State of the Nation&#8217;. Many of his thoughts appeared instead
                  in his <title>Quarterly Review </title>articles, &#8216;Parliamentary Reform&#8217;, 16
                  (October 1816), 225&#8211;278, and &#8216;Rise and Progress of Popular Disaffection&#8217;, 16
                  (January 1817), 511&#8211;552.</note> After all it is of little consequence; as regards
               myself of none, &amp; as regards the country things will take their course. The
               present ulcers will heal, &#8211; the disease will continue in the system, &#8211; we shall go on
               upon a system of expedients, living as it were from hand to mouth, to day with the
               bugbear of ruin before our eyes, tomorrow in a heyday of prosperity: &#8211; the evil may
               be indefinitely delayed, but sooner or later come it must unless adequate remedies be
               applied, &amp; for these the present race of statesmen want either the courage or the
               power, or both.</p>
