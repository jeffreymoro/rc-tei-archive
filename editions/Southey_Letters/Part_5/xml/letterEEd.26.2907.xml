        <p rend="indent1"> If you were but in the administration, instead of out of it, there is but one question upon which there would be a
               shade of difference between us.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Just after your receiving your letter I cut out the inclosed extract from the Times.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">This clipping from <title>The Times</title> has not survived. It was possibly the Address sent to the Prince Regent
                  by the Lord Mayor, Councillors and Aldermen of the City of London, which appeared in <title>The Times</title>, 9 December 1816. The
                  Address criticised the government&#8217;s opposition to parliamentary reform and its failure to reduce national expenditure.</note> &#8211; In
               discharging men from the army &amp; navy it is possible that much private good might be effected by a very easy arrangement; &#8211; in
               paying off a regiment for instance, allowing those men who would prefer remaining in the service to exchange with others in a retained
               regiment who desire their discharge &#8211; &amp; so with ships. As for this newspaper story the Lord Mayors<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Matthew Wood (1768&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>), druggist and Lord Mayor of London 1815&#8211;1817, MP for the City of
                  London 1817&#8211;1843. Wood was a radical and a consistent opponent of the government.</note> language is very reprehensible, &#8211; like the
               rest of his conduct, &#8211; but I am afraid there is some cause for it. It is inserted in the Times for the sake of doing mischief.
                  Walter<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Walter II (1776&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>), variously owner, manager and editor of
                     <title>The Times</title> 1803&#8211;1847 and the director of its policy, though he delegated the editorship after 1814.</note> the
               proprietor of that newspaper believes that neither the Ministry nor the Opposition can stand &amp; that <hi rend="ital">Hunt</hi>
          <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry &#8216;Orator&#8217; Hunt (1773&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>), radical politician.</note>is about to be Lord
               of the Ascendant &#8211; he has therefore dismissed Stoddart<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Stoddart (1773&#8211;1856;
                     <title>DNB</title>), writer, lawyer and editor of <title>The Times</title> 1814&#8211;1816. Stoddart was an extreme Tory and refused
                  the proprietor, John Walter&#8217;s, attempts to moderate his articles, leading to his dismissal at the end of 1816. His successor, Thomas
                  Barnes (1785&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), editor of <title>The Times</title> 1817&#8211;1841, had written for radical papers including the
                     <title>Examiner</title>. Barnes shifted <title>The Times</title>&#8217;s support to the Whigs in 1819.</note> who was for many years
               the Editor, &amp; the paper is becoming Jacobinical as fast as possible, in order to swim with the stream. The man is probably weak as
               well as unprincipled. This turmoil may easily be allayed if Ministers have courage to act as they ought, &#8211; &amp; on this your party
               would go with them. But I doubt their courage &amp; I doubt their wisdom, &#8211; &amp; if things are suffered to go on, a bold push will
               certainly be made for revolution.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have a letter from poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#Peacockunknown">Peacock</ref>, &#8211; full of gratitude to you.
               The liberty which you procured for him of attending public worship was soon taken away again, he says, &#8211; but he lives in hopes of being
               looked after again. The letter seems perfectly sane.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> writes to me that his company dissolves on Tuesday week. His letter is
               perfectly in character &#8211; &amp; he asks if I can get him &#8220;a situation to travel with a gentleman on the continent, or a messengers
               place, &#8211; or indeed any thing, even a berth in the Excise or Customs.&#8221; &#8211; The first thing is to consider what is fit for him; &#8211; which it
               is not easy to discover; &#8211; &amp; then there is the greater difficulty of obtaining it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will receive my second vol. of Brazil<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> in two or three weeks &#8211; a book necessarily <del>xxx</del> unlike other
               histories in many respects. Some parts will interest you much. I am busy upon the third volume, fully purposing (if I have health as
               well as life) to bring it out in twelvemonths from this time, &amp; thus compleat a work of extraordinary labour, &#8211; the value of which
               will not be appreciated by many readers in this country. I could get more money by one months employment for the Q Review, than this
               volume will produce me: &#8211; but on the other hand this is for myself &amp; for posterity.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Have you read Mariners Tonga Islands?<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">William Mariner (1791&#8211;1853) lived in the
                  Tonga islands from 1806 to 1810 after the local people attacked his ship and killed his crewmates. His narrative was published by
                  Murray in 1817, having been prepared for the press by the meteorologist John Martin (1789&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An
                     Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, with an Original Grammar and Vocabulary of their
                     Language</title> (1817). Southey reviewed the book in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 17 (April 1817), 1&#8211;39.</note> I had the
               manuscript here, &#8211; a singularly curious book.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have very much interested with the letters of Sydenham<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Sydenham
                  (1780&#8211;1816), soldier who served in India and then Spain 1811&#8211;1812, before ending his career as Minister Plenipotentiary at Lisbon
                  1814&#8211;1816. He was a close friend of Marquess Wellesley, with whom he served in India. He did not, however, marry the widow of
                  Southey&#8217;s school friend Charles John Bunbury.</note> who died lately (I believe he married poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#BunburyCharlesJohn">Bunburys</ref> widow) &#8211; written from Spain during the war. They are among the

               to the credit of the writers. This history of mine ought to be a good one, the subject being so fine, &amp; my materials so copious
               &amp; of such authenticity. I shall bring up about half a volume to the press in April.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I look with more anxiety than usual for the meeting of Parliament. Put a stop to the incendiary journals, &amp; all
               other evils will cure themselves; &#8211; but if you let them go on unchecked, in no long time it must inevitably come either to mob-law, or
               bayonet-law. I have heard no hint as to the intentions of Ministers, &#8211; but I know they are frightened, &#8211; the less likely therefore are
               they to act as they should do.</p>
