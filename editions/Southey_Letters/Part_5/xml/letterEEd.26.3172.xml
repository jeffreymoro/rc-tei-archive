I
               thought of you there, &amp; the other unhappy persons who have nothing better than
               Thames water in a hot day. Do you remember those beautiful deep baths of clear glassy
               water where you once bathed with me in Newlands, &amp; those still more delightful
               ones which we reconnoitred after we came out of the water? It was in these latter
               that I played the river God this morning.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Dogstar</ref> thinks <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> will challenge me.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                     <title>Courier</title> had reported on 4 July 1818, that Brougham, campaigning
                  for the parliamentary seat of Westmorland against the candidates favoured by
                  Wordsworth&#8217;s patron the Earl of Lonsdale, had, when he spoke at the hustings at
                  Appleby on 30 June, attacked Southey and Wordsworth. Southey was dissuaded from
                  publishing the retort that he discusses here. Part of it (without naming Brougham)
                  finally appeared as a &#8216;Postscript&#8217; to the second edition of <title>Carmen
                     Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp. 45&#8211;53.</note> He got so little credit by
               his challenge at Appleby that he is not likely to make a second attempt at
               establishing a character for courage by such means. And it must be allowed that he
               has some reason to think seriously of duelling, having lost a brother in one.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Brougham (1781&#8211;1800), Brougham&#8217;s elder
                  brother and an army officer, was reportedly killed in a duel on 11 July 1800 in
                  San Salvador. His family refused to believe he had died in such a manner and made
                  efforts to prove he had been murdered.</note> This certainly ought to make him
               more cautious how he offers an insult, &#8211; but some thing in his shyness upon such
               occasions may fairly be <del>xxxxxx</del> ascribed to a consideration of his mothers
                  feelings.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Eleanor Brougham (c. 1750&#8211;1839),
                  daughter of James Symes (1723&#8211;1753), Church of Scotland Minister at Alloa,
                  Clackmananshire.</note> Both you &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> seem to suppose that my
               Letter is a defence of myself but you will see that this is not the case. I take
               advantage of an unprovoked attack to expose him thoroughly, &amp; this will have a
               considerable effect <del>upon</del> not upon his friends, but upon those who have yet
               their part to chuse, or who are disgusted with his conduct, &amp; would be glad to
               have such an exposure to appeal to. I care not how much is pruned away, it is better
               to write as one feels, &amp; prune afterwards. The strength of the pamphlett will lie
               in a statement of the calumnies {of} which he has been convicted in the H. C. &amp; a
