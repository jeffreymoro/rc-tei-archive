        <p rend="indent1"> Since you heard from me last my &#8216;Pilgrimage&#8217; has never been off my desk, &amp; I have not reached the end of it,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey began <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816) on 8 December 1815, but the
                  poem proved longer and harder to write than he had anticipated. It was not finished until late March 1816 and was published in May
                  1816.</note> &#8211; such a snails pace have I travelled. With as boyish a heart as ever, I begin to have a grey head, &amp; many symptoms
               that the noonday of life is gone by. In the year 1798 I once wrote 1200 lines in a week, Gualberto made part of them, the greater
               number of the rest were in Madoc.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;St. Juan Gualberto. Addressed to a Friend&#8217;, first published
                  in <title>Annual Anthology</title>, 2 vols (Bristol, 1800), II, pp. 1&#8211;19; and Southey&#8217;s first complete version of &#8216;Madoc&#8217;, written in
                  1797&#8211;1799.</note> This I could not do now; &amp; an increased fastidiousness, or sense of imperfection will not account for all, or
               even half the difference; the inclination for the effort is wanting &#8211; which is a strong indication that the power no longer exists. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I took the story of Bless thy eyes from Bowdlers book,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had included the
                  following anecdote in his article &#8216;Life of Wellington&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (July 1815), 448&#8211;526 (511): &#8216;&#8220;Bless thy
                  eyes!&#8221; said a soldier in Spain, when Lord Wellington passed by him for the first time after he had returned from Cadiz to the army.
                  &#8220;Bless thy eyes! I had rather see thee come back, than see ten thousand men come to help us.&#8221; The bowdlerised anecdote came,
                  fittingly, from Thomas Bowdler (1754&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Short View of the Life and Character of the Late
                     Lieut.-General Villettes</title> (Bath, 1815), p. 120.</note> with a strong suspicion, I confess, that the word <hi rend="ital">Bless</hi> was put <hi rend="ital">evangelice</hi> for a much more soldierlike expression; &#8211; but I had no suspicion that eyes had
               been substituted for nose; or I should certainly have restored the true reading. In consequence of what was said of the Convention of
               Cintra in the former number (where my sentiments were suffered to stand)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> In his first article
                  on the &#8216;Life of Wellington&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (April 1815), 215&#8211;275, especially at 242&#8211;243, Southey had
                  criticised the conduct of Dalrymple when, arriving in Portugal as commanding officer, he had, at the Convention of Cintra, signed 30
                  August 1808, allowed a defeated French army free passage out of the country with its weapons and supplies intact.</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#DalrympleHew">Sir Hew Dalrymple</ref> has sent me a long vindication thro <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>. I cannot reply to him, as I should wish to do for his courtesy, &#8211; &amp; must therefore
               take advantage of his letter having come to me as an anonymous person: not to reply to it at all.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lacking a reply to the enquiry he had made through Murray, Dalrymple wrote to Southey directly, and Southey replied
                  on 6 March 1816, Letter 2732.</note> He is very fearful of what I shall say in my history,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
                  Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &#8211; &amp; from this fear it is impossible to relieve him.
               This is an evil inseparable from the task of writing contemporary history; &#8211; there are occasions on which be as cautious as you may,
               you must either sacrifice <del>
            <del>xxxx</del>
          </del> truth, or wound the feelings of others. &#8211; My Spanish honours bring me into a
               curious dilemma; &#8211; as a Member of their two Academies<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Royal Spanish Academy (founded 1713)
                  and the Royal Spanish Academy of History (founded 1738).</note> I am expected to send copies of whatever I may publish to each, &#8211;
               &amp; to do this with a history which will neither mince the matter respecting the Holy Office, nor Ferdinand would be a direct
                  insult.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish Inquisition (established 1478) upheld religious orthodoxy in Spain and
                  had a notorious reputation in Protestant Europe and among Enlightenment thinkers. Southey was a determined opponent of its
                  activities. The Inquisition was abolished by the French regime in Spain in December 1808, but was reinstated by Ferdinand VII
                  (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833) on 21 July 1814 as part of his plan to restore absolutism in Spain.</note> As for
               Ferdinand &amp; the Liberales<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> While Ferdinand VII was under arrest in France, those areas of
                  Spain that were not under French control acknowledged the authority of the Cortes elected in 1810. It drew up the liberal
                  Constitution of 1812, which Ferdinand abolished in May 1814. The King&#8217;s reactionary policies produced a number of minor revolts in
                  1814&#8211;1815. The Constitution&#8217;s supporters were known as &#8216;Liberales&#8217;.</note> there is as much to be said in justification of one as of
               the other: &#8211; their Constitution provided for quarrelling with the puppet King at its head, &amp; would soon have ended by
                  <del>xxxxxxxxxx</del> getting rid of him. It is not much to be wondered at if he who has just sense enough to understand this
               thoroughly, &amp; is moreover so thorough a Catholic as to embroider petticoats for the Virgin,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Blasius Ostolaza (1775&#8211;1835), one of Ferdinand VII&#8217;s confessors during his captivity in Spain, had claimed that the King passed
                  his time embroidering a silk gown and petticoat for a statue of the Virgin Mary. The report had produced widespread ridicule in
                  Britain, e.g. <title>The Literary Panorama and National Register</title>, n.s. 2 (1815), 89&#8211;90.</note> should have very little mercy
               upon men who really are thorough Jacobinical Atheists; &amp; who declare that they would show no mercy if the power were in their
               hands. This is a matter which I can judge with entire impartiality; &#8211; for certainly had I been born a Spaniard, &amp; bred under such a
               Government &amp; such a Church, &#8211; the first wish of my heart would {have} been to destroy both. In short it is as <hi rend="ital">fair</hi> a war between them, as between shark &amp; sailor. &#8211; It required all <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Broughams </ref>effrontery to take up this question, &#8211; while these men were acting against
               France, he never spoke of them but with contempt.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> In Southey&#8217;s eyes Brougham was an
                  opportunist. Brougham had belittled the patriots who fought against the French invasion of Spain, because the British government
                  (which he opposed) supported them. However, he now backed the same patriots&#8217; cause against Ferdinand VII. Indeed, Brougham had
                  spoken in the Commons on 15 February 1816, calling on the British government to do more to defend the Spanish liberals from
                  Ferdinand VII.</note>
