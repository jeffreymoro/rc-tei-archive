                  suffrage &#8211; than Sir Francis Burdett, Chairman of the Hampden Club of London, who
                  had called the meeting, wished. The Hampden clubs were reformist political
                  debating societies, grouped mostly in the north and midlands, formed by the
                  veteran radical John Cartwright (1740&#8211;1824; <title>DNB</title>). </note> Waithman

                     <title>DNB</title>), the main radical who supported petitions for universal
                  suffrage at the 22 January meeting. Waithman preferred more moderate reform, and
                  tried unavailingly to close the gap between the Whig opposition in parliament and
                  the radicals outside it.</note>

                  1807&#8211;1818. A naval hero and a radical, Cochrane was one of the leaders charged by
                  the Crown and Anchor delegates to present the petitions for universal suffrage to
                  parliament on 29 January 1817. His readiness to take extra-parliamentary action
                  frightened both Burdett and Brougham. Brougham, on 29 and 31 January, defended the
                  right to petition parliament for reform but spoke out against universal suffrage

                  was surrounded by protestors as he was driven to open the new session of
                  parliament. Conservatives suggested one of the windows was smashed by a bullet;
                  radicals suggested a pane of glass was cracked by the hail of rotten fruit and
