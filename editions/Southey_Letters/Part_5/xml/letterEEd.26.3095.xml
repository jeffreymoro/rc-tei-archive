               which, as you will perceive is a paper of no little importance, &#8211; &amp; for obvious
               reasons, the less my name is connected with it the better, &#8211; one reason why I thought
               proper to praise the Ed: Review there.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, Southey&#8217;s main enemy and a journal to
                  which Thomas Robert Malthus (1766&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>) was a frequent
                  contributor. Southey detested Malthus&#8217;s arguments about the poor, as he made clear
                     in<title> Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319&#8211;356. This section on
                  the <title>Edinburgh Review</title> was not printed.</note> Now the reason why the
               proofs are to be handed to you is, that (without letting it be known to any person)
               you may give them to <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> who will check the article
               against all the Parl: Documents referred to therein &amp; return it to you, for <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>. &#8211; But do not mention that it has been in R&#8217;s
                  hands.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This secrecy was probably because
                  Rickman was a civil servant in the office of The Speaker of the House of Commons
                  and did not want his name to be associated with a controversial article.

          <p rend="indent1"> Oh! &#8211; I had nearly forgotten to say that there is a dreadful
                  report in town concerning Greenwich Hospital, &#8211; all their woods it is said are to
                  be cut down. My dear G. think of Castlelet! Is there nobody who can point out to
                  the persons concerned that thinning these woods instead of cutting <del>dow</del>
                  all down, would be as much more advantageous for the estate, &#8211; as it would be
                  desirable for the country wherein they stand. Especially in Castlelet &#8211; where
                  there are trees which fifty years hence will be fine timber.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Castelet is a wooded hill near Derwentwater,
                     once part of the estates of James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater
                     (1689&#8211;1716; <title>DNB</title>), which were forfeited to the Crown after his
                     execution for treason and were administered by the commissioners of Greenwich
                     Hospital for disabled sailors (founded 1692). In 1817 concern about the
                     estate&#8217;s lack of profitability had led to a review of its operations. Southey
                     was clearly affected by local gossip because at this time there were no plans
                     to cut down the trees he mentions here.</note>
