        <p rend="indent1"> My estimate of human life is more favourable than yours. If death
               were the termination of our existence then indeed I should wish rather to have been
               born a beast, or never to have been born at all; &#8211; but considering <del>more</del>
               nothing more certain than that {this} life is <del>a state of</del> preparatory to a
               higher state of being I am thankful for the happiness which I have enjoyed, &#8211; for the
               blessings which are left me, &#8211; &amp; for those to which I look on with sure &amp;
               certain hope. With me the enjoyments of life have more than counterbalanced its
               anxieties &amp; its pains: no man can possibly have been happier; &amp; at this
               moment when I am suffering under the severest loss which could have fallen me, I am
               richer both in heart &amp; hope than if God had never given me <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">the child</ref> whom it hath
               pleased him to take away.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s son
                  Herbert had died on 17 April 1816.</note> My heart has been exercised with better
               feelings during his life, &#8211; &amp; is drawn nearer toward heaven by his removal. &#8211; I
               do not recover spirits, &#8211; but my <del>health is</del> strength is materially
               recruited, &amp; I am not unhappy.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have employed myself with more than ordinary diligence. You will
               receive portions of my history<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                     <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819), of which Southey was preparing
                  the second volume.</note> in quick succession. I find abundant materials for a
               third volume, &amp; have therefore determined not to injure a work which has cost me
               so much labour, by attempting to compress it because forsooth the public would prefer
               two volumes to three. If I had ever consulted their taste, my reputation would not
               now have been what it is. You will see that the story of Cardenas is not an episode,
               &#8211; it is the beginning of the great struggle with the Jesuits.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 25 of the <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols
                  (London, 1810&#8211;1819), II, pp. 381&#8211;448 dealt with the struggle between Bernardino de
                  Cardenas Ponce (1579&#8211;1668), Bishop of Paraguay 1640&#8211;1663 and the Jesuits in the
                  1640s.</note> This volume will bring the narrative down to the beginning of the
               last century &amp; conclude<del>ing</del> with an account of the manners in Brazil at
               that time, &#8211; &amp; the state of the country as far as my documents enable me to give
                  it.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 30 of the <title>History of

                  sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; I have desired <ref type="m" target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</ref> to print at the rate of three sheets
               per week, which in the course of eight or ten weeks will compleat the volume; &#8211; &amp;
               I will not be diverted by any other occupation from proceeding steadily with the
               third, for a certain portion of every day till it is concluded.</p>

               There is sufficient excuse for <del>not</del> being silent, &amp; tho the poem would
               do me great credit I have no desire for its publication, if any of my friends should

               present circumstances, the conclusion <del>being</del> {is} precisely what it was
