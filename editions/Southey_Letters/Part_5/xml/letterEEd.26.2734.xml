        <p rend="indent2"> I have been reading Turners Tibet,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Turner (1759&#8211;1802), <title>An Account
                     of an Embassy to the Court of the Teshoo Lama in Tibet</title> (1800), describing his diplomatic mission to Tibet and Bhutan in
                  1783.</note> having felt my intellect hungry for it after what you said in its praise. A good book, &#8211; a strange country, &#8211; &amp; a
               stranger people. I do not find any mention of the proportion between the sexes, &#8211; &amp; this silence may seem to infer that
                  <del>the</del> {there is no visible} disproportion; &#8211; but on the other hand women being every where less abroad than men, it may
               exist, without being obvious to a traveller. I can account for the system of polyandry<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Turner,
                     <title>An Account of an Embassy</title> (London, 1800), pp. 348&#8211;349. Tibetans mainly practised fraternal polyandry to prevent the
                  division of family landholdings.</note> as he calls it only in one way; &#8211; that among the first settlers there was, from whatever
               cause, a paucity of women, &amp; that it originated in necessity. As for instance it might have done at early Rome, if there had been
               no Sabines <del>in the</del> within reach.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In Roman myth, the founders of the city acquired
                  wives by abducting women from the Sabine tribe in c. 750 BC.</note> C&#230;sar found a similar system here,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Julius Caesar (100&#8211;44 BC), <title>Commentarii de Bello Gallico</title>, Book 5, lines 8&#8211;12, claimed the British
                  tribes he encountered in his invasion of 54 BC practiced polyandry. The standard modern interpretation is that this was propaganda to
                  discredit the British as barbarians.</note> &#8211; this island being peopled from the continent, there will <del>x</del> always a great
               majority of men among emigrants &amp; colonists. But if the system thus began in an actual disproportion, that disproportion (in the
               ordinary course of nature) would continue the same, unless <del>more</del> a supply were introduced from without: &#8211; to restore the
               natural equilibrium women must be imported, &#8211; not bred. In Tibet there seems to be no importation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Their Lama,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Turner obtained an audience with Palden Tenpai Nyima (1782&#8211;1853)
                  the 7th Panchen Lama. Like many senior Lamas he was selected for his office as an infant and regarded as an incarnation of his
                  predecessor.</note> like Apis,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Apis was a deity of ancient Egypt, whose worship was centred
                  at Memphis. Apis was believed to be incarnated in the form of a black bull. Every time the bull died, the priests of Apis instituted
                  a search for the calf into which Apis had been reborn.</note> who is always the same has this advantage over other Rulers, &#8211; rather
               there is this advantage in the fraud that it gives them choice of the subject, &#8211; &amp; that as Apis was sure to be a fine oxe so will
               the Lama be chosen among the finest specimens of the human infant. It is a book that gives me much matter for speculation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Have you read Elphinstones Caubul?<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Mountstuart Elphinstone (1779&#8211;1859;
                     <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Account of the Kingdom of Caubul, and Its Dependencies in Persia, Tartary, and India</title>
                  (1815), no. 922 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> The Afghanns are a fine people. &#8211; Of all the Easterlings the
               Persians <del>or the Hindoos</del> are the worst.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I send some history<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably a section of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of
                     Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> in another inclosure; &#8211; work with which I have been refreshing myself for a few days.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Can you send me the Report concerning the application of the money voted for the relief of the Portugueze?<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The House of Commons had in 1811 voted &#163;100,000 to be used to relieve the civilian population of
                  Portugal, after much of the country was laid waste during the French invasion. The Report of the Commissioners who had distributed
                  the money was presented to the House of Commons on 6 July 1814. Southey required the Report for his <title>History of the Peninsular
                     War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note>
