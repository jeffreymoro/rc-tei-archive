        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter may be answered without deliberation.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Acting on the authority of its proprietor, John
                  Walter II (1776&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>), Crabb Robinson had written inviting
                  Southey to become the Editor of <title>The Times</title>.</note> No emolument
               however <del>xxxxx</del> great would induce me to give up a country life, &amp; those
               pursuits in literature to which the studies of so many years have been directed. &#8211;
               Indeed I should consider that portion of my time which is given up to temporary
               politics, grievously mispent, if the interests at stake were less important. We are
               in danger of an insurrection of the Yahoos:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Jonathan Swift (1667&#8211;1745; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Gulliver&#8217;s
                     Travels</title> (1726), Part 4 described a race of beings called the Yahoos,
                  who were ignorant, coarse and incapable of reason. They closely resembled human
                  beings. Here Southey uses the term to refer to the mob.</note> &#8211; it is the fault
               of governments that such a cast should exist in the midst of civilized society, but
               till the breed can be mended it must be curbed, &amp; that too with a strong
               hand.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall be in town during the last week in April, on my way to
               Switzerland &amp; the Rhine. &#8211; You wrong our country by taking its general character
               from a season which was equally ungenial over the whole continent.</p>
