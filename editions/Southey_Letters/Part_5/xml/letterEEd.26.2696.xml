          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> You probably know by this time that the Morte Arthur has fallen into my hands.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Byrth, Lyf, and Actes of Kyng Arthur</title> (1817).</note> The business of a perfect Editor would be to go thro the whole Round Table Library, &amp;
               point out the originals of this compilation chapter by chapter; &#8211; but this is more than can in any conscience be expected from an
               Editor in these days. When I was formerly meditating this task I read thro four of your romances, Giron, Meliadus, Tristram &amp; Sir
                  Lancelot.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Round table romances from Heber&#8217;s collection: the heroes of <title>Le Roman de
                     Gyron le Courtois</title> (n.d) and <title>Le Roman de Meliadus de Leonnois</title> (1532) both first appeared in the thirteenth
                  century text, <title>Palamedes</title>, attributed to the (probably fictional) &#8216;Helie de Boron&#8217;; <title>Histoire du Tres&#8211;Vaillant,
                     Noble et Excellent Chevalier Tristan</title> (n.d), a version of the thirteenth century <title>Prose Tristan</title>, was also
                  attributed to this author; and <title>Le Roman du vaillant Lancelot du Lac, Chevalier de la Table Ronde</title> (1494), a version of
                  the thirteenth century <title>Prose Lancelot</title>. See Robert Southey to Richard Heber, 13 March 1809, <title>The Collected
                     Letters of Robert Southey. Part Three</title>, Letter 1599.</note> Contrary to my expectation I found the two former very far the
               best, &amp; Tristram on the whole the worst. I believe great part of the M Arthur is taken from the Brut,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the Prologue to <title>Le Roman de Gyron le Courtois</title>, the author who describes himself as &#8216;Helie de
                  Boron&#8217; claimed he had already written a <title>Livre de Bret</title>, or <title>Life of Brut</title>, which had been well-received.
                  But the poems that were key sources for the legends of King Arthur were Wace (c. 1110&#8211;after 1174) <title>Roman de Brut</title> (c.
                  1155) and Layamon (late twelfth century/early thirteenth century), <title>Brut</title> (c. 1190).</note> &#8211; at least I have somewhere
               seen this asserted, &#8211; &amp; the Brut was written by the author of Giron &amp; Meliadus. &#8211; What assistance can you lend me in this
               business? The books which I <hi rend="ital">know</hi> would be useful are the Brut, the San Graal.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

               During a five weeks journey I saw many interesting places, &amp; some beautiful country. My course was Ostend &#8211; Brussels &#8211;Waterloo &#8211;
               &amp; the three fields of battle at La Belle Alliance, Les Quatres Bras &amp; Ligny, &#8211;Namur, Huy, Liege, Spa, Aix-la-Chapelle,
               Maestricht, Tongres, Tirlemont, Louvaine, Brussels, Mechlin, Antwerp, Ghent. Courtray Ypres Dunkirk &amp; Calais. I bought some books,
               &amp; bargained for a set of the Acta Sanctorum, which I hope <del>have</del> {has} reached England.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey hoped he had bought at the massive 53&#8211;volume compendium of hagiographies entitled <title>Acta Sanctorum
                  </title>(1643&#8211;1794), no. 207 in the sale catalogue of his library; but instead had purchased the 6&#8211;volume abridgement (1783&#8211;1794),
                  no. 152 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> They gave me little hope of obtaining Waddings Franciscan Annals<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Luke Wadding (1588&#8211;1657; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Annales Minorum, seu Trium Ordinum A. S. Francisco
                     Institutorum</title>. Southey eventually acquired two editions, one of 1625&#8211;1654, and a second of 1731&#8211;1745, nos 2903&#8211;2904 in the
                  sale catalogue of his library.</note> in that country, where the destruction of the convent libraries has been such as to remind me
               of the excesses at our own Reformation. At Ypres I picked up a compleat set of Vondels works:<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">
                  Joost van den Vondel (1587&#8211;1689), Dutch poet. Southey possessed his various works in 11 volumes, no. 3091 in the sale catalogue of
                  his library. It has been argued that his plays, <title>Lucifer</title> (1654) and <title>Adam in Ballingschap</title> (1664) were
                  sources for John Milton (1608&#8211;1674; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Paradise Lost</title> (1667). Southey also suggests that Vondel&#8217;s
                     <title>Samson of Heilige Wraeck</title> (1660) was a source for Milton&#8217;s <title>Samson Agonistes</title> (1671).</note> two of
               his dramas were probably among those works which suggested to Milton the subject of the Paradise Lost, &#8211; &amp; I suspect the Samson
               Agonistes was suggested by the same author: &#8211; <del>but</del> I have as yet given only a cursory glance at the Dutch play, enough to
               excite my curiosity very strongly, whenever I can find leisure to gratify it. Vondel is not a difficult writer, but the Dutch
               vocabulary is tremendous, &amp; their capricious orthography greatly increases the trouble of recurring to the Dictionary. Their plain
               historical prose I can manage with sufficient ease. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As I could not well avoid writing upon the last years great events, I have endeavoured to avoid all possible appearance

        <p rend="indent1"> Several of your books are on my shelves. One of them, an odd volume relating to the affair of the Bp of Paraguay &amp;
