               &#8211; on a former occasion Oliver was thought of for a good reason.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1812 Herbert Hill had proposed naming his
                  new&#8211;born son &#8216;Oliver Hill&#8217;. He thus made a humorous connection between the baby
                  and the most famous &#8216;Hill&#8217; of the day, the Army commander Rowland Hill, 1st
                  Viscount Hill (1772&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>): Oliver and Roland were two

               again in consequence of discovering what he has left undone; &#8211; for he neither saw the
               Fair Elizabeth of Unterseen,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">On his
                  continental tour Southey had reached Unterseen in Switzerland on 7 July 1817.
                  There he met Elisabetha Grossmann (1795&#8211;1858), a shopkeeper&#8217;s wife who had gained
                  some fame with visitors from rowing them on the local lake. She was known as &#8216;La
                  Belle Bateliere&#8217; or the &#8216;beautiful Elizabeth of Brientz&#8217;. Southey compared her to
                  Mary Robinson (1778&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>), the &#8216;Maid of Buttermere&#8217;, another
                  local beauty.</note> nor the Flying Tree<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">On his tour of 1817, Southey reached Alpnach in Switzerland on 11 July 1817.
                  There he saw the eight-miles long &#8216;Slide of Alpnach&#8217;, erected to convey logged
                  spruce trees from the mountain-side to the lake below. The trough, a feat of
                  engineering supported on a timber frame over several ravines, was so angled as to
                  transport the tree trunks from forest to shore in no more than six minutes.</note>
               (which is the tenth &amp; greatest wonder of the world) nor the Eleven Thousand
                  Virgins.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The church of St Ursula in
                  Cologne contains an enormous reliquary in which supposedly lie the bones of this
                  fourth-century British saint who, according to legend, was killed, with her eleven
                  thousand virginal handmaids, on a pilgrimage to Cologne, by the Huns besieging the
                  city. The reliquary is extraordinary because, in addition to its size, it displays
                  the bones arranged in patterns and so as to form letters and words. Southey
                  visited Cologne on the return leg of his tour of 1817.</note> &#8211; I was very much
