        <p rend="indent1"> My poem approaches its close, &amp; will fall little short of 1500 lines. The title is A Poets Pilgrimage to the Field
               of Belle Alliance.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Published as <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note>
               I transfer to it as much of the proem to the intended marriage verses as is transferable,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                  1814 Southey, as Poet Laureate, had started a poem celebrating the forthcoming marriage of the Prince Regent&#8217;s only child Princess
                  Charlotte to the Hereditary Prince of Orange, William (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). The poem had not been
                  published because the royal engagement was broken off in June 1814. Southey did not use these stanzas in <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>; instead he reworked the 1814 poem into <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>
                  (1816) to celebrate Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>). Nor did he conclude <title>The
                     Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816) with a &#8216;L&#8217;Envoy&#8217;.</note> &amp; conclude with a L&#8217;Envoy in the same strain. There is
               much variety in the poem, &amp; it is not like any thing else. If any person asks why I call it the field of B Alliance, it may be
               replied as a sufficient reason that I wished not to give it the same title as <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter
                  Scott</ref> had done, &#8211; being especially desirous of avoiding any thing which might seem to invite a comparison between two poems,
               which are in structure &amp; manner essentially &amp; totally different.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Walter Scott,
