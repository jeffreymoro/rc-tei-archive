        <p rend="indent1"> I am inclined to think it would be better to shorten what is said
               about the Carmen Triumphale,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Like Southey&#8217;s
                  letter to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 8 November 1816 (Letter 2859), this concerns
                  proposed changes to the draft of the review of Southey&#8217;s Laureate poems that
                  Bedford was writing for the <title>Quarterly Review</title> (it was not
                  published). Southey suggests shortening quotations from <title>Carmen
                     Triumphale</title> (1814) in order to insert stanzas from the main section of
                     <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816), &#8216;The
                  Dream&#8217;.</note> characterizing it briefly as a <del>th</del> strain of solemn
               thanksgiving, &#8211; &amp; leaving out quotations from it, to make room for one from the
               Lay at the end which may lead to a good home stroke. <del>I w</del> Could you not
               quote Stanzas 74&#8211;75 78 &amp; then from 80 to the end {(leaving out 79 perhaps)} &amp;
               then taking it for granted that the readers must feel those stanzas as they ought to
               do &#8211; put the question something in this way. If any man in exercising the part of a
               public critic were to say of such lines as these that they were like Sternhold &amp;
                  Hopkins<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In the <title>Edinburgh
                     Review</title>, 22 (January 1814), 447&#8211;454 (448), Jeffrey had called
                     <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814) &#8216;a strange farrago of bad psalmody and
                  stupid newspapers ... a base imitation of Sternhold and the Daily Advertiser&#8217;.
                  Thomas Sternhold (1500&#8211;1549; <title>DNB</title>) and John Hopkins (d. 1570) were
                  translators of the metrical Psalms of David; their version was often bound
                  together with the <title>Book of Common Prayer</title> (1662) and used in Church
                  of England services.</note> (quoting the words) &#8211; such a man if he believed what
               he said must labour under the most pitiable incapacity; &#8211; but if there were a writer
               who could say this without believing it, &#8211; with a secret consciousness that what he
               was saying was as opposite to truth as it is to common sense &#8211; then indeed his
                  <del>xxxx</del> case would be more pitiable. men <del>x</del> are only ridiculous
               when they play the fool for love, &#8211; but when they lose their senses for hatred the
               malady excites a very different feeling.&#8221; &#8211; Something to that turn &amp; tune, will
               touch the sore place, &amp; spoil his breakfast.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As soon as I have finished reviewing <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Koster</ref>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Koster&#8217;s <title>Travels in Brazil</title> (1816); reviewed by

               I have to write a paper for Stoddarts &#8220;Correspondent&#8221;, &#8211; which will be a life of
                  Wesley.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1817 a new journal was launched,
                  published by Longmans and edited by John Stoddart (1773&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>),
                  who had in 1816 been dismissed from the editorship of the <title>Times</title> for
                  the intemperate Toryism of his articles. It was entitled <title>The Correspondent;
                     Consisting of Letters, Moral, Political, and Literary, between Eminent Writers
                     in France and England; and designed by presenting to each Nation a Faithful
                     Picture of the Other, to Enlighten both to their True Interests, promote a
                     Mutual Good Understanding between them, and render Peace the Source of a Common
                     Prosperity</title>. Southey contributed a sketch of the life of John Wesley
                  (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) to the first two numbers (1 (1817), 26&#8211;48; and 2
                  (1817), 157&#8211;176). However, the <title>Correspondent</title> lasted only one
                  further number. Stoddart became the editor of a new ministry-supported paper,
                     <title>The New Times</title> (1817&#8211;1828).</note> This is for the sole purpose
               of assisting him in his project. And that done, which it <hi rend="ital">must</hi> be
               by the first of December I shall think very seriously of the spur upon which you have
               given me, whether the Powers above care about it, or not. I have been chewing the cud
               upon it, &amp; my general views appear to me so clear &amp; comprehensive &amp; to
               embrace objects of such importance, &#8211; that it is in a fair way of becoming a matter
               of conscience with me. And if I could fairly embody what I know &amp; think &amp;
               feel; &#8211; I shall hardly stand excused to myself for neglecting it, &#8211; or contenting
                  <del>wit</del> myself with dealing it out in shreds &amp; patches, &amp; with such
               reservations as are necessary to make it pass under favour of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gifford</ref>. To speak
               with full effect I must speak with full freedom.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been asked to edit a new pro-government journal, but
                  had declined the offer. He was instead thinking of writing a book or pamphlet on
