        <p rend="indent1"> The sooner you can send me some money the better, &#8211; my article for the Q. having been postponed to make room for matter
               which certainly was not entitled to any such preference.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford remitted Southey&#8217;s stipend as
                  Poet Laureate to him. Southey had recently completed a review of Lord Holland, <title>Some Account of the Lives and Writings of Lope
                     Felix de Vega Carpio, and Guillen de Castro</title> (1817), but this was not published until <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18
                  (October 1817), 1&#8211;46 (this number did not appear until 21 February 1818). </note> This of course they are fully entitled to do: &#8211;
               but I should like to know what motive can have induced them to go so far out of their way as to insert a reviewal of Malthus, for the
               pure &amp; only purpose of contradicting what I had written upon that very subject in a former number.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 17 (July 1817), 369&#8211;403, carried a review by John Bird Sumner (1780&#8211;1862;
                     <title>DNB</title>), entitled &#8216;Malthus on Population&#8217; and far more favourable to the ideas of Thomas Robert Malthus (1766&#8211;1834;
                     <title>DNB</title>) on poverty and population increase than Southey had been when he discussed Malthus in <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319&#8211;356. </note> It is quite impossible that any thing could have been more impolitic for the
               Review, &#8211; if consistency be of any consequence to its character, &#8211; or more thoroughly disrespectful to me. &#8211; I shall not take any
               notice of this conduct, &#8211; for if I did it would be necessary at once to break off all connection with the journal. But when I have
               finished off {one or} two <del>xxxxx</del> subjects for which I have made more preparations than it would be convenient to lose, I
               shall then <del>xxxxxxx</del> {<del>xxxx</del> find worthier employment for} that half of my time which has hitherto been, not very
               willingly, devoted to Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Mammon &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>. A resolution
               to the propriety of which I believe every one of my friends will cordially assent. </p>

                  Charlotte had died in childbirth, after 18 months of marriage, on 6 November 1817, and Southey was considering whether to make this
                  event the subject of his New Year&#8217;s Ode as Poet Laureate. This would need to be sent to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">William Shield</ref>, the Master of the King&#8217;s Music, to be set to music (though no
                  performance of such an ode had taken place since 1810). Southey had already drafted &#8216;Lines Written Upon the Death of the Princess
                  Charlotte&#8217;, but these were not published until they appeared in <title>The Amulet, or Christian and Literary Remembrancer</title>
                  (London, 1829), pp. 91&#8211;92. By 15 December 1817 Southey had completed a &#8216;Funeral Song for the Princess Charlotte&#8217;, to serve as the
                  Poet Laureate&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1818; but this too was left unpublished for ten years, when it appeared in <title>Friendship&#8217;s
                     Offering: A Literary Album and Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Present, for 1828 </title>(London, 1828), pp. 1&#8211;6. </note> There
               certainly can be no <hi rend="ital">necessity</hi> for my doing more than this, &amp; the <hi rend="ital">propriety</hi> must depend I
               think more upon my own inclination, than any thing else. You will ask what I have been about: &#8211; doggedly reviewing in the evenings; &#8211;
