        <p rend="indent1"> I have a letter from Como, three days old, with a report that the

               poisoned. But I will give it you in <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">

        <p rend="indent1"> &#8220;A most extraordinary piece of intelligence reached us yesterday (his
               letter has no date) &#8211; that the Princess of Wales &amp; five of her rascals had been
                  poisoned.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Princess Caroline of Brunswick
                  (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), estranged wife of the Prince of Wales, had been
                  living in Italy with an entourage of servants, with one of whom she was thought to
                  be having an affair. The Rome newspapers of 15 May had carried reports that it was
                  being rumoured that the servant in question, Bartolomeo Pergami (1783/4&#8211;1842), had
                  been poisoned; see the <title>Morning Post</title>, 8 June 1818. But Landor&#8217;s
                  account is composed of a mixture of gossip and wild exaggeration and it is not
                  possible to clearly identify who he is referring to in the Princess&#8217;s
                  household.</note> Such is the profound ignorance of the English character among
               this most degraded &amp; infamous people, that it is considered as a thing beyond all
               doubt that the English have committed this atrocity. I could not refrain from making
               the following remark, &#8211; there is only one nation in Europe accused of such villainy,
               &amp; that nation is far removed in all its institutions &amp; feelings from the
               English. Altho the report is circulated among the best informed, I am inclined to
               disbelieve it. Surely it is more probable that the sudden &amp; violent heats have
               inflamed the blood of creatures who are always half-drunk. &#8211; Or that Syphilis or the
               remedies of Syphilis are preying on their constitutions. It is not indeed quite
               impossible that those who are implicated in the forgery of the two letters of
               exchange have dispatched a wretch capable both of employing &amp; betraying them: nor
               that jealousy, not arising from the enjoyment of personal charms, but from the
               disposal of pecuniary favours, has precipitated some of the scoundrels in her service
               to commit this atrocious deed. She has a known &amp; convicted assassin in her
               household, &#8211; &amp; who knows but some such untoward accident has befallen her as
               befell Cesar Borgia,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Cesare Borgia
                  (1475/1476&#8211;1507), Renaissance statesman, and his father Alexander VI (1431&#8211;1503;
                  Pope 1492&#8211;1503), were allegedly poisoned at a dinner on 6 August 1503. Cesare
                  survived (though it was claimed his skin peeled off as a result of the medicines
                  he took to save his life) but Alexander VI died on 18 August. It was rumoured that
                  their poisoning was an accident and that Cesare had intended to poison their host,
                  Cardinal Adriano Castellesi (c.1460&#8211;c.1521).</note> &amp; played a sorry wreck
               upon the infallibility of his master? We shall certainly hear more of the matter
               soon. The Popes<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Pius VII (1742&#8211;1823; Pope

                  the Papal States. Princess Caroline was at this time living at Pesaro in the Papal
                  States.</note>(I cannot decipher the name, &amp; do not know it) is at once the
               most honest &amp; the most prudent Statesman in Europe. He will unravel the mystery,
               for whoever may be the contriver of this mischief, the perpetrator must be in the
