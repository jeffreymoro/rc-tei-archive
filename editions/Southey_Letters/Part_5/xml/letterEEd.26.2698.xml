                  1804&#8211;1806, 1807&#8211;1845 and reviewer for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note>
               who so perversely persists in discrediting cannibalism for no better reason than that
               he thinks his own preconceived opinion of more weight than the testimony of any body
                  else:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Barrow doubted the existence of
                  cannibalism in his review, in<title> Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (July 1815),
                  352&#8211;83 (367), of <title>Journal of a Cruize made to the Pacific Ocean by Captain
                     David Porter, in the United States Frigate Essex, in the Years 1812, 1813, and
                     1814, containing Descriptions of the Cape de Verd Islands, Coasts of Brazil,
                     Patagonia, Chili and Peru, and of the Gallapagos Islands. Also a full Account
                     of the Washington Group of Islands; the Manners, Customs, Dress of the
                     Inhabitants, &amp;c. &amp;c.</title> (1815).</note> &#8211; this is strange &amp;
               provoking in a man of so much knowledge &amp; so much ability. It is curious too, &#8211;
               for he has expressed this disbelief before thro the same channel,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Barrow had previously cast doubt on cannibalism in
                  his reviews of Antoine Dentrecasteaux (1737&#8211;1793), <title>Voyage de
                     Dentrecasteaux</title> (1808) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 3 (February
                  1810), 21&#8211;43 (38) and of Matthew Flinders (1774&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>),
                     <title>A Voyage to Terra Australis</title> (1814) in <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 12 (October 1814), 1&#8211;46 (23). However, in the latter article,
                  he qualified his opinions a little by asserting that the practice of cannibalism
                  &#8216;for the mere love of human flesh as food&#8217; had not been demonstrated.</note> &amp;
               after the publication of my first volume<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  sixteenth-century Brazil.</note> seemed to retract it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has a manuscript in his hands
               concerning the Tongataboo islands which contains some pleasant stories upon this
               subject, &amp; upon savage life in general. I have advised him by all means to
               publish it. It is one of the most curious books of its kind, &#8211; drawn up from the
               account of a certain M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mariner who was spared from the massacre
               of a ships crew being a lad, &amp; lived among them several years.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Mariner (1791&#8211;1853) lived in the Tonga
                  islands from 1806 to 1810 after the local people attacked his ship and killed his
                  crewmates. His narrative was published by Murray, having been prepared for the
                  press by the meteorologist John Martin (1789&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>), as
                     <title>An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands, in the South Pacific
                     Ocean, with an Original Grammar and Vocabulary of their Language</title>
                  (1817). Southey reviewed the book in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 17 (April

               twelfth-century <title>Vita Griffini Filii Conani</title> &#8211; the Life of Gruffudd ap
               Cynan (c. 1055&#8211;1137; Prince of Gwynedd 1081&#8211;1137). The unfortunate subject of this
               story was Trahaern ap Caradog (d. 1081; Prince of Gwynedd 1073&#8211;1081), who was killed

                  Southey&#8217;s story of collecting human grease from the frames on which the Brazilian
