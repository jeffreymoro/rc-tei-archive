          <salute> My dear Chauncey,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> During this fine autumn (the finest which we can remember in this country) I have frequently regretted that you were
               not with us, upon our mountain excursions; and thought sometimes how busily your hammer would have been at work among the stones, over
               which I was treading as ignorantly as the cart-horse in our company.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have not estimated <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville White</ref> more favourably than he
               deserves. There does not breathe a better or a nobler heart. Men are sometimes strangely out of their place in this world: there, for
               instance, is a man living in Milk Street,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Milk Street, near Cheapside in the City of London;
                  White&#8217;s main residence at this time. He was engaged in the hosiery (&#8216;Nottingham goods&#8217;) trade.</note> and busied about Nottingham
               goods, who, if he were master of a palace and a princely fortune, would do honour to the one, and make the best possible use of the
               other. I felt towards him just as you have done, at first sight; and recognising instantly the character, scarcely perceived that the
               individual was a stranger. There is more in these sympathies than the crockery class of mankind can conceive, or than our wise men have
               dreamt of in their philosophy.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The final part of the sentence is a paraphrase of
                     <title>Hamlet</title>, Act 1, scene 5, line 168.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your picture of the Norfolk scenery is very lively and very just. I have been twice in my life at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref>, and once at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had visited Norwich in 1798 and 1806, and the coastal town of Great Yarmouth in 1798.</note>
               many years ago, long enough to have drawn from that open and level country some images, which were introduced in Thalaba.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801). Southey may be referring to Book 5, lines 110&#8211;119, where
                  the bittern makes a rather incongruous appearance, as it is much more common in Norfolk than in Arabia.</note> I remember writing an
               epistle in blank verse from thence in 1798, which had some descriptive lines that might be worth transcribing, if they were at
                  hand.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">For the poem see Southey to Edith Southey, 4 June 1798, <title>The Collected Letters of
                     Robert Southey. Part Two</title>, Letter 322. </note> It was the unbroken horizon which impressed me, appearing so much wider
               than at sea; and the skyscapes which it afforded. I had the same impression in passing through Picardy;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey passed through Picardy in May 1817 during his continental tour.</note> and if I lived in such a country,
               should perhaps find as many beauties in the sky as I do here upon the earth. Anywhere I could find food for the heart and the
               imagination, at those times when we are open to outward influences, except in great cities. If I were confined in them, I should wither
               away like a flower in a parlour window. Did you notice the cry of the bittern in that country? I heard it between <ref type="m" target="places.html#Yarmouth">Yarmouth</ref> and <ref type="m" target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref>. Its spiral flight, when
               it takes wing, is as remarkable and as peculiar as its cry. This bird has been extirpated here; only one has been seen since I have
               resided at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, and that was shot by a young Cantab, who ate it for his dinner,
               and had no more brains in his head than the bittern.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The appearance of Cambridge students in the
                  Lake District on reading parties was becoming increasingly common at this time; the identity of the student who shot the bittern is
                  not recorded.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Having nothing to hope in this world, and nothing to desire in it for myself, except as quiet a passage through it as
               it may please God to grant, my mind, when it takes its course, recurs to the world which is to come, and lays as naturally now the
               scenes of its day-dreams in Heaven, as it used to do upon earth. I think of the many intimacies I have made among the dead, and with
               what delight I shall see and converse with those persons whose lives and writings have interested me, to whom I have endeavoured to
               render justice, or from whom I have derived so much pleasure and benefit of the highest kind. Something perhaps we shall have to
               communicate, and oh I how much to learn! The Roman Catholics, when they write concerning Heaven, arrange the different classes there
               with as much precision as a master of the ceremonies could do. Their martyrs, their doctors, their confessors, their monks and their
               virgins, have each their separate society. As for us poets, they have not condescended to think of us; but we shall find one another
               out, and a great many questions I shall have to ask of Spenser and of Chaucer. Indeed, I half hope to get the whole story of Cambuscan
               bold; and to hear the lost books of the Fa&#235;ry Queen.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1340&#8211;1400; DNB), whose
                  &#8216;The Squire&#8217;s Tale&#8217; related the story of King Cambuscan; and Edmund Spenser (1552? &#8211;1599; <title>DNB</title>), author of <title>The
                     Faerie Queene</title> (1590&#8211;1596). The concluding books of Spenser&#8217;s poem had, according to an apocryphal story, been written but
