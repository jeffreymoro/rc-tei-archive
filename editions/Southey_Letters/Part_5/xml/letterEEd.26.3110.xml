        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Congo-Journals: &#8211; a dismal story!<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">James Hingston Tuckey (1776&#8211;1816;
                     <title>DNB</title>), <title>Narrative of an Expedition to Explore the River
                     Zaire, Usually Called the Congo, in South Africa, in 1816, Under the Direction

                     Some General Observations on the Country and its Inhabitants</title> (1818),
                  published by Murray. Tuckey, and most of the officers and scientists, had died of
                  fever during the expedition.</note> However much what you say about politics might
               accord with my own inclinations now that the foreign enemy is subdued, &amp; we have
               obtained something like a respite from the domestic one, I have yet my doubts how far
               the total withdrawal of <del>at</del> such topics would suit the interests of your
               Review. For it must not be forgotten that the Review has fought its way up by
               fighting the battles of the country &amp; of the Government. Depend upon it that your
               silence would be highly satisfactory to the Edinburghers,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Edinburgh Review</title> (1802&#8211;1929), the main Whig
                  quarterly journal.</note> &amp; highly to their advantage, &#8211; there is no occasion
               to seek for political subjects, &amp; it would be worse than folly to enter into mere
               party questions, &#8211; but upon momentous points (remember that we are living in perilous
               times!) &#8211; your Review is a great power in this country, which is felt &amp; feared as
               well as hated by a set of wretches who are not the less dangerous because they are at
               once low &amp; loathsome: &amp; that power ought not to lie idle when it can be
               employed to counteract their machinations, still <del>more to</del> {less when it
               can} encourage the well-affected, &amp; prepare the way for measures <del>which</del>
               upon which the <del>very xxxxxxx of</del> preservation of society may depend.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I say this without the slightest reference to any papers which you
               might possibly suppose that I had planned upon political subjects. And now let me
               state what I am preparing for you.</p>

               if I live to clear off the works in hand, which three or four years will do, I shall
               think seriously of writing the literary history of England upon a wide scale such as

        <p rend="indent1"> Your last number was a very entertaining one upon the whole. But it
               is unfortunate that Barrow who is so able a man, &amp; himself so admirable a
               traveller will allow no merit to any book of travels. I am told by men upon whose
               judgement &amp; nautical science I can implicitly rely, that Lt Chappells book is
               really an able &amp; meritorious work.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">John Barrow (1764&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>), Murray&#8217;s main reviewer of

                  Lieutenant Edward Chappell (1792&#8211;1861), <title>Narrative of a Voyage to Hudson&#8217;s
                     Bay, in His Majesty&#8217;s Ship Rosamond, Containing Some Account of the

               of travels which I had read with great profit &amp; great delight &amp; should have
               praised accordingly, had they past thro my hands. The only thing which can raise the
