        <p rend="indent1"> I have been asked for a letter of introduction to you by the <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">elder Koster</ref>, an old
               Lisbonian, &amp; a very estimable man, notwithstanding some wrong notions, &amp; a
               contradictious manner. By no fault of his own he is at present a ruined man, &#8211; with
               not merely an unsullied character, but a high one. I believe his business in town is
               partly if not chiefly to try what interest he may have in procuring a consulship in
               Brazil, &#8211; he has claims upon Government for having many years acted as Consul at
               Lisbon, during Sir John Horts non-residence,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Hort, 1st Baronet (1735&#8211;1807), Consul General at Lisbon 1767&#8211;1796. He
                  spent over two years on leave in London 1786&#8211;1789, leading to many complaints from
                  British merchants in Lisbon.</note> &#8211; without the slightest remuneration. In this
               I do not suppose that you can assist him, &#8211; nor indeed do I know that he has any
               other motive in asking an introduction to you, than the desire of seeing you; &#8211;

               all countries were to be found who possessed any literary or scientific attainments,

               being known.</p>
