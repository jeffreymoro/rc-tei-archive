It was already clear, though, that there would be a contest in Westmorland, which was dominated by the Lowther family, who were supporters of the government &#8211; the two sitting MPs were the brothers Henry Lowther (1790&#8211;1867), MP for Westmorland 1812&#8211;1867 and William, Viscount Lowther (1787&#8211;1872), later 2nd Earl of Lonsdale and MP for Cockermouth 1808&#8211;1813, MP for Westmorland 1813&#8211;1831 and 1832&#8211;1841. So complete was the Lowthers&#8217; dominance that the last contested election in Westmorland was in 1774. However, in January 1818, a committee of Whigs and smaller landowners had brought forward Henry Brougham to challenge the Lowthers &#8211; Brougham&#8217;s family home was Brougham Hall near Penrith and he could plausibly be presented as a local candidate.</note>
