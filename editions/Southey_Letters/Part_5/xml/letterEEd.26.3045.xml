        <p>MS untraced; text taken from
                  Lady Knighton, Memoirs of Sir William Knighton, 2
                     vols (Paris, 1838) .  Previously  published: Lady Knighton,
                     Memoirs of Sir William Knighton, Bart., G.C.H. Keeper of the Privy Purse
                     during the Reign of His Majesty George the Fourth, 2 vols (Paris,
                  1838), I, pp. 83&#8211;84 [in part; undated]. Dating note: The letter was probably
                  written in late November 1817, as Southey turned to the task of marking the death,
                  from post-partum haemorrhage, on 6 November 1817, of Princess Charlotte Augusta of
                  Wales. Similarities in phrasing suggest a composition date close to Robert Southey
                  to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 26 November 1817, Letter 3042. </p>

        <p rend="indent1"> The death of the <ref type="m" target="people.html#WalesCharlottePrincess">Princess
               Charlotte</ref> has been felt in a manner very honourable to the
               national character. Individuals, as far as my observation goes, feel concerning it as
               they would upon a similar case occurring in private life, and within the circle of
               their own acquaintance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The manner in which I have heard Prince Leopold<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Charlotte&#8217;s widower, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg
                  (1790&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>).</note> spoken of on the occasion impressed me a
               good deal: he was called &#8216;poor <hi rend="ital">man</hi>&#8217; and &#8216;poor <hi rend="ital">fellow</hi>.&#8217; His affliction has brought him down to our level, and rank was
               forgotten in the sympathy of humanity. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not like to write anything upon the mournful occasion in the
               common-place form of threnodial verses, which would be read only to be criticised and
               forgotten, and, under the appearance of respect, are in reality the most
               disrespectful of all things. But I would fain so treat the subject as to combine with
               it something which might aim at present utility, and possess some permanent value, as
               far as I am capable of giving it. I hope I see the way of doing this; but I compose
               slowly, and not without some previous meditation.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey swiftly drafted &#8216;Lines Written Upon the Death of the
                  Princess Charlotte&#8217;, but these were not published until they appeared in
                     <title>The Amulet, or Christian and Literary Remembrancer</title> (London,
                  1829), pp. 91&#8211;92. By 15 December 1817 Southey had completed a &#8216;Funeral Song for
                  the Princess Charlotte&#8217;, to serve as the Poet Laureate&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1818;
                  but this too was left unpublished for ten years, when it appeared in
                     <title>Friendship&#8217;s Offering: A Literary Album and Christmas and New Year&#8217;s
                     Present, for 1828 </title>(London, 1828), pp. 1&#8211;6. But his thoughts provoked by
                  Princess Charlotte&#8217;s death eventually developed into <title>Sir Thomas More: or,
                     Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829), which
                  developed some of the reflections outlined in the following paragraph.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Many causes have led me to look far forward and widely around me: and
               if I could teach others to see things as they appear distinctly to myself, it would
               be doing the State some service. Great changes in the very constitution of society
               are going on &#8211; almost as great as the human system undergoes when all its physical
               powers are developed, and the time is as critical. In proportion as this is properly
               understood, government will be strengthened or endangered &#8211; perhaps overthrown: and
               in that word &#8216;government&#8217; the best interests of the human race are at this time
               included. If I can assist in strengthening it, I shall not be an unprofitable
               servant: and I am a very disinterested one, for I look for no reward. </p>
