               translated into any language except German, &#8211; partly perhaps because those persons

                  Sara Coleridge to translate Dobrizhoffer into English, and the latter&#8217;s
                     <title>Account of the Abipones</title> was published by Murray in 1822. Southey
                  reviewed it positively in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 26 (January 1822),
                  277&#8211;323. Southey&#8217;s 1825 poem <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> was based on
