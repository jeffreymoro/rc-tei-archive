                  buried in St George&#8217;s Chapel, Windsor. He was present at the Field of the Cloth of
                  Gold (1520), a lavish diplomatic exchange between Henry VIII and Francis I
                  (1494&#8211;1547; King of France 1515&#8211;1547) held just outside Calais. But Southey&#8217;s
                  verses also refer to the rhyme: &#8216;Cloth of Gold, do not despise/ To match thyself
                  with Cloth of Frieze./ Cloth of Frieze, be not too bold,/ Though thou art matched
                  to Cloth of Gold&#8217;. Brandon had these words inscribed on the trappings of his horse
                  at a tournament, following his wedding in 1515 to Princess Mary (1496&#8211;1533;
                     <title>DNB</title>), Henry VIII&#8217;s sister. Here &#8216;cloth of frieze&#8217;, a rough cloth
                  worn by the poor, indicated Brandon&#8217;s humble background as the son of Sir William
                  Brandon (1456&#8211;1485) an obscure Cambridgeshire gentleman; but one who was still
                  &#8216;matched&#8217; to Princess Mary, who is here represented as &#8216;Cloth of Gold&#8217;, the finest
                  of fabrics.</note> &#8211; that cloth of frize</p>
