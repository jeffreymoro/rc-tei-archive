        <p rend="indent1"> I return under a separate cover the map for <ref type="m" target="people.html#ArrowsmithAaron">Arrowsmith</ref>, for so small a scale it
               would be endless &#8211; or impossible <del>to attempt</del> to correct it with any
               accuracy. I have referred to the little sketch of Pernambuco in <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Kosters</ref> Travels for some improvements of
               more consequence than any others, &amp; desired him to colour the outlines of Brazil
               &amp; Paraguay.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Aaron Arrowsmith had been
                  commissioned to make a map of Brazil and Paraguay for the second volume of
                  Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). It was this map which
                  Southey was dissatisfied with and that he was attempting to improve by referring
                  to the &#8216;Plan of the Port of Pernambuco&#8217; in Koster&#8217;s <title>Travels in
                     Brazil</title> (London, 1816), [unpaginated].</note> To do any thing more is
               out of the question. But I have had the physical outlines copied from his great
                  map<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Outlines of the Physical and
                     Political Divisions of South America: Delineated by A. Arrowsmith Partly from

               dividing it into as many portions as seemed best, &#8211; &amp; upon these I shall mark
               down every point mentioned in the history for use hereafter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Knowing as you do the way in which things are managed, you will not
               wonder that I have heard nothing <del>farther</del> in reply to my letter.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 10 September
                  1816 (Letter 2839) in which Southey passed on through Bedford and Herries his
                  refusal to edit a pro-government publication.</note> The letter itself may
               meantime be doing some good, &#8211; for it was written with that strength which arises
               from a clear view of the subject, &#8211; a decided <del>mode s</del> manner of considering
               it, &amp; a straight forward sincerity. Mean time you will see that I have said
               something to the purpose in the Quarterly, &#8211; to nights Courier notices it, praises
               it, garbles it, &amp; steals from it.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of &#8216;Works on England&#8217;, had just been published in
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (July 1816), 537&#8211;74; at 563&#8211;574 Southey
                  warned of the threat of revolution, condemned the radical press and analysed the
                  causes of the current economic depression. The <title>Courier</title>, 14 November
                  1816, had commended the article calling it &#8216;a masterly consideration of the
                  present state of the country&#8217; and suggested it should be published as a pamphlet.
                  This did not happen.</note> And whether any thing farther come from Vangoose &amp;

                     <title>The Masque of Augurs</title> (1622), Vangoose was a ridiculous figure
                  and &#8216;Projector of Masques&#8217;.</note> &#8211; or not, my mind takes that direction whenever
               it is let loose from other employment, &amp; I shall ere long gird up my loins &amp;
               set seriously to work <hi rend="ital">totis viribus</hi>,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;With all my powers&#8217;.</note> aiming at nothing less than to <del>a
                  fa</del> give a fair &amp; full view of the evils of the society we live in, the
               dangers, the means of averting the one &amp; alleviating the other, of securing the
               good which we enjoy &amp; <del>that</del> attaining that which is deficient.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was contemplating, but did not write, a
                  book on the &#8216;State of the Nation&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One fit means of retrenchment, as being an improvement in policy, is
               that the Colonies be made to defray their own expences. But upon all such points I
               shall <del>listen</del> ask counsel of you, &#8211; &amp; most probably see you before I
               print any thing, &#8211; for if the work proves what I hope to make it, it will be of
               sufficient importance to render a journey to London expedient before its
               publication.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This long volume of Brazil draws very near its termination. I am far

               he notices p. 90 is proved to be a rocking stone by the Dutchman who found magn&#230;

                  region of Drentia in Belgium also has, which you would think could not have been
                  carried there by any transport or any human strength, because of their great size;
                  and of a shape that seem to recall altars.&#8217; The second passage translates as: &#8216;Two
                  stones the size of millstones of precise roundness and amazing bulk, whose
                  diameter was sixteen feet, and whose thickness was so great that someone standing
                  on the surface of the earth would scarcely be able touch the middle of the stone
                  with his fingertips, and one of them stood on top of the other, the larger on top
