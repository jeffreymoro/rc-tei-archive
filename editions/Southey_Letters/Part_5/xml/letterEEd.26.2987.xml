                  3p. .  Previously  published: Kenneth Curry (ed.), New Letters of Robert
                     Southey, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), II, pp. 155&#8211;157.
                  Dating note: The letter was begun between 30 April and 4 May 1817; probably after
                  30 April as Coleridge&#8217;s visit of 29 April is referred to as &#8216;Tuesday morning&#8217; and
                  not &#8216;yesterday&#8217;.</p>

               requesting that I would appoint a time for seeing him (<ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">S.T.C.</ref>) &amp; came accordingly on

               finding me alone began immediately &#8211; a discussion upon Animal Magnetism. When he went

        <p rend="indent1"> Some eight weeks ago when I wrote to him,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s letter appears not to have survived. </note> I <hi rend="ital">asked</hi> him to come to Cumberland. I have done many foolish things

               but that he is speculating upon him &amp; hoping to ride upon his reputation into
               notoriety &amp; practice: that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> is engaged to pay five guineas
               per week to him, &#8211; that all the money which <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C</ref> has had in various ways
               (amounting to a considerable sum) has gone in this way &#8211; that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> is largely in debt to him. &#8211;

               which they have made for him &#8211; &amp; this has manifestly cut <ref type="m" target="people.html#MorganJohnJames">Morgan</ref> to the heart. &#8211; What they tell

                  recited an Ode of his dear Friend, in the hearing of these persons, with a tone
                  and manner of the most contemptuous burlesque, and accused him of having stolen
                  from Wordsworth images which he knew not how to use &#8230; after this disgusting
                  display of egotism and malignity, he observed, &#8220;Poor fellow, he <hi rend="ital">may</hi> be a Reviewer, but Heaven bless the man if he thinks himself a
