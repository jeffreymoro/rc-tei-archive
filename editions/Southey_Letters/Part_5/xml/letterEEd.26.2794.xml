        <p rend="indent1"> Guardant is having his face turned toward the spectator, &#8211; whether a
               Lion may or may not be Guardant without being Rampant <del>G</del>, as the Leopard
               may, is a question for the Heralds; &#8211; &amp; whether my Lion, or more properly, the
               Arch-Coachmans Lion be simply Guardant, or Rampant Guardant I care not, Guardant in
               one way or other he is, &amp; that suffices for me. The word will imply that I have
               made inquiry about the arms.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Lay of
                     the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816), &#8216;The Dream&#8217;, stanza 19, line 1:
                  &#8216;Guerdant before his feet a Lion lay&#8217;, referring to the coat of arms of Prince
                  Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865), who
                  had married Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent, on 2 May 1816.
                  The poem was written to celebrate the marriage. &#8216;Guerdant&#8217; replaced &#8216;Guardant&#8217; in
                  the manuscript, but this was a mistake; the lion on the Prince&#8217;s coat of arms was
                  indeed &#8216;guardant&#8217; and Southey here correctly describes the meaning of this term in
                  heraldry. Lions could be depicted as guardant in a number of postures, including
                  (but not exclusively) &#8216;rampant guardant&#8217; which means standing erect, with one
                  forepaw raised; lions &#8216;passant guardant&#8217; i.e. depicted walking, with one forepaw
                  raised, are usually known as leopards in heraldry, as in the arms of England.
                  &#8216;Guerdant&#8217; is not a word in heraldry (or English). In Southey&#8217;s <title>Poetical
                     Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), X, pp. [1]&#8211;132, the error was
                  silently corrected and &#8216;guardant&#8217; reappeared.</note> The half title may be altered
               if you like it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What am I to say in a letter, &amp; in what form must it be
               written??? <del>Xxxx</del> the quid? &amp; the quomodo???<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;The what and the how&#8217;. Southey was agonising over how to ask for
                  permission to dedicate his poem to Princess Charlotte.</note> &#8211; I would rather
               write another poem of double the length &#8211; See if you can shape this into any suitable

        <p rend="indent1"> I certainly think <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref> objection exceedingly frivolous, &#8211; the passage entirely in keeping

                  grounds of its egotism and vanity. </note> I am not at all afraid of such
               objections. Several persons have seen the first half of the poem, &#8211; &amp; without one
               exception they all agreed with you that it was the best of all my minor poems. I am
               very sure that the latter half has not fallen off from the beginning.</p>

                  the truthfulness of books of romance and chivalry.</note> &#8211; for I have an immense
               accumulation. With good carving, I shall cut up to great advantage. And there is a
               great deal which may be done while it can be done chearfully, &amp; while I can lend
               a hand.</p>

               can, &amp; as actively as I can, &#8211; &amp; that in self management whether of body or
               mind you may be perfectly satisfied with me.</p>
