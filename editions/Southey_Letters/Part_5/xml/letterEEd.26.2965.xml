                  of extent in aid was a legal process to recover debts, under which the belongings
                  of a debtor were seized and the debtor was jailed; unless the debt was paid in
                  seven days, the debtor&#8217;s goods were sold to meet their liabilities. The sheriff
                  (of Cumberland in this case) would have the duty of enforcing the writ, but the
                  Crown was only nominally the plaintiff. Greta Hall had suffered from the
                  complicated financial and legal entanglements of its owner, Samuel Tolson Jnr
                  (dates unknown), who was by April 1817 in Carlisle jail for debt. The creditor was
                  William Quintus Harding (1778&#8211;1870), of Copeley, Warwick, who had married Rebecca
                  Pemberton (c. 1779&#8211;1854), sister of Sophia, the wife of Southey&#8217;s friend Charles
                  Lloyd. </note> However I will not be disappointed of my journey to the Alps, but I
