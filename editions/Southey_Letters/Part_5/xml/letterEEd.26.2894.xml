                  Ramsgate whilst treating the Marquess. Sydenham provided Southey with the papers
                  of his brother, Thomas Sydenham (1780&#8211;1816), another ex-Indian soldier who served
                  in Spain 1811&#8211;1812 and as Minister Plenipotentiary at Lisbon 1814&#8211;1816, to assist

                     <title>DNB</title>), who had in 1816 been dismissed from the editorship of the
                     <title>Times</title> for the intemperate Toryism of his articles. It was
                  entitled <title>The Correspondent; Consisting of Letters, Moral, Political, and
                     Literary, between Eminent Writers in France and England; and designed by
                     presenting to each Nation a Faithful Picture of the Other, to Enlighten both to
                     their True Interests, promote a Mutual Good Understanding between them, and
                     render Peace the Source of a Common Prosperity</title>. Southey contributed a
                  sketch of the life of John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) to the first two
                  numbers (1 (1817), 26&#8211;48; and 2 (1817), 157&#8211;176. However, the
                     <title>Correspondent</title> lasted only one further number. Stoddart became
