        <p rend="indent1"> I am very sorry to inform you that my movements are suddenly
               suspended by the cares of this world, in a very unexpected manner.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My wretched rogue of a Landlord<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A writ of extent in aid was a legal process to recover debts, under
                  which the belongings of a debtor were seized and the debtor was jailed; unless the
                  debt was paid in seven days, the debtor&#8217;s goods were sold to meet their
                  liabilities. <ref type="m" target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref> had
                  suffered from the complicated financial and legal entanglements of its owner,
                  Samuel Tolson Jnr (dates unknown), who was by April 1817 in Carlisle jail for
                  debt. </note> is at this moment in Carlisle prison under an Extent. Yesterday
               evening the gentleman who has taken out the Extent against him, (&amp; who happens to
               be brother in law to my friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#PembertonSophia">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lloyd</ref>
          <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  creditor was William Quintus Harding (1778&#8211;1870), of Copeley, Warwick, who had
                  married Rebecca Pemberton (c. 1779&#8211;1854), sister of Sophia, the wife of Southey&#8217;s
                  friend Charles
               Lloyd.</note>) called upon me, &amp; I had to make up my mind in the course of
                  <del>the</del> evening, whether to purchase the property, &#8211; or have it cut up
               piecemeal in building-lots, &amp; thus be turned adrift by having the whole comfort
               &amp; beauty of the residence destroyed. To make short of the story I chose the
               former part of the alternative, upon an understanding that the great mortgage upon it
               may remain, &amp; in the reasonable expectation that in the course of three years I
               may be able to pay off the whole sum, &#8211; having nothing to begin with at present. The
               matter is in suspense at present, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Harding (the <hi rend="ital">Extentor</hi>) being gone to Carlisle to negociate with Tolson, upon the plain
               proposition that I will give him what he gave for it, which is 2000&#163; with
               incumbrances of legacies &amp; annuities amounting to 800&#163; more.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Here then are my travels frustrated, &#8211; &amp; heaven knows by no wish
               or desire of my own. I could not of course <del>be at</del> go from home till all the
               forms of the business were compleated, &#8211; neither can I afford a three months holyday,
               &#8211; when the purchase money must come from the grey goose quill. I am vexed at breaking
               my engagement with you, &#8211; vexed at losing a journey from which I had anticipated much
               pleasure, &#8211; vexed at having any {thing} to do with business, &#8211; for which I am of all
               men the most compleatly unfit. &#8211; Excuse me I pray you in a case where I cannot help
               myself. &#8211; If my place be taken I must of course forfeit the half fare &#8211; or such
