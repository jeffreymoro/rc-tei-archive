               turned myself loose for a week in an old library. – There I chewed the cud at leisure upon your remarks as to the certain &amp; wide
               circulation of the Review &amp; the precariousness of any other mode of publication for writings of a political character. They had
               their weight, &amp; perhaps would have <hi rend="ital">entirely</hi> instead of <hi rend="ital">almost</hi> persuaded me, had not the
               last Number which I found on my return in a great degree counteracted your arguments, by proving that whatever advantage this powerful
               Journal affords for the diffusion of political opinions, – the writer who avails himself of it must express none which are not
               perfectly in accord with those of the Government, let him be as zealous as he will in their cause.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had proposed a book on the ‘State of the Nation’, but Murray had urged him to confine his writings to the
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title> – something Southey was less keen to do once he had seen the editorial expurgations in his
                  article ‘Parliamentary Reform’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 225–278.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I am therefore undecided in what form to bring forward some observations upon the real evils of society, &amp; some
               speculations as to the possible means of removing or alleviating them. Perhaps the better place may be to put together Espriellas
               Travels, which <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> some time ago <del>advertised</del> announced,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey never published a follow–up to his pseudonymous travelogue <title>Letters from England: By Don
                     Manuel Alvarez Espriella </title>(1807), but Longmans had been attempting to boost the sales of the third edition of 1814 by
                  announcing a sequel, e.g. <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 8 September 1814, ‘Also speedily will be published. TRAVELS in ENGLAND.
                  By Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. In 3 vols. Duodecimo.’</note> – &amp; for which ample materials have long since been collected.
               This would ensure a considerable sale, &amp; it would also enable me to speak with much more freedom because it would rest with the
               Reader to <del>discover when</del> distinguish when I was writing <hi rend="ital">in</hi> a fictitious character, &amp; when <hi rend="ital">thro</hi> one; – &amp; this would be very advantageous in treating of the Established Church.</p><p rend="indent1"> In whatever manner this may be determined, it is beyond a doubt desirable that I should make as much use as I can of
               your journal. With temporary politics I hope there will be little more to do. If Government, as they appear to intend, should check the
               licentiousness of the press, all will do well; – if they do not, – the question will <hi rend="ital">soon</hi> come to be settled
               between the Mob &amp; the Military <hi rend="ital">soon enough</hi> to ensure success to the Government. But this, even with such an
               issue is a dismal thing to contemplate.</p><p rend="indent1"> The M. Chronicle has been sent me this day with an advertisement of Wat Tyler.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘A <hi rend="ital">curious</hi> dramatic Poem, entitled <title>Wat Tyler</title>, by Mr. SOUTHEY, is just published’,
                     <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 12 February 1817.</note> I wrote this piece in 1794, when it was put into Ridgeways hands, he
               being then in Newgate. He promised to print it at that time, – &amp; I suppose thought better of it. So little did I think of it that I
               never demanded back the MSS. By whose roguery it has got to the press I do not know. I have written to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, as a good adviser in such cases, &amp; if he thinks it better to obtain an injunction
               he will immediately <del>xxx</del> transmit my letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> (which contains
               all the facts) &amp; desire him to act for me. God be thanked that the worst which Malice can say of me is no more than what I was once
               proud to say of myself, {&amp; never shall be ashamed of saying} that I was a Republican in my youth. – Were it not for a
                  <del>slight</del> certain feeling of resentment which makes me desire <del>that xx</del> the publisher {should be} a loser by his
               rascality, I should let the thing take its course <del>xxx</del> unnoticed: I heartily wish the Attorney General would prosecute him
               for sedition.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey refers to his Jacobin drama <title>Wat Tyler</title>, which he had written
                  in 1794 and sent to James Ridgway (1755–1838), and Henry Symonds (1741–1816), radical booksellers, for publication; see Robert
                  Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12 January 1795], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 123.
                  Ridgway and Symonds did not publish it and it remained in manuscript until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass the now
                  anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817. Having taken advice from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, Wynn
                  and Turner, Southey launched a suit in Chancery so as to gain an injunction suppressing the publication, on the grounds that it
                  breached his copyright. William Garrow (1760–1840; <title>DNB</title>), Attorney-General 1813–1817, did not prosecute the publishers
                  for seditious libel.</note></p><p rend="indent1"><del>Xxx xxx</del> I am very little concerned at this dirty transaction. My heart as well as my mind has been well disciplined, – &amp;

               let me have it, because it is possible, &amp; perhaps likely, that something may be traced in this direction. I expect to make an
               interesting paper, – the narrative first, &amp; then some wider matter respecting the state of these islands, the missionaries &amp;c.
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#BurneyJames">Burneys</ref> book may very well stand in the title, &amp; I will do my best to give
               it a lift.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey reviewed John Martin (1789–1869; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Account of
                     the Natives of the Tonga Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, with an Original Grammar and Vocabulary of their Language</title>
                  (1817) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 17 (April 1817), 1–39. This book told the story of the ship’s boy William Mariner
                  (1791–1853) who lived in the Tonga islands from 1806 to 1810 after the local people attacked his ship and killed his crewmates.
                  Burney’s <title>A Chronological History of the Voyages and Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean; Illustrated with Charts
                     and Plates</title> (1816) was also listed as one of the books reviewed in this article. The book Southey asked for was probably

                     Customs, Productions and Commerce. From the Spanish of Martinez de Zuniga published at Manila, 1803</title> (1814).</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Tales of my Landlord.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Scott’s pseudonymous,
