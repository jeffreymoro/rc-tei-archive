          <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have two matters of business to propose for your consideration. I
               believe I mentioned to you, in town, the death of <ref type="m" target="people.html#DusautoyJames">a young Cantabrigian</ref>, in
               whom I had taken much interest.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dusautoy
                  had first written to Southey at the beginning of 1813, enclosing some of his poems
                  and asking advice about publishing them. Southey replied (the letter does not
                  survive) and Dusautoy in turn wrote back. For the reply to this second letter see
                  Robert Southey to James Dusautoy, 12 February 1813, <title>The Collected Letters
                     of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2220. Southey had encouraged
                  Dusautoy to study at Cambridge, using his contacts to ease his path. Dusautoy had
                  succumbed to an epidemic ravaging the University city.</note> His papers (poems)
               are in my hands, and, in my judgment, a selection from them will do honour to his
               memory. They will not have the religious interest of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke
                  White&#8217;s</ref>
          <ref />&#8220;Remains,&#8221;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>Remains of Henry Kirke White</title> (1807); it went into a
                  seventh edition in 1816.</note> neither do they display so much correctness; but
               certainly there is as much power and as much promise. In the way of memoir, I do not
               know that there will be much to say. He was the eldest of a very large family; the
               father a half-pay officer, in very straitened circumstances.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Du Sautoy (1761&#8211;1859) had retired from his post as a
                  Lieutenant in the Royal Marines in 1798. He was barrack-master of the cavalry at
                  Totnes 1803&#8211;1822.</note> Of course, the publication is with his approbation; but
               it remains to be seen what circumstances of his son&#8217;s short life he would choose to
               have stated. Be that as it may, there will be enough of general matter bearing upon
               the particular subject to make an introduction. He was highly respected in his
               college, and known enough at Cambridge to have excited some interest there; with
               this, and with my name, there can, I think, be little risk in venturing one volume,
               the size of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">K.
               White&#8217;s</ref>; the title, &#8220;The Remains of James Dusautoy, late of Emmanuel
               College, Cambridge; with an Introduction, by R. S.,&#8221; &amp;c. My own judgment of these
               papers is sanctioned by <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>. Should you be willing to undertake the publication,
               upon our usual terms, I should wish you to communicate your assent to Captain James
               Dusautoy, Totness, Devonshire, and account with him for the eventual profits.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The &#8216;usual terms&#8217; were that any profits were
                  equally divided between Longmans and Southey. In this case, the profits would go
                  to Dusautoy&#8217;s family. This discussion proved to be fruitless as Southey eventually
                  abandoned the proposed edition.</note> I may hint to you, that it is desirable the
               letter should be franked.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> A tactful way of
                  ensuring that the letter&#8217;s recipient, James Du Sautoy, did not have to pay for
                  postage.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The second point of business relates to a volume of &#8220;Travels in
               Brazil,&#8221; by <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Henry Koster</ref>, a friend of mine who resided
               six years in that country, and went to it with the advantage of speaking Portuguese
               as his own tongue, being an English-Lisboner by birth. The line of his travels was
               from Pernambuco to Ceara, besides occasional excursions, and a voyage to Maranham.
               The manner of his narration is plain and unaffected; and the picture which it gives
               of the state of society in that country is highly curious. In quantity, I should
               suppose it would make such a volume as Mawe&#8217;s;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The comparison is with John Mawe (1764&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>),
                     <title>Travels in the Interior of Brazil, particularly in the Gold and Diamond
                     Districts of that Country, including a Voyage to the Rio de la Plata</title>
                  (1812), also published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</note> and he has
               some four or five drawings of costumes, which would make good coloured prints.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Koster&#8217;s <title>Travels in Brazil</title>
