        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the half bills. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> died on the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &amp; he was in the tenth year of his age. &#8211; Say nothing more
               than this.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A notice of Herbert Southey&#8217;s
                  death appeared in the <title>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</title>, 119 (June 1816), 566.
                  It read: &#8216;<title>April</title> 17. At Greta&#8211;hall, Keswick, aged 9, Herbert, only
                  son of Robt. Southey, esq. Poet Laureat, a boy of uncommon promise, having at that
                  early age obtained, in a great degree, a proficiency in English, Latin, Greek,
                  French, Spanish, and German!&#8217; Bedford, therefore, certainly exceeded Southey&#8217;s
                  wishes.</note> How much does it contain to me &amp; to the world how little!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have great power of exertion, &amp; this is of signal benefit at
               this time. My mind is closely employed throughout the whole day, &#8211; I do more in one
               day than I used to do in three. Hitherto the effect is good, but I shall watch myself
               well, &amp; be careful not to exact more than the system will endure. I have
               certainly gained strength, &#8211; but as you may suppose every circumstance of spring
               &amp; reviving nature brings with it thoughts that touch me in my heart of hearts. Do
               not however imagine that I am unhappy &#8211; I know what I have lost, &amp; that no loss
               could possibly have been greater, &#8211; but it is only for a time, &#8211; &amp; you know what
               my habitual &amp; rooted feelings are upon this subject.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is not unlikely that <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> will do
                  <hi rend="ital">for</hi> me in this number what he has done <hi rend="ital">by</hi> me in others, &#8211; displace some other persons article to make room for
                  mine.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Gifford did make room for Southey
                  in the next issue of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (April 1816), 1&#8211;69,
                  where he published Southey&#8217;s review of a series of memoirs of the French
                  Revolutionary wars, including the royalist rising in La Vend&#233;e, 1793&#8211;1796. The
                  subject was still fresh because of the further royalist resistance in the area to
                  the restoration of the Napoleonic regime in 1815.</note> He will act wisely if he
               does so, &#8211; for the freshness of the subject will else evaporate. I shall finish it
               with all speed upon this supposition. It would surprize you were you to see what I
               get thro in a day.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The remainder of the proofs might as well have been sent me.
               Surrounded as I am with mementos, &#8211; there was little reason for wishing to keep these
               at a distance. And however mournful it must ever be to remember the proem; &amp; the
               delight which it gave when the proof sheet arrived &#8211; I am glad that it was written, &#8211;
               &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> feels upon this point as I do. &#8211;
               The proofs had better come to me, if it is not too late.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The proofs of <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>
                  (1816). In his letter to Bedford of 18&#8211;[19] April 1816 (Letter 2761), Southey,
                  stricken by grief over the death of his son Herbert, had asked Bedford to correct
                  the final proofs of the poem, especially as the &#8216;Proem&#8217; recorded Southey&#8217;s joyful
                  return to Keswick in December 1815, after his journey to the Low Countries.</note>
               I can verify the quotations which it is impossible for you to do, &#8211; &amp; may perhaps
               add something.</p>

               shall be obliged to him if he will make some speed with the history of Brazil: that I
               find it impossible to comprize it in two volumes, &#8211; a third there must be, but it
               will go to press as soon as the second is printed, &amp; that there will be no delay
               on my part (that is as far as man can answer for himself) till the whole is
                  compleated.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Pople printed Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819) in three volumes.</note> I send a
               portion of copy in the frank which covers this. If I mistake this second volume will
               be found very amusing as well as very curious.</p>
