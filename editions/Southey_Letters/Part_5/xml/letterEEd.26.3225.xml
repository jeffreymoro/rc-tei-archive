               before suspected, that John had been more sinned against than sinning.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">May’s son John (1802–1879) had been expelled from
                  Eton for his part in ‘Palk’s Rebellion’ on 3–4 November 1818.</note> Indeed by
               what I have since learnt it appears that the Master<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Keate (1773–1852), clergyman and headmaster of Eton
                  1809–1834. One of the causes of the rebellion was his insistence that boys should
                  be in their boarding houses one hour earlier, at 5pm. </note> acted at the
               beginning with great imprudence. If, as has been stated, he ordered the boys to be
               locked up an hour earlier than usual, because some of them employed their time
               improperly, it was assuredly an act of injustice towards all the others; &amp; any
               person who knows what boys at a public school are, might have anticipated the
               consequences. In reality one of the best things belonging to public schools is that
               they generate that kind of spirit, which is liable to explode upon such occasions,
               but which gives a master who knows how to direct it, the best hold upon his boys. In
               my time at Westminster if any offence had been committed by some unknown person
                  <del>xxx</del> {whom} it was thought necessary to discover &amp; punish nothing
               more was necessary than to send one of the Monitors round to the different forms,
               &amp; ask who had done the thing, – &amp; immediately the offender stood up &amp;
               avowed himself. The Master behaved injudiciously at first, &amp; his conduct towards
               John has been abominably unjust. How easily might it have happened that such a
               punishment might ruin a boys fairest prospects; – for instance if instead of having a
               good &amp; affectionate father his fortune depended upon the will of some relation
               who without enquiring into the merits of the case <del>xxx</del> might think it {a}
               sufficient reason for discarding him, because he had been expelled from school.
               Public expulsion is {for this reason} too severe a punishment for any thing except
               some heinous moral offence, – But boys are so tractable when they are treated justly,
               &amp; generously &amp; kindly, that <ref type="m" target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell</ref> says it is almost always the Masters
               fault if they <del>xxx</del> require punishment at all.</p><p rend="indent1"> We are very well satisfied with the result of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartleys</ref>
                  examination.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Hartley Coleridge had just
                  graduated from Merton College, Oxford with a Second Class Honours degree. His
                  examiners had disagreed profoundly about his merits, with some wishing to award
                  him a First and some a Fourth.</note> Considering the disadvantages which he has
               had in a north-country school &amp; an inefficient Tutor,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Hartley Coleridge had attended a school in Ambleside 1808–1815,
                  run by John Dawes, the local clergyman. John Lightfoot (1784–1863), Principal of
                  the Postmasters and Tutor at Merton College, Oxford was felt by Southey to have
                  provided Hartley Coleridge with little help in his studies.</note> it is almost as
               honourable for him to have taken <del>xxx</del> a second class as for one who has
               been regularly bred to obtain the first place. About his future prospects I am
               <del>xxx</del> by no means hopeful. There is far too much of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</ref> in his
               disposition. He has neither the strength nor the richness of his mind, – but he has
               the same subtlety in finding reasons to justify his own habits &amp; inclinations, –
               &amp; a perverse love of paradox which never brings forth good fruits. – If his
               prospects at Oxford should altogether fail, I believe it would be in my power to send
               him out as Chaplain to Pernambuco, – (a house, &amp; 400£ a year) an appointment

                  Koster, on behalf of the expatriate community in Pernambuco, had asked Southey’s
                  help in finding a chaplain, but it was proving difficult to produce a suitable
                  candidate.</note> – His brother <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</ref>

                  Coleridge lived with the Hopwood family, well-connected Lancashire landowners, at
                  Summerhill, near Ulverston 1817–1819. Robert Gregge Hopwood (1773–1854) had
                  married in 1805 Cecilia Elizabeth Byng (1770–1854), daughter of John Byng, 5th
                  Viscount Torrington (1743–1813). Derwent Coleridge was tutor to the Hopwoods’
                  sons: Edward (1807–1891); Frank (1810–1890); and Hervey (1811–1881).</note> at the
               close of the ensuing year, he will have sixty or seventy pounds of his own. And I
               have put him in a way of helping himself rather more effectually, I have set him upon
               translating my old friend Dobrizhoffer de Abiponibus, which <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> will print, &amp; give him half
               the eventual profits. He has plenty of time for this task. I will oversee it for him,
               &amp; review the book as soon as it appears, so as to give it the best chance for a
               sale, – which indeed I should hope my little Tale of Paraguay (taken from
               Dobrizhoffer) will almost secure.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  account of the Jesuit missions in Paraguay by Martin Dobrizhoffer (1717–1791),
                     <title>Historia de Abiponibus, Equestri, Bellicosaque Paraquariae
                     Natione</title> (1784), no. 843 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, was
                  a book of which he was especially fond. Derwent made little headway with the
                  translation and so Sara Coleridge completed it, and her <title>Account of the
                     Abipones, an Equestrian People of Paraguay</title> was published by Murray in
                  1822. Southey reviewed it positively in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 26
                  (January 1822), 277–323. Southey’s <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825) was
                  based on Dobrizhoffer’s narrative.</note> It is in three octavo volumes, &amp; his
               probable share of profits may be estimated at <del>xxx</del> about 200£. He is not a
               little pleased with the prospect of thus working his own way. The book is a
               delightful one, tho it will lose something in translation, – for there is a
               liveliness &amp; originality in the old Jesuits Latin which cannot be transfused. –
               Two of the volumes he has with him, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">his

               me accelerate my poem, that it may be published before the story appears in prose. It
               is very well that I should have some such motive to spur me on, – the less time we
               have to spare the more careful should we be not to let that <del>old</del> notorious
               old thief Procrastination run away with any of it. What little poetry I have written
               of late has been in Oliver Newman, – &amp; this I am going on with at a snails pace

                  of the river. The Guarani inhabitants of the Reductions resisted these measures
                  and were defeated by a joint Spanish-Portuguese force in the Guarani War of

               will seem a mere trifle to me in comparison with the Brazil, – indeed I do not expect
               that the three volumes will take up so much time in composition as one of the others
               for in the great bulk of the work I make no second copy, – whereas every syllable of
               the Brazil has been transcribed, &amp; the materials which have been collected &amp;
               not used are of no inconsiderable bulk.</p><p rend="indent1"> It is a long while since I have heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref>, – but if any thing
               had been amiss <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> no doubt would have
               informed me. In his last letter he spoke of himself as relieved from his rheumatism
               but very feeble. Winter I fear will bring back the one complaint, &amp; the other is
               not likely to be lessened by any favourable change. I cannot turn my thought that way
               without perceiving many anxieties in store, – <del>xx</del> yet there is so much
               promise about the three elder boys, as greatly to lessen the apprehensions concerning
               them. The prospect of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Toms</ref>
               family gives me a much sadder concern. He has already six, – &amp; they come as fast
               as they can come four of them are girls.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey’s rapidly growing family: Margaret Hill Southey (b. 1811); Mary

               utterly impossible that he can make the slightest provision for them, – &amp; they
               are almost as much dependant upon my life as upon his. – Our writers &amp;
               speculative politicians seem never to touch upon the real evils of our state of
               society; – the great &amp; growing one is the increase of the educated class
                  <del>xx</del> in a ratio out of all proportion to the room for it. If it does not
               become a part of our system of policy to provide remedies or at least alleviations

               way without a root &amp; branch revolution, – were there no other causes tending
               toward such a catastrophe. Schemes of colonization upon a scheme which we have no
               statesmen bold enough to contemplate, ought not to be delayed. Another thing needful
               is some sort of establishment for educated women, which should have the advantages of
