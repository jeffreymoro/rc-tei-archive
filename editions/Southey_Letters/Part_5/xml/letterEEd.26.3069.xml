                  provoke opposition, even from Whigs. Rickman had urged this course of action in his letter to Southey of 10 January 1818, Orlo

                  (1763&#8211;before 1831; <title>DNB</title>), and his son Thomas John Evans (c.1798&#8211;?), were both detained without trial on 9 February

                  Philanthropists, several of whose members had been responsible for the abortive uprising at Spa Fields on 2 December 1816.
                  Ironically, Evans had played no role in events at Spa Fields. Evans was the author of <title>Christian Policy: the Salvation of the
                     Empire </title>(1816), which Southey had reviewed in &#8216;Parliamentary Reform&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816),
