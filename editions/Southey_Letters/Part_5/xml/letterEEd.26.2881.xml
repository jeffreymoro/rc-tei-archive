               bestow any time in making verses which are to serve no other purpose than that of
               afflicting <ref type="m" target="people.html#ParsonsWilliam">Sir W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Parsons</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Parsons, as
                  Master of the King&#8217;s Music, was obliged to set the Poet Laureate&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s odes
                  to music, for performance at court; but this practice had been suspended since
                  1810 and none of Southey&#8217;s three previous New Year&#8217;s odes had been performed.
                  Southey had sent Bedford a first draft of the New Year&#8217;s ode for 1817 in his
                  letter of 13 December 1816, Letter 2877.</note> &#8211; for as you know during three
               succeeding anniversaries no other use has been made of them: &#8211; &amp; time is really
               of all things that which I can least afford to spare. However more of this a week
               hence. &#8211;</p>

               &amp; I understand each other now &#8211; but it was impossible for me, receiving his draft
               as I did in specified payment for two papers, to understand it in any other way than
               that he meant to diminish the price which he had offered.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and Murray were in disagreement about remuneration for his
                  contributions to the <title>Quarterly Review</title>. In <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 15 (July 1816), 537&#8211;574, Southey reviewed a series of volumes
                  by travellers in England, under the title &#8216;Works on England&#8217;. His review of &#8216;Ali
                  Bey&#8217; Domingo Badia y Leblich (1766&#8211;1818), <title>Travels of Ali Bey in Morocco,
                     Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey, Between the Years 1803 and
                     1807</title> (1816) also appeared in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15
                  (July 1816), 299&#8211;345. Southey expected to receive &#163;100 for each article, but
                  Murray only agreed to &#163;150 for the two.</note> Whether I was hasty in resenting
               this is another question; &#8211; perhaps I was. We have agreed about the book, &amp; part
               of it <del>ap</del> is to appear in the next Quarterly, at his desire,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This pamphlet or book on the &#8216;State of the Nation&#8217; was
                  not published; instead, Southey wrote on &#8216;Parliamentary Reform&#8217; in
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 225&#8211;278, and the &#8216;Rise and

               secure a certain &amp; ample payment for the labours bestowed upon it. And I shall
               digest &amp; embody in the book whatever applicable matter I have <del>xxxx

                  Southey had written the historical sections. </note> There will be enough that is

                  Longmans and edited by John Stoddart (1773&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>), who had in
                  1816 been dismissed from the editorship of the <title>Times</title> for the
                  intemperate Toryism of his articles. It was entitled <title>The Correspondent;
                     Consisting of Letters, Moral, Political, and Literary, between Eminent Writers
                     in France and England; and designed by presenting to each Nation a Faithful
                     Picture of the Other, to Enlighten both to their True Interests, promote a
                     Mutual Good Understanding between them, and render Peace the Source of a Common
                     Prosperity</title>. Southey contributed a sketch of the life of John Wesley
                  (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) to the first two numbers (1 (1817), 26&#8211;48; and 2
                  (1817), 157&#8211;176). However, the <title>Correspondent</title> lasted only one
                  further number. Stoddart became the editor of a new ministry-supported paper,
                     <title>The New Times</title> (1817&#8211;1828).</note> I should have thought his
               French Connections were a pretty good proof of what his English opinions must be.

                  France in 1814&#8211;1815. By this time he was associated with the Ultra Royalist
