               been no battle. I suspect that my conscience will not be satisfied till I have
               inserted something more about that garden, &#8211; but the humour must come first.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Despite this assertion, the order of the
                  stanzas was altered. The stanzas that appeared in print as <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816), Part One, Book 3, &#8216;The Field of Battle&#8217;,
                  lines 32&#8211;55 preceded lines 18&#8211;31 in both surviving manuscripts of the poem at the
                  Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733 and at the Houghton Library, Harvard, MS
                  Eng 934. The farmhouse, Chateau d&#8217;Hougoumont, was the scene of fierce fighting at
                  the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815.</note>
