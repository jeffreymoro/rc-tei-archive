It was entitled <title>The Correspondent; Consisting of Letters, Moral, Political, and Literary, between Eminent Writers in France and England; and designed by presenting to each Nation a Faithful Picture of the Other, to Enlighten both to their True Interests, promote a Mutual Good Understanding between them, and render Peace the Source of a Common Prosperity</title>.
                  Southey contributed a sketch of the life of John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) to the first two numbers (1 (1817), 26&#8211;48;
                  and 2 (1817), 157&#8211;176). However, the <title>Correspondent</title> lasted only one further number. Stoddart became the editor of a
                  new ministry-supported paper, <title>The New Times</title> (1817&#8211;1828).</note> Perhaps I may enlarge it one of these days for
               publication in a separate volume,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey expanded his article into a full-length book:
                     <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> &#8211; which the subject certainly deserves &#8211;

               winters will make little difference in my feelings, till so much time has elapsed that the past cannot be brought as it is now into
               contact with the present. Perhaps this is not intelligibly exprest &#8211; I mean that if that had not taken place which has, &#8211; I know at
