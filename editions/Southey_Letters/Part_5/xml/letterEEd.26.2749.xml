               in <del>that</del> such a state that I know not whether there be more cause for fear or for hope.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Herbert Southey died on 17 April 1816.</note> In the disposition of mind which an affliction of this kind induces,
               there is no person to whom I feel so much inclined to converse with as with you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have touched in the latter part of my poem upon the general course of human events, &amp; the prospects of society.
               But perhaps I have not explained myself as fully &amp; as clearly as if I had been writing in prose. The preponderance of good &amp;
               the progressiveness of truth <del>&amp;</del> knowledge &amp; general well-being, I clearly perceive, &#8211; but I have delivered an opinion
               that this tendency to good is not an overruling necessity, &amp; that that which is, is not necessarily the best that might have been,
               &#8211; for this in my judgement would interfere with that free agency upon which all our virtues &amp; indeed the great scheme of revelation
               {itself} is founded.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Time, my own heart, &amp; more than all other causes, the sorrows <del>xx</del> with which it has been visited (in the
               course of a life that on the whole has been happy in a degree vouchsafed to few even among the happiest) have made me fully sensible
               that the highest happiness exists <del>when</del> {as} the only consolation is to be found, in a deep &amp; habitual feeling of
               devotion. Long ere this would I have preached what I feel upon this subject, &#8211; if the door had been open to me.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s attendance at Balliol College, Oxford in 1792&#8211;1794 was financed by his uncle, Herbert Hill, in the
                  expectation that he would become a clergyman in the Church of England. But Southey refused this career path as it would require him
                  to subscribe to the Church&#8217;s Thirty-Nine Articles.</note> But it is one thing to conform to the Church, preserving that freedom of
               mind which in religion more than in all other things is especially valuable, &#8211; &amp; another to subscribe solemnly to its articles.
               Christianity exists nowhere in so pure a form as in our own Church, but even there it is mingled with much alloy, &#8211; from which I know
               not how it will be purified. I have an instinctive abhorrence of bigotry, when dissenters talk of the Establishment, they make me feel
               like a high Churchman, &#8211; &amp; when I get among high churchmen, I am ready to take shelter in dissent.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have thrown a new light upon the York &amp; Lancaster age of our history by showing the connection of those
               quarrels with the incipient spirit of reformation.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In his <title>The History of England</title>,
                  3 vols (London, 1814&#8211;1823), II, pp. 212, 425, Turner drew attention to the protection of the early reformer, John Wycliffe (c.
                  1331&#8211;1384; <title>DNB</title>), by John of Gaunt (1340&#8211;1399; <title>DNB</title>) of the House of Lancaster.</note> I wish we had
               reformed the monastic institutions instead of destroying them. Mischievous as they are in Catholic countries they have yet this good
               about them that <del>they</del> they hold up something besides worldly distinction to the respect &amp; admiration of the people, &amp;
               fix the standard of virtue higher than we do in protestant countries. Would that we had an Order of Beguines in England.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Beguines were medieval communities of lay women in the Low Countries, in which Southey and Rickman
                  had a long-standing interest.</note> There are few subjects which have so unfairly discussed as the monastic institutions, the
               protestant condemns them in the lump, &#8211; &amp; the Romanist crams his legends down your throat. The truth is that they began in a
               natural &amp; good feeling, tho somewhat exaggerated, &#8211; that they produced the greatest public good in their season, &#8211; that they were
               abominably perverted, &amp; that the good which they now do, wherever they exist, is much less than the evil. &#8211; Yet if you had seen, as
               I once did, a Franciscan of fourscore, with a venerable head &amp; beard, standing in the cloister of his convent where his brothers
               lay buried beneath his feet, &amp; telling his beads, with a countenance expressive of the most perfect &amp; peaceful piety, &#8211; you
               would have felt with me how desirable it was that there should be such institutions for minds so constituted.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">This incident probably occurred during one of Southey&#8217;s visits to Portugal and Spain in 1795&#8211;1796 or
                  1800&#8211;1801.</note>
          <del>Xx</del> The total absence of religion from our poor-houses, &#8211; alms-houses &#8211; &amp; hospitals is as culpable in one way, as the
               excess of superstition is in another. I was greatly shocked at a story which I heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gooch</ref>, &#8211; a woman of the town was brought to one of the hospitals
               having been accidentally poisoned: &#8211; almost the last words which she uttered were, that this was a blasted life, &#8211; &amp; she was glad
               to have done with it! Who will not wish that she had been kissing the crucifix, &amp; listening in full faith to the most credulous
               priest! &#8211; I say this with reference to her feelings at that moment, &#8211; &amp; the effect upon <del>xx</del> others, than as to her own
               future state, however aweful that consideration may be. The mercy of God is infinite, &amp; it were too dreadful to believe that they
               who have been most miserable here should be condemned to endless misery hereafter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But I will have done with these topics, &#8211; because I wish to say something respecting your second volume. You have
               surprized me by the additions which you have <del>xxx</del> made to our knowledge of our own early poetry. I had no <del>xxx</del>
               notion that the Hermit of Hampole<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  English poem, &#8216;The Prikke of Conscience&#8217;.</note> was so considerable a personage &#8211; nor that there remained such a mass of unedited
               poetry of that age. The Antiquarian Society<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The Society of Antiquaries, founded 1751.</note>
               would do well to publish the whole however much it may be. You are aware how much light it would throw upon the history of our
               language, of our manners, &amp; even of civil transactions; &#8211; for all these things I should most gladly peruse the whole mass. &#8211; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Francisco Xavier is not the Xavier who wrote the Persian life of Christ.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Turner makes this erroneous attribution at <title>The History of England</title>, 3 vols (London, 1814&#8211;1823), II, p. 341. He
                  confused St Francis Xavier (1506&#8211;1552), the co-founder of the Jesuit order, with Jerome Xavier (1549&#8211;1617), author of <title>Mir&#8217;at
                     ul Quds</title>, a Life of Christ in Persian.</note> P.3 you mention some Norse verses which related to Portugueze history: &#8211; if
               the Scald Halldors poem be not too long may I request you to transcribe it for me, &#8211; as a document for my history.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">In <title>The History of England</title>, 3 vols (London, 1814&#8211;1823), II, p. 3, Turner notes that in the
                  course of his crusade of 1107&#8211;1110, Sigurd I (c. 1090&#8211;1130; King of Norway 1103&#8211;1130) defeated Moorish forces at Cintra and Lisbon
                  in 1109. He states these exploits were recorded by the &#8216;Scald Halldor&#8217;. The verses are preserved in the &#8216;Saga of Sigurd the Crusader
                  and his brothers Eystein and Olaf&#8217; in Snorri Sturlason (c. 1179&#8211;1241), <title>Heimskringla</title> (c. 1225).</note> Observe that
               this request is purely conditional, as regarding the extent of the poems. If it be more than a half hours work, it would be
               unreasonable to ask for time which you employ so well, &#8211; &amp; of which you have so little to spare.</p>
