                  journal.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Murray did not wish the <title>Quarterly Review</title> to agree with its rival, the
                     <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, in supporting the Registry Bill, a measure proposed by Wilberforce in 1815, and requiring West
                  Indian planters to submit accurate records of the slaves they owned. He may also have feared that the <title>Quarterly</title>’s
                  conservative readership and the government would be hostile to an abolitionist article.</note> Your opinion upon the Registry Bill
               had been implied in a former letter, but <del>upon that</del> (as upon the Baptist Missionaries<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The West Indian planters resented the attempts of anti-slavery Baptist missionaries, who arrived in Jamaica in 1813, to instruct
                  their slaves in Christianity.</note>) I thought it likely that you had been prepossessed by hearing only one side, – that you had
               not had occasion to examine <del>xx</del> into the merits of the question, &amp; that the Review was perfectly free upon that subject.
               Why you should have taken it for granted that I was in favour of the Planters I am utterly at a loss to imagine; abhorring the Slave
               Trade as I do, &amp; having taken every opportunity of expressing that abhorrence.</p><p rend="indent1"> The Quarterly has sometimes agreed with the Edinburgh; sometimes in praising good books, – sometimes in extolling very
               worthless ones, – &amp; once upon a great political question, – the Bullion controversy, – when both were so totally in the wrong, that
               had their advice been followed this country would instantly have been rendered incapable of continuing the war.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The question of whether to restore the convertability of the wartime paper currency to gold bullion had been hotly
                  debated in 1811, with Parliament eventually rejecting the idea. Southey had been opposed to convertability on the grounds that it
                  would restrict the country’s ability to fund the war against France, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813),
                  104–113.</note> It would be truly disgraceful if because the Edinburgh had taken the one side, the Quarterly for that reason should
               take the other; &amp; if I were <del>xx</del> always to think differently from Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi><ref type="m" target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref>, merely from the spirit of opposition, I should prove myself to be as devoid of principles as I believe them both to
               be. If there be one subject upon which all persons might be expected to agree (except those who are influenced by a mistaken principle
               of self–interest, or who act openly in contempt of any other ruling principle) it is the Slave Trade. And this is the question, which
               under the name of the Registry Bill is to be tried again.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have often wished some mark might be affixed to the different papers in the Review, – a single letter for instance, –
               which might just <del>to</del> serve the purpose of exempting M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> A from any imputation of holding the same opinions
               as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B, or the rest of the Alphabet, &amp; thus leaving every writer responsible <del>only</del> to the public
