                  Koster. Robert Stewart, Lord Castlereagh (1769&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>), Foreign Secretary 1812&#8211;1822, was ultimately responsible
                  for the appointment.</note>

                  Prime Minster 1783&#8211;1810, 1804&#8211;1806.</note> was a disinterested man I never doubted, &#8211; nor that he was a man of great &amp;
               extraordinary talents. I doubt the extent of his foresight, &amp; the wisdom of many of his measures: &#8211; perhaps there would be little
               difference in our opinions, now that we must look back upon his administration as a part of past history.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is no likelihood of my moving southward during the present year. But I should be most glad to receive from you
               any information, or hints respecting Wesley.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was researching the career of John Wesley
                  (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) for <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism </title>(1820).</note> I
               consider him as the most influential mind of the last century, &#8211; the man who will have produced the greatest effects centuries, or
               perhaps millenniums hence, if the present race of men should continue so long. The early excesses of Methodism I can account &amp;
               allow for. I admire his tolerant &amp; truly catholic spirit; &amp; I accord so far with his opinions, as they are expressed in his
               latter years, that where he goes beyond me in his belief I feel a conviction it is because I have not {yet} advanced far enough. I wish
               he had been less credulous, &#8211; his credulity weakens the effect of his testimony, &amp; the weight of his opinion. For instance, &#8211; I am
               as deeply &amp; fully persuaded as he was that the spirits of the departed are sometimes permitted to manifest themselves; &#8211; there is a
               body of evidence upon this subject <del>xxx</del> which it is impossible for me to disbelieve; besides it is good that it should be so,
               &amp; this with me (in such matters) is sufficient reason for concluding that it is probable, &#8211; but it is also probable upon the
               strictest reasoning. But I do not believe in witchcraft, &amp; very much doubt the reality of demoniacal possession, &#8211; even however if
               both were admitted the absurd stories which he credited impeach his judgement, &amp; consequently weaken the force of his authority
               when he is right.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall very soon begin upon an essential &amp; interesting part of the work, &#8211; a view of the state of religion in this
               country from the Reformation to his time.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 9, <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and
                     Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, pp. 305&#8211;336.</note> Even now after all that the Methodists have done,
               &amp; all that they have caused the church to do, there is no part of Christendom where the <del>populace</del> state of religion in
               the populace is so utterly neglected. The field is left fallow, &#8211; &amp; then we wonder to find that a more active spirit has been
               sowing tares! I am not surprized at the result of these late trials, &#8211; they are a fit &amp; proper example of the consequences of <ref type="m" target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fox&#8217;s</ref> law of libel;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey refers to the acquittal of <ref type="m" target="people.html#HoneWilliam">William Hone</ref> in three trials

                  the main role in deciding on whether a publication was libellous. Its architect was Charles James Fox.</note> &#8211; whether there be
