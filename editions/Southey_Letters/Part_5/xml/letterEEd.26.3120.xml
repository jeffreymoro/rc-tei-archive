                  1813. The younger Jeremiah did go out to Calcutta, where he became a leading

               Aunt, &amp; is a man of great commercial activity &amp; enterprize. He is going to
               Calcutta “there to be employed by some merchants” – this I understand as meaning that
               he is to be agent there for some English merchants – but I may not understand him
               likely. And he says that it will require strong interest to be suffered to remain <hi rend="ital">out</hi>, while a requisition from a Merchant there for allowing him

               favourable an impression, – he looked his fortune in the face with such calmness

               proof of no slight merit. It came to me too late, – nevertheless when the proofs of
