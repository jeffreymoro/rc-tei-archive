               deeply concerned, &#8211; that I will write upon any other subject. There are two modes of

               pretend not to say what. Money has been lavished in purchasing newspapers &amp;c &#8211;
               yet he can hardly have been so imprudent as <del>well as xx</del> to sell his review
               &#8211; &amp; damn its character &amp; his own should this truth be suspected. I of course
               have laid the subject aside, &#8211; but as I made no secret of my intention to write thro
               that medium upon the question, I have warned him to beware how he takes the other
               side.</p>
