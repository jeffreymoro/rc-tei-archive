                  (d. 1430), who took the name Jack Sharpe. Very little is known about this incident. It occurred in the reign of Henry VI (1421–1471;
                  King of England 1422–1461, 1470–1471; <title>DNB</title>) and Southey compares its purpose to that of the followers of Thomas Spence

               &amp; I repeatedly said to my fellow travellers that there was no other way of accounting for it than by supposing that large masses of
               ice were floating in that direction. We heard of such afterwards in the newspapers as seen by various ships.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">See, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 4 October 1817, for an account of unusual amounts of ice in the North
                  Atlantic.</note> And now it appears that whalers have got as far as 84, the sea open, &amp; no ice in sight! – Some earthquake or
