                  it would appear in the next issue, 18 (January 1818), 259&#8211;308. Thomas Peregrine
                  Courtenay was the author of <title>A Treatise upon the Poor Laws</title> (1818),
                  one of the works discussed in Southey&#8217;s article, &#8216;On the Means of Improving the

                  had advised Murray that the Parliamentary Proceedings detailing debates on the

            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (January
                  1818) was published on 9 June 1818.</note> The sooner it goes to the Printer, the
               sooner of course you can have the proofs; &#8211; &amp; perhaps there is not much occasion
               to wait for the foolish bill which you anticipate, &#8211; &#8211; it may as well be attacked by
               anticipation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have not seen the Bankruptcy &amp; Insolvent Reports.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Insolvent Debtors Act of 1813 attempted to
                  reduce the number of debtors languishing in jail by providing means for a compact
                  to be reached with creditors. The Report from the Select Committee on the
                  Insolvent Debtors Act (1816) recommended alterations in its operations. &#8216;On the
                  Poor Laws&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (January 1818), 264, condemned the
                  operation of the Act without referring to the Report. Reports from the Select
                  Committee on the Bankrupt Laws appeared in 1817 and 1818.</note>

                  (1811) was the basis of the map of Brazil and Paraguay that Arrowsmith had been
                  commissioned to make for the second volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of
                     Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). The diamond demarcation was a special area under
                  direct government control since 1772 because of the mineral wealth it contained &#8211;
                  it is indeed in Minas Geraes.</note> He has put the Diamond Demarcation (Districto
               Defeso dos Diamantes in the middle of the continent, &#8211; Mato-Grosso, &#8211; whereas it
               ought to be in the Captaincy of Minas Geraes, &#8211; more than 1000 miles distant!!!
               Tejuco is the capital of the district. If there are two demarcations of this kind I
               never heard of the second. And the one which I know is not marked. How this can have
               arisen I cannot conceive.</p>
