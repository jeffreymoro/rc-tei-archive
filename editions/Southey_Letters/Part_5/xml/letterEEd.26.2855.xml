                  Tabernacles&#8217;. Knowles was hoping to publish it and had written to Southey asking
                  permission to dedicate it to him. Following Knowles&#8217;s early death, Southey himself
                  published the poem as &#8216;Lines Written in the Churchyard of Richmond, Yorkshire&#8217; in
                  his article &#8216;Cemeteries and Catacombs of Paris&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>,
                  21 (April 1819), 359&#8211;398 (396&#8211;398).</note> arrived this morning &amp; I have just
               finished the perusal of it. -</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When I tell you that I never saw clearer proofs of feeling &amp;
               power in the verses of a young Poet, you will not suppose that I wish to discourage
               you from the pursuit of poetry, when I disuade you from publishing. Far from it;
               genius like yours cannot fail of success if it be wisely directed; but premature
               publication would inevitably bring with it every disappointment, nor could it
               possibly accomplish the purpose for which it is designed. In what manner then can
               that purpose be effected? This is what I am desirous to find out. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The university {will} obviously be the place in which you might have
               the fairest &amp; surest means of establishing yourself, if means could be found for
               placing you there; &#8211; but if you have been only 18 months acquiring Latin &amp; Greek,
               it seems scarcely possible that you should have made such progress as would enable
               you to get on there, if the first great difficulty were removed. &#8211; Why the intention
               of your friends upon the first were frustrated you have not explained; and I should
               be most unwilling to hurt your feelings by enquiring more than you may be disposed to
               avow. But if you think it might be of service to you were I to write to the Dean of
                  Canterbury,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Gerrard Andrewes (1750&#8211;1825;
                     <title>DNB</title>), Dean of Canterbury 1809&#8211;1825. Andrewes had been one of
                  three benefactors who financed Knowles&#8217;s education at Richmond Grammar School by
                  providing &#163;20 per year; Knowles&#8217;s relations had provided a further &#163;30 per year;
                  and James Tate, the headmaster, had offered help in kind. The plan had been to,
                  eventually, send Knowles to St John&#8217;s, Cambridge, as a Sizar. However, his
                  relations had had to withdraw from their part of the arrangement, possibly through
                  financial constraints; see Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 20
                  November 1816, Letter 2866.</note> or any other of those friends, and consult with
               them concerning the manner in which your interests might best be promoted &#8211; I will
               readily do so.&#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to your own plan &#8211; would <ref type="m" target="people.html#TateJames">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Tate</ref> like
               you to remain with him as long as you propose, and at what expence could this be
               accomplished? And have you looked fairly at the prospect which would then be before
               you, supposing you could obtain ordination? Have you any other probability of
               preferment than what you found upon your own talents and deserving? I would not
               undervalue this, &#8211; but you must not place too much dependence upon it, and a curacy
               would afford but a bare maintenance. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Yet on the whole if there be no prospect of establishing yourself at
               the University, this seems the most feasable plan; &#8211; for if you were only secure of a
               maintenance, you would live in hope of distinguishing yourself and certainly would do
               so, if the fruit should bear any proportion to the Blossom. You speak of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TateJames">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Tate</ref> as if you loved and
               respected him. I should like to know what he most recommends for you. Shall I write
               to him?<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">See Robert Southey to James Tate, 3
                  November 1816, Letter 2858.</note> Believe me I am truly solicitous to see you
               relieved from your present anxiety, and placed in a situation which would hold out
               hope equal to your desert. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But you will ask me why do I advise you not to publish the poem, if
               it contain indisputable marks of genius? Because there is not the smallest likelihood
               of emolument from it; &#8211; full of genius it certainly is, and its faults are only
               Exuberancies which evince the vigour of the root from whence they have sprung; &#8211; in a
               very few years you will perceive these faults and perceive also the crudity of the
               plan; &#8211; no poet ever published in his youth, without wishing in his maturer life that
               it was possible to recall the premature publication. &#8211; It is less likely that you
               would make friends by this publication than that they may be made for you without it,
               by a fair representation of what may be expected from you. &#8211; And you would certainly
               make enemies by the attack upon the inhabitants of Richmond.</p>
