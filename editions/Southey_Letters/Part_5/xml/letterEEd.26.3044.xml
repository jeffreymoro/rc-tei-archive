                  reached Alpnach in Switzerland on 11 July 1817. There he saw the eight-miles long
                  &#8216;Slide of Alpnach&#8217;, erected to convey logged spruce trees from the mountain-side
                  to the lake below. The trough, a feat of engineering supported on a timber frame
                  over several ravines, was so angled as to transport the tree trunks from forest to
                  shore in no more than six minutes.</note> Your hams have been excellent (one is in
