          <salute> My dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent2"> I would fain give your two letters<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford had written transmitting ministerial proposals that
                  Southey edit a journal supporting the government.</note> all the consideration
               they deserve, &#8211; so you shall you have my first, fresh, thoughts at present, &amp; my
               maturer opinion when I have chewed the cud <del>upon it</del>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So far as I can render any service towards upholding the existing
               Government, &#8211; (&#8211;by which you will understand I do not mean a mere ministry, &#8211; but the
               old English order of things as by our fathers established, &amp; by us to be (if
               possible) transmitted unimpaired) &#8211; I am ready to exert myself to the utmost, without
               regard to any personal considerations. But in what manner I could do this more
               effectually than I have for seven years past been endeavouring to do it in the
                  QR<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Quarterly Review</title>,
                  for which Southey had written since its inception in 1809.</note>, &amp; during
               four years of that time in the E Register,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808&#8211;1811</title> (1810&#8211;1813), for
                  which Southey wrote the historical sections.</note> &#8211; I cannot tell. <del>It seems
                  to me the me that</del> To the management of a journal (if any such thing be
               contemplated) I am not equal. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If a full exposition of the state of things, &#8211; a full display of our
               danger, &#8211; &amp; a resolute appeal to the sound part of the community should be
               thought likely to be beneficial, I am ready to undertake the task, &amp; to perform
               it with all my heart &amp; with all my soul, &amp; with all my strength. The possible
               advantage is that such an appeal might strengthen the Government, &amp; enable them
               to do what I advised in 1812<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319&#8211;356, where Southey
                  blamed the manufacturing system for the physical and moral degeneracy of the urban
                  poor, argued for an improved system of parochial education, for suppression of the
                  radical press, for cultivation of wastelands and for the employment of the
                  unemployed on public works.</note> &#8211; &amp; what <hi rend="ital">must be done</hi>
               if they would escape an attempt <hi rend="ital">at least</hi> at a Jacobinical
               revolution, &#8211; that is to curb the licentiousness of the press. My remedy is to make
               transportation the punishment for sedition, &#8211; &amp; thus to rid the country of those
               who would set it on fire. &#8211; I could produce such a pamphlett as should startle the
               nation, if exertions were made to circulate it: &#8211; without such exertions it would
               fail to do this, &#8211; Burkes<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Edmund Burke
                  (1729&#8211;1797; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Reflections on the Revolution in
                     France</title> (1790).</note> name was such as to make thousands read his
                  <del>book wh</del> Reflections who were incapable of understanding it. My name
               carries with it no such charm, &#8211; but all who read shall understand me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It does not appear to me (at present) that it would be of any use to
               see <ref type="m" target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Ld L.</ref> or any of the persons in power. I
               believe <del>they</del> that an interview would tend to abate their favourable
               opinion of my practical talents, &#8211; in whatever manner they might estimate me in other
               respects, I am not a man of business &#8211; I am not a man of the world. They might be
               displeased, &#8211; I am certain they would be disappointed. In the open field of
               conversation there are five hundred men who might <del>x</del> excel me, &#8211; or baffle
               me; &#8211; <del>let me</del> but at my post I defy the world.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The sum of this is that if it be desired I will write upon the State
               of the Nation,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey planned, but did not
                  write, a book on the &#8216;State of the Nation&#8217;.</note> &#8211; taking it in all points of
               view, looking the danger fairly in the face, &amp; calling upon the Government to act
                  <hi rend="ital">vigorously</hi>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am interrupted, &#8211; this however may suffice for to night.</p>
