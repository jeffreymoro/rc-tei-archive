        <p rend="indent1"> You see I am flourishing in the newspapers, as much as <ref type="m" target="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna Southcott</ref> did before her expected accouchement. And I have
               not flourished in Chancery because a <ref type="m" target="people.html#Winterbottom">Presbyterian
                  parson</ref> has made oath that I gave the MSS to him, &amp; to
               another person &#8211; whom I never saw in my life. There is no standing against perjury,
               &amp; therefore it is useless to pursue the affair into a court of law.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey refers to the affair of
                     his Jacobin drama <title>Wat Tyler</title>, which he had written
                  in 1794 and sent to James Ridgway (1755&#8211;1838) and Henry Symonds (1741&#8211;1816),
                  radical booksellers, for publication; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12
                  January 1795], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>,
                  Letter 123. Ridgway and Symonds did not publish it and it remained in manuscript
                  until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass the now anti-Jacobin Southey,
                  appeared in 1817. Having taken advice from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam                         people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, Southey launched a suit in Chancery in
                  order to gain an injunction suppressing the publication, on the grounds that it
                  breached his copyright. The case was heard on 18&#8211;19 March 1817 and, in Southey&#8217;s
                  view, lost because of perjury in an affidavit given to the court by William
                  Winterbotham. The latter swore that Southey had, when visiting Newgate
                  prison, where Winterbotham, Ridgway and Symonds were all confined, given the
                  manuscript of <title>Wat Tyler</title> and the copyright to Winterbotham and
                  Daniel Isaac Eaton (1753&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), to do with as they
                  liked.</note> I have addressed two brief letters to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SmithWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Smith</ref> in the Courier,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Smith had denounced Southey in the House of Commons on 14 March
                  1817 in the debate on the Seditious Meetings Bill, condemning &#8216;the settled,
                  determined malignity of a renegado&#8217; and comparing Southey&#8217;s arguments against
                  radical views in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 227, with
                  those expressed in <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817), Act 2, lines 103&#8211;112. In
                  reply, Southey wrote two letters which he originally hoped to publish in the
                     <title>Courier</title>: Southey to William Smith, 17 March 1817 (Letter 2943)
                  and Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title> [19 March 1817] (Letters
                  2946). These two letters were sent to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, on 17 and 19
                  March 1817 (Letters 2944 and 2948), for him to forward to the newspaper. In the
                  event, Wynn&#8217;s absence from home led to a delay in his receiving the letters. By
                  the time he did so, the public debate had moved on and Southey therefore decided
                  not to publish them in the <title>Courier</title>, but instead to incorporate them
                  into his pamphlet <title>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.</title>
                  (1817).</note> &#8211; &amp; there the matter will end on my part, &#8211; unless he is fool
               enough to reply to them. In the second of those letters you will see the history of
               Wat Tyler, &#8211; as far as it was needful to state it. &#8211; There was no occasion for
               stating that about a year after it was written, I thought of making a serious
               historical drama upon the same subject, which <del>it</del> would have been on the
               side of the mob in its main feeling, &#8211; but in a very different way; &#8211; &amp; indeed
               under the same circumstances I should have brained a tax-gatherer just as he did. The

               should suppose that the danger is over, &#8211; &amp; think the disease is removed, because

               read, &amp; to separate that which would be profitable for all, from that which
               scarcely half a dozen men in England can understand (I certainly am not one of the
