               be in the course of the summer, for if the Extent should not pursue its course (which in all likelihood it will) the <ref type="m" target="people.html#WoodSara">mortgagee</ref> will bring it to sale. I must make up my mind in London, &amp; if the ways &amp; means be
               forthcoming, leave <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> to act for me.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref> and the surrounding estate had suffered from the
                  complicated financial and legal entanglements of their owner, Samuel Tolson Jnr (dates unknown) who was by April 1817 in Carlisle
                  jail for debt; a creditor had taken out an injunction (an &#8216;extent in aid&#8217;) against him, seeking recompense by forcing a sale of the
                  estate.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The greater part of the property is freehold, but there is a part which is customary<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Customary tenantright was a Cumbrian form of tenure equivalent to copyhold. The tenant in practice had the same
                  security as a freeholder, but was required to pay &#8216;fines&#8217; to the Lord of the Manor on particular occasions, as Southey
                  outlines.</note> &amp; pays a fine of 33&#163; on changing proprietor or the Death of the King. The sum which I could give is 2000&#163;
               taking it with the charges of legacies &amp; annuities to the value of 800&#163; more. The rents are 75 my own house (which <hi rend="ital">is very dear</hi> but includes some furniture valued the other day at 42&#163; after the expiration of my unexpired 14 years) 35 <ref type="m" target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barkers</ref>, the nursery garden 40&#163; (of course it would be much less if laid down in
               grass) &amp; the field 8 &#8211; or ten: &#8211; in all 158&#163; &#8211; or 160. But Clarke<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Clark (dates

               &amp; a ruined man. The property would probably sell for 4 or 500 more than this if it were cut up for building: &#8211; so that there can be
               no danger of ultimate loss by it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We will talk over this matter in town. I am to have 1000 guineas for the History of the War,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &#8211; which I may calculate upon for Xmas in

                  227, with those expressed in <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817), Act 2, lines 103&#8211;112. Southey&#8217;s response was his <title>A Letter to
