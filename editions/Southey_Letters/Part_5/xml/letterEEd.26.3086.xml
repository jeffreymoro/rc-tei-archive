        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is not till this evening that I have been able to acknowledge your
               obliging letter of Jan<hi rend="sup">y</hi>. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. by thanking you
               for enriching my library with your works.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Butler&#8217;s <title>Philological and Biographical Works</title> (1817), no. 507
                  in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, is noted as &#8216;Presentation Copy, with
                  an autograph note from the author&#8217;. </note> They arrived only an hour ago in a box
               which I had long been expecting from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Longmans</ref>. I look with great pleasure to a careful perusal of
               them. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have indeed Sir written in a spirit of true Catholic charity, in
               the true acceptation of the word. And did the question of a reunion depend upon such
               minds as yours, that most desirable of all objects would easily be effected. As yet,
               according to human judgement, it is far distant, &#8211; yet sooner or later we shall be
               one fold, under one Shepherd, &#8211; &amp; the increasing toleration of your Church is an
               advance toward it. I shall be much interested in your history of the English
               Catholics. Some of your martyrs (for I allow &amp; respect the name) were men every
               way excellent. I wonder that a collection of Southwells works is not published. He
               holds no mean rank among the Elizabethan poets, &amp; as a prose writer, he has
               rarely been excelled.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> His &#8220;Epistle of Comfort, to the Reverend Priests &amp; to the
               Honorable, Worshipful &amp; other of the Lay sort restrained in durance for the
               Catholic faith&#8221; is a most beautiful composition of its kind.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southwell (1561&#8211;1595; <title>DNB</title>), the English
                  Jesuit, was tortured and executed for high treason. His <title>An Epistle of
                     Comfort</title> (1587) was written to counsel Catholics suffering persecution.
                  Southey owned an undated edition published in Paris, no. 2712 in the sale
                  catalogue of his library.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am still busy with the Jesuits in South America; &#8211; their
               establishments in the centre of that continent among the Chiquitos &amp; the Moxos
               are less known than those in Paraguay, &#8211; but not less interesting; &amp; had they not
               been placed in a most unhealthy region, they would soon have outstripped them in
               prosperity. <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  where the Jesuit missions to these peoples are described.</note> I verily believe
               that if the Jesuits had not been expelled from that country, there would not at this
               day <del>be</del> have been a single horde exisiting there in a savage state. My
               concluding volume is in great forwardness, &amp; will contain a great portion of
               matter altogether new to the public, being drawn from unprinted documents.</p>
