        <p rend="indent1"> In the ways of thanks it is quite unnecessary that I should say anything to you.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Here Southey comments on a draft of Bedford&#8217;s review of the poems he had published as Poet Laureate. The piece was intended for the
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, but did not appear.</note> The whole introductory matter is curious &amp; to the purpose. I
               would only wish it improved by a word or two implying respect for Davenant,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir William Davenant
                  (1606&#8211;1668; <title>DNB</title>), Poet Laureate 1660&#8211;1668.</note> &#8211; a hint concerning the absolute doggrel of Cibbers notes<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Colley Cibber (1671&#8211;1757; <title>DNB</title>), Poet Laureate 1730&#8211;1757, notorious for
                  inconsequential and vain poems accompanied by annotations. His New Year&#8217;s and Birthday Odes had been printed in the
                     <title>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</title>. </note> (or perhaps a specimen of them, &#8211; to be found in the magazines of his day) &#8211; &amp;
               more praise of Whitehead,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">William Whitehead (1715&#8211;1785; <title>DNB</title>), Poet Laureate
                  1757&#8211;1785.</note> who performd his task with more than respectability.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> P. 11. you may add that this piece of <del>xx theatre</del> history (the interview at the lev&#233;e) &#8211; <del>was told</del>
               has been told both in prose &amp; verse,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">See <title>The Satirist; or, Monthly Meteor</title>, 13

                  portrayed as motivated by the desire for money and office. </note> &#8211; &amp; that it will doubtless give great pleasure to the well
               intentioned authors of the story to be informed what the real circumstances were, as it must be very satisfactory to them to perceive
               how capable they were of conceiving what should be the conduct of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">

               asserted the severest test to which poetry can be put is that of translating it into prose &#8211; the charm of verse being taken away, the
               matter has then only its own strength &amp; dignity to support it. To the test the C Triumphale was put by certain critics,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 22 (January 1814), 447&#8211;454 (448&#8211;450), claimed that Southey&#8217;s Laureate
                  poem <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814) was prosaic and to prove its point printed several stanzas as prose.</note> &#8211; &amp; the
               result was <del>th</del> (as was said in the Times) &#8211; that they produced some of the best prose which had ever appeard in their

                  to be denominated prose, they are some of the best prose I ever read in the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>.&#8217;</note>
