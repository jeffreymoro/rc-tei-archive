          <salute>My dear James,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Never, I entreat you, think it necessary to apologise for, or to
               explain any long interval of correspondence on your part, lest it should seem to
               require a like formality on mine, and make that be regarded in the irksome character
               of a debt, which is only valuable in proportion as it is voluntary. We have both of
               us business always to stand in our excuse, nor can any excuses ever be needed between
               you and me. I thank you for your letter and your inquiries. Time is passing on, and
               it does its healing work slowly, but will do it effectually at last. As much as I was
               sensible of the happiness which I possessed, so much must I unavoidably feel the
               change which the privation of that happiness produces. My hopes and prospects in life
               are all altered, and my spirits never again can be what they have been.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s son, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>, had died on 17 April 1816.</note> But I have a living
               faith, I am resigned to what is (if I know my own heart, truly and perfectly
               resigned), thankful for what has been, and happy in the sure and certain hope of what
               will be, when this scene of probation shall be over. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall be glad to receive your communications upon the distresses of
               the manufacturers; they might probably have been of great use had they reached me
               when the last Quarterly was in the press. But I may, perhaps, still turn them to some
               account. There is another paper of mine upon the poor in the sixteenth number of the
                  Quarterly,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to Southey&#8217;s
                  articles from the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319&#8211;356 (no.
                  16), and 15 (April 1816), 187&#8211;235. The Luddites protested, by smashing machinery,
                  against the introduction of new technologies in the textile trades.</note> written
               when the Luddites, after their greatest outrages, seemed for a time to be quiet. In
               that paper I had recommended, as one means of employing hands that were out of work,
               the fitness of forming good footpaths along the road side, wherever the nature of the
               soil was not such as to render it unnecessary. This was (foolish enough) cut out by
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">the editor</ref>; but
               when the great object is to discover means of employing willing industry, the hint
               might be of some service wherever it is applicable. In the way of palliating an evil
               of which the roots lie deeper than has yet, perhaps, been stated, your efforts should
               be directed towards finding employment, and making the small wages that can be
               afforded go as far as possible; the reports of the Bettering Society show what may be
               done by saving the poor from the exactions of petty shopkeepers;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Society for Bettering the Condition and
                  Increasing the Comforts of the Poor, established in 1796. Its
                     <title>Reports</title> had been amongst the volumes surveyed by Southey in
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (April 1816), 187&#8211;235 (205 for the conduct
                  of &#8216;petty shopkeepers&#8217;).</note> and as winter approaches great relief may be
               given, by obtaining through the London Association supplies of fish.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Association for the Relief of the
                  Manufacturing and Labouring Poor, established in May 1812, whose second
                     <title>Report</title>, published in 1815, had focused on &#8216;The General Supply of
                  Fish in the Metropolis and the Interior&#8217;. </note> Believe me, that person who
               should instruct the poor how to prepare cheap food in the most savoury manner would
               confer upon them a benefit of the greatest importance, both to their comfort, health,
               and habits; for comforts produce good habits, unless there be a strong predisposition
               to evil. I have much yet to say upon this subject, which may perhaps furnish matter
               for a third paper in the Review. Sooner or later I trust we shall get the national
                  schools<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The schools established by the

                  Southey&#8217;s friend Andrew Bell. They provided primary education in accordance with
                  the doctrines of the Church of England. Southey had already propagandised for them
                  in his <title>The Origin, Nature and Object, of the New System of
                     Education</title> (1812). The schools did not receive a State grant until
                  1833.</note> placed upon a national establishment; this measure I shall never
               cease to recommend till it be effected.</p>
