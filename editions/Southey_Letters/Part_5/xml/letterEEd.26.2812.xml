        <p rend="indent1"> The inclosed Table is from G. Rose pamphlet on the Saving Banks,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">George Rose (1744&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>),
                     <title>Observations on Banks for Savings</title> (1816). Rose advocated
                  promoting savings banks by requiring them to deposit their funds in an account at
                  the Bank of England and to pay interest to their account holders &#8211; a proposal
                  embodied in Rose&#8217;s Savings Banks (England) Act (1817).</note> &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MorganJohnJames">Morgan</ref> supplied it, &#8211; &amp; he is a man of such skill in
               these matters that the state of the table must of course be imputed to the
               transcriber &#8211; or printer, rather than to him. You who understand these things will
               see at a glance if it be as full of errors as it appears to me who knows nothing of
               them, &#8211; &amp; if it be so you had better mention it to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rose
               that he may a new one printed. I wanted to make use of the Table to day, &amp;
               discovered immediately in the first line that the compound interest had been
               forgotten; &#8211; but there were other blunders for which I could not find a key.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> These Banks seem to me a sort of Sinking Fund which may extinguish
               the poor rates in time. &#8211; I wish your last Tables had contained the number of Paupers
               in each county, &#8211; &amp; the average of the poor rates.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Rickman had provided Southey with information for his article
                  &#8216;On the Poor&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (April 1816), 187&#8211;235.</note> I
               should like also to know what proportion these bear to the different prices of labour
               in different counties.</p>
