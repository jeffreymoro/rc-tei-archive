          <salute> My dear Koster,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for your narrative, you can very well understand how deep an interest it would excite in me.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Koster had sent Southey an account of the insurrection of March&#8211;May 1817 against Portuguese rule in
                  Pernambuco, of which Koster had been an eye-witness.</note> When you come home, it will form a valuable part of your second
                  volume,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Koster&#8217;s <title>Travels in Brazil</title> (1816) went into a second edition in 1817,
                  but his death in 1820 prevented him writing a sequel.</note> you may look forward to this with good encouragement, <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> writes me word that your second edition is doing well. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will think it strange that there should be any difficulty in procuring a Chaplain, nor could I have believed it,
               without so shocking a proof. The <ref type="m" target="people.html#HowleyWilliam">Bp. of London</ref> informs me that he cannot provide
               one for Bahia (where the salary is 500&#163;) and that he has a great many appointments in the West Indies which he cannot fill.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Through Koster, the English expatriate community in Pernambuco had sent Southey a letter requesting his
                  help in securing for them a chaplain, rather than directly approaching the church authorities. Discovering that responsibility for
                  such appointments lay with the Bishop of London, Southey was endeavouring to help.</note> He asked me to recommend a person if I
               knew one. I thought of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteJames">James White</ref> (the brother of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</ref>) and proposed it
               to him, but if his own inclination had been stronger, his Mother&#8217;s<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary White, n&#233;e Neville
                  (1756&#8211;1833).</note> life and state of health would have been objection enough. And here the matter rests. The difficulty arises from
               a vice in the very nature of our establishment, which I once touched upon in the Q. Review,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s &#8216;On the Poor&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (April 1816), 187&#8211;235 (228&#8211;229).</note> &#8211; that men go into the Church
               only at one age, and then because they are bred to it, as others to the Law or the Army: the door is shut (by custom tho not by laws)
               against those persons among whom the Roman Catholics and the Methodists recruit their most efficient troops, men in middle life, who
               from deliberate choice, and a conviction of the vanity of worldly pursuits (which oftentimes nothing but affliction and experience will
               produce) devote themselves to the service of God and their brethren, and are ready to go wherever they may be useful. I am still making
               enquiry. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My third volume is coming on steadily and well.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The third volume of Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> Your M.S. concerning the insurrection of 1711 has been very useful, and the
               next proof will begin with it.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  III, p. vi, thanked Koster for providing a transcription of &#8216;Guerra Civil ou Sedissoens de Pernambuco Exemplo Memoravel aos
                  vindouros 1710&#8217;, no. 3840 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. This manuscript dealt with the Mascate War or &#8216;War of the
                  Peddlers&#8217; in Pernambuco in 1710&#8211;1711, covered in <title>History of Brazil</title>, III, pp. 85&#8211;107.</note> Perhaps you may be able
               to inform me, in time for the supplementary notes, whether the Bernardo Vieira of these troubles,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernardo Vieira de Mello (1658&#8211;1714), leader of the insurrection at Pernambuco in 1710&#8211;1711.</note> were related to

                  Pernambuco in their fight against the Dutch in the 1630s and 1640s, was not related to Bernardo Vieira de Mello.</note> and who were
               the two persons who were degraded to India, the manuscript was written before the sentence was known, and Rocha Pitta who writes thro
               thick and thin in favour of the Pernambucans, conceals their names.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  inserted a note condemning the treatment of the rebellion by Sebasti&#227;o da Rocha Pita (1660&#8211;1738), <title>Historia da America

                  (1770&#8211;1854), daughter of John Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington (1743&#8211;1813). She was a first cousin of Georgiana Byng (1768&#8211;1801), first
                  wife of Lord John Russell, later the 6th Duke of Bedford (1766&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>). Lady Russell had lived in Lisbon for two
                  years for her health and was known to Herbert Hill. Derwent Coleridge was tutor to the Hopwoods&#8217; sons: Edward (1807&#8211;1891); Frank
                  (1810&#8211;1890); and Hervey (1811&#8211;1881). He continued in this post until December 1819, later becoming an undergraduate at St John&#8217;s
