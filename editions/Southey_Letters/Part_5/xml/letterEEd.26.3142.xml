                  Blackstone became Rector of Worting, Hampshire 1819&#8211;1831, Southey&#8217;s uncle Herbert Hill having held this living since 1815 (i.e.
                  deputising as parish priest until such time as Blackstone was ready to take up his duties) &#8211; Blackstone was a Fellow of New College,
                  Oxford and was not ordained until 1819. Southey had met Blackstone in Switzerland in June 1817 at the home of John Awdry
                  (1766&#8211;1844), solicitor in Reybridge, and his wife Jane, n&#233;e Bigg-Wither (1770&#8211;1845), another sister of Herbert Hill&#8217;s wife,
                  Catherine. </note> that he should think an introduction necessary to me after passing several days in the same house <del>with

                  1817. Princess Caroline of Brunswick was living with an entourage of servants, with one of whom she was thought to be having an
                  affair. The Rome newspapers of 15 May had carried reports that it was being rumoured that the servant in question, Bartolomeo
                  Pergami (1783/4&#8211;1842), had been poisoned; see the <title>Morning Post</title>, 8 June 1818. However, Southey&#8217;s account came from
                  Landor in a letter of May 1818; see John Forster (1812&#8211;1876; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Walter Savage Landor: a Biography</title>,
