        <p rend="indent1"> Here are some medical extracts for you, &#8211; if they serve occasionally
               to enhance a lecture, or merely to fill one up, even that is something. I will always
               have a sheet ready for such, &amp; when the leaf is filled it shall be sent off.
               There are some for <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref>

        <p rend="indent1"> You must thank Mr Bell for me in form of suitable civility, &amp; of
               course I will take care that the book be sent him as soon as it appears.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Bell (1774&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>) had made
                  a drawing of the &#8216;Entrance to Hougoumont&#8217;, an engraving of which appeared in
                  Southey&#8217;s <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (London, 1816), between
                  pp. 58&#8211;59. He was a colleague of Henry Herbert Southey&#8217;s at the Middlesex
                  Hospital.</note> It probably goes to press this day. My task is not yet done. It
               is like crossing a mountain according to the old simily, &#8211; always something more in

               their solicitations. She has not yet been able to sell her little property, which is
               unfortunate, for it gives her trouble &amp; may give her more, requiring repairs
