        <p rend="indent1"> I am exceedingly glad to hear that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walpoles
               Portugueze correspondence has been discovered,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">May had sent Southey the papers of Robert Walpole (1736&#8211;1810), the British
                  envoy to Portugal 1771&#8211;1800, in the hope that Southey would be able to write a
                  biography of Walpole. Walpole&#8217;s Portuguese correspondence was held in the Foreign
                  Office in London.</note> altho it be among the unmoveables of the Crown. The only
               course to be taken in such a case is that I should write all which can be written
               from other materials here, &amp; compleat the memoir in London, &#8211; obtaining leave,
               which there will be no difficulty in doing, to examine the books in the office. This
               must be toward the close of the year. I must then set my face southward in
               consequence of an invitation from my old Chamber-fellow at Westminster, <ref type="m" target="people.html#BunburySirHenryEdward">Sir H. Bunbury</ref> to
               inspect his papers respecting the Peninsular war,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Bunbury was Under-Secretary of State for War and Colonies
                  1809&#8211;1816 and had offered Southey material to help with his <title>History of the
                     Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &#8211; so I shall make a journey of
               business, &amp; take London first or last as may be most convenient. Bunbury&#8217;s papers
               will not relate to the two first years of the war, &amp; therefore I shall not want
               their information <del>xxx xxx</del> sooner, &#8211; those years with the needful
               preliminary matter will nearly occupy half of the whole narration.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am very much obliged to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> for his
               communication concerning Wesley.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel
                  Wesley (1662&#8211;1735; <title>DNB</title>), father of John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791;
                     <title>DNB</title>), was a servitor at Exeter College (a poor scholar who
                  earned his keep at Oxford by waiting on wealthy students), where he matriculated
                  in 1684. John Coleridge was a Fellow of Exeter College 1812&#8211;1818 and so was able
                  to provide this information from the College&#8217;s registers. Southey included this
                  snippet in a footnote to his <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress
                     of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, pp. 7&#8211;8, thanking &#8216;a fellow of
                  Exeter College, through the means of a common friend&#8217; for their help.</note> It is
               desirable to be <del>xxx</del> accurate even in unimportant things; &amp; this
               unquestionable document shows that the Wesleys were strangely inaccurate respecting a
               material part of their fathers history.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) and Charles Wesley (1707&#8211;1788;
                     <title>DNB</title>) in their accounts of their father&#8217;s life, for example in
                     <title>The Works of the Rev. John Wesley</title>, 16 vols (London, 1809), I,
                  pp. 12&#8211;13. Their father, Samuel Wesley, was the son of John Wesley (1635&#8211;1678), a
                  Nonconformist Minister; and Samuel Wesley was educated for the Nonconformist
                  ministry at various schools and academies in London in 1678&#8211;1684 before entering
                  Oxford and conforming to the Church of England.</note> They represent him as
               leaving the Dissenters &amp; entering at Oxford at the age of sixteen, &#8211; whereas it
               appears that he was not less than two &amp; twenty. John Wesley is often beautifully
               clear &amp; close in his reasoning, but this is not the only instance
                  <del>wherein</del> to prove that he is not always to be implicitly trusted in his
               relation of facts. I never suspect him of any intentional deceit, &#8211; but he eagerly
               believed any thing which he wished to believe, &amp; sometimes gave himself
                  <del>xx</del> no time for reflection, nor for examining the truth or credibility

               in quest of materials for this work, &amp; have raked up much that is useful &amp;
