        <p rend="indent1"> You must not send this to <ref type="m" target="people.html#PopleWilliam">the Printer</ref> till the Proem reaches you,
               &#8211; for such an Introduction I think there will be. There are twenty stanzas of it written, such as will put good readers in good humour
               with me, &amp; with what is to follow. Tomorrow you shall a second portion of equal bulk, containing &#8216;Brussels&#8217; &amp; as much of &#8216;The
               Field of Battle&#8217; as the number will hold. It is not yet compleated for it grows under my hands &#8211; the section which I thought to have
               comprized in one part will fill two. &#8211; The second I began this morning; it will be well if I can make this second part stand in place
               of an ode. In these latter cantos you will see that I take a higher tone.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The published
                     <title>Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816) began with a &#8216;Proem&#8217; describing Southey&#8217;s return home after his visit to the
                  Netherlands in 1815; this was originally intended to be the conclusion to the poem, entitled &#8216;The Return&#8217;. The first book of Part
                  One was broken into two and entitled &#8216;Flanders&#8217; and Brussels&#8217;, followed by &#8216;The Field of Battle&#8217;. The sections Southey was writing
                  grew into Part Two of the poem, consisting of &#8216;The Tower&#8217;, &#8216;The Evil Prophet&#8217;, &#8216;The Sacred Mountain&#8217; and &#8216;The Hopes of Man&#8217;. These
                  replaced the ode, &#8216;Hymn of Victory&#8217;, with which Southey originally intended to conclude the poem.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The drawings should be put into the hands of different engravers for the sake of saving time.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> All the illustrations in the poem were engraved by George Cooke (1781&#8211;1834).</note> What has been done about a view
               of <hi rend="ital">La Haye Sainte</hi>? <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> has no sketch of it; &#8211; but it was a
               most important point in the battle, &amp; as you will see, is dwelt upon in the poem. If we can get one in no other way, we must take
               it from the Panorama print.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> An engraving of La Haye Sainte (a farmhouse that was fiercely
                  contested in the Battle of Waterloo) appeared in <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (London, 1816), between pp. 62&#8211;63.
                  Southey was able to use a sketch by Nash and so did not have to resort to the works of Henry Aston Barker (1774&#8211;1856), who had
                  become well-known through his exhibition of panoramas at his purpose-built hall in Leicester Square, London. Barker drew the scenes
                  for his Waterloo panorama at the battlefield and visitors to his exhibition could purchase copies of the various
               sections.</note>

        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> will print what number he thinks best, I think 1500 will not be too
               many, &#8211; perhaps 2000, but he will determine this.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> 2,000 copies were printed of the first
                  edition of <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note> He must determine too the bulk of the volume. Reckon the
               poem at 1500 lines, that is 250 stanzas. If there be three stanzas in the page this will be 84 pages, say 90. &amp; some 30 notes, &#8211;
               120. Two stanzas per page would carry the text to 130; a scant page I grant, &#8211; but not so as to be remarkable, &#8211; the numbering the
               stanzas occupying the place of two lines to each, thus making the complement in the printers form 16 which is not uncommon. In this
               case let us have large top &amp; bottom &amp; the text compacted for beauty, &amp; not spread out for filling up: &#8211; because the more
               beautiful the appearance of the book the better<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage</title> was printed in duodecimo, in a volume of 232 pages, at two numbered stanzas per page. There
                  were 35 pages of notes.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is another reason for preferring this last distribution. If I print the Lay of the Laureate in the small size
               instead of 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi> it will not admit of more than two stanzas in the page, &#8211; as its length will not exceed 100 stanzas,
               &amp; there can be no notes.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816) was published in duodecimo rather than quarto. It ran to 120 stanzas,
                  at two stanzas per page. There were only 77 pages, though, and six of these were notes.</note>
