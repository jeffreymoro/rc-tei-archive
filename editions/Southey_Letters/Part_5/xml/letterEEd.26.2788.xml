        <p rend="indent1"> I received a proof<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A proof
                  of <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale </title>(1816), &#8216;The Dream&#8217;,

               for due consideration, &amp; sent it back by yesterdays post. It contains the first
               15 stanzas of the dream. So that all to which you or <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> object up to that point
               is irrevocable, &#8211; &amp; to let you into a secret had the case been otherwise, not a
               syllable of it would I have altered. The Guards indeed I admit to have stood there
               {only} for this <del>apparent</del> cause &#8211; that the <hi rend="ital">throng</hi>
               which they repelld &#8211; is a true &amp; lawful rhyme, &#8211; which is cause sufficient.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  in order ranged repelled the throng&#8217;.</note> But as for Dream it would have been
               mere waste of time to have changed the word, if it could have been done in that
               place, &#8211; in my judgement (quoad the use, &amp; weight &amp; current value of words I
               am not disposed to submit it to any mans) &#8211; there was not the slightest reason for
               changing it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  dream&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Stanzas 30&#8211;1- are meant to be congratulatory.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                     Nuptiale</title> (1816), &#8216;The Dream&#8217;, stanzas 30&#8211;31 congratulated Princess
                  Charlotte and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the
                  Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) on their marriage on 2 May 1816, wishing them &#8216;blessings for

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If egotism in poetry be a sin God forgive all great poets! But
               perhaps it is allowable in them when they have been dead a few centuries, &#8211; &amp;
               therefore they may be permitted to speak of themselves &amp; appreciate themselves
               provided they leave especial orders that such passages be not made public {statute}
               till the {critical} limitation expires. How can <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> be weak enough to
               suppose that the man who wrote that third stanza<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>
                  (1816),&#8217;Proem&#8217;, stanza 3 features &#8216;Fancy&#8217; addressing the poet: &#8216;&#8220;For what hast
                  thou to do with wealth or power,/ Thou whom rich Nature at thy happy birth/ Blest
                  in her bounty with the largest dower/ That Heaven indulges to a child of Earth, .
                  ./ Then when the sacred Sisters for their own/ Baptized thee in the springs of
                  Helicon?&#8221;&#8216;</note> would be deterred from printing it by any fear of reprehension
               on the score of vanity! Who is to reprehend him? None of his peers assuredly: not one
               person who will sympathize with him as he reads, &#8211; not one person who enters into his
               thoughts &amp; feelings, not one person who can understand the strain &amp; enjoy it.
               Those persons indeed may who live wholly in the present, &#8211; but I have taken especial
               care to make it known that a faith in hereafter is as necessary for the intellectual
               as the moral character, &amp; that to the man of letters (as well as the Xtian) the
                  <hi rend="ital">present</hi> forms but the slightest portion of existence. &#8211; He
               who would leave any durable monument behind him must live in the past, &amp; look to
               the future. The poets of old scrupled not to say this, &#8211; &amp; who is there that is
