                  Ivy How estate, Little Langdale; see Wordsworth to Thomas Monkhouse, 4 December 1818, <title>The Letters of William and Dorothy
                     Wordsworth. The Middle Years. Part 2. 1812&#8211;1820</title>, ed. E. De Selincourt, 2nd edn rev. Mary Moorman and Alan G. Hill
                  (Oxford, 1970), p. 509. A share in this estate would qualify the co&#8211;owners as 40 shilling freeholders, thus enabling them to vote in
                  county elections in Westmorland. The entire scheme was an attempt by Wordsworth to create more votes for the Lowther interest in the
                  county, so boosting its chances of success in the next general election contest against Brougham, who had challenged the Earl of
                  Lonsdale&#8217;s hold on the county in the 1818 general election.</note> But after taking counsel with myself this is the answer which I
               must return at last. Twelve months hence, if I live &amp; do well, I shall be able,- but there will be calls upon me in the

                  seems to have played an important backstage role in organising the Lowther family&#8217;s election contests in Westmorland in 1818, 1820
                  and 1826. Gee was one of the eight men who participated in the purchase of Ivy How.</note>
