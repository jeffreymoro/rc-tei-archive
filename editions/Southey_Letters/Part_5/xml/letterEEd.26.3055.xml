                  of 1430 centred on a weaver and bailiff of Abingdon, William Mandeville (d. 1430), who took the name Jack Sharpe. Very little is
                  known about this incident. It occurred in the minority of Henry VI (1421–1471; King of England 1422–1461, 1470–1471;

                  papers, e.g. <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 8 December 1817. One of the extracts reported that in the Kamchatka peninsula ‘in the
                  course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the woods, frequently entered the houses of the Kamtschdales; in many
                  places have attacked and devoured the inhabitants; nay traces have even been found of their having killed and devoured each other;
                  at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of hunger. In several settlements they have killed from two to three
                  hundred bears, the oldest Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty. The cause of
                  this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past there has been an entire want of fish in the Kamschatka sea,
                  and fish, as is well known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters, they easily contrive
                  to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately felt in the Peninsula.’</note> – to the great discomfort of the <hi rend="ital">Bears</hi>, who in consequence have made fierce attacks upon the people (a sort of civil war) &amp; have also engaged in
               cannibal hostilities among themselves. If the ice has been broken up by a volcano the eruption would have this precise effect of
               killing, or <hi rend="ital">fugitating</hi> the fish. And it would work away for a year or two before it cleared away such a continent
               of ice as appears to have been broken up. The coast of East Greenland is said to be open.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The
