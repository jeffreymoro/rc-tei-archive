        <p rend="indent1">You will have seen by my last letters that I am not exhausting myself
               by over-exertion. On the contrary for many days I have been forcing myself to the
               more difficult necessity of bearing my own recollections; &#8211; time will soften them
               down, &#8211; indeed they now have, &amp; always have had all the alleviation which an
               assured hope &amp; faith can bestow, &#8211; &amp; when I give way to tears which is only
               in darkness or in solitude, they are not tears of unmingled pain.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey's son <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> had died on 17 April.</note> I
               begin to think that change of place would not be desirable; &amp; that the pain of
               leaving a place where I have enjoyed so many <del>t</del> years of such great
               happiness, is more than <del>should</del> it is wise to incur without <del>xxxx</del>
               necessity. Nor could I reconcile either <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> or myself to the thought of leaving

                  Wilson</ref>, &#8211; whose heart is half-broken already, &amp; to whom our departure
               would be a death stroke. Her days {indeed} must necessarily be few; &#8211; &amp; her
                  <del>xxxx</del> life-lease will probably expire before the end of <del>my
                  first</del> {the} term to which we are looking on.</p>

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has sent me
               50 &#163; for the Le Vendee article,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                  review of a series of memoirs of the French Revolutionary wars, including the
                  royalist rising in La Vend&#233;e, 1793&#8211;1796, appeared in the <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 15 (April 1816), 1&#8211;69.</note> &#8211; which makes me indifferent when
               it appears, &amp; proposes to me half a dozen other subjects at 100 &#163; each, &#8211; at
               which rate I suppose in future I shall supply him with an article every quarter: &#8211;
               this will set me at ease in money matters, &#8211; about which thank God &amp; the easy
               disposition with which he has blest me, I have never been <del>xxxx</del> too
               anxious.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">It is needless to say I shall be glad to see you here, &#8211; but rather at
               some future time when you will find me a better companion, &amp; when your company
               would do me more good. Nor indeed must you leave <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">your Mother</ref>; her deliverance from the
               infirmities of life cannot be long deferred by any human skill, or any favourable
               efforts of nature. Whenever that event takes place you will need such relief as
               change of scene can afford; &amp; whenever it may be I hold myself ready to join you
               &amp; accompany you to the continent, &#8211; for as long a time as you can be spared from
               your office, &amp; as long a journey as that time may enable us to take. Remember
               this, &amp; look to it as a fitting arrangement which will benefit us both. </p>
