                  (dates unknown), who was, by April 1817, in Carlisle jail for debt; a creditor had
                  taken out an injunction (an &#8216;extent in aid&#8217;) against him, seeking recompense by
                  forcing a sale of the estate.</note> This is a great nuisance, for I should else

                  settled, determined malignity of a renegado&#8217; and comparing Southey&#8217;s arguments
                  against radical views in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816),
                  227, with those expressed in <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817), Act 2, lines
                  103&#8211;112. Southey responded with <title>A Letter to William Smith, Esq.,

               this is owing to a confusion of memory &amp; that he has mistaken <ref type="m" target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</ref> for me.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">This refers to Southey&#8217;s Jacobin drama <title>Wat Tyler</title>,
                  which he had written in 1794 and sent to James Ridgway (1755&#8211;1838) and Henry
                  Symonds (1741&#8211;1816), radical booksellers, for publication; see Robert Southey to
                  Edith Fricker, [c. 12 January 1795], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 123. Ridgway
                  and Symonds did not publish it and it remained in manuscript until a pirated
                  publication, designed to embarrass the now anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817.
                  Having taken advice from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> and
                     <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, Southey launched
                  a suit in Chancery in order to gain an injunction suppressing the publication, on
                  the grounds that it breached his copyright. The matter was complicated because
                  Southey&#8217;s ownership of the copyright was brought into doubt when William
                  Winterbotham swore an affidavit in which he declared that Southey had,
                  when visiting Newgate prison, where he, Ridgway and Symonds were all confined,
                  given him and Daniel Isaac Eaton (1753&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), the radical
                  publisher, the manuscript to do with as they liked. When the case was heard in the
                  Court of Chancery on 18&#8211;19 March 1817, Southey lost his application for an
                  injunction.</note> This however will not explain many things in his affidavit
               which are direct falsehoods. He swears however that he did <hi rend="ital">not</hi>
               furnish the MS. &amp; that it must have been surreptitiously obtained from him. This
               of course is of no consequence &#8211; my business is to state my own principles &amp; to
               chastise the <ref type="m" target="people.html#SmithWilliam">member of Norwich</ref>,
               which I shall do with scorpions. </p>
