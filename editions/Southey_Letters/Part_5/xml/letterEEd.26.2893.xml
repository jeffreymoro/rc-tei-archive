                  of the Second Class of the Royal Institute of Science, Literature and the Fine
                  Arts of the Netherlands (founded 1808). The Institute’s headquarters are the

               into the two first chapters of my book.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s article ‘Parliamentary Reform’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16
                  (October 1816), 225–278 (published 11 February 1817); Southey intended this to form
                  part of a book he was planning on the ‘State of the Nation’. The book did not
                  materialise.</note> It will not surprize me if in some parts it should startle

               Government besotted in security, – or are they rendered absolutely helpless by fear,

               to know that their throats as well as their places are at stake? As for accelerating
               my movements<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford had conveyed the
                  suggestion to Southey that he should edit a new pro-government journal – a
                  suggestion he had declined.</note> for the sake of holding a conversation which
               would end in nothing, tho I have little prudence to ballast my sails I have enough to
               prevent me from <del>xxxxx</del> that. All that I possibly can do I am doing, – under
               a secret apprehension that it is more likely to bring personal danger upon myself
               than to rouse them to exertion, – but for that no matter; it is proper that the
               attempt should be made; the country will stand by them if they will stand by the
               country.</p><p rend="indent1"> Were I to see one of these Personages &amp; he were to propose any

               &amp; are fitter for it. I suspect that Stoddart would very gladly quit the Times
               (where he is perpetually thwarted, &amp; even treated as if there were a wish to oust
               him) make such a plan worth his while, &amp; there is an experienced editor at hand
               for them.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Stoddart (1773–1856;
                     <title>DNB</title>). Stoddart was editor of <title>The Times</title> until
                  dismissed at the end of 1816 for the intemperate Toryism of his articles. Later in
                  1817, he became the first editor of the ministry-supported <title>The New
                     Times</title> (1817–1828).</note> I say this merely from what I have reason to
               believe the case. Not from any sort of predilection, – the sole <del>xxxx</del>
               {motive} which has brought me in to any intercourse with a man from whom during many
               years I took no pain to conceal my dislike, – being a sense that he had done good
               service to the common cause, &amp; deserved well of all who were attached to it. </p><p rend="indent1"> I think of being in town in April, <hi rend="ital">si
