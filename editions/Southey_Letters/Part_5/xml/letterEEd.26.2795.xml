                  1814, when Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent, was engaged to
                  William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands
                  1840&#8211;1849). He had to abandon the poem when the engagement was broken off, but he
                  was able to reuse most of it when, in 1816, the engagement of Charlotte to Prince
                  Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) was

                  the earlier draft of the poem in Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, Box B/414,
                  reveals Southey simply changed the description of the lion from &#8216;Belgic&#8217;,
