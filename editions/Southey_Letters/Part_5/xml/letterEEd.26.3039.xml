        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for your Lectures.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Blanco White&#8217;s <title>Preparatory Observations on
                     the Study of Religion: in Eight Lectures, delivered before the Children of a Family in High Life, by their Tutor, a Clergyman of
                     the Church of England</title> (1817).</note> They are admirably adapted for their occasion, &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">one of my children</ref> is old enough to profit by them, &amp; I have put them into her hands.
               It is indeed curious that such a teacher should have come to us from Seville! Whatever the result of the convulsion in Spain may have
               been to others, you at least have obtained in its consequences a benefit which is beyond all price. Nor is this Exposition of our
               Divine Religion the less remarkable for the place where it has been written.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Blanco White&#8217;s work
                  had been written whilst living in the household of Lord Holland at Holland House in London. The house functioned as the social
                  centre of the Whig party.</note> God grant that the good seed may take root where you have so faithfully sown it, &amp; that it may
               not be choked by weeds. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fox</ref> is said to have died an
               unbeliever, in doubt even of a future state. I know how prevalent this fatal error is among the persons of his party, &amp; trace it
               but too clearly in much of their political conduct; &#8211; it is the secret principle which explains things otherwise inexplicable. Hence
               their eagerness to cooperate with Catholics, Methodists, or Socinians<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Followers of the theology
                  of Fausto Paolo Sozzini, (Socinus) (1539&#8211;1604); effectively the term was used as an alternative for Unitarian, or someone who denied
                  the existence of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus.</note> against the Established Church: hence their adherence to
                  Buonaparte<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French 1804&#8211;1814, 1815).</note> in
               spite of his atrocious tyranny. The evil is increasing among us, &amp; on the other {hand} a spirit of fanaticism as wide from the
               truth increases also. We stand in need of able &amp; zealous labourers, &amp; it is a consolation to see that by Gods blessing, they
               are not wanting.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> During my journey I made what enquiry I could concerning the state of religion in the Protestant Cantons of
               Switzerland, where I had an opportunity of seeing some of the Clergy. During these late years which have dislocated the whole fabric of
               civil society it has not escaped serious injury. The power of the clergy has been lessened, &#8211; it was not too great, &amp; it was used
               discretely. Their influence has diminished with it, &amp; a visible deterioration of morals is the consequence. Geneva has become a
               school of Socinianism: it was never a good school, &amp; we in England have sustained much <del>injury</del> {evil} from it in former
                  times:<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Geneva was the headquarters of Jean Calvin (1509&#8211;1564) from 1541 onwards and a centre
                  for the dissemination of his theology. Southey particularly disliked Calvinism&#8217;s insistence on the predestination of souls to
                  damnation or salvation and believed this theology had inspired many Parliamentarians in the English Civil War and Commonwealth
                  1642&#8211;1660.</note> but this change is for the worse. It is not from the ashes of Socinus whom they murdered so cruelly<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sozzini (Socinus) died peacefully in Poland; Southey has confused him with Michael Servetus
                  (1509/1511&#8211;1553), a Spanish doctor and theologian who held unorthodox views on the Trinity and who was burned in Geneva for
                  heresy.</note> that it has arisen, it is the thin cloak which Philosophism condescends to wear. Their countryman Jean Jacques has
               left his leaven there, &amp; a blast from Ferney has infected the place.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean Jacques Rousseau
                  (1712&#8211;1778), deist philosopher from Geneva; Ferney, a town in France close to Geneva, was the residence of Fran&#231;ois-Marie Arouet
                  (Voltaire) (1694&#8211;1778) from 1759 to 1778. Voltaire, too, was a deist.</note> Yet I think good may be deduced from it. The Pastors in
               other Cantons appear to be awakened by it &amp; it may occasion a revival of sound doctrine and of zeal. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will see in the next Quarterly Review that I have translated one or two of Lope de Vega&#8217;s devotional sonnets.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (October 1817), 1&#8211;46, Southey reviewed Lord Holland,
               <title>Some Account of the Lives and Writings of Lope F&#233;lix de Vega Carpio, and Guillen de Castro</title> (1817). The religious
                  sonnets translated by Southey (at 8&#8211;9) were &#8216;Sirvio Jacob los siete largos anos&#8217; and &#8216;Quando la Madre Antigua reverdeze&#8217;, Sonnets V

        <p rend="indent1"> I trust we shall see you next summer. Come when the days are lengthening, that you may see our country in its greatest
               beauty. I went thro the finest parts of Switzerland &amp; saw beyond the Alps the Lakes Como, Lugano, &amp; Maggiore; yet this country
               has borne the comparison; &#8211; the charm of its <hi rend="ital">proportion</hi> compensates for every thing in which it is inferior. And
               the bountiful clearness of its streams is perfectly delicious after the turbid torrents of the Alps, which carry with them the wreck of
               those crumbling mountains &amp; produce goitres &amp; cretinism.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">These conditions were actually
                  caused by a lack of iodine in the soil.</note> You will find here quiet &amp; an air which I believe to be as wholesome as any in
               this island; &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> was sent here by his Physicians in despair for
               a liver complaint, &amp; if his recovery can be assigned to any definite cause it must be to the air of these mountains. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It was at Como that I first read of the revolution at Pernambuco <del>in the Lugano Gazette</del>; &#8211; &amp; I guessed
               but too truly that the man who was there called Isaac Ribeiro Person: would prove to be Ribeiro Pessoa,<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Joam Ribeiro Pessoa de Melo Montenegro (1766&#8211;1817), a priest who was a member of the provisional government set up by
                  a group of revolutionaries in Pernambuco, 8 March&#8211;18 May 1817. He committed suicide in the town of Paulista after the defeat of the
                  revolutionary forces and the fall of Recife, the provincial capital. Southey read of his death in the <title>Gazzetta di
                     Lugano</title> (1814&#8211;1821), a liberal weekly newspaper that circulated widely in Switzerland and northern Italy.</note> &#8211; a man
               with whom I was in communication thro my friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Koster</ref>, &amp; with whose history
               &amp; opinions I was perfectly well acquainted. He was a man of great ability &amp; of excellent heart: a priest, who saw the falsehood
                  <del>x xx</del> of his own church &amp; unhappily did not see the truths which are smothered under it. With the best feelings, &amp;
               the best intentions, he <del>xxxx</del> {lent} the whole weight of his talents &amp; high character to this miserable attempt, &#8211; &amp;
               when once in blood, was in immediate <del>xxx xxxx</del> {danger of} plunging himself into the deepest damnation. He had consented to
               the desperate resolution of setting fire to the city &#8211; murdering all the royalists in their power; &#8211; but I rejoice to say that <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Kosters</ref> expostulations moved him from this purpose. He perished by his own hand &#8211;
               God be merciful to his soul! &#8211; He has left a woman whom he regarded as his wife, &amp; several children. This is a dismal story. the
               man who thus died an Atheist, &amp; a traitor &amp; a rebel was a noble creature, who might have been an ornament &amp; a benefactor to
               his country &amp; his kind. </p>
