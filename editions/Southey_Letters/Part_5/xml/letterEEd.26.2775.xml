        <p rend="indent1">Time passes on, &#8211; I employ myself, &amp; have
                  recovered strength, &#8211; but in point of spirits I rather lose ground. The cause
                  perhaps is obvious,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s son Herbert had died on 17 April 1816.</note>
                  &#8211; at first we make great efforts to force the mind from thoughts which are
                  intolerably painful; &#8211; but as from time they become endurable, less effort is made
                  to avoid them, &amp; the poignancy of grief settles into melancholy. Both with
               <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> &amp; myself this seems to be the
                  case. Certain I am that nothing but the fixed &amp; full assurance of immortality
                  could prevent me from sinking under an affliction which is greater than any
                  stranger could possibly believe; &#8211; &amp; thankful I am that my feelings have been
                  so long &amp; so habitually directed toward this point. You probably know my poems
                  better than most people, &amp; may <del>recollect</del> perceive how strongly my
                  mind has been impressed upon this most consoling subject</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Yesterday I finished the main part of the Lay, &#8211; there remains only
               six or eight stanzas as a L&#8217;Envoy, which I may perhaps compleat this night &#8211; then I
               shall send you the whole in one packet thro <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Lay of the
                     Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816) was a wedding gift celebrating the
                  marriage of Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent, to Prince Leopold
                  of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) on 2 May 1816.
                  The &#8216;Epilogue&#8217; contained 13 stanzas, the last of which was entitled
                  &#8216;L&#8217;Envoy&#8217;.</note> I have said nothing about it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, &#8211; for I think it very probable that you may advise me not to
               publish the poem now it is written, lest it should give offence; &amp; having
               satisfied myself by writing it, it is quite <del>xxxx</del> indifferent to me whether
               it appears now, or after my decease. The emolument <del>is</del> to be derived from
               it is too insignificant to be thought of, &#8211; &amp; the credit which I should gain
               (assuredly it would be great credit) I can very well do without. So take counsel with
               any body you please, &amp; remember that I who am easily enough persuaded in any
               case, am in this perfectly unconcerned. For were it a thing of course that I should
               produce a poem on this occasion, &#8211; there is at this time, God knows, sufficient
               reason why I might stand excused.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do not imagine that the poem has derived the slightest cast of
               colouring from my present state of mind. The plan is precisely what was originally
               formed. William Nicol<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Nicol (d.
                  1855?) was the son and business partner of George Nicol (1740?&#8211;1828;
                     <title>DNB</title>), who was Bookseller to the King, 1781&#8211;1820. William Nicol
                  also held a minor Court appointment as Assistant Paymaster in the Lord Steward&#8217;s
                  office.</note> is likely to judge as well as any man whether there be any
               unfitness in publishing it. You are quite aware that I neither wish to court favour,
               nor to give offence, &#8211; &amp; that the absurdity of taking offence <del>would</del>
               (if it were taken) would excite in me more pity than resentment. &#8211; I do not want <ref type="m" target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Crokers</ref> opinion, the strain of language, &amp; of thought
               are alike out of his way</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Good night. I am going to this poem in hope of compleating it. I
               cannot yet bear to be unemployed, &#8211; &amp; this I feel severely. You know how much I
               used to unbend, &amp; play with the children, in frequent intervals of study, &#8211; as
               tho I were an idle man. Of this I am quite incapable, &amp; shall long continue so.
               No circumstance of my former life ever brought with it so great a change, as that
               which I daily &amp; hourly feel, &#8211; &amp; perhaps shall never cease to feel. Yet I am
               thankful for having possessed <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">this child</ref> so long, &#8211; for worlds I would not but have been his father, &#8211; of all the
               blessings which it has pleased God {to} vouchsafe<del>d</del> {me}, this was &amp;
                  <hi rend="ital">is</hi> the greatest.</p>
