        <p rend="indent1"> This poor wretched paper-hanger has sent me another letter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to
                  Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 15 February 1817, Letter 2919. John William Southey (dates unknown), a paper hanger and stationer, whose
                  shop in 1794&#8211;1798 was at 35 Bedford Street, Covent Garden, had delivered a letter to Southey in c. 1797&#8211;1798 which had been
                  misdirected to him. He had gone bankrupt in 1809 and had written to Southey asking for money. It is possible that he was from
                  Somerset and a very distant relative of Southey&#8217;s.</note> because I did not reply to the first. Men are too prone to <del>xxxxx
                  importunity &amp; plea for</del> take offence at importunity, &#8211; finding anger a less uncomfortable emotion than pity: this indeed it
               is, &amp; for that reason I scold <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my wife</ref> &amp; my children<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s daughters, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref>.</note> when they hurt themselves. As to this unhappy man I hope you have sent
               him the two pounds, &#8211; it will do him very little good, &#8211; but it is really as much as I can afford to give him for <del>the xxxx</del>
               {the} sake of the name, &#8211; &amp; a great deal more than I ever got by it. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you have seen the New Times you will perceive how wrongly you judged of Stoddart,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Stoddart (1773&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>). Stoddart was editor of <title>The Times </title> 1814&#8211;1816, until
                  dismissed at the end of 1816 for the intemperate Toryism of his articles. He had just become the first editor of the pro-government
                     <title>New Times</title> (1817&#8211;1828).</note> &#8211; for whom however I beg you will understand that I am no farther interested in than
               as believing him a man of right principle, very usefully &amp; industriously employed. He sent me the first number; &#8211; his talents are
               just suited to such work, &#8211; he can write with equal fluency upon all temporary subjects, always with words at command, in any quantity,
               &amp; sometimes with considerable force. The tide seems to be turning &amp; if Government will but check the press things will soon
               right themselves. In this part of the country I hear that travellers (the bagmen) collect their money more easily than in their last
               rounds, &amp; receive more orders. &#8211; A fellow was selling <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbetts</ref> twopenny
                  Register<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In November 1816, by removing news items but by retaining comment, Cobbett had
                  avoided stamp duty on his weekly journal, the <title>Political Register</title> (1802&#8211;1835), thus reducing its price to two pence,
                  and so reaching a wider readership.</note> &amp; other such things at Rydale the other day, &#8211; it was, or appeared to be a sailor,
               &amp; his story was, that he was going to Whitehaven, &amp; a gentleman had given him these to support himself on the road by selling
               them. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In grief &amp; in uneasiness I have often caught myself examining my own sensations as if the intellectual part
                  <del>should xxxx</del> could separate itself from that in which the affections predominate, &amp; stand aloof, &amp; contemplate it
               as a surgeon does the sufferings of a patient during an operation. This <del>has happened to me</del> {I have observed} in the severest
               sorrows that have ever befallen me. &#8211; but it in no degree lessens the suffering. And whenever I may have any serious malady this habit,
               do what I may to subdue it, will tend materially to impede or prevent recovery. But in petty vexations it has its use. &#8211; <del>Would
                  they are xxx xxxx xxxxxx xxx xxxxx xx xx deserve</del> I was more vexed than I ought to have been about this publication of Wat
                  Tyler:<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1794 Southey had sent James Ridgway (1755&#8211;1838), and Henry Symonds (1741&#8211;1816),
                  radical booksellers then in Newgate prison, a copy of his Jacobin drama <title>Wat Tyler</title>; see Robert Southey to Edith
                  Fricker, [c. 12 January 1795], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey, Part One</title>, Letter 123. Ridgway and Symonds did not publish it and it remained in
                  manuscript until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass the now anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817. Having taken advice
                  from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, Wynn and Turner, Southey launched a suit in Chancery so as to
                  gain an injunction suppressing the publication.</note> &#8211; for tho I shook off the <del>xxxx</del> first thoughts, or rather
               immediately began to consider it in the right point of view as a thing utterly unimportant, still there was an uneasiness working like
               yeast in my abdomen;&#8211; &amp; my sleep was disturbed by it for two nights, &#8211; by that time it had spent itself, &amp; I should now think
               nothing more about it, if it were not necessary to determine how to act. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>
               will find the thing more full of fire &amp; brimstone perhaps than he imagines &#8211; &amp; yet perhaps the wiser way will be not to notice
               it <del>&amp;</del> {but} let it pass as a squib, &amp; an imposition. Indeed I could laugh about it with any person who was disposed
