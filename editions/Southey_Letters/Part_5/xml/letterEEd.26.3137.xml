                  the article &#8216;Mr M&#8217;Kerrell and Mr Brougham&#8217;, 208&#8211;227. Robert M&#8217;Kerrell (1761&#8211;1841),
                  a textile merchant and manufacturer in Paisley, had on 28 May 1812, given evidence
                  to the House of Commons committee enquiring into the Orders in Council system,
                  which enforced a trade blockade on territories controlled by France. The Whig
                  opposition were campaigning for its repeal, on the grounds that it harmed British
                  manufacturing. Brougham denounced M&#8217;Kerrell (though not by name) in the House of
                  Commons on 16 June 1812, claiming he had told the committee that textile workers
                  were overpaid and &#8216;oatmeal and water were good enough for Englishmen.&#8217; M&#8217;Kerrell
                  denied he had said this and published an acrimonious exchange of letters between
                  himself and Brougham in <title>The Times</title> of 20 July 1812. Southey had been
                  collecting material that could be used against Brougham in his election campaign
