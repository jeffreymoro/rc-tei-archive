        <p rend="indent1"> One of the inclosed is for a Portugueze Journal containing an account
               of M. Beauchamps plagiarism of my Hist of Brazil.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had enclosed a notice for a journal, drawn up in
                  Portuguese, by Henry Koster, highlighting the plagiarism of his
                     <title>History of Brazil</title> by Alphonse de Beauchamp (1767&#8211;1832), in his
                     <title>Histoire du Br&#233;sil</title> (1815). Southey accused Beauchamp of
                  plagiarism in the preface to the second volume of his <title>History of
                     Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), II, pp. vi&#8211;viii.</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Koster</ref> perhaps has taken more trouble in
               drawing it up than was necessary, &#8211; I shall say a sentence or two about it myself in
               the advertisement to the forthcoming volume.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I trouble you often with inclosures &#8211; &#8211; &amp; am asked as coolly by
               the females of this family to frank a letter as if my name were potential at the Post
               Office.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is an unwise oeconomy (I shall soon class that word with candour,
               liberality philanthropy, &amp; the other <del>abominables</del> abominanda of the
               age) &#8211; to deprive our Consuls of their salary, &amp; make them wholly dependant upon
               the trade.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Consuls were at this time
                  representatives of governments in foreign cities who dealt mainly with trade
                  issues (though they were accumulating other functions). British consuls were
                  entitled to a fee from all British merchants and shippers using the city where
                  they were based, but some consuls in more important locations (like Lisbon) also
                  received a salary.</note> The very reverse of this <del>poli</del> is wanted, &#8211; we
               want able &amp; respectable men to fill the situation, &#8211; &amp; during the war the
               want of such men was continually felt, e.g. in the Levant. But the system is to be
               penny-wise with the mob, &amp; pound-foolish with the powers above!</p>
