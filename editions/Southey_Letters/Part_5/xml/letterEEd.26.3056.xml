        <p rend="indent1"> Have you heard the great news from the North? Some great convulsion appears to have broken up the ice about the pole.
               The Whalers went as far as 84 &amp; there was then no ice in sight; &#8211; had their instructions allowed them to make such an attempt they
               were of opinion that there was nothing to prevent them from reaching the Pole! The coast of East Greenland was open.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Reports of events in the Arctic were widespread in British newspapers; see, for example, <title>Morning
                     Chronicle</title>, 22 November 1817, which coincides closely with Southey&#8217;s information.</note> It was the large masses of ice
               floating to the S. which occasioned those extraordinary cold winds from the S. &amp; S.W. throughout the whole of May: I often remarked
               at the time that nothing but floating ice could account for that unnatural weather.<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">See, for
                  example, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 4 October 1817, for an account of unusual amounts of ice in the North Atlantic.</note> A
               Volcano is the most probable cause, &amp; what renders this the more likely is that for the last two years there have been no fish at
                  Kamtschatka,<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">British newspapers had carried a number of extracts from Hamburg papers at the
                  end of 1817, e.g. <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 8 December 1817. One of the extracts reported that in the Kamchatka peninsula
                  &#8216;in the course of last winter an incredible number of bears have left the woods, frequently entered the houses of the Kamtschdales;
                  in many places have attacked and devoured the inhabitants; nay traces have even been found of their having killed and devoured each
                  other; at the end of the winter many bears were found who had perished of hunger. In several settlements they have killed from two
                  to three hundred bears, the oldest Kamtschadales do not remember ever to have seen so many bears so savage and blood-thirsty. The
                  cause of this savageness and of their hunger is, that for these two years past there has been an entire want of fish in the
                  Kamschatka sea, and fish, as is well known, are the chief food of the bears, which being usually so abundant in those waters, they
                  easily contrive to catch. A couple of shocks of an earthquake have been lately felt in the Peninsula.&#8217;</note> &#8211; to the great
               distress of {the} Bears, who in consequence are in a state of civil war with themselves, &amp; with the people too, <del>for that also

                  civile.<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;More than a civil war&#8217;.</note> It is the effect of marine volcanos to kill or drive
               away the fish, of course; &amp; they might blaze away for years before they could break up such a continent of ice as actually appears
               to be removed. This is highly curious, tho it seems to have excited very little attention.</p>
