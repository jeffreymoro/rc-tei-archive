        <p rend="indent1"> Mariners information has been put into a very good form for the press, &#8211; it is better not to make an expensive book of
               it, &#8211; prints of scenery, costume &amp; natural history in such works justify expence &amp; tempt purchasers, but here you have nothing
               of that kind. I think you over-estimate the extent of the manuscript. I should not think it contained more than an ordinary octavo
               volume: &#8211; the promised vocabulary which certainly should not be omitted, may be printed in a close type, &amp; cannot occupy many
               pages. With regard to the composition it is in such a state that I should think the editor has nothing more to do than to prepare a
               transcript for the press.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey approved for publication a manuscript account of the story of
                  the ship&#8217;s boy William Mariner (1791&#8211;1853) who lived in the Tonga islands from 1806 to 1810 after the local people attacked his ship
                  and killed his crewmates. The manuscript was published by Murray, after editing by the meteorologist John Martin (1789&#8211;1869;
                     <title>DNB</title>), as <title>An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean, with an Original
                     Grammar and Vocabulary of their Language</title> (1817). The book was published in two octavo volumes, with &#8216;A Grammar of the
                  Tonga Language&#8217; at pp. 353&#8211;412 of Volume II and &#8216;A Vocabulary, Tonga and English&#8217; following in unpaginated pages. There was only one
                  illustration. Southey reviewed the book in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 17 (April 1817), 1&#8211;39.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> Now to the other points of your letter in order. I do a friendly act in taking the subject of Alfieri, &#8211; but I am not
               making a friendly article in any other sense of the word. The subject is <del>xx</del> good, &amp; the act of friendship consists in
               thus calling attention to the translation, of which I shall speak as if it were the work of a stranger. I have Alfieris life, &amp; am
