                  pro-ministerial candidate. He was financially ruined and also severely injured by
                  a paving slab thrown from the crowd. He did not contest the subsequent by-election

        <p rend="indent1"> The inclosed letter is a matter of compassion, &#8211; a medical case of a
               very uncommon kind, &#8211; an internal enlargement of the parotid glands on both sides, &#8211;
               occasioning fever, thirst &amp; difficulty of <del>xxxxxx</del> breathing. I fear it
               is incurable, &#8211; but it is doing the poor patient some good to give her the hope of
               relief which better advice than a village can afford may seem to offer her.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The identity of this patient is

               blow at the Malthusians in the last number.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey criticised the arguments of Thomas Robert Malthus (1766&#8211;1834;
                     <title>DNB</title>), though not by name, in &#8216;On the Means of Improving the
                  People&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 79&#8211;118. In particular,
                  he declared &#8216;Away then with all silly theorems about population, &#8211; the whole
                  battology of statistics, &#8220;with many words making nothing understood.&#8221; Population
                  cannot be discouraged, and must not be interfered with by legislative regulations
                  &#8211; you might as well attempt to regulate the seasons. The one thing needful is to
                  give the lower classes that knowledge and those principles which shall make them
                  understand that moral restraint is a duty, and that their duty and their interest
                  are the same&#8217; (96&#8211;97). This contradicted the arguments in <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 17 (July 1817), 369&#8211;403, which carried a review by John Bird
                  Sumner (1780&#8211;1862; <title>DNB</title>), entitled &#8216;Malthus on Population&#8217; and far
                  more favourable to the ideas of Malthus on poverty and population increase than
                  Southey&#8217;s opinions.</note> But how preposterous is it for the Review to be thus
               saying &amp; unsaying! &#8211; I am speaking a word about pictures for the new churches, &#8211;
               &amp; saying a good deal about cemeteries.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey discussed churches in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 23 (July 1820),
