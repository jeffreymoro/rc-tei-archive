        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Salamanca plan,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">At the Battle of Salamanca, Spain, 22 July 1812, an
                  Anglo-Portuguese army commanded by Wellington, defeated French forces. Southey
                  needed a plan of the battle for his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
                  (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &amp; the Bankrupt-Insolvent &amp; Usury Report.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Select Committee on the Bankrupt Laws reported
                  in 1817 and 1818. The Select Committee on the Usury Laws reported in 1818 (ordered
                  to be printed 28 May 1818).</note> The latter is a question which I do not
               understand, but because Jeremy Bentham<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Jeremy Bentham (1748&#8211;1832; <title>DNB</title>). His <title>Defence of
                     Usury</title> (1787) condemned the existing laws restricting interest rates on
                  loans. Since 1713 the maximum interest rate that could be charged was 5% &#8211; a
                  provision that was not repealed until 1854.</note> is the great authority on one
               side, I am inclined to suppose the other must be in the right. Can you send me the
               report upon the Churches, &#8211; for I am about to take this as the text for a
               miscellaneous discourse upon Churches Cemeteries &amp;c.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s articles on &#8216;New Churches&#8217;, <title>Quarterly

                  Paris&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (April 1819), 359&#8211;98. The &#8216;report&#8217;
                  refers to events on 16 March 1818, when Nicholas Vansittart (1766&#8211;1851;
                     <title>DNB</title>), Chancellor of the Exchequer 1812&#8211;1823, drew attention to
                  statistics collected on the deficiency of Church of England places of worship and
                  proposed &#163;1,000,000 be spent on constructing new churches. This proposal was
                  embodied in the Church Building Act (1818).</note>

                  general election of 1818.</note> was by dint of the true demagogue system, &#8211;
                  <del>lyin</del> lying by word of mouth &amp; thro the press with undaunted
               impudence &amp; indefatigable perseverance. He has set on foot a sort of United Irish
               association to keep the county in a state of perpetual agitation,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">When the poll closed for the 1818 Westmorland
                  Election, confirming that Brougham had not been elected, a meeting of Brougham&#8217;s
                  friends in the yard of Appleby Castle endorsed resolutions forming a &#8216;Grand
                  Association to secure the independence of Westmorland and Cumberland&#8217;, i.e. to
                  work to promote future Whig candidates. In the <title>Westmorland Gazette</title>
                  of 18 July 1818, De Quincey described the Association as &#8216;nearer the compacts of
                  Irish insurgents than anything yet witnessed among Englishmen and professing
                  friends of the Constitution&#8217; &#8211; comparing the Association to the United Irish
                  rebels of 1798. Southey had probably received his information from De
                  Quincey.</note> &#8211; Lord Thanet<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Sackville
                  Tufton, 9th Earl of Thanet (1769&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), the principal Whig
                  landowner in Westmorland and financial backer of Brougham&#8217;s election
                  campaign.</note> gave him this precious plan which he himself received from the

                  Stanhope (1753&#8211;1816; <title>DNB</title>), radical peer and, like the Earl of
                  Thanet, a major landowner in Kent.</note> for the benefit of the people of
                  Kent.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1780 Stanhope helped organise
                  in Kent a county association to promote political reform and to petition
                  parliament.</note> On the other hand he has lost ground by his ill temper, &#8211; &amp;
               is likely to lose more, for there will be some difficulty in paying the expenses of
               the struggle. He has no wealth on his side here. Lord Thanet gave 4000 &#163; &#8211; but that
               was gone presently. Lambton<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">John George

                  schoolmate of Southey&#8217;s in Bristol. He seems to have played an important backstage
                  role in organising the Lowther family&#8217;s election contests in Westmorland in 1818,
                  1820 and 1826. As Southey implies here, one of his tasks was to organise physical
                  force in the interests of the Lowthers. </note> a man who is in his element in
               such a scene, &amp; is quite willing when he cannot persuade his opponents to act

                  Brougham, which he modelled on his pamphlet <title>A Letter to William Smith, Esq.,
                     M. P.</title> (1817) and termed the &#8216;Tender Epistle&#8217;. The sections that were
                  completed were published as a &#8216;Postscript&#8217; (without naming Brougham) to the second

                  seats in 1818. But in Cumberland the representation was shared between the

        <p rend="indent1"> &#8211; I cannot help suspecting that Cochrane is gone to carry off
                  Buonaparte.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Cochrane, 10th

                  leaving the country. He accepted an offer to command the navy of the
                  revolutionaries who were attempting to liberate Chile and Peru from Spanish
                  control and arrived in Valparaiso on 28 November 1818. Southey suspected that his
                  ulterior motive was to free Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French
