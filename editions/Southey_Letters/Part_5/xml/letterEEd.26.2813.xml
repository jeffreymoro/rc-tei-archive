        <p rend="indent1"> Tho there is a very good reason why my unlucky poem (which after miscarrying in 1814, might have met with a more
               irreparable mischance now) should not be published in London till it hath been presented,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had begun composing celebratory verse in March&#8211;June 1814 when Princess Charlotte had been engaged to William, Hereditary
                  Prince of Orange (1792&#8211;1849; King of the Netherlands 1840&#8211;1849). When that engagement was broken off, he had laid the verses aside,
                  only to reuse them in 1816 in an epithalamion, <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> celebrating Princess
                  Charlotte&#8217;s marriage to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) on 2 May 1816.
                  Publication was delayed until Southey received formal permission to dedicate his poem to the Princess.</note> there is no reason why
               its publication at the Ant-Hill<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A nickname for <ref type="m" target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref> deriving from the presence there of three aunts &#8211; the Fricker sisters Edith, Sarah and Mary.</note> should be
               delayed on that account; &amp; therefore I should like to have the copies which are destined for this quarter, without delay. Moreover,
               if the copy for <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> be not dispatched, it need not go to him, as I
               have just learned that he is coming here for the Long vacation, by an injudicious arrangement of <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">his mothers</ref>, instead of accepting an invitation from <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his fathers</ref> brothers<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The surviving brothers
                  were: James (1759&#8211;1836), Edward (1760&#8211;1843) and <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">George Coleridge</ref>. The
                  family was centred on Ottery St Mary, Devon.</note> in Devonshire, with whom on every account it was highly proper that he should
               have become acquainted on the first possible opportunity.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The <del>agricultural</del> riots in the Eastern counties,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Ely, or
                  Littleport, riots of 22&#8211;24 May 1816, caused by high unemployment and bread prices. Trials of those accused took place at Ely 17&#8211;22
                  June; five men were hanged on 28 June.</note> &amp; the hooting down of the Kent address ought to open the eyes of government as to
               the real state of feeling in the populace,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A meeting at Maidstone on 17 June 1816 rejected, with
                  jeering and hissing, proposed loyal addresses of congratulation from the county to the royal family, on the occasion of the marriage
                  of the Princess Charlotte to Prince Leopold. Objecting to the expenditure the government proposed making on the royal couple, the
                  meeting called for money to be spent to help unemployed agricultural workers.</note> &#8211; a subject upon which they are strangely
               ignorant, or inexcusably careless. They seem never to dream that revolutions in the state are like the eruption in the small pox &#8211; the
               consequence of the {disease} prexistent in the system, &#8211; <del>the disease exists, &amp;</del> the body politic has been successfully
               inoculated for it, &amp; the inoculation has taken; &#8211; the disease exists; &amp; if it should not run the same course as in France, it
               will be because Government can depend upon the army, &amp; the Gentry of the country, Whigs &amp; all, would rally round it in danger.
               But as far depends upon the opinion of the multitude, the work is done. What they ought to do is to make transportation the punishment
               for seditious libel, &#8211; had this been done seven years ago, the country would have been rid of <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref>
          <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Weekly Political
                     Register</title>, written and published 1802&#8211;1835 by William Cobbett, was the radical paper the government most despised; it had
                  increased stamp duty on newspapers partly in order to make them expensive and restrict their circulation. In November 1816 Cobbett
                  began publishing a shorter version, shorn of news but retaining comment, for 2<title>d</title>., thus boosting circulation to an
                  estimated 40,000. Cobbett had been imprisoned for two years in 1810&#8211;1812 for seditious libel.</note> &amp; the Examiner,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Examiner</title> was a weekly opposition paper run 1808&#8211;1821 by <ref type="m" target="people.html#HuntLeigh">James Henry Leigh Hunt</ref> and his brother John Hunt (1775&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>). It sold c.
                  7,000&#8211;8,000 copies per week, but its readership was much wider than these figures suggest. Both brothers had been imprisoned for
                  seditious libel 1813&#8211;1815.</note> &#8211; one or other of which are read in every pot-house. And Government should recollect that if a
               Review has done them good service, newspapers <del>are capable of acting</del> {act} upon a much more numerous public. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> talks about a standing army, the old opposition language of sixty years
                  <del>standing</del> growth, but with the new opposition spirit. There is no danger from any arbitrary disposition in the Crown, &#8211;
               but there is a mortal danger of seeing the liberties of the country destroyed by the abuse of them, &#8211; a tremendous probability that the

                  was also fought by Bengali intellectuals who denied its vedic standing. Sati was not, however, legally prohibited in

               abolish this abominable practise than it was to abolish infanticide: for the Bramins do not defend it as enjoined by their scriptures;
               it did not exist when their sacred books were written, &amp; nothing would make the British Government so popular among the Women in
