          <salute>My dear R.</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry we shall not see you this year, &#8211; for this among other
               reasons, &#8211; that God knows whether we may both live till the next. But the cause for
               this disappointment is valid, &#8211; &amp; I will look {on} in hope.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to the map a great blunder has been committed which it is
               impossible to remedy. Instead of giving <del>only</del> Brazil &amp; Paraguay, &amp;
               marking the adjoining countries in outline, the map has been made equally full in all
               parts.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#ArrowsmithAaron">Aaron
                     Arrowsmith</ref> had been commissioned to make a map of Brazil and Paraguay for
                  the second volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). It
                  was this map with which Southey was dissatisfied.</note> The only palliative of
               this absurdity is to colour the boundary of the two countries to which the history
               relates, &#8211; one unnecessary expence thus creating another. As for correcting the map I
               perceive it is quite hopeless. And I console myself thus &#8211; a sister<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Charlotte Koster (b. 1783). </note> of <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Kosters</ref> who has most excellent use of her fingers,
               is copying for me the outline of all the Captaincies, separately, from the great map.
               These I shall fill up with my additions, &#8211; &amp; thus prepare materials for a proper
               map, or series of maps for some future edition, &#8211; which perhaps will not be required
               during my life.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was correct &#8211; no
                  further maps were added to the <title>History of Brazil</title> after that which
                  appeared in the second volume of 1817.</note>

                  the Practicality and Expediency of Supplying our West India Colonies with Free

                  <del>is a</del> will serve as text to an important subject. There are also Reports
               upon the Police of London, &amp; upon the State of Ireland, of which I should be

                  the Disturbances which have recently prevailed in Ireland, and Measures adopted in
                  consequence thereof (ordered to be printed by the House of Commons, 14 June 1816).

                  intention at this time, though he remained a convinced opponent of Catholic

               make the Dissenters &amp; the Methodists act against the Catholicks at this
                  time.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey kept a close eye on the
                  Nonconformist press. He was for instance a subscriber to the <title>Evangelical
                     Magazine</title> 1811&#8211;1841, no. 1014 in the sale catalogue of his library. This
                  would have alerted him to the intense anger felt in Nonconformist circles at what
                  they perceived to be the persecution of Protestants by Catholics in the South of
                  France, e.g. <title>Evangelical Magazine</title> 24 (June 1816), 3.</note>
