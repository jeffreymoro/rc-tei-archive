        <p rend="indent1"> My first business on arriving here yesterday evening, was to go to the Post Office, &#8211; judge of my disappointment in
               finding nothing but a scrawl from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>, merely telling me what I knew
               before by your letter to Geneva. I am sure you have written. Your letter has been lost, &amp; I must remain without any news from home
               till I reach London. Write as soon as you receive this, &amp; direct to <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Q Anne
                  Street</ref>, where I expect to be as soon as your answer. We stay here to day &amp; to morrow. &#8211; We have <del>xxxxxx xxx</del>
               travelled without one days intermission from Zurich to this place &#8211; sixteen days journey: &#8211; this halt is indispensable for our
               wardrobe, &amp; very useful to ourselves. Sunday morning we start, &amp; on Tuesday shall be at Calais. &#8211; I shall of course dispatch a
               line from Dover. We are in high health, &amp; have met with no accident, impediment, or unpleasant circumstance of any kind.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Since I wrote from Echichens<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The residence of John Awdry (1766&#8211;1844), solicitor
                  in Reybridge and his wife Jane, n&#233;e Bigg-Wither (1770&#8211;1845), sister of Herbert Hill&#8217;s wife, Catherine.</note> I have seen the finest
               part of Switzerland. We were nine days <hi rend="ital">enfonced</hi>
          <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Dug in&#8217;.</note> as we
               call it among the mountains, travelling sometimes in car or cart, sometimes on [MS missing]back, sometimes on foot with a man to carry
               our little portmanteau, sometimes by water. The weather was delightful, the country beyond description beautiful, &amp; some of our
               adventures not a little comical. But I have no time to describe them. The carriage had been sent from Berne to Zurich. There we staid
               one day for the love of the washerwoman, thence to Schaffhausen &amp; the falls of the Rhine, Donaueschingen &amp; the source of the
               Danube, thro the Black forest &amp; the Hollenthal, which is being interpreted, Hell-dale (a beautiful place thus wickedly denominated)
               to Freyburg in the Brisgau Kehl &amp; across the Rhine to Strasburg. From that city we returned the same evening &amp; slept at Kehl, &#8211;
               the next day to Baden where we dined at a Table d Hote in the Inn yard, the house &amp; yard being full of all the Beaux &amp; Belles
               in the Gross Herzogs<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;The Great Duke&#8217;s&#8217;. The rulers of Baden were Grand Dukes &#8211; at this time

               the place was so crowded, so after seeing the dungeons of the Secret Tribunal<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In the castle at
                  Baden. The Secret Tribunal operated from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century; convictions for heresy or witchcraft were commonly
                  followed by immediate execution. The Tribunal often featured in Gothic romances.</note> &#8211; with stone doors a foot thick, the most
               devilish sight that I ever beheld, &#8211; we proceeded that night to Rastadt. Thence to Heidelberg (&amp; the Ton),<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A huge wine vat in the cellars of Heidelberg Castle.</note> Manheim, Frankfort, Mentz &amp; along the left bank of
               the Rhine to Cologne. Here we visited the Three Kings &amp; the Eleven Thousand Virgins &#8211; a visit so curious that I heartily wish you
               had been with us.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A reliquary in Cologne cathedral supposedly contains the bones of the magi who
                  visited the infant Christ in Bethlehem, <title>Matthew</title> 2: 1&#8211;12. The church of St Ursula in Cologne contains an enormous
                  reliquary in which supposedly lie the bones of this fourth-century British saint who, according to legend, was killed, with her
                  eleven thousand virginal handmaids, on a pilgrimage to Cologne, by the Huns besieging the city. The reliquary is extraordinary
                  because, in addition to its size, it displays the bones arranged in patterns and so as to form letters and words.</note> That night
               we slept at Julliers &amp; the next day breakfasted at Aix la Chapelle. You may be sure we did not go to our old abominable quarters &#8211;
               next door instead at the Dragon d&#8217;Or, &amp; there we were recognized by the waiter, who had been our Commissionaire.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">References to Southey&#8217;s trip to the Netherlands in 1815. Edith May Southey had been taken ill at
                  Aix-la-Chapelle and the party was held up there for a week.</note> I carried Percys Reliques with me as a present for D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Reumont:<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Gerhard Reumont (1765&#8211;1828), eminent Belgian doctor who treated
                  Edith May two years earlier; his wife was Lambertine Reumont, n&#233;e Kraussen (1786&#8211;1850). As a present, Southey gave Reumont a copy of
                  Thomas Percy (1729&#8211;1811; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</title> (1765).</note> &#8211; he wished for the
               book &amp; as the medical bookseller would not or could not execute his commission I had no means of sending it him before. He was not
               at home when I called, but I never saw a womans countenance express more pleasure than his wifes did when I explained who I was &amp;
               why I had called. We were in danger of sleeping at Herve that night for want of horses. However we got on to Liege, &amp; there also we
               were recognized. Next day to Huy &#8211; the people glad to see me here also. Called on M. Ouverx<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Francois-Joseph Ouwerx (dates unknown), of Huys, a soap manufacturer whom the Southeys had met on their tour in 1815.</note> &amp;
               sate three hours with him. He was exceedingly civil &amp; glad to see me, but did not invite us to sup or breakfast. He gave me a book
               of some rarity which I was glad to possess, &#8211; a dictionary of the Walloon dialect.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">M. R. H. J.

                  grape shot during the battle (18 June 1815). The leg was then buried in the garden and a tombstone erected, bearing the inscription
                  &#8216;Here lies the Leg of the illustrious and valiant Earl Uxbridge, Lieutenant-General of His Britannic Majesty, Commander in Chief of
                  the English, Belgian and Dutch cavalry, wounded on the 18 June 1815 at the memorable battle of Waterloo, who, by his heroism,
                  assisted in the triumph of the cause of mankind, gloriously decided by the resounding victory of the said day.&#8217; The tombstone became
                  a tourist attraction.</note> &#8211; &amp; to Brussels. The carriage had scarcely stop at the Hotel door before Henri was at the one door,
               &amp; the man who had driven us to Calais at the other. There was no room at our former Hotel, so we are next door at the Hotel de
