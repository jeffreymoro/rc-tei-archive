                  mother was Margaret Bigg-Wither (1768&#8211;1842), a sister of Hill&#8217;s wife, Catherine.
                  Blackstone became Rector of Worting, Hampshire 1819&#8211;1831, Southey&#8217;s uncle Herbert
                  Hill having held this living since 1815 (i.e. deputising as parish priest until
                  such time as Blackstone was ready to take up his duties). Southey had met
                  Blackstone in Switzerland in 1817 on his continental tour.</note> arrived on

                  charitable endowments for education through the Select Committee into the
                  Education of the Lower Orders in the Metropolis (1816). The Committee was
                  reappointed in 1817 and 1818 and its scope widened. Brougham focused on the
                  misapplication of funds intended for the education of the poor and looked into a
                  number of leading, and richly-endowed, schools, including Winchester. At this time
                  all Fellows of New College had to come from Winchester School and they could
                  retain their Fellowships if appointed to benefices.</note> may be to disable him

                  subsequent War of the Seven Reductions (1756&#8211;1757) to remove the Jesuit
                  settlements which had been transferred to Portuguese territory. Subsequent
