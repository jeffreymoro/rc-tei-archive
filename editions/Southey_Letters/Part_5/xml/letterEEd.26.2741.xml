          <salute>My dear Miss Betham</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been so busy with my poem (which from its subject required the
               least possible delay)<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s
                     Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note> that your first letter, sharing
               the fate of too many others, has remained unanswered. What shall I say to it now? &#8211;
               You must be aware how difficult or how impossible, it is when you communicate the
               state of your mind to communicate the circumstances which have altogether produced
               the impression that disturbs you; &#8211; strong as their aggregate evidence may appear to
               you, they would be deemed &#8216;light as air&#8217; by others. I am myself fully persuaded that
               your feelings &amp; imagination delude themselves; &#8211; &amp; that <del>xx</del> such a
               combination as that with which your mind is haunted, cannot possibly exist, &amp;
               could not possibly be so carried on.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We have all read the Lay<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                  Betham&#8217;s <title>The Lay of Marie: a Poem</title> (1816), no. 278 in the sale
                  catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> with great interest. The story is not
               perspicuous, &amp; thence there arises a disappointment at the end, &#8211; but throughout
               the execution is original &amp; striking. I do not remember ever to have seen the
               female heart so faithfully &amp; so delicately delineated; &amp; hence the poem
               derives a marked character, &amp; a permanent value. &#8211; I expect much pleasure from
               your smaller pieces which I will carefully peruse whenever they arrive.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly shorter poems that were later published
                  in Betham&#8217;s <title>Vignettes in Verse</title> (1818).</note> But you stand in no
               need of verbal criticism. It is only in the place of longer compositions that a
               little fault&#8211;finding in time would be of any use to you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Your note of today answers a question respecting <ref type="m" target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barkers</ref> copy which I should else have
               asked you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Where can I send you &#8220;the Poets Pilgrimage&#8221; when it <del>xxx</del>
               comes from the press, &#8211; which will be in about three weeks from this time? I hope to
               draw very near the conclusion of it this night. It has grown into a work of some
               length, above 2000 lines, in the six-lined stanza <del>of</del> which I used in
