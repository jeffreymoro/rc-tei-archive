        <p rend="indent1"> I want to raise 30 &#163; a year, for four years from this time, &amp; for this purpose.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is a lad at Richmond school (Yorkshire) by name <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert
                  Knowles</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Richmond School was a medieval foundation, at this time famous for the
                  standards of its classical learning and the number of its scholars who proceeded to Cambridge University, in particular.</note> &#8211;
               picked out from a very humble situation for his genius (he has neither father or mother) &amp; sent to this school (a very excellent
               one) by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Andrewes the Dean of Canterbury,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Gerrard Andrewes (1750&#8211;1825;
                     <title>DNB</title>), Rector of St. James&#8217;s, Piccadilly (1802&#8211;1825), Dean of Canterbury (1809&#8211;1825). He had been an usher at
                  Westminster School 1771&#8211;1784.</note> &#8211; &amp; a clergyman by name <ref type="m" target="people.html#DoylyGeorge">D&#8217;Oyle</ref> &#8211; so the name
               is written to me, if it should turn out to be D&#8217;Oyley of the Bartlett Buildings Society <del>so muc</del> &amp; the Quarterly so much
               the better.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">George D&#8217;Oyly was co-editor of an annotated Bible (1814) for the Anglican Missionary
                  organisation the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, which met in Bartlett&#8217;s Buildings. D&#8217;Oyly was a frequent contributor to
                     the<title> Quarterly Review</title>.</note> From these &amp; another clergyman he was promised 20 &#163; a year, his relations
               promising 30 &#163; more, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#TateJames">Tate</ref> (the schoolmaster, a good &amp; able man) gave him
                  <del>his</del> the run of his school; &#8211; more he could not do for the valid reason that he has a wife &amp; ten children; &#8211; so his
               boarding &amp;c were to be provided for. The plan was that when qualified here he was to go as a Sizar to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  Johns.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">That is, as an undergraduate in St John&#8217;s College, Cambridge, supported by a
                  scholarship, in return for which he performed various specified duties.</note> And this plan has been defeated by an inability on
               the part of his relations to fulfill their engagement, owing to unforeseen circumstances &#8211; connected I suppose with the pressure of the
               time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In this state of things, <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert Knowles</ref>, God help him, thought
               the sure way to help himself was to publish a poem.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;The Three Tabernacles&#8217;. Knowles was hoping
                  to publish it and had written to Southey asking permission to dedicate it to him. Following Knowles&#8217;s early death, Southey himself
                  published the poem as &#8216;Lines Written in the Churchyard of Richmond, Yorkshire&#8217; in his article &#8216;Cemeteries and Catacombs of Paris&#8217;,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (April 1819), 359&#8211;398 (396&#8211;398).</note> Accordingly he writes one, &#8211; &amp; introduces himself
               by letter to me, requesting leave to dedicate it to my Worship &#8211; if upon perusal I think it worthy &amp; so forth. &#8211; Of course I
               represented to him the folly of such a scheme, &#8211; but the poem is brimfull of power &amp; of promise, &#8211; I have written to his master
               &amp; received the highest possible character of him, both as to disposition &amp; conduct, &#8211; &amp; now I want to secure for him that
               trifling assistance which may put him in the right path &amp; give him at least a fair chance of rendering the talents with which God
               has endowed him, useful to himself &amp; beneficial to others.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of the 30 &#163; which are wanting for this purpose, I will give 10. And it is not for want of will that I do not supply the
               whole. Perhaps if you were to mention the circumstances to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> &amp; to
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> it might not be necessary to go farther. &#8211; He must remain where he
               is till October next, &amp; by that time will be qualified for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Johns.</p>
