        <p rend="indent1"> It is not from idleness &#8211; you may be well assured, that I do not return the first proof, &amp; send off the conclusion
               of the article. &#8211; The fact is that I have obtained some documents, &amp; shall obtain more, which will enable me to treat the specific
               subject of the Poor Laws with full information, &amp; a clear &amp; <del>specific</del> {determined} <hi rend="ital">purpose</hi>, in a
               way, that coming with the weight of your journal, &amp; in this next number, may assist (very materially I hope &amp; <hi rend="ital">trust</hi>) in ridding this country of a burthen far more ruinous than its national debt. Reforms will be presented at the meeting
               of Parliament without which the <hi rend="ital">research</hi> &amp; <hi rend="ital">strength</hi> of the article cannot be compleat &#8211;
               &amp; upon such a subject &amp; at such a time I think you will not repine at a three weeks delay, &#8211; especially as in that time I shall
               fit up &amp; finish the present paper for the number after, with this title &#8211; On the means of improving the People. &#8211; I am giving my
               whole time &amp; thought to these great subjects, &#8211; but the Poor Laws must <del>xxx xx</del> come <del>as the</del> first

                  by Southey and Rickman (mainly the latter), this appeared as &#8216;On the Poor Laws&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>&#184;18 (January 1818),
                  259&#8211;308, published 9 June 1818. Southey had hoped it would be included in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (October 1817),
                  published 21 February 1818. Southey followed this article with &#8216;On the Means of Improving the People&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>,

                  purpose.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Murray had just taken a stake in the <title>Edinburgh Monthly Magazine</title>,
                  which was re-named <title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title> (1817&#8211;1980). He had asked Southey for a poem to appear in the new
                  venture. The poem Southey sent is untraced and was not published.</note> &#8211; It is true that I have several of my Inscriptions for the
               Peninsular War, but they had better be reserved till the history is published, &amp; then follow it in the same form.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832). His inscriptions on the same subject
