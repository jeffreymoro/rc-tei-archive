                     Royal Quarto, Price 10s. 6d.</hi>// ESSAYS IN DESIGN/ FROM/ SOUTHEY&#8217;S POEM OF

            <title>/ </title>BY/ WILLIAM HAWKES
                  SMITH/ PROSPECTUS.// When an unprofessional Artist, and one whose only
                  opportunities of cultivating an acquaintance with the Arts, are the scanty
                  portions of leisure allowed from the pressure of his daily occupations; when such
                  a one ventures to submit the result of his labours to public notice, some apology
                  is necessary, and it is accordingly, with becoming diffidence, that these attempts
                  to embody the ideas of the Poet are given to the general eye.// The Sketches which
                  form the proposed work, were chiefly made several years ago, and their revision
                  and improvement have been the occasional occupation of the Artist&#8217;s leisure for
                  some months past. Fully aware that numerous defects may be detected, he trusts
                  that, under the unpretending title of &#8216;ESSAYS,&#8217; his efforts may be candidly
                  examined, and that if any merit be discernible in the <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, those errors in <hi rend="ital">Drawing</hi> which years of
                  close study would alone instruct him to avoid, may be pardoned.// The work will
                  consist of <hi rend="ital">Twenty-eight</hi> outline Etchings, from what are
                  deemed the most prominent and interesting situations in the Poem; they will be
                  printed on fine Royal Drawing Paper, and accompanied by a sheet of Letter-press,
                  containing ample explanatory quotations.// A specimen of the style of the designs,
                  is given in the Plate worked at the back of this page.// The Names of Subscribers
                  will be received by W. Hawkes Smith, Easy Row, Birmingham.// [SMITH,
