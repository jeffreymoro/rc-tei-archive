                  written by Rickman, and Southey was awaiting material from him.</note> Indeed if
               no unforeseen interruption should occur, this great opus will certainly be off my

               death have been flogged till they died. I will not say that the Portugueze are a
               hard-hearted people, &#8211; but they are in a very hard-hearted state of society. The
               prisoners have been all treated with abominable inhumanity &amp; insult. It is
               noticeable that many of them discovered no courage at the last, &#8211; this is putting
               courage to the test, &#8211; Of the thousands who were guillottined in France there were
               not above three or four persons who could not command their fears upon the scaffold;
               &#8211; &amp; in England we know that it is as common a thing to <hi rend="ital">die

        <p rend="indent1"> This is the first time that white men have been executed, or flogged,
               in Pernambuco. And the Priests are much offended that some of their number have been
