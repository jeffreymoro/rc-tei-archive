        <p rend="indent1"> I am afraid that the parcel has not reached you, as you have not
               written to acquaint me of its arrival.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was sending his brother books; see Southey to Thomas Southey, 27
                  April 1816, Letter 2774.</note> In that case you had better desire the Brough
               carrier to make enquiry at Penrith, where our carrier says it was duly deposited. It
               is somewhat remarkable that being about to have added another quarto volume to the
               packet, I was withheld by recollecting that carriers were only answerable to the
               amount of &#163;5 &amp; that this quarto would make it exceed that sum, &#8211; in case of
               accident.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The final proof of the Lay<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s poem <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>
                  (1816).</note> went back yesterday, &#8211; the insertion of a few stanzas occasioned a
               weeks delay in sending back a revise. There is no harm in this, for tho the poem may
               be late for the wedding,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Lay of
                     the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale </title>(1816) was intended as an epithalamion on
                  the wedding of Princess Charlotte to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865;
                     <title>DNB</title>) on 2 May 1816.</note> it will be far too soon for the
                  Pilgrimage,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s poem <title>The
                     Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note> which is of much more
               consequence. It must be presented before it is published, &amp; bound before it is
               presented, &#8211; for which operations another fortnight must be allowed, after the
               printers, hot-pressers, folders &amp; stitchers have done their work. Some credit I
               shall get by it among the few: &#8211; but in the way of profit, there can be little or no
               doubt but that more will be lost by its interfering with the sale of the Pilgrimage,
               than can be gained by its own. In matters of fashion, &amp; it is merely for fashion
               that books are bought by multitudes of buyers, &#8220;the last poem&#8221; is what is asked for,
               &#8220;Southeys last poem&#8221; &#8211; &amp; the poor <hi rend="ital">last but one</hi>, is at once
               left in the lurch. This is so much the case, that <del>xx</del> as a matter of
               prudence I did wrong in publishing the Pilgrimage. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My spirits I believe are now as good as they ever will be, &#8211; which
