                  Marquess Wellesley and Commissioner of the Board of Excise 1809&#8211;1819, had offered Southey the papers of his brother, Thomas Sydenham
                  (1780&#8211;1816), a soldier who served in India and then Spain 1811&#8211;1812, before ending his career as Minister Plenipotentiary at Lisbon
                  1814&#8211;1816. He also was a close friend of Marquess Wellesley, with whom he served in India. The papers were to help Southey with his
                     <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> till I make them myself when the box is returned which shall be

                  and <title>Aubrey</title> (1804) &#8211; his work, like Southey&#8217;s, was published by Longmans. The son was Alexander Robert Charles Dallas,
                  an officer in the British army in Spain and Portugal, whose manuscript was published as <title>Felix Alvarez, Or, Manners in Spain;
                     Containing Descriptive Accounts of Some of the Prominent Events of the Late Peninsular War</title> (1818). It had been sent to

               &amp; history is always unpleasant to a man who delights in historical truth; &#8211; but it is absurd to quarrel with a book for being what
               it pretends to be, &#8211; &amp; I have found some matters of fact in this which will appear to great advantage in their proper place. For
               this history indeed I have not only one of the finest subjects that has ever existed for historical narrative, but also the amplest
               materials, &amp; access to the best authorities. I hope to <del>bring</del> {carry} up a portion <del>with me</del> in the month of
