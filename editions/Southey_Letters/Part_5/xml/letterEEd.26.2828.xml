               briefly &amp; plainly what I have often thought of telling you &amp; have as often deferred.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You are not too old for marrying, &#8211; tho it would have been better to have married earlier, &#8211; but whether you can make
               up your mind to the kind of marriage which is within your choice is a question which you alone can answer, &amp; perhaps have never
               asked yourself; It is too late to marry for love, &amp; at your time of life you ought not to chuse a woman under thirty, &#8211; a greater
               disparity of years would afford less chance for happiness. &#8211; Most women marry for the sake of obtaining a settlement in life, &#8211; their
               condition in this country is very forlorn unless they have fortunes, &#8211; &amp; fortune falls to the lot of few. If you can resolve to
               marry a woman who has no money, you may find plenty who would accept you <del>for prudenti</del>, not for affection, but for prudential
               considerations, &#8211; but who would very <del>xx</del> soon learn to estimate you as you deserve. You could not do this without making some
               worldly sacrifices: &#8211; the first indispensable measure would be to insure your life, &amp; thus secure a provision for <del>your famil
                  widow &amp; f</del> her in case of your death; &#8211; the next to live upon a scale of expenditure which should be within <del>your</del>
               the residue of your income by 100 &#163; an year. There would be no diminution of comfort or of respectability in this, for 500 &#163; a year you
               could live as <hi rend="ital">happily</hi> as for 5000 &#163;. &#8211; In your situation this is what I should do. I might have expressed myself
               perhaps <del>as better less directly</del> {more winningly} by means of circumlocution, &#8211; but you will not require any round-aboutness,
                  <del>or</del> protestations, or qualifications from me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A walk from <ref type="m" target="places.html#RydalMount">Rydal</ref>, &amp; a weeks continual exercise &amp;
               excitement have somewhat <del>tired me &amp;</del> unfitted me for writing just now &#8211; therefore it is that I have thus bolted out my
               meaning in blunt words.</p>
