        <p rend="indent1"> Dont growl at my letter,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been drafting a letter formally presenting his <title>The Lay of
                     the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816) to its dedicatee, Princess
                  Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent. The poem was an epithalamion for her
                  marriage to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1790&#8211;1865; King of the
                  Belgians 1831&#8211;1865) on 2 May 1816; see Southey to Princess Charlotte, 4 June 1816,
                  Letter 2805.</note> &#8211; in the first place the only thing necessary is that there
               should be one the manner &amp; matter being infinitely unimportant (which I am wise
               enough perfectly to understand) &#8211; &amp; in the next place if a thought were bestowed
               upon it, it would not be liked the worse for having less of <del>the</del> court
               unction than is usually laid on.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I could not say any thing about the Dedication,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The dedication to <title>The Lay of the Laureate.

        <p rend="indent1"> (Here let me communicate to you a discovery which I have this day
               made. In that collection which the Butler compared with the Princess Elizabeths it is
               certain that he had <hi rend="ital">not </hi>got King Arthurs chamber pot, for such
               utensils <hi rend="ital">were not known in King Arthurs days</hi>; &amp; the honour
               of communicating this discovery to the learned world in the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               century is to be mine.)<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">One of the facts
                  that Southey collected under the name &#8216;Butleriana&#8217; and intended to publish, with
                  Bedford. The &#8216;Butler&#8217; humour dated from Southey&#8217;s and Bedford&#8217;s schooldays; some
                  of it found its way into print in Southey&#8217;s <title>The Doctor</title> (1834&#8211;1847).
                  In <title>The Byrth, Lyf, and Actes of Kyng Arthur</title>, 2 vols (London, 1817),
                  II, p. 462, Southey told the story of the chamber pot in a note: &#8216;A plot was laid
                  by the relations of the illegitimate Guenever to pass her off upon Arthur for her
                  half sister, and thus revenge themselves upon King Leodagan, whom they hated. It
                  was known that the true Guenever before she went to bed must go into the garden,
                  for a purpose which the romance writer states in the plainest language, and which
                  proves that one of the commonest and most indispensable chamber utensils was not
                  in use in King Arthur&#8217;s days, nor in his own. She was to be waylaid in the garden,
                  carried off, put into a boat, and kept somewhere in durance, while the false
                  Guenever was to be conducted to the bridal bed in her place, by a treacherous
                  governante.&#8217;</note>
