               attacking me in the House of Commons, &#8211; the only place where he dares attack any body without a mask.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">On 24 February 1817 Brougham, speaking in the House of Commons on the Cabinet&#8217;s Seditious Meetings Bill, had
                  contrasted the prosecution of radical writers with the government&#8217;s refusal to act against Southey for the pirated publication of
                     <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817) the radical play he had written in 1794. Southey had learned of this attack from the
                     <title>Courier</title>, 26 February 1817.</note> I hope this affair will give no friend {of mine} any more vexation than it does
               me. Immediately upon seeing the book advertised I wrote to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> &amp; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, giving them the whole facts, &amp; proposing to obtain an injunction in
                  Chancery.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had sent <title>Wat Tyler</title> to James Ridgway (1755&#8211;1838), and Henry
                  Symonds (1741&#8211;1816), radical booksellers, for publication; see Robert Southey to Edith Fricker, [c. 12 January 1795], <title>The
                     Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 123. Ridgway and Symonds did not publish it and it remained in
                  manuscript until a pirated publication, designed to embarrass the now anti-Jacobin Southey, appeared in 1817. Having taken advice
                  from Wynn and Turner, Southey launched a suit in Chancery so as to gain an injunction suppressing the publication. </note> How they
               will determine I do not yet know, &#8211; perhaps as <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> has thus given full
               publicity to the thing, they may not think it advisable to proceed, but let it rest, considering it as it really is of no importance.
               Men of this stamp who live in the perpetual fever of faction are as little capable of disturbing my tranquillity as they are of

               good word for our friend the <ref type="m" target="people.html#BurneyJames">Captain</ref>)<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey reviewed, among other books on the Tonga islands, John Martin (1789&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Account of the

                  Southey also reviewed in the same essay, Burney&#8217;s <title>A Chronological History of the Voyages and Discoveries in the South Sea or

                  just long enough to detain Wellington&#8217;s army, then to evacuate the city and join forces with the army of Louis Gabriel Suchet
                  (1770&#8211;1826). Although he succeeded in escaping from the city with his army on 11 April, the difficult terrain and the armistice that
                  ended the war prevented his uniting with Suchet. </note>
