                        <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>, in March–June 1814,
                     when Princess Charlotte, only child of the Prince Regent, was engaged to

                     1840–1849). He had to abandon the poem when the engagement was broken off, but
                     he was able to reuse most of it when the engagement of Charlotte to Leopold was
                     announced. Leopold had served in the Russian Army during the wars against

                     Prince Leopold, as both the royal houses of the Netherlands and Saxe-Coburg
