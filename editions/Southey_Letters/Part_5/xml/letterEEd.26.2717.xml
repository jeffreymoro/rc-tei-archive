               best obtained by showing him the chapters before they go to press: &#8211; he will then see
               where they are erroneous, &amp; where defective. I will however write to him in a few
               days, &#8211; &amp; I am about to write to Paris in the prospect of obtaining good
               information respecting Junots reign at Lisbon, from a very excellent &amp; able man
               implicated by no fault of his own in the ruin of those times.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey described the occupation of Lisbon by the French under
                  General Jean-Andoche Junot, 1st Duke of Abrant&#232;s (1771&#8211;1813) in 1807&#8211;1808 in
                     <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I,
                  pp. 92&#8211;148. His correspondent was possibly Timoteo Lecussan Verdier (1754&#8211;1831), a
                  Portuguese scholar and factory owner of French parentage, who Southey had met in
                  Portugal in March 1801 and whom he attempted to contact on his visit to Paris in
                  May 1817. Another possibility was Jean-Victoire de Novion (1747&#8211;1825), a French
                  &#233;migr&#233;, who was commander of the police force in Lisbon in 1801&#8211;1807. He had
                  returned to France in 1814 and held minor office under the royalist regime.</note>
