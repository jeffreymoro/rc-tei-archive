          <salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have thought upon your letters night &amp; morning.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford had written communicating a ministerial
                  proposal that Southey should edit a journal supporting the government and
                  attacking its critics. This letter constituted Southey&#8217;s considered reply.</note>
               You have long known what my opinion is of the state of public opinion in this
               country. For years I have distinctly seen the danger. Imus, imus pr&#230;cipites!<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Aulus Persius Flaccus (34&#8211;62 AD), Satire 3,
                  line 40, &#8216;We are going over the precipice&#8217;.</note> We are hurrying on headlong to
               revolution, &#8211; &amp; my hopes that we may be saved from what in its consequences would
               lead to the destruction of social order, not here alone but in France also, &amp; in
               the whole of Europe, &#8211; rest more upon the providence of God than upon any other
               foundation. &#8211; If this feeling were confined to myself there might seem to be less
               cause for it, but unhappily it is confirmed by the opinions of those men on whose
               judgement, &amp; sound sense I have the most reliance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The greater the danger the more necessary is it that we should face
               it manfully, &amp; resist it to the utmost. And if Government will show that Jupiter
               has not blinded them to their perilous state,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">As in the common Latin tag, &#8216;Quem Jupiter vult pedere, dementat prius&#8217;; &#8216;Whom
                  Jupiter would destroy, he first sends mad&#8217;.</note> some presumption may be drawn,
               that he does not mean to destroy us. The Press must be employed, ably &amp; actively
               employed in its behalf, &#8211; but this will not suffice unless a speedy &amp; effectual
               check be given to its Licentiousness. There was not half the danger in 1794 that
               there is at this time;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1794 the panic
                  about domestic revolution, inspired by events in France, was at its height; Habeas
                  Corpus was suspended, allowing imprisonment without trial, and a number of
                  prominent radicals were tried for treason.</note> &amp; it is partly owing to the
               injudicious measures which were then pursued that the danger is now what it is.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The present punishment for sedition is altogether nugatory. Fines
               &amp; imprisonment affect a public libeller slightly for a time in his comforts,
               &amp; something perhaps (which the law has not intended) in his health, &#8211; {but} his
               fortunes are rather bettered by the sentence than otherwise; the whole means of
               mischief are left him, &amp; the disposition to it is aggravated &amp; inflamed.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had in mind the imprisonment for two
                  years of the radical journalists <ref type="m" target="people.html#HuntLeigh">Leigh Hunt</ref> (in 1813&#8211;1815 for libelling the <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince
                     Regent</ref>) and <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref> (in
                  1810&#8211;1812 for seditious libel). Both men continued to edit their newspapers from
                  prison and emerged with their standing amongst radicals enhanced.</note> The
               punishment ought to be transportation. I, who upon the general question stand up for
               the vindictive character of penal justice, would in this case strip it of every thing
               vindictive. The object is to rid the country of men, who seek to overthrow it, &#8211;
               &amp; as these men have their friends as well as admirers, &amp; some of them however
               mischievous, <del>&amp; however xxxx</del> are rather mistaken than wicked, there
               would be both fitness, grace, &amp; political advantage in alleviating the sentence
               by indulgences suited to the circumstances of the culprit; &#8211; upon the conviction of
               such a man he should be shipped off as soon as possible, &#8211; a passage given his family
               &amp; that with such attention to their comforts as humanity requires, &#8211; he should
               not be regarded as a convict on his arrival, (otherwise than as <del>being</del> not
               being at liberty to leave the settlement) &amp; every facility <del>xxxxxx</del>
               given him for settling himself in the land, where he must necessarily become a useful
                  colonist.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Five prominent radicals had
                  been sentenced and deported to Australia in 1793&#8211;1794, events Southey had
                  condemned in his &#8216;To the Exiled Patriots &#8216; (1794). Their time in Australia was
                  easier than that of most deportees as they had received substantial gifts of money
                  from radical sympathisers, which allowed them to avoid forced labour and buy plots

                  policy.</note> The sentence would intimidate the disaffected, &amp; the temper in

               laying the most mischievous of the Revolutionary writers in confinement, under such

                  <del>xxxx</del> for this object <del>xxxxx</del> the aid of the Press is mainly
               necessary. It is possible that some Reflections upon the State of the Nation, if well
               written &amp; widely circulated before the meeting of Parliament, might go far
               towards <hi rend="ital">couching</hi>

               to continue the effect it would be desirable that a journal should be established

        <p rend="indent1"> My dear Grosvenor you have here the result of much consideration, as
               anxiously &amp; seriously given as the importance of the subject required.
               Communicate this to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref>. It does not appear to me
               necessary that I should go to London, nevertheless if he thought so, I will set my
               house in order &amp; depart. But I can write any thing better than I can say it. &#8211; My
               fear is that Government is not aware of the extent of the evil &#8211; how widely the
               contagion is spread, &amp; how actively it is propagated. It is indeed necessary,
               &amp; urgently so, that every effort should be made by means of the press to check
               the evil which the press produces, &#8211; but if <del>Government</del> {Ministers} depend
               upon this, it will not even impede for a moment the progress of that Revolution which
               like Jaggernauts Car<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">It was widely
                  believed in Europe that Hindu devotees threw themselves under chariots bearing
                  statues of the Hindu gods at Puri. Southey had used this idea in <title>The Curse
                     of Kehama</title> (1810), Book 14.</note> will crush them &amp; me, Nobles,
               Priests, Princes, &#8211; &amp; whatever stands in its way. The art of combining against
               the laws is perfectly understood by the disaffected, &#8211; so is the art of raising money
               to support such combinations, &#8211; so are the tactics of insurrection, &#8211; which is as
               capable of being reduced to system as the art of war. Bear witness Nottingham!<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">The post-war depression added to previously
                  existing causes of poverty in the textile manufacturing midlands, leading to
                  outbreaks of machine-breaking and protest. There were a number of trials for arson
                  and frame-breaking in Nottingham in August 1816, but Southey may have had in mind
                  the trial at Leicester on 10 August for the attack on Heathcote and Boden&#8217;s lace
                  mill in Loughborough on 28 June 1816.</note> The Revolution <hi rend="ital">is</hi> effected in the minds of the populace; the lower orders of tradesmen are
               very generally disaffected, the evil has spread &amp; is spreading in the middle
               class of society, &#8211; &amp; if the dry rot were to reach the soldiers, &#8211; the earthquake
               which in the course of one day laid Lisbon in dust &amp; ashes<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">The earthquake at Lisbon on 1 November 1755.</note> would be
               but a faint type of the destruction that must overtake this miserable country.
               Perhaps the evil is already too far gone &#8211; in my secret heart I am afraid so, &#8211; &amp;
               for many years have felt &amp; expressed an unwilling belief that to this we must
               come at last. The breach is made; &amp; if Government do not silence the batteries,
               all is lost.</p>
