                  <lb />Unpublished.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Ever since my return my chief employment has been rhyming &#8211; which I hope has been done to a good tune; &#8211; <del>xxx</del>
               the work has grown under my hands, &amp; is not yet compleated.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816).</note> I call it &#8220;<hi rend="ital">A</hi> Poets Pilgrimage to the Field of
               Belle Alliance&#8221; (<hi rend="ital">A</hi> or <hi rend="ital">The</hi> as any one may happen to like best who will give an opinion upon
               such a subject.) This evening I have finished the fourth part, which makes between 8 &amp; 900 lines in all.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey probably meant that he had drafted the &#8216;Proem&#8217; and Books 1&#8211;3 of Part One of the poem (840 lines in the
                  published version). But he was nowhere near finishing; the poem grew to include another Book in Part One and four Books in Part Two,
                  though the &#8216;hymn for victory&#8217; was not written.</note> there are yet two more parts to be written, &amp; perhaps a hymn for victory
               to conclude with. The sooner it is published the better, but I shall not for that reason push Pegasus<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In Greek mythology Pegasus was a winged horse; the fountain Hippocrene on Mount Helicon was created from his
                  hoof-print and all who drank from it received poetic inspiration.</note> beyond his speed, &#8211; for tho the occasion be temporary I
               have endeavoured to make something which shall {not} prove a mere temporary poem. It is in the six-lined stanza (like the story of
                  Gualbertos<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;St. Juan Gualberto&#8217;, first published in <title>Annual Anthology</title>, 2 vols
                  (Bristol, 1799&#8211;1800), II, pp. 1&#8211;19.</note>) &#8211; a form which naturally induces a tint of language in keeping with the title of a
               Pilgrimage. I hope there will be no delay about the engravings. <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">My fellow traveller</ref>
               who gives me the drawings lives next door to Burn,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Burn (1750&#8211;1821) was a friend of the
                  Southeys from their days in Portugal. A member of the Lisbon Factory, he was well-known to Herbert Hill and John May and had first
                  met Southey in Lisbon in 1796. He moved to London in 1806.</note> &amp; I have desired <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to commence an acquaintance with him, &#8211; the latter as my fact-otum being to convey them to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>. Some of the subjects are sufficiently picturesque, &amp; these prints will give an
               interest to the book.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Seven engravings of places around which the fighting at the Battle of
                  Waterloo (18 June 1815) centred, after drawings by Nash, appeared in <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>
                  (London,1816) as a frontispiece and between pp. 56&#8211;57, pp. 62&#8211;63, pp. 68&#8211;69, pp. 70&#8211;71, pp. 88&#8211;89, and pp. 90&#8211;91.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have heard nothing from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</ref> since we left him,
               &amp; this I regret, for I wish much to know how your leg is; &#8211; the weather has been very unfavourable at one time; &amp; you I fear
               are not disposed to allow the part that rest which it requires.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Two divisions of my foreign purchases have arrived in England, &amp; left London a week ago in one of <ref type="m" target="people.html#VardonMr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Vardons</ref> ships for Newcastle. Vardon says the Acta Sanctorum are among
                  them.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey hoped he had bought the 53&#8211;volume compendium of hagiographies, <title>Acta
                     Sanctorum </title>(1643&#8211;1794), no. 207 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. To his disappointment, he had only bought the
                  6&#8211;volume abridgement (1783&#8211;1794), no. 152 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> I wish this so much, that I doubt it for two
               weighty reasons (he not being a man who knows the Acts of the Saints from the Acts of the Sinners) &#8211; the bookseller was to draw on me
               for payment for them, &amp; of this no intimation has reached me; &#8211; &amp; I do not think so large a set of books (52 weighty folios)
               would come in one case, especially as my other purchases from the same man<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean-Baptiste Ver
                  Beyst (1770&#8211;1849), a famous Brussels bookseller.</note> were themselves of considerable bulk &#8211; more than 100 volumes, some thirty
               being folio or quarto. I am anxious for their arrival, many of them being very curious books</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your Lewis Guicciardini will help me to a few notes, &#8211; a great assistance this to a lean book, which must needs have a
               substantive shape.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey provided notes from Luigi Guicciardini (1521&#8211;1589), <title>Belgicae,
                     sive Inferioris Germaniae, Descriptio</title> (1613) in <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (London, 1816), pp. 202,
                  205.</note> My journal had better not be cut up for this purpose more than is absolutely necessary; &#8211; it will turn to much better
               account as a post obit<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey means that the manuscript journal he kept on his 1815 tour of
                  the Netherlands and Belgium should not be mined too heavily to provide notes to <title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title>
                  (1816) because to do so would diminish its value to his family as a posthumous publication. The journal was finally published as
                     <title>Journal of a Tour in the Netherlands in the Autumn of 1815</title> (1902).</note>
