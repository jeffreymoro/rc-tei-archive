               observing of course the secrecy which you desire &amp; giving them all the weight I

                  1817, Letter 2910. Walter Scott&#8217;s <title>Tales of My Landlord</title> (1816) was
                  reviewed in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (January 1817), 430&#8211;480. The
                  review was probably by many hands, including Scott himself, William Erskine
                  (1768&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>) and William Gifford. One of these two
                     <title>Tales</title> was <title>Old Mortality</title> (1816), centred on the
                  Covenanters&#8217; rebellion in South West Scotland in 1679. John Graham of Claverhouse,
                  7th Laird of Claverhouse and 1st Viscount Dundee (1648&#8211;1689; <title>DNB</title>)
                  was a key figure in suppressing the rebellion; Scott&#8217;s portrayal of Claverhouse
                  was ambiguous, drawing attention to both his bravery and his capacity for cruelty.
                  Wilberforce objected both to the portrayal of Claverhouse and the book&#8217;s use of
                  passages from the Bible. </note>

               to the very purport of your remarks; &amp; I recollect observing that tho this bloody
               persecutor was celebrated on earth by the name of Dundee, Claverhouse was the name by
               which the Devil knew him.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Claverhouse&#8217;s name

                  strongly in a note to his poem, <title>The Sabbath</title> (1804).</note> I urged
               him as strongly as I could to take those times &amp; circumstances as the groundwork
               either for a dramatic or narrative poem, &#8211; a subject perfectly congenial to his
               powers, &amp; which he could have executed admirably. But he preferred ploughing away
               in his Georgics,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">James Grahame&#8217;s

                  Wilberforce. He provided Wilberforce with a seat in Parliament that he controlled

                  Francis was later a clergyman and Fellow of Gonville and Caius College,
                  Cambridge.</note> was mistaken in representing him to be in a dangerous state of
               health. Yet when I saw him I could not but fear that he was one who was not long to
               be a sojourner on earth. There is an expression in his countenance at times which has
               more of heaven than of earth about it, &#8211; something which is at once inexpressibly
               sweet but mournful, &#8211; like the smile of a broken heart.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall look anxiously for your name in the debates. From false
               doctrine, heresy &amp; schism Parliament cannot deliver us; &#8211; but from sedition,
