Between three and four years ago, <ref type="m" target="people.html#DusautoyJames">a youth</ref>, as ardent in the study of poetry as yourself, but under less favourable
               circumstances of fortune, sent me some specimens of his poems, and consulted me concerning the course of life which he should
                  pursue.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dusautoy had first written to Southey at the beginning of 1813, enclosing some of
                  his poems and asking advice about publishing them. Southey replied (the letter does not survive) and Dusautoy in turn wrote back.
                  For the reply to this second letter see Robert Southey to James Dusautoy, 12 February 1813, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert
                     Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2220.</note> He was the eldest of a very large family, and the father a half-pay officer.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Du Sautoy (1761–1859) had retired from his post as a Lieutenant in the Royal Marines in
                  1798. He was barrack-master of the cavalry at Totnes 1803–1822.</note> He wished to go to London, and study the law, and support
               himself while studying it by his pen. I pointed out to him the certain misery and ruin in which such an event would involve him, and
               recommended him to go to Cambridge, where, with his talents and acquirements, he could not fail of making his way, unless he was
               imprudent. I interested myself for him at Cambridge; he was placed at Emmanuel, won the good-will of his college, and was in the sure
               road both to independence and fame, when the fever of last year cut him off. I do not think there ever lived a youth of higher promise.
               His name was <ref type="m" target="people.html#DusautoyJames">James Dusautoy</ref>. This evening I have been looking over his papers,
               with a view of arranging a selection of them for the press. In seeking to serve him, I have been the means of sending him prematurely
               to the grave. I will at least endeavour to preserve his memory.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey proposed an edition of
                  Dusautoy to Longman in a letter of 8 March 1816, Letter 2733. However, this edition was abandoned because Southey felt the poems
                  would not suit public taste.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Of the many poets, young and old, whom I have known only by letter, <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke White</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#DusautoyJames">Dusautoy</ref>, and yourself have borne the fairest blossom.
