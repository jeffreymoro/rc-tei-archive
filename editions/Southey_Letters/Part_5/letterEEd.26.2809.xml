                  Fertility and Agricultural Population, of Several Counties of England and Wales’,
                     <title>The Literary Panorama and National Register</title>, 7<title/>(June 1816), 447–448. Southey had subscribed to this publication since
                  1809 – it was no. 1734 in the sale catalogue of his library. </note> – the most
               sensible of all our periodical publications, if books are to be estimated by the
               useful matter which they contain. It is not heathen Greek to me, – tho as remote as
               possible from all my own pursuits. Doubtless a number of curious results would arise
               from due consideration of this laborious summary, I could find many questions to
               propound therein. The net product per family in Bedford is given at 30 £, in Hereford
               at 40 £ – the agricultural population in both counties because at an exact
               proportion. I should have expected from the state of agriculture in the two counties
               to have found the advantage on the side of Bedford at least <del>or pa</del> as 4 : 3
               – instead of the difference lying the other way. Is there any roguery in the returns
               of the rental which may account for this?</p><p rend="indent1"> These agricultural rioters are begotten by the opposition<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Ely, or Littleport, riots of 22–24 May 1816,

               ground for rioting when good mob tactics may defy any military force, but they show
               that the newspapers &amp; the malcontent politics have infected the agricultural
               population also, &amp; this is no light evil, inasmuch as the wrong persons are
               hanged for it. One of my remedies is to make transportation the punishment for
