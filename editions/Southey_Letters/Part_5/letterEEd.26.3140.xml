               &amp; the very interesting letter by which it was introduced.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles had written to Southey on 25 April 1818, enclosing her
                  manuscript poem ‘Ellen Fitzarthur’ and seeking his advice as to publication; see
                  Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline
                     Bowles</title> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. [1]–4. The poem was published by
                  Longman in 1820.</note> You will have expected to hear from me ere this, &amp; I
               think I know how you will have thought &amp; felt as a suspicion has arisen of
               something even less pardonable than the brutal sort of repulse which you have done me
               the justice not to anticipate. – Parcels lie for me at <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Mess<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
               Longmans</ref> till they have
               occasion to send to me; – they then travel by waggon, which owing to the change of
               carriers is a business of eighteen days or sometimes three weeks. Your packet has
               been fortunate in not having been longer in <ref type="m" target="places.html#PaternosterRow">Paternoster Row</ref>. </p><p rend="indent1"> I reply to your letter without the delay of a single post, – &amp;
               with sincere pleasure, –</p><p rend="indent1"> for tho’ what I have to say may in some degree discourage
                  <del>hope</del> hope, in all other respects it will correspond entirely to your
               wishes. – The success of a poem, indeed of any <del>xxxx</del> composition
               whatsoever, does not depend upon its merit, – or less upon its merit than upon any
               other cause. Of the volumes of poetry which are published not one in twenty, –
               perhaps I might say in <hi rend="ital">fifty</hi>, – pays the expense of publication,
               – tho there is not one of the whole number which would not have excited attention
               &amp; secured <del>or</del> a remuneration to the author had it been published thirty
               years ago. No persons therefore should risque the publication of a poem on their own
               account unless the sacrifice of the money so expended were a matter of indifference.
               For the same reason booksellers will not purchase poetry, – unless from some writer
               who is in vogue. But I must not leave you here, without trying what can be done. The
               “Caroline Bowles, to whose very name &amp; existence I was a stranger” this morning,
               cannot now be to me an “insignificant” person, – one <del>of</del> whom I shall soon
               forget, – or by whom I would <del>xxxx</del> willingly {be} forgotten.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey quotes Bowles’s letter to him of 25 April
                  1818.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Booksellers are not the most liberal, nor the most amiable of men.
               They are necessarily <hi rend="ital">tradesmen</hi>, – &amp; a constant attention to
               profit &amp; loss is neither wholesome for the heart nor the understanding. Of those
               with whom I have any dealings <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> is the one who would be least unlikely to risque the
               publication of your poem, &amp; the most likely to make the publication answer. He
               would perhaps take the risque upon himself, &amp; give you half the eventual profits.
               Shall I write to him upon the subject? <del>xx</del> Poor as these terms may appear,
               they are the best that I have ever obtained {for} myself. – My recommendation ought
               to have some weight with him. </p><p rend="indent1"> I do not like such poems, because I am old enough to avoid all
               unnecessary pain. Real griefs do not lessen the susceptibility for fictitious ones,
               but they take away all desire for them. There is a great deal of beauty in it, –
                  <del>a female fluency</del> a womanly fluency, a womanly sweetness, a womanly
               truth &amp; tenderness of feeling, which I have enough of my mother in me perfectly
               to understand. It is provoking to think that if the same powers had been displayed in
               prose instead of verse, in a novel instead of a poem, there would have been little or
               no doubt of finding a publisher, – for let the supply of novels be what it will, the
               demand is sure to outrun it. </p><p rend="indent1"> Many years ago, I resided for a short time within ten miles of
                  Lymington.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles’s place of residence
                  was near Burton, Christ Church, where Southey lived in June–September 1797 and
                  again in October–December 1799.</note> I wish I were near enough now to see &amp;
               converse with you. It is in planning a work that advice is useful; – a single remark
               may then induce an author to avoid a fault, which <del>would xxxx</del> cannot
               afterwards be got rid of by any laborious correction. I do not mean to say that this
               poem has any such faults: – a few verbal alterations are all I should suggest here,
               &amp; a few omissions where they can be made without injury, chiefly for the sake of
               shortening it, because I foresee that its length will be a bookseller’s objection. –
               But to the point; – if you think proper I will write to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> &amp; ask him whether he will publish
               it, – this <del>you must</del> {I would wish you to} consider as extremely doubtful,
               – but if the application fails, it will not be for any want of warmth &amp; sincerity
               in the recommendation. And if it should fail you must not be discouraged, but turn
               your thoughts to something else, in prose or verse, – in which if I can assist you by
               any advice, or direct you<del>xx</del> to any subjects which carry with them some
               attraction, I shall be very happy to <del>xxxxxxx you</del> {show} that you have not
               honoured with your confidence one who is unfeeling &amp; therefore unworthy of it. –
               for the present farewell, &amp; believe me</p><closer><salute rend="indent2"> Yrs with sincere respect</salute><signed rend="indent3"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
