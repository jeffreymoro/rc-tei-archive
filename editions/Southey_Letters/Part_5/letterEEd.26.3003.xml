                  Catherine.</note> is residing, about eight miles from Lausanne, &amp; two from the
               borders of the Lake of Geneva. We are resting here on our way back from Milan.
               Thursday we begin our course again, &amp; after a weeks deviation into the very heart
               of Switzerland by the Lakes of Thuin &amp; Lucerne, we hasten homeward by Strasbourg
               Manheim, Frankfurt &amp; the Rhine. Four weeks from this time will I trust bring me
               to London, – this is going three beyond my furlough, tho we have lost no time &amp;
               spared no exertion. A week must be set down to the unusual lateness of the season.
               When we arrived in Switzerland, parts of the country which we should have taken on
               the way to Italy were not practicable because of the snow; – it was necessary
               therefore to leave them till our return, &amp; this sent us round by Mount
                  Cenis,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A mountain pass between France
                  and Italy, the traversal of which had been eased by a road constructed between
                  1803 and 1810.</note> whereby at the expence of a week or ten days circuit we have
               seen the Chartreuse,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The head monastery of

                  Crecy<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey compares the British
                  victory over the French at Waterloo (18 June 1815), with the victory over France
                  at the battle of Crécy (26 August 1346) in the Hundred Years War.</note> with
               pride. five days at Paris, where I saw Humboldt,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), the traveller, scientist
                  and, in his voluminous writings, a leading authority on Latin America.</note> but
               was disappointed by not meeting Espoz y Mina,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Francisco Espoz y Mina (1781–1836), Spanish guerrilla
                  leader in the Peninsular War. He was in exile after leading an unsuccessful revolt
                  against the royalist regime in September 1814.</note> for which I had waited a
               day. Fontainebleau, Auxerre, Dijon, Besançon, &amp; over the Jura mountains to
               Neufchatel. At Besançon the fine scenery began. Yverdun where we went to see
                  Pestalozzi,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi
                  (1746–1827), Swiss educational reformer.</note> – such a man that if I had him in
               a cage I could make a fortune by carrying him from fair to fair. I like him well as
               an oddity, &amp; a kind hearted, warm hearted strange fellow, – but as for his
               system, – it is one proof more how easily quackery of any kind makes its way in the
               world. Lausanne. Geneva, – a place which stinks worse than Lisbon or Edinburgh, – it
               is the very odour of heresy, – just as the cradle of Calvinism<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean Calvin (1509–1564), the founder of Calvinism,
                  which insisted souls were predestined to salvation or damnation, was based in
                  Geneva from 1541 and the town’s established church, the Protestant Church of
                  Geneva, followed his ideas.</note> ought to stink. And it is built as if the very
               Demon of Calvinism had been the architect, &amp; the prevailing principle had been
               not merely a contempt, but a hatred of any thing ornamental or beautiful. Chamberry
               here as we were to cross the French frontier, the Grand Chartreuse being in France,
               we were obliged to procure billets of health, owing to the report of an infectious
               disease in Piedmont. When we went to the third office thro which it was necessary to
               pass, the officer exclaimed when is this abominable comedy to end! He told us that
               upon every billet he had certified that no infectious disorder had existed in
               Piedmont, – but that the Prefect of the Isere<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Ferdinand de Bertier de Sauvigny (1782–1864), French émigré, Army officer and
                  administrator. He was Prefect of Isère 17 October 1816–27 August 1817.</note> –
               had some end in view by keeping up the delusion. Mount Cenis. The Savoyards were
               complaining loudly some that the King of Sardinia<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Victor Emmanuel I (1759–1824; King of Sardinia
                  1802–1821).</note> would send them no grain, others that the Piedmontese would
               allow none to pass. But the roads were absolutely thronged with carriages conveying
               it, – the top of the Cenis was literally like a fair or a market. The scarcity has
               been very severe in Savoy, &amp; in great part of France, – still more so in some
               parts of Switzerland &amp; Italy: – but with this as with robbers &amp; pestilence,
                  <del>xxxx xxxx</del> {evil} is heard of at a distance &amp; sometimes not to be
               heard of on the spot which has been named as the scene. Where we have been we have
               certainly found that provisions were dear, – rather more so in relation to their
               average price than they have been in England: – grain is now coming by land from
               Marseilles to Switzerland. But in a very few weeks there is every appearance of
               plenty. The hay harvest is getting in, &amp; it is an abundant one. They must by this
               time be cutting the corn in Italy: &amp; here as well as there every thing is looking
               well.</p><p rend="indent1"> Turin. Milan. Como, – there I found <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref>, &amp; heard of the
                  Princess<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline of
                  Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Princess of Wales (1768–1821; <title>DNB</title>),
                  estranged wife of the Prince Regent. She lived at the Villa d’Este on Lake Como
                  1815–1817.</note> who bids fair to rank in history with Messalina &amp; Joan of
                  Naples.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Two royal women who were
                  infamous for marital infidelity: Messalina (c. 17/20–48 AD), third wife of
                  Claudius (10 BC-AD 54; Emperor of Rome 41–54 AD); and Joan I (1328–1382; Queen of
                  Naples 1343–1382).</note> Her relations are infamous to the last degree of infamy,
               – the only respectable personage of the whole suite being – a Pelican, who has a
               carriage to himself – or herself – when the said Pelican travels. Of the three
               Gentlemen in attendance, the Prime Minister has been in six different <del>x</del>
               jails in Italy, &amp; you know it is not for a trifle that a man obtains admission
                  <del>at</del> into an Italian jail.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Bartolomeo Pergami (1783/4–1842). He had initially been hired as a servant,
                  but by this stage was running the Princess’s household. He was widely rumoured to
                  be her lover, but the information given here about his past is gossip, probably
                  relayed to Southey by Landor.</note> – the second would have been a gentleman of
               high fashion in that part of the <del>world</del> {Holy Land} which is now covered by
               the Dead Sea,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Sodom and Gomorrah, two
                  cities destroyed by God for the sinfulness of their inhabitants,
                     <title>Genesis</title> 13–19. The sin primarily associated with Sodom in
                  Christian traditions was homosexuality, so Southey is implying that one of
                  Caroline’s attendants was homosexual. Again, this information is merely local
                  gossip and it is not possible to identify this member of Caroline’s household, or
                  the one Southey claims was an assassin (the ‘practitioner with the stiletto’) with
                  any certainty.</note> – &amp; the third has distinguished himself as a
               practitioner with the stiletto. These wretches plunder her in every imaginable way,
               &amp; she keeps up the most lavish expenditure by the simple means of never paying
               her debts. To Como it is said she will not return on this account. – Lugano, the Lago
               Maggiore. Over the Simplon.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">The Simplon
                  pass, in the Swiss Alps, between Brig and Domodossola in Italy.</note> The Valais,
               – the most beautiful country that can be imagined, &amp; with the most miserable
               inhabitants, Cretins &amp; goitres being more numerous than I could possibly have
               supposed. I am satisfied that the water is the cause, for where the inhabitants drink
               clear water these dreadful curses are not found.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">These conditions were actually caused by a lack of iodine in
                  the soil.</note> They are frightful beyond description. From Martigny a three days
               excursion on mules to Chamounix, &amp; the <hi rend="ital">Mer de Glace</hi>, an
               absurd name for <del>ice of the</del> {a} Glacier {which ought to be called the
                  <del>Lake</del> Valley of Ice}. There is neither beauty nor sublimity in a
               Glacier. Yesterday we arrived here, – tanned to the colour of the Copper Indians,
               &amp; glad of a little rest. During seven weeks <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</ref> &amp; myself have never lain later than six – then only on the
               days when we were not travelling, &amp; have much more frequently risen at four than
               at five.</p><p rend="indent1"> The great industry of the people has surprized me. It is the same
               every where. There is more waste ground within twenty miles of London, upon any one
               line of road, than we have seen in the whole seven weeks that we have been
               travelling. France, Switzerland, Savoy, Piedmont, the Milanese, – it is every where
               the same, every shelf of the rocks is cultivated, &amp; houses &amp; villages are
               perched, where you might suppose it would tire a jack daw to reach them. And yet
               every where there is a degree of squalid poverty, which if it be not explained by the
               pressure of present scarcity, &amp; the effects of a war which in the first place
               drained the male population, &amp; lately brought armies thro the country, would
               appear altogether inexplicable. The women seem to be incessantly employed in
               agricultural labour &amp; almost as soon as they cease to be children, become old at
               once, &amp; look more like living mummies than like human beings, from constant
               exposure, filth, hard work &amp; perhaps insufficient nourishment.</p><p rend="indent1"> The Alps, – if the world should last another six thousand years, <ref type="m" target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref> will still be Skiddaw, but
               there will be no Alps, they will have mouldered down, &amp; formed a table land with
               the wreck. I could not have imagined such a scene of ruins. This it is which
               occasions the difficulty in making roads, &amp; in keeping them up when made. The
               Mount Cenis road is constructed with the greatest care &amp; skill, not the smallest
               runnel is permitted to cross the way; there are walls built up the side of the hill
               to conduct it to an arch under the road, &amp; stone channels by the road side, –
               otherwise a single wet season would break up all that is done. Landslips are so
               frequent, that a part of the new line has been given up as too dangerous, &amp; a new
               road is now constructing at prodigious expence in so spiral a line, that it passes

                  England. James Watson (1766–1838; <title>DNB</title>) was acquitted of High

               by the ambition of the Ruler but by the want of principle in the people. When the
               principle of private virtue fails, all institutions which are built upon it must
               fall. – I think of the subject propounded in your letter, &amp; think <del>xxxx</del>
