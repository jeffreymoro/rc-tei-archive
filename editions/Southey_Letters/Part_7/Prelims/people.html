                     that drew up the plans for the Cortes that met in 1810 and later served in that body
                     as a deputy from Aragon. In 1810-1811 he was in London as secretary to the Duke of
                     Albuquerque, the Cortes’s representative in the United Kingdom. At this time, Southey
                     (who had been given an introduction to Abella by Henry Crabb Robinson) wrote to him
                     requesting documents that might help with accounts of the Peninsular War Southey was
                     producing for the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>. Abella obliged and continued to send Southey material after he returned to Cadiz
                     in 1811. The two men became friendly, despite never meeting. Southey offered Abella
                     advice on where his son might attend school in England and Abella arranged for Southey
                     to become a Fellow of the Royal Spanish Academy and the Royal Academy of History.
                     After the restoration of royal absolutism in 1814 Southey lost contact with Abella.</span></li>

In 1797 Aikin and his son, Arthur Aikin, translated the first volume of Necker’s <em>On the French Revolution</em>. Southey translated the second. In the mid-1790s, Southey (using a variety of pseudonyms)
                     corresponded with Aikin in the latter’s capacity as editor of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>. In 1807 Southey contributed articles to the new periodical Aikin edited: <em>The Athenæum: a Magazine of Literary and Miscellaneous Information</em>. Southey also contributed to Aikin’s <em>General Biography</em> (1799–1813).</span></li>

                     MA 1803, MB and MD 1803). He first met Southey, who was flirting with a career in
                     medicine, at the Anatomy School in Oxford in early 1794. They became firm friends,
                     Southey later describing how in 1794 Allen had been his ‘bosom-companion’ and had
                     ‘rendered many hours delightful which would otherwise have passed in the destructive
                     daydreams of solitude’. Allen wrote poetry and, in Oxford in June 1794, introduced
                     Southey to Coleridge. In 1794–1795, Allen was possibly a convert to Pantisocracy.
                     In 1796, he enrolled at the Westminster Hospital and married a wealthy widow, Catherine,
                     daughter of Nathaniel Forster (1726–1790; <em>DNB</em>). She died within a year. In 1797, with the encouragement of Anthony Carlisle, he
                     became deputy surgeon with England’s Second Royals, then stationed in Portugal. He
                     was back in Britain by 1802 and from 1803 until his death worked as a journalist,
                     writing for (according to Charles Lamb) the London newspapers the <em>Oracle</em>, <em>True Briton</em>, <em>Star</em> and <em>Traveller</em>.</span></li>

                     the fine arts. Allston lived in England 1811–1818 and gained some renown for his <em>The Dead Man Restored to Life by Touching the Bones of the Prophet Elisha</em> (1811–1814). Southey met him in 1813 and shared Coleridge’s admiration for Allston’s
                     works.</span></li>

Southey employed him to make an accurate map of South America for the first
                     volume of his <em>History of Brazil</em> and suggested several books as sources for information about geographical locations.
                     In the end, it was the second volume of Southey’s history, published in 1817, which
                     contained Arrowsmith’s <em>Map of Brazil and Paraguay with the Adjoining Countries</em>.</span></li>

                     he worked as a music teacher at the Franciscan convent school, Taunton, Somerset.
                     He met Thomas Poole and probably through him made acquaintance with Southey. He published
                     his first volume of poetry – <em>The Last Days of Herculaneum; and Abradates and Panthea</em> – in 1821. By 1822 he was planning a poem centred on the Anglo-Saxons, especially
                     Alfred the Great, and wrote to Southey requesting assistance with locating information
                     on these and related subjects. Southey replied and a sporadic correspondence ensued.
                     Atherstone’s poem did not materialise, but his novel <em>The Sea-Kings in England: An Historical Romance of the Time of Alfred</em> appeared in 1830.</span></li>

                     (c. 1786–1831/1832) </span><span class="note" id="Note14"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Daughter of Thomas Holmes (1751–1827), a wealthy East India merchant, who changed
                     his name to Hunter on inheriting the Gobions estate in Hertfordshire in 1802 from
                     his wife’s grandfather. The same year, Ann Holmes eloped, aged sixteen, with Hugh
                     Doherty, an impecunious thirty-year-old Irishman and officer in the Light Dragoons.
                     Their marriage soon broke down, and Doherty published his account of events in <em>The Discovery</em> (1807). This revealed how, in an attempt to prevent the elopement, Ann had been confined
                     by her parents in a ‘madhouse’, from which he had helped her escape. After her separation
                     from her husband, Ann Doherty (as she was then known) published a number of novels,
                     including <em>Ronaldsha</em> (1808), <em>The Castles of Wolfnorth and Mont Eagle</em> (1812) and <em>The Knight of the Glen</em> (1815). Her personal life remained complex. In 1811 Hugh Doherty successfully sued
                     the architect Philip William Wyatt (d. 1835) for ‘criminal conversation’ with his
                     wife. Her relationship with Wyatt did not last and by 1818 she was referring to herself
                     as Ann Attersoll, probably because she was living with John Attersoll (c. 1784–1822),
                     a wealthy merchant, banker and MP for Wootton Bassett 1812–1813. At this time she
                     corresponded with Southey, sending him a copy of her <em>Peter the Cruel King of Castile and Leon: An Historical Play in Five Acts</em> (1818). By 1820 (possibly earlier) she was living in France and had dropped the name
                     of Attersoll and adopted that of Madame St Anne Holmes (much to Southey’s confusion).
                     A French translation of <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em>, published in 1821 by Pierre Hippolyte Amillet de Sagrie (1785–1830), was dedicated
                     to her. She remained in France and was later known by the surname de la Pigueliere.</span></li>

                     School and Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with a First in 1816. He was elected
                     a Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, at the same time as Hartley Coleridge in April
                     1819. He later qualified as a barrister, was knighted in 1830 and rose to the Supreme
                     Court of Judicature in Bombay 1839–1842. Southey first met Awdry in 1817 when he stayed
                     at the Awdry family’s Swiss holiday home on his continental tour.</span></li>

                     Bell, persuading the latter to bequeath £5,000 for this purpose. In 1827 Baird wrote
                     to Southey requesting that he write a poem, probably supporting Baird’s work as convenor
                     of the Highlands and Islands Committee of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
                     Southey refused the request on the grounds that ‘sacred poetry is what I have ever
                     been afraid to touch’.</span></li>

                     correspondence before he received part of the payment he was promised. Baldwin spent
                     the rest of his life as stock-keeper of the Stationers’ Company.</span></li>
               <li><span class="persName">Ballantyne, James (1772–1833)</span><span class="bibl"><em>DNB</em></span><span class="note" id="Note19"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Printer and schoolfriend of Walter Scott. He printed Southey’s <em>Madoc</em> (1805) and many of his subsequent poems. Ballantyne’s printing business, in which
                     Scott had a secret share, became one of the most highly regarded and profitable of
                     the first decade of the nineteenth century. In 1809 Southey agreed to provide historical
                     material for the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>, issued by the related publishing firm in which Ballantyne, Scott and Ballantyne’s
                     younger brother John were partners. Southey wrote the historical section of the <em>Register</em> between 1810–1813, though as the <em>Register</em> was issued two years in arrears, this covered the period 1808–1811. Southey was persuaded
                     to invest his first year’s salary of £209 in the <em>Register</em> and become a shareholder in the concern. However, the <em>Register</em> was not a financial success and helped draw the Ballantynes’ partnership into increasing
                     difficulties. Southey was not paid for his work on the volume published in 1813 and
                     ceased writing for the <em>Register</em> at the end of that year. He also lost his investment. As a result, Southey became
                     increasingly hostile to Ballantyne, describing him as shifty and incompetent (a ‘sad
                     shuffler’). Although the <em>Register</em>’s failure owed much to its attempt to compete in an already crowded marketplace,
                     Southey himself played a role. His contributions often massively exceeded the length
                     allocated to them, thus delaying the appearance and increasing the cost to the publisher
                     of the periodical. In 1811 Ballantyne’s concern about the impact of this on the <em>Register</em>’s potential sales led him to demand that Southey publish an apology at the front
                     of that year’s issue.</span></li>

                     Southey met in 1797 and had many acquaintances in common, including George Dyer, William
                     Godwin and Joseph Johnson. Barbauld was publicly linked with the literary and scientific
                     experimentalism of Southey’s circle, and featured in the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em> satire ‘The Pneumatic Revellers’ (1800). She and Southey both contributed to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> and the <em>Annual Review</em> and occasionally socialised, in particular during Southey’s time in London in 1801–1802.
                     However, his attitude to her was ambivalent. He agreed with her advice to Coleridge
                     (whom Barbauld admired and promoted) not to lose himself in ‘the maze of metaphysic

                     visited the Southeys frequently in Bristol, London and Keswick. She was godmother
                     to Southey’s first child, Margaret (d. 1803). Southey had a high opinion of Mary Barker’s
                     talents and proposed that she should illustrate <em>Madoc</em> (1805). She appears as the ‘Bhow Begum’ in <em>The Doctor</em> (1834–1847). Mary Barker lived at Greta Lodge in Keswick, next to Greta Hall, between
                     1812 and 1817, becoming a close friend of the Coleridges and Wordsworths, as well
                     as the Southeys, and teaching music to the girls of the families. Financial difficulties
                     forced her to move to Boulogne in 1819 and she never returned to England. Southey
                     met her for the last time on his trip to France in 1825. In 1830 she married a Mr

                     Chemistry at Oxford from 1788. In the early 1790s, a growing reputation as a radical
                     led to his surveillance by Home Office spies and failure to gain the Regius Chair
                     in Chemistry. He left Oxford for Bristol in 1793 and married Anna Edgeworth, sister
                     of the novelist Maria (1768–1849; <em>DNB</em>), in the following year. Beddoes was involved in the political protest movements
                     of the mid-1790s and possibly first met Southey in 1795, during the latter’s immersion
                     in Bristol politics. In 1799, Beddoes opened the Pneumatic Institute (from 1802 the
                     Preventive Medical Institution for the Sick and Drooping Poor) in Hotwells, Bristol.
                     Southey participated in the experiments with gases carried out by Beddoes and Humphry
                     Davy, and recorded in <em>Notice of Some Observations Made at the Medical Pneumatic Institution</em> (1799). Beddoes was a prolific writer on medical, political and educational reform.
                     He was also a poet: author of <em>Alexander’s Expedition</em> (1792) and a contributor to Southey’s <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799). Southey respected Beddoes’s medical judgment, consulting him on more than
                     one occasion. In 1809 he recorded that ‘From Beddoes I hoped for more good to the
                     human race than from any other individual’. However, disagreements about poetry ensured
                     that their personal relationship was not warm. Southey dismissed Beddoes as a ‘hypercritic
                     of the Darwin school’ and was furious when his ‘Domiciliary Verses’ (a parody of Samuel
                     Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and Southey) found its way into the first volume
                     of the <em>Annual Anthology</em>. Joseph Cottle, who was responsible for the poem’s inclusion, was ordered by Southey
                     not to solicit any further contributions from Beddoes.</span></li>

                     a version of his system outside Church control. Southey, at Bell’s request, supported
                     his system in an 1811 <em>Quarterly Review</em> article and book, <em>The Origin, Nature and Object of the New System of Education</em> (1812). By 1832, Bell’s National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles

                     translated <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814) into Dutch in 1823–1824. When Southey visited the Netherlands in 1825 he was
                     taken ill and the Bilderdijks nursed him at their home in Leiden. Southey was grateful
                     for their kindness and consideration and publicly praised Bilderdijk on a number of
                     occasions, most extensively in his ‘Epistle to Allan Cunningham’ (1829). Bilderdijk
                     ordered all his papers, including Southey’s letters, to be destroyed after his death,

                     the Farley estate, near Alton, Staffordshire. Robert Bill was educated at Macclesfield
                     School (now the King’s School, Macclesfield), whose headmaster was Dr David Davies
                     (1755–1828). Bill matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1807 graduating BA 1810
                     and MA 1814. He pursued a career as a barrister. In 1820 he married Louisa Dauncey,
                     the daughter of Philip Dauncey K.C. (d. 1819) and his wife Marie (Mary) (b. 1769),
                     and the granddaughter of Mrs Dolignon who had acted in loco parentis during Southey’s
                     time at Westminster School. Bill fathered two daughters and died in Rochester, Kent,
                     on 12 October 1823. As a schoolboy in May 1806, Bill wrote to Southey, expressing
                     his enthusiasm for his work. Bill was clearly a fan of contemporary poetry because
                     in February of the same year he had written admiringly to Thomas Campbell. His enthusiasm
                     persisted and in 1823 he, his wife and sister-in-law subscribed to Joanna Baillie’s <em>A Collection of Poems</em>, which included Southey’s ‘The Cataract of Lodore’ and ‘Lines in the Album, at Lowther
                     Castle’. Bill’s love of poetry was shared by his relative, and namesake, the mechanic
                     and inventor Robert Bill (1754–1827; <em>DNB</em>).</span></li>

                     Scottish publisher of the 1820s and 1830s. Blackwood’s career started in the antiquarian
                     bookselling business, but gradually moved into publishing. His appointment, in 1811,
                     as Edinburgh agent for John Murray gave him excellent links to the English book trade
                     and English authors. In 1817 he founded a new Tory periodical – the <em>Edinburgh Monthly Magazine</em>. Within six months this was refounded as <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em>, which rapidly emerged as a major counterpart to the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. Blackwood, travelling with Murray in the latter’s coach, visited Southey in Keswick
                     in September 1818. Although his (and Murray’s) attempts to enlist Southey as a contributor
                     to the new magazine failed, Blackwood and Southey did correspond occasionally. The
                     publisher was more successful with Caroline Bowles. She contributed to <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em> and published her other writings with Blackwood’s firm. This connection ensured that,
                     after Southey’s death, Bowles chose Blackwood as the publisher of two works co-authored
                     with her late husband: <em>The Life of the Rev. Andrew Bell</em> (1844; also co-authored with Cuthbert Southey) and <em>Robin Hood: A Fragment; with Other Fragments and Poems</em> (1847).</span></li>

                     Bloomfield was afflicted by poverty; Southey advised on schemes to raise money for

                     a retired Captain in the East India service, and Ann Burrard (1753–1817). The continuing
                     decline in her family’s finances was reflected in their move from Buckland Manor,
                     Bowles’s birthplace, to the more modest Buckland Cottage. In 1818, Bowles, fearing
                     that she would lose her home due to the mismanagement of her guardian, wrote to Southey
                     asking his advice about publishing her poetry with the aim of earning much-needed
                     cash. This initiated a correspondence that developed into close friendship and literary
                     collaboration, and culminated in marriage on 4 June 1839. Although Bowles’s finances
                     were in the event stabilised by an annuity from a Colonel Bruce, the ‘adopted’ son
                     of her father, she did pursue a literary career. She contributed to <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em>, and published poetry and prose, including <em>Ellen Fitzarthur</em> (1820), <em>Solitary Hours</em> (1826), <em>Chapters on Churchyards</em> (1829), <em>The Cat’s Tail</em> (1830), <em>Tales of the Factories</em> (1833) and <em>The Birth–Day</em> (1836). She also collaborated with Southey on an unfinished poem on ‘Robin Hood’,
                     which applied the metre of the oriental romance <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em> (1801) to an English subject. Bowles’s relationship with Southey has been the subject
                     of recent debate, though the destruction of part of their correspondence, especially
                     for the crucial period leading up to their marriage, makes it impossible to determine.
                     Certainly their marriage proved unpalatable to three of Southey’s surviving children
                     (Bertha, Kate and Cuthbert), and to some of his friends, including the Wordsworths.
                     Edith May Southey, her husband John Wood Warter, and other friends, such as Landor,
                     took Bowles’s side. Life at Greta Hall during Southey’s final years was uncomfortable,
                     with the house divided between the warring factions. Southey’s ill health and memory
                     loss meant that he was largely oblivious to what was going on around him. The feud
                     continued after Southey’s death in 1843 and ensured the collapse of plans for Henry
                     Taylor to produce a tombstone life of the Poet Laureate. Bowles returned to Hampshire,
                     where in 1847 she published the fragmentary ‘Robin Hood’. She was awarded a pension
                     from the civil list in 1852. On her death in 1854 she left her papers to Edith May
                     and John Wood Warter.</span></li>

                     Kennaway &amp; Co. In 1811 he moved to London where he was employed by Milford &amp; Co, suppliers
                     to Wellington’s troops in the Iberian peninsula. Bowring travelled widely in Europe
                     on company business. In 1823 his role as secretary of the London Greek Committee brought
                     him into contact with Byron and also led to the onset of serious financial problems.
                     He was an admirer of Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832; <em>DNB</em>). In 1824 the latter appointed Bowring as political editor of the recently founded <em>Westminster Review</em>. In later life Bowring fulfilled a wide range of roles, including MP for Bolton,
                     British Consul at Canton, and Deputy Lord Lieutenant for Devon. Bowring, like Southey,
                     was a gifted modern linguist. He published verse translations of Russian, Dutch, Polish,
                     Serbian, Hungarian, and Czech poetry, and in 1824 he sent Southey a presentation copy

                     inscribed on a memorial to Ralph in St Swithun’s Church, Walcot, Bath. In 1829 Broome

                     College, Oxford (matric. 1793). His varied career included time spent as a student
                     at a dissenting academy in Manchester, pastor to a Unitarian congregation in Great
                     Yarmouth, medical student at the University of Edinburgh, assistant to John Rickman,
                     domestic tutor to the sons of Lord Stanhope, assistant surgeon to a militia regiment,
                     and (in Poland) tutor to the family of Count Stanislaw Kostka Zamoyski (1775–1856),
                     a Polish nobleman, politician and patron of arts, after which Southey referred to
                     him as ‘the Count’. Burnett was also a professional writer, whose works included <em>View of the Present State of Poland</em> (1807; from essays originally published in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>), <em>Specimens of English Prose Writers</em> (1807; a companion to George Ellis’s <em>Specimens of the Early English Poets</em>) and <em>Extracts from the Prose Works of Milton</em> (1809). Southey met Burnett at Balliol and the two became friends. Burnett was one
                     of the originators of Pantisocracy and in true Pantisocratic spirit proposed to Martha
                     Fricker, who turned him down. In 1795, he shared lodgings with Southey and Coleridge
                     in Bristol. From 1797–1798, he was minister to a Unitarian congregation in Great Yarmouth,
                     Norfolk, where he also tutored Henry Herbert Southey. Burnett moved in metropolitan
                     literary circles and was friendly with Charles Lamb and John Rickman. His relationship
                     with Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge became deeply ambivalent — by 1803 he was
                     accusing both of treating him badly. Burnett was an opium addict and his last years
                     were probably spent in poverty. He died in the Marylebone Infirmary.</span></li>

He was nicknamed the ‘Capitaneus’ by Southey. He was sent to sea at the age of
                     10. In 1772 he sailed in the <span class="ital">Resolution</span> on James Cook’s (1728–1779; <em>DNB</em>) second voyage to the South Seas and on his return home in 1774 acted as an interpreter
                     for Omai, the first Tahitean to visit Britain. Burney sailed on Cook’s third voyage
                     and witnessed the latter’s death in 1779. He rose to the rank of Captain, but a reputation
                     for insubordination brought his active naval career to an end in 1784. In the 1790s,
                     Burney embarked on a second career as a writer, publishing an edition of William Bligh’s
                     (1754–1817; <em>DNB</em>) <em>A Voyage to the South Sea in HMS Bounty</em> (1792). His magnum opus was <em>A Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean</em> (1803–1817). Burney separated from his wife, setting up house between 1798 to 1803
                     with his half-sister Sarah Burney (1772–1844) in a relationship that was rumoured
                     to be incestuous. He returned to his wife in 1803, where Southey subsequently visited
                     him at his home in James Street, Westminster. Southey and Burney’s shared interest
                     in the South Seas and voyages of exploration led to a long-standing exchange of information

                     Clarke’s wide-ranging interests encompassed Persian, Arabic, Hindu, Coptic and Sanskrit
                     texts, alchemy, the occult, astronomy, folk tales, mineralogy and conchology. His
                     numerous publications included translations, a six-volume survey of the most important
                     books in ten ancient languages, a multi-volume collection of English translations
                     from the classics (1803–1806), <em>The Use and Misuse of Tobacco</em> (1797) and works on scripture and theology. In 1788 he married Mary Cooke (1760–1836),
                     daughter and heiress of a wealthy clothier, and in his later years lived in some affluence.
                     He died in 1832, a victim of the national cholera epidemic. Clarke was appointed as
                     a Methodist preacher in Bristol in 1798 and initially met Southey, and Humphry Davy,
                     there in 1800 at the home of Charles Fox (1740?–1809; <em>DNB</em>). In 1821 Clarke was commissioned by the Methodist Conference to produce a new biography
                     of John Wesley, partly in response to Southey’s work of the previous year, but instead
                     Clarke published a two-volume <em>Memoirs of the Wesley Family: Collected Principally from Original Documents</em> (1823). Clarke wrote to Southey a few times, including in 1826 to congratulate him
                     on his <em>Vindicæ Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ. Letters to Charles Butler, Esq. comprising Essays on the
                        Romish Religion and Vindicating The Book of the Church</em> (1826) and to suggest further sources for attacking the Catholic Church. Southey also
                     possessed a number of Clarke’s works and admired him as ‘the most learned man the

                     and on his critical posterity. It began in Oxford in summer 1794 when Robert Allen
                     introduced Southey to a visitor from Cambridge — Coleridge. It was a fateful meeting,
                     leading to the failed scheme of Pantisocracy, literary collaboration, and — eventually
                     — mutual disenchantment. As Southey later recorded: ‘that meeting fixed the future
                     fortunes of us both ... Coleridge had at that time thought little of politics, in
                     morals he was as loose ... as men at a university usually are, but he was a Unitarian.
                     my morals were of the sternest Stoicism ... that same feeling which made me a poet
                     kept me pure ... Our meeting was mutually serviceable, — I reformed his life, &amp; he
                     disposed me toward Xtianity’. It was Coleridge who induced Southey to come north and
                     live at Greta Hall in 1803. In 1804 he left Keswick for Malta and Italy for the sake
                     of his health, returning in 1806, after which he separated from his wife, leaving
                     her and his daughter Sara at Greta Hall and taking his sons Hartley and Derwent to
                     be educated at Ambleside, near the Wordsworths, with whom he lived. During 1807 and
                     1808 he was in London, lecturing and writing for the <em>Courier</em>, which duly puffed Southey’s work. In 1808 he planned, with assistance from Southey,
                     a new journal <em>The Friend</em>, editing this from Grasmere from 1809 to 1810, with Southey’s help as a proofreader.
                     In 1810 he quarrelled with Wordsworth and moved south. His last visit to the Lake
                     District was in 1812. His relationship with Southey, though distant, was never broken
                     and Southey continued to provide for his wife and children.</span></li>

                     Tory viewpoint, and a leading figure in Oxford University. He gained Southey’s approval
                     through his <em>Three Replies to the Calumnies of the Edinburgh Review</em> (1810–1811), which attacked the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>’s criticism of Oxford’s teaching.</span></li>

                     his father as MP for Newry in the Irish Parliament, 1776. Originally an opposition
                     MP, he first gained office as surveyor-general of the ordnance in 1788 and rose to
                     be Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1799–1804. Always a controversial figure,
                     he fought a duel with the opposition MP, Henry Grattan (1746–1820; <em>DNB</em>), in 1800. He supported the British government’s policies of Union between Britain
                     and Ireland and Catholic Emancipation, but was still dismissed by the Prime Minister,
                     William Pitt (1759–1806; <em>DNB</em>) in 1804. Rickman secured Southey the post of Corry’s secretary in 1801–1802.</span></li>

                     1795, his wife Edith lived with the Cottle sisters for some of the time Southey was

                     (matric. 1795, BA 1799). He then embarked on a legal training. He spent the final

                     and died in his chambers at Clifford’s Inn. Author of <em>Icelandic Poetry, or, The Edda of Saemund, Translated into English verse</em> (1797; published by Joseph Cottle and with a dedicatory poem by Southey). Several
                     of his other poems were collected posthumously in the fourth edition of Joseph Cottle, <em>Malvern Hills, With Minor Poems and Essays</em> (1829). Southey probably met Amos Cottle through his younger brother Joseph. The two

                     in Felix Farley’s newspaper’, Joseph was in fact the second child of Robert and Sarah
                     Cottle. He was educated at the school run by Richard Henderson (1736/7–1792) at Hanham,
                     near Bristol. In 1791 he opened a shop as a printseller, stationer, binder and bookseller
                     in Bristol. Cottle abandoned bookselling in 1798 but continued publishing. Between
                     1791 and 1800, he sold, printed or published 114 works, in congeries with Joseph Johnson,
                     Benjamin Flower, H. D. Symons and others. In 1800 he began to sell his copyrights
                     to the London firm of Longman. A poet and prose writer, his works included: <em>Poems</em> (1795), <em>Malvern Hills</em> (1798; with a prefatory poem by Southey), <em>Alfred</em> (1800), <em>The Fall of Cambria</em> (1808), <em>Early Recollections, Chiefly Relating to the Late Samuel Taylor Coleridge, During
                        his Long Residence in Bristol</em> (1837) and <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (1847). Cottle and Southey were introduced by Robert Lovell in 1794. Although not
                     wealthy, Cottle provided generous financial help to Southey throughout the 1790s,
                     even lending him money for his wedding ring. He published <em>Joan of Arc</em> and the majority of Southey’s earliest works, including <em>Poems</em> (1797) and <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em> (1797). His professional collaboration with Southey also included contributing poems
                     to the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and co-editing the works of their fellow Bristolian Thomas Chatterton (1752–1770; <em>DNB</em>). What Cottle did not know, was that Southey viewed his poetry with a merriment that
                     verged on contempt. The two men met less frequently after Southey’s move to Keswick
                     in 1803, but maintained their correspondence. Southey’s final tour of the West Country
                     in 1836–1837 included a visit to Cottle in Bristol. After Southey’s death, Cottle
                     was a central figure in the successful campaign to erect a monument to his memory
                     in Bristol cathedral. He recorded his association with Southey for posterity in his
                     controversial <em>Reminiscences</em> (1847), itself a reworking of the equally contentious <em>Early Recollections</em> (1837).</span></li>

                     He inherited the Croft baronetcy from a relative in 1797, but no money or lands to
                     accompany the title. He practised as a barrister in London in the late 1770s, and
                     gained some reputation as a miscellaneous writer. Perennially short of money, Croft
                     changed direction and graduated from University College, Oxford in 1785 and was appointed
                     Vicar of Prittlewell in Essex and chaplain of the British garrison in Quebec. Most
                     of his time in the late 1780s and early 1790s was devoted to compiling a new dictionary,
                     but, despite amassing 11,000 entries, he could not find enough subscribers to publish
                     the book and the project was abandoned in 1793. In 1795 Croft was arrested for debt
                     and fled to Hamburg, only returning to England in 1800–1802, after which he lived
                     in France, dying in Paris. In 1780 Croft had published <em>Love and Madness</em>, the story of James Hackman (c. 1752–1779; <em>DNB</em>), who had shot Martha Ray (1742?–1779; <em>DNB</em>), the lover of the Earl of Sandwich (1718–1792; <em>DNB</em>). The book contained a lengthy digression into the life of the Bristol poet Thomas
                     Chatterton (1752–1770; <em>DNB</em>). Southey published a letter in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> for November 1799, accusing Croft of obtaining some of Chatterton’s letters by deception
                     from the poet’s mother and sister, and refusing to pay them any share of his profits
                     from <em>Love and Madness</em>. Croft’s defence, to say the least, was evasive. In 1803 Southey and Joseph Cottle
                     published a new version of Chatterton’s works for the benefit of his sister and niece.</span></li>

                     particularly, of Peel. Croker was a prolific writer of light verse and often acted
                     as an intermediary between the government and the literary world – he played a key
                     role in making changes to Southey’s early Odes as Poet Laureate. He also contributed

                     as one of Peel’s key supporters and was satirised in both Disraeli’s <em>Coningsby</em> and Thackeray’s <em>Vanity Fair</em>. Southey admired some of Croker’s verse, but his attitude was tinged with reserve,
                     as he was well aware of Croker’s connections and influence in literary and political

                     He never married. A Dissenter, he died in London ‘during a short tarriance there’
                     and was buried in Asplands Burial Ground, Hackney. Danvers knew Southey from childhood.

                     with nitrous oxide, or ‘laughing gas’. Southey published some of Davy’s early poems
                     in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799) and (1800) and suggested Davy should write a poem on Mango Capac, the first
                     Inca, after Southey had failed in his plan to identify Madoc with the Inca ruler.
                     In January 1801 Davy moved to London, and Southey saw much less of him. Davy worked
                     at the Royal Institution, where he became a Professor in 1802. In 1807 he made a series
                     of experiments there, using the Voltaic pile to isolate previously unknown elements
                     including potassium and sodium. This work was regarded as a brilliant contribution
                     to Britain’s scientific reputation; Southey, while recognising Davy’s genius, thought
                     that he became vain and over-assiduous to win the approval of polite society. Davy
                     was elected President of the Royal Society in 1820.</span></li>

                     entered Middle Temple 1810; graduated LLB Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1814. His publications
                     included: <em>A Brief Account of the Subversion of the Papal Government in 1798</em> (1799); <em>Heads from the Fresco Pictures of Raffaele in the Vatican</em> (1802), reviewed by Southey in the <em>Annual Review</em> (1805); <em>A Selection of Twelve Heads from the Last Judgment of Michael Angelo</em> (1801); <em>Memoirs of a Literary and Political Character</em> (1803); and <em>The Life and Literary Works of Michael Angelo Buonarotti, with His Poetry and Letters</em> (1806). The latter contained translations by Southey and William Wordsworth. Southey
                     and Duppa were introduced by Edmund Seward in Oxford in 1793. Duppa was related to
                     Seward and, according to family lore, distantly related to Southey. Part of Southey’s

                     Horace Walpole Bedford. In the 1790s, Southey sought Duppa’s advice about projected
                     illustrated editions of his poems. Later, Duppa provided the material on Westminster

                     As a schoolboy in 1811 he canvassed Walter Scott’s advice and was politely encouraged
                     to improve his writing by gaining more knowledge. In 1813 Dusautoy sent some of his
                     verses to Southey. The latter replied and a correspondence about Dusautoy’s career
                     ensued. He took Southey’s advice and was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge,
                     in 1813. In 1814 he entered an ode, in Spenserian stanzas, for a university prize
                     in English poetry. He did not win, but did very well in examinations and seemed to
                     have a promising future. However, in 1815 he fell victim to an epidemic sweeping Cambridge.
                     Southey blamed himself, noting that without his encouragement Dusautoy would never
                     have been at the university and would therefore have not contracted the fatal disease.
                     As a tribute, he proposed publishing a selection of Dusautoy’s writing. However, when
                     he obtained the manuscripts, Southey felt they would not suit public taste: ‘To me
                     … the most obvious faults … are the most unequivocal proofs of genius in the author,
                     as being efforts of a mind conscious of a strength which it had not yet learnt to
                     use … But common readers read only to be amused, and to them these pieces would appear
                     crude and extravagant, because they would only see what <span class="ital">is</span>, without any reference to what might have been’. The edition of Dusautoy was therefore
                     abandoned.</span></li>

                     the late 1780s to mid-1790s he was active in reformist causes, a member of the Constitutional
                     Society and author of <em>An Inquiry into the Nature of Subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles</em> (1789, 2nd revised edn 1792), <em>Complaints of the Poor People of England</em> (1793) and <em>A Dissertation on the Theory and Practice of Benevolence</em> (1795). After 1795, he abandoned active politics, turning instead to scholarship and
                     literature. He was a prolific poet whose works included, <em>Poems, Consisting of Odes and Elegies</em> (1792), <em>The Poet’s Fate</em> (1797), and <em>Poetics</em> (1812). Dyer met Southey in c. 1794–1795, probably through Coleridge. He was enthusiastic
                     about Pantisocracy and encouraged the publication of <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> (1794). He seems to have corresponded with Southey from the mid-1790s, but none of
                     these early letters survive, making it difficult to judge the actual extent of their
                     friendship. It is, however, fair to say, that this has probably been underestimated.

                     He published <em>Night, or, the Legend of Wharncliffe</em> in 1818 and <em>Tales of the Night</em> in 1820. From the 1820s, Elliott was a manufacturer in Sheffield, where, disgusted

                     Southey and Edith met as children in Bristol. They married in secret on 14 November
                     1795 at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. As her sister Sarah later explained, Southey ‘left
                     ... [Edith] at the Church door’ and the following day departed for Spain and Portugal.
                     Edith spent the early days of her marriage living with the Cottle sisters and using
                     her maiden name, only reverting to ‘Southey’ when the secret became public in early
                     1796. Recent biographers of Southey have questioned the state of his marriage, particularly
                     given his lively — even flirtatious — friendships with Mary Barker and Caroline Bowles,
                     who became his second wife in 1839. Compared to these other women, or to her sister
                     Sarah, Edith is a relatively shadowy figure, plagued by physical and mental illness.
                     The deaths of four of her eight children, in particular that of her daughter Isabel
                     in 1826, hastened her decline. She suffered a complete collapse in 1834 and was taken
                     to The Retreat, the pioneering, Quaker-run asylum in York, where she was diagnosed
                     as of ‘unsound mind’ and treated with ‘purgatives, remedies, [and] leeches’. She was
                     released in 1835 ‘as admitted’ — that is, uncured and incurable. Edith spent her final
                     years at her home, Greta Hall, where she was cared for by Southey and her daughters
                     Bertha and Kate. Southey described her death as a release from ‘a pitiable state of

                     of his business speculations (including the manufacture of sugar pans) contributed
                     to Stephen Fricker’s early death and to a sharp decline in the fortunes of his family.
                     The family home was sold, Mrs Fricker moved into lodgings in Bristol and opened a

                     and was ‘partly educated’ with the three eldest girls. The similarity between their
                     situation and his own (Southey’s father was also a bankrupt) was perhaps an important

                     Their son, also called Robert, was born in 1795. After Lovell’s death in 1796, Southey
                     tried to persuade his family to provide for his widow and child. He was only partially
                     successful. The Lovells gave Robert Lovell Junior the occasional gift (for example,
                     £20 in 1802) and made some contribution to the boy’s early education, but they did
                     not provide consistent, long-term support. As a result, Mary and her son were dependent
                     upon Southey. They lived with or near to the Southeys for the rest of the 1790s and
                     early 1800s and in 1803 accompanied them to their new home, Greta Hall. Mary remained
                     with the Southeys after her son’s apprenticeship to a London printer. She finally
                     moved out when the house was given up after Southey’s death in 1843. She spent her
                     final years living with Kate, Southey’s unmarried daughter, and died on 10 August
                     1862. She was buried in the Southey grave in Crosthwaite churchyard, on the outskirts

                     a cousin of Stamford Raffles (1781–1826; <em>DNB</em>), colonial administrator and founder of Singapore. One of Hamond’s sisters lived
                     for a time in the household of Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Hamond’s business failed in
                     1813. He committed suicide by shooting himself through the head on 1 January 1820.
                     He had, he explained in a note left for the coroner, been planning his death for seven
                     years. Hamond moved in the same circles as Henry Herbert Southey and harboured ambitions
                     to be a writer. In early 1819 he asked Robert Southey, whom he had met socially, to
                     act as his literary executor. The Poet Laureate did not commit himself to doing so,
                     but wrote twice to Hamond. After he received no reply to the second letter, he assumed
                     he had caused offence and that the correspondence was at an end. The next he heard
                     was in January 1820, when Henry Crabb Robinson informed him that Hamond had committed
                     suicide and had named Southey as his literary executor. The latter took the task seriously
                     and proposed an edition of Hamond’s writings. After reading through his surviving
                     manuscripts Southey changed his mind, determining that they had no literary worth
                     and should remain unpublished. Henry Crabb Robinson noted that Hamond’s problems stemmed
                     from self-obsession and a sense of failure: ‘while he had a conviction that he was
                     to have been, and ought to have been, the greatest of men, he was conscious that in
                     fact he was not.’</span></li>

His maternal aunt, Anna Maria (1748–1829; <em>DNB</em>), was the widow of the orientalist Sir William Jones (1746–1794; <em>DNB</em>). The family returned to England in 1799. What became a lifelong interest in German
                     literature and scholarship began with Hare’s visit to Weimar in 1804. He matriculated
                     at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1812, graduated B.A. in 1816 and was elected to
                     a Fellowship in 1818. A bibliophile, he amassed a library of some 12,000 volumes that
                     was particularly rich in modern German writers. He obtained a Lectureship at Trinity
                     in 1822 and his pupils included Frederick Denison Maurice (1805–1872; <em>DNB</em>) and John Sterling (1806–1844; <em>DNB</em>). He was ordained in 1826, took up a family living at Herstmonceux, Sussex, in 1832,
                     and became Archdeacon of Lewes in 1840. His clerical career was shaped by his dislike
                     of partisanship and his vision of an Anglican Church that could encompass a broad
                     spectrum of belief. In 1844 he married Jane Esther Maurice (1814–1864), sister of
                     his former pupil and close friend. Hare’s literary career began with the publication
                     of <em>Sintram and His Companions</em> (1820), a translation of the gothic tale by Frederic de la Motte, Baron Fouqué (1777–1743).
                     Hare contributed criticism and translations to a number of periodicals, including <em>Ollier’s Literary Miscellany</em> and <em>The Athenaeum</em>, and did much to promote availability and knowledge of German higher criticism in
                     Britain. He also acted as an editor and agent for Walter Savage Landor, overseeing

                     it was in his power’) and on extremely bad terms with his older half-brother. Hill
                     was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1772, MA 1774). From 1782–1807, he was chaplain
                     to the British factory at Lisbon. Hill took a paternal interest in his nephews, and
                     helped finance Southey’s education. Hill’s concern about Southey’s refusal to take
                     the path mapped out for him (a path leading to ordination), his relationship with
                     Edith Fricker, and his politics, led him to visit England in 1795. He returned to
                     Portugal with Southey in tow. Oblivious to the fact that his nephew had married Edith
                     the day before their departure, Hill used every opportunity to introduce Southey to
                     more suitable women. Nevertheless, the time Southey spent with his uncle in 1795–1796
                     greatly strengthened their relationship, which remained close until Hill’s death in
                     1828. Hill encouraged his nephew’s interests in Spanish and Portuguese history and
                     literature – the <em>History of Brazil</em> and the unfinished <em>History of Portugal</em> were projects prompted by Hill, who supplied books and manuscripts for them. When
                     in 1806, the expected French invasion of Portugal forced Hill to contemplate returning
                     to England, Southey was detailed to go to Hill’s parish of Staunton-on-Wye, Herefordshire
                     and investigate the mismanagement of tithe income. Hill returned to this living in
                     November 1807 and was the incumbent there until 1810, when the Duke of Bedford presented
                     him to a parish in Streatham, near London. In 1808 Hill had married a woman twenty-five
                     years his junior, Catherine Bigg-Wither, a friend of Jane Austen (1775–1817; <em>DNB</em>). The marriage produced six surviving children, all of whom were on good terms with
                     Southey and his family. Hill’s son and namesake, Herbert Hill Junior, married Southey’s
                     daughter Bertha in 1839. Southey dedicated his <em>Colloquies</em> (1829) to his uncle.</span></li>

                     and remained in contact until c. 1828. Jennings was a great admirer of Southey’s writing,
                     but the admiration was not reciprocated. Southey nicknamed him ‘poor Trauma’ and ‘the
                     traumatic poet’, though he admired Jennings’s ‘moral character’. Jennings shared Southey’s
                     interest in educational methods, and in 1813, in collaboration with the local rector
                     at Huntspill, established a school conducted on Lancaster and Bell’s monitorial systems.
                     Jennings included anecdotes of Southey and Coleridge’s early careers in the <em>Metropolitan Literary Journal</em> (1824).</span></li>

                     well-connected. His father was the government manager at Rye, Sussex. Lamb’s career
                     benefited from the patronage of Lord Liverpool (1727–1808; <em>DNB</em>) and his eldest son, Lord Hawkesbury, a future Prime Minister. Lamb was private secretary
                     to Hawkesbury, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1801–1802, and in 1802
                     was offered but rejected the consulship at Lisbon, a post worth between £2000–2500
                     per year. He sat as an MP for Rye from 1802–1806, though he seems never to have spoken
                     in the House of Commons. He vacated his seat when appointed to the post of Law Clerk
                     at the Home Office by the Ministry of ‘Talents’. Following in the footsteps of his
                     grandfather and father, he was Mayor of Rye from 1803–1804, 1809–1810 and 1816–1817.
                     He never married. Southey described Lamb as ‘one of my oldest — &amp; once one of my most
                     intimate friends’. The two met whilst pupils at Westminster and Southey stayed with
                     Lamb’s family in Rye on more than one occasion. They drifted apart (though, Southey
                     later noted, ‘without dissention’) during Southey’s time at Oxford. Lamb seems to
                     have made an effort to renew their acquaintance, seeking Southey out in London in
                     1802. In later years, however, Southey’s opinion of him soured. He described him as
                     one who had ‘discarded decency’ and on reading of Lamb’s death in a newspaper admitted
                     that he had: ‘ ... thought more of him, poor fellow, in consequence, than I had done
                     for the last four-and-twenty years ... [He] had become a mere idle heir of fortune,
                     and not having his estates to manage while his father lived, had not even that occupation
                     to keep him from frivolities. He was an old man at thirty, and that too being of a

                     ten thousand reals for the relief of Venturada, which had been sacked by the French’.
                     He engaged in some minor action at Bilbao and ‘had the satisfaction of serving three
                     launches with powder and muskets, and of carrying on my shoulders six or seven miles
                     a child too heavy for its exhausted mother’ (quoted by Malcolm Elwin, <em>Savage Landor</em> (London, 1941), pp. 101–102). Thoroughly disgusted by the Convention of Cintra, and
                     believing that he had been insulted by Charles Stuart, Baron Stuart de Rothesay (1779–1845; <em>DNB</em>), British envoy to the Spanish juntas in French-occupied Spain, he returned to England
                     and from 1809, he lived at Llanthony Abbey in Wales, where Southey visited him in
                     1811. Landor left England to live in France and Italy in 1814. He received Southey’s
                     advice on his <em>Imaginary Conversations</em> (1824–46), visited Southey in Keswick in 1832, returned to England in 1836 and met
                     Southey for the last time in Bristol in 1837. In 1843 Landor published a tribute after
                     Southey’s death in <em>The Examiner</em>; he also sought advancement for Charles Cuthbert, Southey’s son, in the church. Admired
                     by Dickens, Browning, Swinburne and Trollope, Landor spent his final years in Italy
                     and died in Florence.</span></li>

                     Pemberton in 1799 and they moved to Ambleside in 1800. His works included: contributions
                     to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <em>Poems</em> (1797), <em>Blank Verse</em> (1798) (co-authored with Charles Lamb), the controversial roman-à-clef <em>Edmund Oliver</em> (1798), <em>Nugae Canorae</em> (1819), <em>Desultory Thoughts in London</em> (1821), <em>Poetical Essays on the Character of Pope</em> (1821), and <em>The Duke d’Ormond</em> (1822). Lloyd met Southey at Burton in August 1797, when he and Charles Lamb unexpectedly
                     turned up on Southey’s doorstep. Lloyd remained with Southey and his family for several
                     months. Southey recognised in him a fellow man of strong emotions, a kindred — yet
                     also unlike — spirit, and worried that Lloyd’s ‘feelings ... are not so blunt as we
                     could wish them — or as they should be for his own happiness’. Indeed Lloyd’s continued
                     presence was increasingly unwelcome and in 1798 his tale-telling led to a major quarrel
                     between Southey and Coleridge which was not healed until 1799. After Southey moved
                     to Keswick in 1803, he and his family saw Lloyd, who lived at Low Brathay near Ambleside,
                     regularly. Lloyd’s later life was clouded by mental illness. He was briefly confined
                     in the Quaker-run asylum The Retreat, York, and died in a sanatorium near Versailles.
                     In his edition of Cowper (1836–1837), Southey made his final public observations on
                     Lloyd’s tragic history: ‘[his] intellectual powers were of a very high order ... when
                     in company with persons who were not informed of his condition, no one could descry
                     in him the slightest appearance of a deranged mind.’</span></li>

                     and later of pins), and his first wife Edith Bourne, a Quaker minister. Lovell possibly
                     entered the manufacturing business (on his death he was described as a pin manufacturer)
                     but was ill at ease in the commercial world. In 1794 he married Mary Fricker. His
                     family disapproved of the match because she was not a Quaker and had worked as an
                     actress. Their son, also named Robert, was born in 1795. Lovell died at Bristol on
                     3 May 1796 of a fever contracted on a trip to Salisbury and exacerbated by refusing
                     to take medical advice before returning home. One of his final letters to his wife
                     is in the Huntington Library, San Marino, another in Bristol Reference Library. Lovell’s
                     father was reluctant to provide regular financial support for Mary Lovell and her
                     child, and both became part of Southey’s extended household. Lovell and Southey were
                     introduced by Sarah Fricker in Bristol in late 1793. Lovell was also a poet, his <em>Bristol: A Satire</em> appeared in 1794, and he and Southey embarked on a period of collaboration: planning
                     two co-authored collections, only one of which was published under the pseudonyms
                     ‘Bion’ [Southey] and ‘Moschus’ [Lovell] in late 1794. Lovell was also involved in
                     the 1794 revisions to Southey’s <em>Joan of Arc</em>. The advent of Coleridge in summer–autumn 1794 seems to have led (at least temporarily)
                     to a reorientation of literary relationships. Lovell was pushed to the margins. His
                     contribution to <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> was dropped and Coleridge was openly critical of his poetry. Lovell was, however,
                     involved in Pantisocracy and it was through him that Southey and Coleridge were introduced
                     to Joseph Cottle. After Lovell’s death, Southey tried — and failed — to produce a
                     subscription edition of his poems, to raise money for his widow and child. However,
                     Lovell’s writings were included in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799 and 1800) and <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em> (1807). In a notice published in <em>Literary Memoirs of Living Authors of Great Britain</em> (1798), David Rivers described Lovell’s poetry as being ‘entitled to considerable

                     (significantly less than those of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s children, whose paternal
                     relations were capable of greater generosity). In 1803 the money paid by the Lovell
                     family for his education ceased. Southey and John May tried to get Robert Lovell Junior
                     into Christ’s Hospital. They failed. The boy was apprenticed to a London printer and
                     effectively separated from his mother, who lived with the Southeys in Keswick. The
                     impact of this on his character seems to have been profound. In 1836 his first cousin
                     Sara Coleridge described his lack of social skills: ‘From nine years old he has had
                     to shift and scramble a good deal for himself, to bear up against a hard world which
                     would have crushed &lt;or injured&gt; the frame it did not render to a certain degree tough
                     &amp; unyielding ... [he] never had the opportunity of acquiring a taste for domestic,
                     scarcely even for social enjoyment: we ought not to wonder that he is deficient in
                     many qualities which can only be fostered thereby.’ Robert Lovell Junior predeceased
                     his mother. He disappeared whilst on a European walking tour in 1836.</span></li>

                     and republican, Phillips himself wrote anti-government articles for the periodical
                     under the signature ‘Common Sense’. Phillips’s business prospered in the first decade

                     not have a high opinion of him. In 1812 he cautioned that the publisher was ‘one of
                     the most accomplished rogues in his majestys dominions’. Southey also shared Coleridge’s

                     interest in chivalric romances brought them together. Scott reviewed Southey’s <em>Amadis of Gaul</em> in the <em>Annual Review</em>, and <em>The Chronicle of the Cid</em> and <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, while Southey reviewed Scott’s <em>Sir Tristram</em> in the <em>Annual</em>. Privately envious of the enormous sales Scott achieved with his own chivalric poems,
                     Southey was nevertheless a ready correspondent, persuading Scott of Wordsworth’s claims
                     to greatness. For his part Scott, as his fame and influence increased, did not forget
                     Southey: he arranged for Southey to write for the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> in 1807, and when Southey declined, disapproving of its anti-war politics and personal
                     attacks on authors, helped him to a position reviewing for the new journal set up
                     to counter the <em>Edinburgh</em> – the <em>Quarterly</em>. Scott also sought preferment for Southey via his connections in government: Canning
                     was approached to see whether a diplomatic place might be found; Melville was requested
                     to grant the post of Historiographer Royal. Southey also sought Scott’s help as he
                     pursued the sinecure of Steward of the Derwentwater estates (which had passed to the
                     Crown). None of these attempts having succeeded, Scott recommended in 1813 that Southey
                     should be offered the Laureateship, after refusing it himself. Scott had also been
                     influential behind the scenes in securing Southey the invitation from the Ballantynes’
                     publishing house (in which he was, unbeknownst to Southey, a silent partner) to write
                     the historical section of the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em> (1808–1811). Here Scott was disingenuous: Southey was offered a share in the venture
                     and so deferred payments owing to him to take up the offer; Scott, however, did not
                     reveal his own financial involvement in the firm even when, as it faced insolvency
                     in 1813, he promised to help Southey retrieve the monies owed him.</span></li>

Walter Scott edited her <em>Poetical Works</em> for Ballantyne in 1810; her voluminous correspondence was published in 1811. Seward
                     was quick to recognise Southey as a poet to be watched: her 1797 ‘Philippic on a Modern
                     Epic’ condemned the ‘Baneful’ politics of his <em>Joan of Arc</em>, but simultaneously heralded it as the work of ‘sun-born Genius’. She continued to
                     follow Southey’s career with some interest. In 1802 she wrote to the <em>Poetical Register</em>, lauding him as a ‘genuine Poet’, though cautioning the reader against adopting ‘his
                     capricious systems’. She read <em>Madoc</em> shortly after its 1805 publication and published a lengthy defence of it in the <em>Gentleman’s Magazine</em> in 1808. When Southey got wind (via a letter sent by Seward to Charles Lloyd) of her
                     high opinion, he wrote to her. This initiated a correspondence that lasted until Seward’s
                     death and that led to their one meeting in Lichfield in summer 1808. Late in life,
                     Southey provided a comic account of the ‘jubilant but appalling solemnity’ of this
                     encounter. However, his attitude to Seward was more ambivalent than this suggests.
                     He was keenly aware of – and attentive to – her place in literary history, noting
                     that she ‘was not so much over-rated at one time, as she has been since unduly depreciated’

                     to him. In a letter to James Montgomery, 6 May 1811, Southey recalled him as ‘an admirable
                     man in all things, whose only fault was that he was too humble ... In his company

                     Society of Lancashire and Cheshire. It is known that he owned some autograph letters
                     from famous people, including one by Horatio Nelson (1758–1805; <em>DNB</em>). On balance, he seems the most likely candidate to be Southey’s correspondent. In
                     1843 he built Greaves House (now the Greaves Park Hotel, Lancaster) shortly before
                     marrying Ann Atkinson (b. 1819) of Ellel Grange, Lancaster. In 1851 he was ordained
                     and became chaplain of St Thomas Church, Douglas, Isle of Man. Simpson retired from
                     this post in 1867 and later died in Chester, having sold Greaves House.</span></li>

                     He became a published poet and novelist while still at Eton and was expelled from
                     University College, Oxford, in March 1811 for writing <em>The Necessity of Atheism</em> (1811). In August 1811 he eloped with, and married, Harriet Westbrook (1795–1816),
                     causing a temporary breakdown in relations with his family. Shelley admired some of
                     Southey’s poetry, especially <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em> (1801) and <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (1810), and engaged in a number of intense conversations with the older man while
                     Shelley lodged in Keswick in 1811–1812. Southey saw Shelley as a ‘ghost’ of his own
                     past, who would grow out of his heterodox opinions. He directed Shelley to the work
                     of the philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1743; <em>DNB</em>), as an antidote to atheism, thus profoundly influencing Shelley’s intellectual development.
                     Shelley left suddenly for Ireland in February 1812 and the two men did not meet again.
                     However, this was not the end of their relationship. Southey took an increasingly
                     hostile view of Shelley’s politics and his abandonment of his first wife. Shelley
                     (erroneously) believed that Southey had attacked him in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> in 1820, leading to an acrimonious exchange of letters.</span></li>

                     as the ‘Macenas of his neighbourhood’ for his patronage of men of letters and his
                     philanthropy. He had a wide circle of friends in public life, including the economist
                     David Ricardo (1772–1823; <em>DNB</em>) and John Whishaw (c. 1764–1840), ‘the Pope of Holland House’. Smith was married

                     extensive library. He also sought out new items for Elizabeth Smith’s autograph collection.

                     money subsidized his lengthy political career – he was MP for Sudbury 1784–1790 and
                     1796–1802, Camelford 1791– 1796 and Norwich 1802–1806, 1807–1830. Smith was a long-standing
                     supporter of parliamentary reform, religious equality and the abolition of the slave
                     trade. He was also an early supporter of the French Revolution, an enthusiastic Whig
                     from the early 1790s and a convert to Unitarianism. These views condemned him to the
                     backbenches and he never held office. He was, though, a regular contributor to debates
                     on a wide range of subjects. Some MPs found his contributions rather too regular,
                     though, and his sententious style did not always command the House of Commons’ respect.
                     When he denounced Southey in a debate on the 14 March 1817 for changing his views
                     on political reform, Southey defended himself with <em>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M.P.</em> (1817) and Smith decided not to prolong the exchange. His voice continued to be heard

                     – publishing <em>English Lyrics</em> in 1807 – and took an interest in contemporary poets, including Henry Kirke White,
                     whom he knew during the latter’s time at university. Smyth’s verse epitaph to White,

                     were in financial trouble. Sotheby’s poetry had little success and he was best known
                     for his translation of <em>Oberon</em> (1798). Southey was first introduced to him in 1802, finding Sotheby ‘a man of taste
                     &amp; much original thought’, though he valued his criticism above his poetry. The two
                     men were on friendly terms and Sotheby even helped Southey with corrections to the

                     Thomas Sotheby (1759–1831) – another connection between the two men. Southey saw much
                     less of Sotheby after he settled in Keswick in 1803, but they continued to exchange
                     occasional letters and Sotheby sent Southey presentation copies of some of his works.</span></li>

                     in her experiences, her publication <em>The Strange Effects of Faith; with Remarkable Prophecies (Made in 1792)</em> (1801–2) brought her to the attention of followers of Richard Brothers, including
                     Southey’s acquaintance William Sharp. Transferring their allegiance to Southcott,
                     these Brotherites brought her to London, where they and a number of women converts
                     enabled Southcott to publish her prophecies of a coming millennium in England, in
                     numerous pamphlets – many of them bought and collated by Southey in the course of
                     his work on <em>Letters from England</em>, then the best-researched and most detailed account to have been published. Southcott
                     also embarked on a preaching tour and attracted many thousands of followers, whom
                     she confirmed as adherents by issuing with seals, bearing her symbol and signature
                     and the believer’s. Many of her followers were women, for Southcott empowered the
                     female, suggesting that she herself fulfilled the predictions in <em>Genesis</em> 3, that the woman’s seed shall bruise the serpent’s head, and <em>Revelation</em> 12, that the woman clothed in the sun will precipitate a millennium. Southey’s sceptical
                     distrust of Southcott and her movement came to a head in 1814, when she announced
                     that she, a virgin of sixty-four, was pregnant with Shiloh, the returning saviour.
                     She died, without issue, on 27 December, although William Sharp believed that her
                     body might only be in a trance and be resuscitated and the Shiloh discovered. She
                     left behind her a ‘great box’, made by Sharp, containing sealed prophecies, to be
                     opened by the bishops of the Church of England.</span></li>

                     raised the money to send him to Queen’s College, Oxford (1837–1841), but Cuthbert
                     did not display the precocious intellectual talent of his elder brother, Herbert.
                     Cuthbert entered the Church and pursued a solid, if unspectacular, career, including

                     1841) in 1871. Cuthbert was deeply opposed to Southey’s marriage to Caroline Bowles
                     and edited one of the rival posthumous versions of Southey’s letters, <em>Life and Correspondence </em> (1849–1850). Cuthbert was embarrassed by many of his father’s views, including his

                     a boarding house in Westgate Buildings. Her continued financial difficulties — possibly
                     exacerbated by the extravagance of her half-sister — caused Southey great anxiety.

                     He married Sarah Castle in 1810 and produced a large family. Tom’s lack of financial
                     stability meant that some of the burden of supporting him fell on his brothers Robert

                     of foreign climes, provided important information for many of Southey’s writings,
                     including his poetry and <em>The Life of Nelson</em> (1813). Tom’s only publication was <em>A Chronological History of the West Indies</em> (1827), written with his brother Robert’s encouragement.</span></li>

                     over the newspaper’s contents. Stuart employed Southey to write poems for the <em>Morning Post</em> at a guinea a week in 1798–1799, and again in 1801–1803. This ‘laureateship’ was crucial
                     to Southey’s finances. He invited Southey to contribute to the <em>Courier</em> in November 1807 and in that same month included excerpts from <em>Letters from England</em> in the paper (on 17th and 20th). Southey continued to order the <em>Courier</em> as his daily paper and occasionally published poems there, including a sonnet praising

                     his job with a literary career. His greatest success was the drama <em>Philip Van Artevelde</em> (1834), which contained a preface critiquing Byron and Shelley. Taylor and Southey
                     were on excellent terms, and the latter encouraged the former’s literary ambitions,
                     writing a favourable review of his <em>Isaac Comnenus</em> (1827). They toured Holland, France and Belgium in 1825 and 1826 and in the 1830s
                     Southey appointed Taylor as his literary executor and official biographer. The family

                     grammar schools, he moved to London in 1803, where he worked in the publishing and
                     bookselling trade. In 1806 he set up his own business with James Augustus Hessey (1785–1870).
                     The firm’s staple fare was sermons, moral tracts and homilies. They also published
                     contemporary poets, including John Clare (1793–1864: <em>DNB</em>) and John Keats (1795–1821; <em>DNB</em>), though Taylor’s extensive and frequently unauthorised copyediting was a subject
                     of controversy then and since. From 1821–1825 he was co-owner of the <em>London Magazine</em>, whose contributors included Thomas De Quincey, Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt.
                     His business partnership with Hessey ended in 1825, and in 1827 Taylor became bookseller
                     and publisher to the new University of London. He retired from business in 1853. Taylor

                     Taylor’s interest in German culture culminated in his <em>Historic Survey of German Poetry</em> (1828–1830). He was also a prolific contributor to the <em>Annual Review, The Athenaeum, Monthly Magazine</em>, and <em>Monthly Review</em>. Southey and Taylor met in 1798, whilst the former was on a visit to Great Yarmouth,
                     where his brother Henry Herbert Southey was being tutored by George Burnett. Taylor
                     introduced Southey to his great friend Frank Sayers (1763–1817; <em>DNB</em>) — whose 1792 collection <em>Poems</em> had influenced Southey’s early work — and also to radical and dissenting circles in
                     Norwich. Taylor gave Southey the idea for the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and was an acute, if frequently blunt, critic of his work. From 1803–1804, he edited
                     the Norwich newspaper <em>The Iris</em>, to which Southey contributed poetry. Southey described Taylor as ‘one of the three
                     great men of my acquaintance ... the more I know him and the longer I know him, the

                     over 1,000 new bridges and many harbour improvements. He also designed the Menai Suspension
                     Bridge (1819–1826). Southey inspected the Caledonian Canal and other Highland improvements
                     with Telford and Rickman in 1819 and greatly admired Telford’s work – he wrote three

                     and his wife Sarah. His parents separated when he was very young and a lengthy suit
                     in Chancery followed. He was educated at Wye College Grammar School, Kent, and then
                     at a school in Ashford. After that he held a variety of posts, including usher, private
                     tutor, clerk and assistant teacher. By the late 1810s he was determined on a literary
                     career and from January to June 1819 edited the <em>New Monthly Magazine</em>. He married Priscilla (Zillah) Maden Wiffen (1799–1873) in 1821. Her Quaker family
                     disowned her after the marriage. In the early 1820s he contributed to the <em>Literary Gazette</em> and the <em>Gentleman’s Magazine</em> and published <em>Poetical Sketches</em> (1822). He was editor of the <em>Leeds Intelligencer</em> (1822–1825) and the <em>Manchester Courier</em> (1825–6). A Tory, Watts claimed that between 1827–1847 he was involved in the setting
                     up of over twenty conservative periodicals. These included the London evening paper, <em>The Standard</em>, in 1827. Watts played a key role in the emergent market for annuals. He was the
                     editor, and latter proprietor, of the influential annuals the <em>Literary Souvenir</em> (1824–1835) and the <em>Cabinet of Modern Art</em> (1836–1837). He owned the <em>Literary Magnet</em> from 1825–1828 and published a collection of contemporary verse, <em>Fugitive Poetry</em> (1828–1829). In the 1840s he encountered serious financial difficulties and was made
                     bankrupt in 1849. His situation was eased by the award of a civil list pension of
                     £100 p.a. in 1854 for his services to literature and art. He edited the biographical
                     compendium <em>Men of the Time</em> in 1857 and spent his later years re-reading and annotating the poetry of Chaucer,
                     Spenser, Milton and Dryden. Watts and Southey had shared Tory sympathies and literary
                     interests. They corresponded intermittently from 1824. Southey also contributed to
                     the<em>Literary Souvenir</em> in 1826 and 1827.</span></li>

                     Army’s artillery and Southey had included Webb’s defence in a note at <em>History of the Peninsular War</em>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 554–555. The poor quality of the artillery horses
                     was one of the reasons given for British forces not advancing after their victory
                     in the Battle of Vimeiro (1808). In 1824 he solicited Southey’s advice on finding

                     Southey’s relationship with Wellington was deeply ambiguous. He passionately supported
                     Wellington’s aim of defeating the French invasion of Spain in 1808–1813, but was often
                     critical of Wellington’s tactics, especially his caution and unwillingness to rely
                     on Spanish help. In 1815 Southey was alarmed to find that an article he had written
                     for the <em>Quarterly Review</em> on Wellington’s role at Waterloo had been personally censored by the general to remove
                     unflattering references to his conduct of the battle. Southey’s <em>History of the Peninsula War</em> (1824–1832) retained a guarded attitude towards the Duke. In 1829, Southey was horrified
                     by the decision of Wellington’s government to support Catholic Emancipation.</span></li>

Wellesley’s governorship
                     was marked by a drive to acquire more territory in India. On his return, political
                     controversy soon erupted: James Paull (1770–1808; <em>DNB</em>), Indian trader (1790–1805), accused Wellesley of ruining his trade in Lucknow (Bengal)
                     and undermining the nawab of Oudh’s authority there during the years 1801–1802. This
                     challenge kept Wellesley out of political office until 1809. In that year Wellesley
                     was appointed Ambassador to Spain, and he arrived in Seville in August 1809 to negotiate
                     with the embattled Supreme Central Junta. Here, he found himself once again in the
                     same theatre of military and diplomatic activity as his brother Sir Arthur Wellesley
                     (Duke of Wellington), his main aim being to support his brother’s army in the Peninsula.
                     The Junta’s unwillingness to organise supplies for the British Army while urging a
                     policy of attack led Wellesley (and Southey) to suspect some of the Junta of co-operating
                     with the French. Southey was suspicious of Wellesley’s role in the Cabinet as Foreign
                     Secretary 1809–1812, because he knew Wellesley favoured Catholic Emancipation. Nevertheless,
                     he had some hopes that Wellesley’s appointment as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland 1821–1828
                     might lead to stern measures to suppress rural disorders.</span></li>

                     1760 and England in 1763, remaining there for the rest of his life. Although he worked
                     in a number of genres, West became best known, first, as a history painter and, later
                     in his career, as a painter of religious subjects. His works included, <em>Agrippina Landing at Brundisium with the Ashes of Germanicus</em> (1768) and <em>The Departure of Regulus from Rome</em> (1769), the latter commissioned by George III. His <em>The Death of General Wolfe </em>(1770) demonstrated that it was possible to apply the principles and style of history
                     painting to a near-contemporary event. Uncompleted works included a commission from
                     William Beckford (1760–1844; <em>DNB</em>) to supply a series of paintings drawn from <em>Revelation</em> for Fonthill Abbey. West played an important role in obtaining the monarch’s patronage
                     for a Royal Academy of Arts in 1768 and became its President in 1792. Royal favour
                     gained him decorative commissions for Windsor Castle and the appointments of historical
                     painter to the King (1772) and Surveyor of the King’s Pictures (1791). West rejected
                     a knighthood in the early 1790s, mistakenly believing that he would instead be offered
                     a hereditary title. He was not. Southey attended a dinner at the Royal Academy in
                     1817.</span></li>

                     him to Canton and Bombay. He arrived back in England in 1805 and was elected a Fellow

                     1808 and 1809. In 1811 he became a full member of the Society of Painters in Water
                     Colours, contributing to their exhibitions of 1811 and 1812. In 1814 Flinders’s <em>A Voyage to Terra Australis</em> contained 37 illustrations by Westall. He had a nervous breakdown in 1815. With the
                     help of Sir George Beaumont, he became a regular visitor to the Lakes, where he met
                     Southey and Wordsworth, who both admired his work. Westall and Southey corresponded
                     and the latter contributed an introduction to the former’s <em>Views of the Lake and Vale of Keswick</em> (1820). This described Westall as ‘by far the most faithful delineator of the scenery

                     help from evangelical Anglicans, who provided the means for him to study towards becoming
                     a student at Cambridge. In 1805 he took up a place there, but his fierce regime of
                     study exacerbated a delicate constitution, and he became ill and died. Southey then
                     edited his <em>Remains</em> (1807), having been supplied with papers by White’s brother Neville. These were well

                     was disappointed by his academic performance. White never married and became a clergyman.
                     Initially, he held difficult curacies in industrial parishes in West Bromwich and
                     then St George’s, Manchester (1826–42) – Southey helped him acquire the latter post.
                     However, he finally benefited from the connections his brother, Neville White, had
                     made in Norfolk, especially that with Benjamin Cubitt (1769–1852), a wealthy clergyman
                     and landowner. Cubitt was a relative of Neville White’s wife, Charlotte Sewell, and
                     married in 1827, as his second wife, Neville and James’s middle sister, Frances Moriah
                     White (1791–1854). To consolidate the Whites’ connections with the Cubitts even further,
                     in 1835 Catherine Bailey White (1794–1889), the youngest sister of Neville and James,
                     married Thomas Mack (1794–1858), Benjamin Cubitt’s nephew and another Norfolk clergyman
                     and landowner (Curate 1822–37, Vicar 1837–58 of Tunstead). Cubitt, as patron of the
                     living, appointed James White to be Vicar of Stalham in Norfolk (1843–52). Following
                     Cubitt’s death, White succeeded him as Rector of Sloley (1852–85), and was followed
                     by one of Neville White’s sons, Joseph Neville White (1825–1901) as Vicar of Stalham
                     (1852–1901). James White also inherited the estate at Sloley after the death of his
                     sister, Frances. White officiated at the marriage of Southey’s daughter, Edith May,

                     for his work on the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em> (1810–13) and the <em>History of Brazil</em> (1810–19). He then gave up his business, decided to become a clergyman, and in 1820
                     married Charlotte Sewell (1799–1873), the daughter of Joseph Sewell (1772–1844), a
                     wealthy Norwich solicitor. White obtained a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Cambridge

                     Hay (1730–1812). Her early writings included <em>Edwin and Eltruda</em> (1782), <em>Peru</em> (1784) and <em>Poems</em> (1786); the latter elicited a tribute from William Wordsworth, his first publication
                     (‘Sonnet on Seeing Miss Helen Maria Williams Weep at a Tale of Distress’). She moved
                     in the circles that included Anna Letitia Barbauld, William Godwin, Samuel Rogers
                     and Anna Seward, and was a committed abolitionist. From the early 1790s she lived
                     mainly in France, which she first visited in 1790, or, during periods when it was
                     unsafe for her to be there, in Switzerland. Her first hand account of the revolution
                     – <em>Letters from France</em> – appeared in 1790 and eventually extended through eight volumes and several, revised
                     editions. She translated writings by Bernadin de St Pierre (1737-1814) and Alexander
                     von Humboldt (1769-1859). Other works included an account of the Hundred Days of 1815.
                     After Napoleon’s fall from power, her home in Paris became a regular calling-in spot
                     for English tourists. Southey visited her during in May 1817 during his continental

                     North (1778–1821), in 1825 and retired to Hastings in later life. Southey wrote to
                     him in 1820 asking if he possessed a letter to John Wesley (1703–1791; <em>DNB</em>) from a female follower that might prove Wesley had made improper advances to this

                     replied that he only possessed a copy, not the original, of this letter. Southey therefore

                     a conversion experience he became a Baptist Minister in 1789 and the following year
                     moved to Plymouth to take charge of the congregation at How’s Lane Meeting House.
                     In 1793 he was sentenced to four years imprisonment for two radical sermons he preached
                     to his congregation. Winterbotham passed most of his incarceration in Newgate prison
                     and spent his time in writing – he published an account of his trial, sermons and
                     works of divinity and geography. On his release he returned to preach in Plymouth,
                     moving to Newmarket in 1808. Winterbotham’s and Southey’s lives intersected when Southey
                     visited Newgate in January 1795 to see the radical publisher James Ridgway, to whom
                     his brother-in-law, Robert Lovell, had delivered a copy of Southey’s play, <em>Wat Tyler</em>. Southey stated that Ridgway promised to publish the play, but he heard no more about
                     the matter. However, when <em>Wat Tyler</em> finally saw the light of day in 1817, Winterbotham swore to an entirely different
                     version of events in an affidavit. He claimed that Southey had visited Newgate on
                     a number of occasions in late 1795 or early 1796. Furthermore, Winterbotham asserted
                     that on one of these visits Southey was accompanied by the radical journalist Daniel
                     Isaac Eaton (c. 1753–1814; <em>DNB</em>) and that Southey gave Winterbotham the manuscript of, and copyright to, <em>Wat Tyler</em>, asking him to publish it as a pamphlet. Winterbotham claimed to have no knowledge
                     of how the play had come to be published in 1817 and to still possess the manuscript
                     of <em>Wat Tyler</em>. This dispute over the copyright of <em>Wat Tyler</em> meant Southey lost his application for an injunction to prevent its publication. Moreover,
                     it opened the floodgates to a series of cheap editions, none of which paid Southey
                     a penny. Ironically, the play became Southey’s bestselling work. Southey was convinced
                     that Winterbotham had perjured himself, though he admitted there might be a possibility
                     that Winterbotham had confused Southey with Lovell. The circumstances surrounding
                     the publication of <em>Wat Tyler</em> remain something of a mystery. Further confusion was added to the picture by the essayist
                     John Foster (1770–1843; <em>DNB</em>) who claimed in a letter to Joseph Cottle that two unknown people in Worcester had
                     copied the play from Winterbotham’s manuscript without his knowledge and provided
                     it to the publishers in 1817.</span></li>
