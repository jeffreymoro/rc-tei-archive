               <p>I suppose what is properly called the Morning service had been performed at an early
                  hour, for we had only the Communion Service. Rowland Hills pulpit is raised very high,
                  &amp; before it at about half the height is the readers desk on his right, &amp; the Clerks
                  on his left, the Clerk being a very grand personage, with a sonorous voice. The singing
                  was so general &amp; so good that I joined in it, &amp; doubtless made it better by the addition
                  of my voice. During the singing after Rowland had made his prayer before the sermon,
                  we, as respectable strangers were beckoned from our humble places by a gentleman in

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Rowland – a fine tall old man, with strong features, – very like his portrait, – began
                  by reading three verses for his text, stooping to the book in a very peculiar manner.
                  Having done this, he stood up erect &amp; said Why the text is a sermon! &amp; a very weighty
                  one too. I could not always follow his delivery, the loss of his teeth rendering his
                  words sometimes indistinct, &amp; the more so because his pronunciation is peculiar, generally
                  giving <span class="ital">e</span> the sound of <span class="ital">ai</span> like the French. His manner was animated &amp; striking, sometimes impressive &amp; dignified,
                  always remarkable: &amp; so powerful a voice I have rarely or never heard. Sometimes he
                  took off his spectacles, frequently stoopd down to read a text, &amp; on these occasions
                  he seemed to double his body, so high did he stand. He told one or two familiar stories,
                  &amp; used some odd expressions, such as “A murrain on those who preach the doctrine that
                  when we are sanctified we do not grow in grace!”

                           love.</span></div>

                  &amp; the Calvinism which it expressed was so qualified as to be harmless. The manner
