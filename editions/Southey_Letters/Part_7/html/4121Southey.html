               St Lawrence, Exeter, and St John, Broadclyst. The patron of the latter church was
               Sir Thomas Acland, who was also a friend of Marriott. Southey had stayed with Marriott
               on 6 January 1824 on his visit to the West Country. While he was on this trip, Southey
               received the poem ‘The Poetic Epistle to Southey from his Cats’, which he liked and
               kept; it was later printed in <em>The Doctor</em>, 7 vols (London, 1834–1847), VII, pp. 580–582.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
