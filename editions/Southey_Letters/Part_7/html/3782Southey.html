                           Byron believed him to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged
                           in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</span></div>

                  to be none. I respect it too much to reason against it. I was aware that it would
                  exist in some instances, tho I believed not in many, &amp; I very well knew that it would
                  be feigned in some cases where it was not felt. The trials which I made of the poem
                  in private all served to shew that others considered it as I did, objectionable on
                  no other account than that of relating to too recent an event.

               on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland
               in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed him to
               have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League of
               Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in this letter. He was, however, quite wrong. The custom in early modern Scotland
