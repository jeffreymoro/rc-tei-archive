            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Yesterday evening I had the great pleasure, for such it truly was, of receiving your
                  picture.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Beaumont had given Southey a painting he had made of the view from Greta Hall.</span></div>
                  </div> It is a beautiful example of the manner in which, according to your principle, real
                  subjects should be treated. You have dealt with this landscape as a poet does with
                  an historical tale: modifying it to his purpose, and supplying whatever it wanted
                  to make it suitable for his art. I thank you most sincerely for it; and this I can
                  venture to say, that you have never painted a picture which will be regarded with
                  more delight, nor prized more highly by its possessor.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You give us hopes of seeing you in the autumn. By that time I trust I shall be in
                  a condition to accompany you in some of your excursions. My usual visitant at this
                  season has seized me somewhat more violently than usual, and effected a lodgment in
                  the chest, where it keeps its ground more obstinately than in any former attack. The
                  inconvenience is more in the debility which it induces, by making me keep house when
                  the catarrh is in full force, than in the complaint itself. Next year I will, if it
                  be possible to get from home, try to fly from it; and as I know by an experience of
                  more than twenty years that the only chance of escaping it is by travelling at the
                  season when it would otherwise certainly come on, I will endeavour to set off at the
                  end of April, and spend six or eight weeks on the Continent, probably in Holland and
                  the north of Germany.

                  </div> happened to be in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, and examined it in time. Where he probed it a thin layer of mud lies upon a bed
                  of peat which is six feet thick, and this rests upon a stratum of fine white clay,
                  the same I believe which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</a> found in Borrowdale when building her unlucky house.

                           to retrench.</span></div>
                  </div> Where the gas is generated remains yet to be discovered, but when the peat is filled
                  with this gas, it separates from the clay, and becomes buoyant. There must have been
                  a considerable convulsion when this took place, for a rent was made in the bottom
                  of the lake several feet in depth, and not less than fifty yards long, on each side
                  of which the bottom rose and floated. It was a pretty sight to see the small fry exploring
                  this new-made strait and darting at the bubbles which rose as the Professor was probing
                  the bank. The discharge of air was considerable here when a pole was thrust down.
                  But at some distance, where the rent did not extend, the bottom had been heaved up
                  in a slight convexity, sloping equally in an inclined plane all round; and there,
                  when the pole was introduced, a rush like a jet followed as it was withdrawn. The
                  thing is the more curious, because as yet no example of it is known to have been observed
                  in any other place.</p>
