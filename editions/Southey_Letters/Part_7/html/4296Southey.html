                  connected with any literary object (for example, to procure those Catalan books –

                           10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s Account of the War in Catalonia,
                           published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the
                           Catalan War (1816); and Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles
                           4 &amp; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte (1816). However, none of these works seem to
                           exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John
                           …</span></div>
                  </div> – because it was paying him a compliment to presume upon his willingness in such a
                  case to grant one. But I am shy of obtruding myself upon a person so high in office;
                  &amp; especially unwilling to arrogate to myself any importance for the part which I may
                  have borne in the QR.</p>

               <p>There is also another motive which would withhold me from addressing him upon this
                  topic. The time cannot be far distant when the Q. R. must take its part upon a most

                  </div> I have always considered it as one of the greatest errors in the management of the
                  Review that it should have been silent upon that subject so long. Something of what
                  is going on, I know; (even at this distance from the sphere of public affairs) more
                  than is publicly known; &amp; the crisis is likely to be accelerated by the rebellion
                  which may at any hour break out in Ireland, – where it cannot be doubted that the
                  intention of a desperate party is to bring on a religious war. Let us take our stand
                  upon the rock of high constitutional principles, &amp; we shall have with us the integrity
                  &amp; the talents &amp; the heart of the country. – But with this hope, &amp; knowing what I know,
                  it would be unfitting in me to do any thing which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">M<sup>r</sup>. C.</a> might suppose that the Q.R. would follow wherever he may lead. – There are other members
                  of the Government to whom I can make such a communication without scruple, &amp; for whose
