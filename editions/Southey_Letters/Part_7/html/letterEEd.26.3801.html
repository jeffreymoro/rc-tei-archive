                           tale in which a boy who grows up alone on a desert island attains great wisdom purely
                           from studying nature, and deduces his own system of beliefs, including monotheism

                           as proof that a person could attain ‘a profound knowledge of God’ by ‘a conjunction

                  of this temper would make converts in Persia, &amp; in Hindostan, – wherever mysticism
                  &amp; naturalism are to be found. Barclay seems to me to have saved the Quakers, – before
                  this time they hardly knew what they believed; &amp; as upon principle they spoke &amp; wrote
                  without thinking, they often in pure absence of thought uttered expressions from which
                  the worst consequences deduced by their adversaries were fairly inferred, – fairly
                  as respected the words, but wrongfully as respected men in their state of mind.</p>
