            <p class="indent1">There is one omission in your letter, which I interpret in good part: you say nothing
               of your own health; but as you are well enough to go thro a regular course of Brighton
               stage-coaching, I conclude therefrom that it is thoroughly reestablished, &amp; that neither
               the disease nor the remedies have left any weakness behind them.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My annual cold has, I hope, now run its course &amp; taken its departure. I shall not
               recover from its effects so soon as if I had a guest with me to lead me over the mountains;
               however I take all opportunities that occur &amp; use more solitary exercise than is agreable.

               that there is no place except her own home where she could possibly feel so much at
               home as there. But still she feels that she never is or can be so happy any where
               else as here. However she has made up her mind to pay her visits in the South when

                  </div> she told him that he was then in North Wales, &amp; that he talked of coming to this place:
                  – an intention which I find he has communicated to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</a> by letter a few days ago. – This as you will at once perceive places me in a difficult
                  situation. I think if your opinion upon this point had undergone any change you would
                  have informed me of it; – &amp; unless I were assured that this attachment on his part <span class="strikethrough">were</span> had now received your approbation; I should feel myself acting very culpably in entertaining
                  him here; &amp; affording him those opportunities which can only be had by being under
                  the same roof with her. Yet on the other hand it will be very unpleasant, – not to
                  say painful, – to receive him coldly &amp; repulsively. That he has continued to write
                  to her is now evident. What encouragement he has received I know not. – Tell me how
                  I am to act, – if there should not be time for you to prevent the visit – I did not
                  expect this perseverance on his part: – &amp; had his attentions been discontinued I am
                  quite certain that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</a> would <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;long ago&gt; have felt herself disengaged. An expectant attachment of this nature may
                  often I believe be highly useful to the man, as giving him the surest of all preventatives
                  against the greatest danger which lies in the way of youth. But it is not so on the
                  womans part.</p>
