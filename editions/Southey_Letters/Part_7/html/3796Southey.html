            <p class="indent1">I will begin by answering the medical part of your letter first. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</a> never complains of headache, nor of any pain in her eyes, – but there is a dizziness
               of sight when the drooping of the lids comes on, – then only. She has no ailment of
               the stomach, her tongue is clear, &amp; her general health has always been good. Indeed
               we have looked upon her as the healthiest of our children, tho the least in growth.
               Upon enquiry from her I find that there is a tendency to constipation, – but the appearance
               of the stool is natural. She has always been remarkably subject to chilblains.</p>

                           central figure in the evangelical revival of the eighteenth century.</span></div>
                  </div> is very characteristic. Is it not strange that not a trace of this talent which he
                  possessed in so eminent a degree should appear in any of his printed works, neither
                  in his letters, nor in the sermons which he published himself, nor in those which
                  were published by his friends?

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey had researched Whitefield’s writings extensively for his The Life of Wesley:
                           and the Rise and Progress of Methodism (1820). He possessed both An Authentic Memoir
                           of the Life of the Late Rev. G. Whitefield (1803), no. 298 in the sale catalogue of
                           his library, and A Select Collection of Letters of the Late Reverend George Whitefield
                           (1772), no. 3010 in the sale catalogue of his library. Many of Whitefield’s sermons
                           were published during his lifetime and the final two volumes of The Works of the Reverend
                           George Whitefield, M.A, 6 vols (1772), were devoted to his sermons.</span></div>
                  </div> In these latter one should think that the fine parts of his discourse would have been
                  surely taken down in short hand, or retained in memory, than the common place matter
                  which any evangelical preacher could utter at any length.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I heard with sorrow of your ill health. It is well that your practice can afford so
               large a loss. Perhaps you are at this time a happier man than if you were in the enjoyment
               of vigorous health, &amp; had never known sickness or sorrow. Any price is cheap for religious
               hope. The evidence for Christianity is as demonstrative as the subject admits: the
               more it is investigated, the stronger it appears. But the root of belief is in the
               heart, rather than in the understanding, &amp; when it is rooted there it derives from
               the understanding nutriment &amp; support. Against atheism, materialism &amp; the mortality
               of the soul, there is the reductio ad absurdum in full force: &amp; for revealed religion
               there is the historical evidence, strong beyond the conception of those who have not
               examined it, – &amp; there is that perfect adaptation to the nature &amp; wants of man, which
               if such a revelation had not already been made would induce a wise &amp; pious man to
               expect it, as fully as a Jew expects the Messiah. For many years my belief has not
               been clouded with the shadow of a doubt.</p>
            <p class="indent1">When we observe what things men will believe, who will not believe Christianity it
               is impossible not to acknowledge <span class="strikethrough">the x</span> how much belief depends upon the will.</p>
