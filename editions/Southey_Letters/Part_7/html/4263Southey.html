               <p>First, let me thank you for offering to join me in an expedition to Holland, when
                  I may find it possible to undertake one.

                  </div> Most truly shall I rejoice to have such a companion. I am, however, under something
                  like a promise of going to Ireland, when I take flight next May, in the hope of escaping
                  from my annual visitation,

                  At that time I was not sufficiently recovered to have ventured from home, even if
                  it had suited me on other accounts to have absented myself from my desk. I am now,
                  thank God, once more in good health, and take a good deal of pains in the way of exercise
                  to keep myself so. The want of a companion in these walks is supplied by a book, so
                  that the time is not wholly lost; this habit is with me full five–and–twenty years
                  old, and I can read as well when walking as at the fire–side.</p>

                           of 1824 established the event on a triennial basis. It consisted of six performances
                           in St Andrew’s Hall. The newspaper that Neville White sent Southey is difficult to
                           identify with certainty. It might have been the Norwich Mercury, 9 October 1824, which
                           contained articles and correspondence about the poor lighting and smell of gas in
                           St Andrew’s Hall.</span></div>

                  is so entirely unexceptionable, even if the charitable application of the money were
                  not considered; and this is a very disinterested opinion, from one who has no faculty,

                           of Sir Thomas Browne, Knt. M. D. of Norwich’ was advertised as forthcoming with Longmans,
                           for example, in the London Courier and Evening Gazette, 2 October 1824. This was an

                  </div> he thanked me for it, and in a sensible reply observed upon the difficulty of doing
                  anything in the way of a formal negotiation. Meantime individual discretion might
                  do something, and he thought the Methodists might very usefully be encouraged in the
                  colonies, and perhaps in Ireland also. I had a second communication from Mark Robinson,
                  who is a local preacher at Beverley. You will, of course, understand that he knows
                  nothing of my laying the business before <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HowleyWilliam">the Bishop</a>. The second letter related to the probability of the church Methodists separating

                  that Methodism has in this country reached the point in which the main body will not
                  be progressive in numbers, rather maintaining its population than increasing it, and
                  losing as many by defection and schism as it acquires by proselytism and birth. But
                  this rather alters the nature of the danger to the Establishment than diminishes it;
                  for every new sect that branches off has a fresh principle of increase. I asked Mark
                  Robinson to direct me to information concerning some of these sects, – the Ranters,
