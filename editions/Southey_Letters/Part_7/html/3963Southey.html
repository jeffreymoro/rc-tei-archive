               him habitually neglect the fulfillment of every engagement which he undertook, &amp; of
               every duty which he was bound to perform. She importuned him to make those exertions

               person who will house him, &amp; collecting auditors about him. On her part, it would
               be an entire sacrifice of what comforts are left her; – his habits (which would be
               uncontrolled of course, if he had an establishment of his own) are destructive of
               all comfort &amp; domestic order. She has anxieties enough now for her sons, – but then
               she would have a perpetual anxiety concerning her own means of subsistence.

               Test Act (1673), which stipulated that only members of the Church of England could
               hold public office. This would allow Nonconformists to gain control of many Corporations,
               or local borough councils, and lead to calls to remove property from the Church of
               England, including its rights to taxes such as tithes.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note26_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
