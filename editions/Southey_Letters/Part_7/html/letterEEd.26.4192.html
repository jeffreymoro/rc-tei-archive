                           Southey did not edit his works; however ‘The Whole Works and Correspondence of Sir

                           of Simon Wilkin’s edition, which did not appear until 1835–1836. Southey acquired

                  I should be very far from allowing this concerning a new work. As to terms, I had

                  </div> which was what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> offered, being the sum they were to have given a certain person who was originally
                  announced as editor, but left the book and the booksellers in the lurch, for the sake
                  of decamping with another man’s wife.
