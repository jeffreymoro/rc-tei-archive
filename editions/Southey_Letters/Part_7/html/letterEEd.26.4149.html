               <p>I have this day heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Tilbrook">M<sup>r</sup> Tillbrook</a>. His advice is that your son should not commence his residence at Cambridge before
                  Oct. 1825.

                           College, Cambridge, in 1825 as a sizar (i.e. a student receiving some form of financial
                           assistance) and obtained his BA in 1829. He became a clergyman and was Perpetual Curate
                           of New Mill, Huddersfield 1841–1843, and Lothersdale, near Skipton 1844–1848, later
                           going to St Kitts in the West Indies and serving as Rector of Christ Church, Nichola
                           Town, and St Mary’s, Cayou.</span></div>
                  </div> The intermediate time may bring him greatly forward, under proper tuition, &amp; he then
                  promises him “fair play, &amp; kind treatment, – with the hope also of the best piece
                  of patronage he can bestow upon an under-graduate, – that of Chapel Clerk, – provided
                  he is qualified for it. For this office it is an indispensable qualification that
                  he should profess the orthodox principles of the Church of England. – There is nothing
                  of which I am more clearly, fully &amp; conscientiously convinced than that those principles
                  are the genuine truths of the Gospel, &amp; that Unitarianism has not even the shadow
                  of evidence for its support. It is in fact but the shadow of Christianity.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The Chapel Clerk has nothing to pay for rooms, or for dinner in the Hall: this is
               fairly worth 20£ per annum Other little allowances which are given him amount to about
               30£ more per annum. And should he obtain an additional scholarship that may be 8 or
               10£ more.</p>
            <p class="indent1">At the outset the expence of furnishing his rooms is estimated at 25£. Should he get
               him the Clerkship, (which is highly probable, &amp; depends very much &lt;<span class="ital">almost wholly</span>&gt; upon himself) he will come into its receits at the Xmas following his entrance;
               &amp; after that time <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Tilbrook">M<sup>r</sup> Tillbrook</a> says 20£ a year will more than pay his College Tutors bill, after the deductions
               due to him have been made. If he can command from 100 to 150£, <span class="strikethrough">that sum will</span> the whole of his collegiate expences during his undergraduateship will be provided
               for.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This is a very desirable prospect. – <span class="strikethrough">Xxx</span> Nothing in the University can be gained without desert, &amp; every thing by it. Give
