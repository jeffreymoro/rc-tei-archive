                           occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming
                           Henry): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their
                           departure, fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded,
                           and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (Glasgow Herald, 12 August 1822).
                           The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part
                           of the annual Keswick Regatta.</span></div>

                  the trifling one of protecting the part. Regarding the case <span class="strikethrough">it</span> in all its circumstances, it may truly be deemed a merciful preservation. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Peachy</a> may now be quite at ease, – &amp; ease of mind I hope will soon remove any ill effects

                  was a great gulph between us, which allowed of little communication between the Isle

                  that time, I should certainly have regretted that you went away just as the bad weather
