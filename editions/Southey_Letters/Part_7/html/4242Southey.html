               with little inconvenience, &amp; sometimes without any. This I shall endeavor to keep
               up thro the winter, &amp; when the spring advances, if it be possible for me to leave
               home, I will take a journey, as the only chance of avoiding a yearly attack that becomes
               every year more serious. Most probably it will be to visit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JebbJohn">the Bp of Limerick</a> who would fain have taken me with him to Ireland about ten days ago.</p>

                  </div> I have had no intimation why it has been delayed, – certainly not as being too late
                  for insertion, for I corrected the proofs more than two months ago. I am even half
                  inclined to suspect an intention of rejecting it, because without eulogizing Hayley
                  in the slightest degree beyond his deserts, it touches lightly on his faults, &amp; treats
                  him as a scholar &amp; a gentleman ought to be treated. This remains to be seen, – meantime
