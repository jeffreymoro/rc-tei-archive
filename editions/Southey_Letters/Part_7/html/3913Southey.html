               <p>Who should succeed <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord Liverpool</a>, if he were about to retire, would be to me a matter of less interest than who shall
                  succeed poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> as the Editor of the Q. R. in case of his death, or of his inability to continue in
                  that office. The latter probability he mentioned to me some weeks ago, &amp; likewise
                  how totally at a loss he was where to look for one who might supply his place. I mentioned <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</a> to him, – &amp; have mentioned him to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> also.

                  </div> – I have some reason to think that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> inclines to my opinion, for he has had a conversation with him upon the difficulties
                  of an Editors task &amp;c, &amp; tho he said nothing which in any way committed himself, yet
                  he would not have entered <span class="ital">upon</span> that subject, &amp; <span class="ital">into it</span> as he did, <span class="strikethrough">unless he</span> if my suggestion had been totally dismissed. One thing which he said was that his
                  successor must be a man in whom the Government could feel confidence, because of the
                  assistance which they afforded in the way of documents from the public offices. And
                  this leads me to mention the subject to you.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There is no question about his abilities, acquirements habits &amp; principles. But he
                  possesses in an eminent degree discretion, a sound judgement, &amp; a right feeling. I
                  am sure he would never admit any thing which should lower the review, – nothing of
                  that mere insolence which has so often disgraced it, &amp; brought it down to the level
                  of the Edinburgh.

               <p>The choice is a matter of more consequence than <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> is aware of. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> is very much disliked by the <span class="ital">trade</span>.

                  starting a New Quarterly upon the same principles, has been thought of.

                  </div> I do not wish to see this <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> because it would weaken the effect which the Q. now produces, &amp; it is better to have
                  one efficient journal of this kind, than to divide its power. But if it were made
                  unexceptionable in its tone &amp; temper &amp; consistent in its views, I am sure its influence
