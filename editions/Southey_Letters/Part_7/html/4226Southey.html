            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter is not of a kind to remain unacknowledged, and my time is often less worthily
               employed than it will be in making a few remarks upon some parts of it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You tell me of the prevalence of Atheism and Deism among those persons with whose
               opinions you are acquainted. Are those persons, think you, fair representatives of
               the higher orders, whom you suppose to be inflicted with such opinions in the same
               proportion? Or are they not mostly young men, smatterers in literature, or literati
               by profession?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Where the principles of reasonable religion have not been well inculcated in childhood,
                  and enforced by example at home, I believe that infidelity is generally and perhaps
                  necessarily one step in the progress of an active mind. Very many undoubtedly stop
                  there; but they whose hearts escape the corruption which, most certainly, irreligion
                  has a direct tendency to produce, are led into the right path, sooner or later, by
                  reflection, inquiry, and the instinct of an immortal spirit, which can find no other
                  resting place in its weal, no other consolations in its afflictions. This has been
                  the case in the circle of my experience, which has not been a contracted one. I have
                  mixed with men of all descriptions – Atheists, Roman Catholics, and Dissenters of
                  every kind, from the Unitarians, whose faith stands below zero, to the disciples of
                  Richard Brothers
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Richard Brothers (1757–1824; DNB), who declared himself to be Prince of the Hebrews
                           and Nephew of the Almighty, with a mission to lead the British people to Palestine,
                           where he would rule over them until the Second Coming. He was incarcerated in a private
                           asylum 1795–1806.</span></div>
                  </div> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna Southcote</a>, whose trash would raise the thermometer to the point of fever heat. I have seen
                  them pass from one extreme to another; and had occasion to observe how nearly those
                  extremes meet. And now when I call to mind those persons who were unbelievers some
                  thirty years ago, I find that of the survivors the greater and all the better part
                  are settled in conformity with the belief of the national church, and this conformity
                  in those with whom I am in habits of peculiar and unreserved friendship I know to
                  be sincere. A very few remain sceptical and are unhappy; and these, with the best
                  feelings and kindest intentions, have fallen into degrading and fatal habits, which
                  gather strength as they grow older and older, and find themselves more and more unable
                  to endure the prospect of a blank futurity. Some others, who were profligates at the
                  beginning, continue to be so.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>According to my estimate of public opinion, there is much more infidelity in the lower
                  ranks than there ever was before, and less in the higher classes than at any time
                  since the Restoration.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> The indifferentists – those who used to conform without a thought or feeling upon
                  the subject – are the persons who have diminished in numbers. Considering the connection
                  of infidelity with disaffection in all its grades, and the alliance for political
                  purposes between Catholics, Dissenters, and Unbelievers, I think with you that a tremendous
                  convulsion is very likely to be brought about; but I am not without hope that it may
                  be averted; and even should it take place, I have no fear for the result, fatal as
                  it must needs be to the generations who should witness the shock.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The progress of my own religious opinions has been slow, but steady. You may probably
               live to read it; and what is of more consequence – may, without reading it, follow
               unconsciously the same course, and by God’s blessing rest at last in the same full
               and entire belief.</p>
