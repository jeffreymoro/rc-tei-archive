               <p>You see I judged rightly concerning the encouragement which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilkinSimon">M<sup>r</sup> Wilkin</a>, was likely to find from the London Book-sellers.

                           the Norwich resident, doctor and writer on a huge range of subjects. ‘The Whole Works
                           and Correspondence of Sir Thomas Browne, Knt. M. D. of Norwich’ was soon advertised
                           as forthcoming with Longmans, for example in the London Courier and Evening Gazette,
                           2 October 1824. This was an early indication of Simon Wilkin’s edition, which did
                           not appear until 1835–1836. Southey did not edit or review this work, though he obtained
                           a copy, no. 376 in the sale catalogue of his library.</span></div>
                  </div> This is a subject on which they are necessarily the best judges. A second edition
                  is not to be hoped for in a case like this, nor do I think there is any reasonable
                  expectation, that so large an edition as 1000 will sell. I advise him not to print
                  more than 750, &amp; tell him further, that highly desirable as such a collection is of
                  this authors works, it would be prudent not to venture more than 500 –</p>

               <p>The best service I can render him will be to review the book which of course is incompatible
                  with editing it. Edite it I ought not to do unless I could allow to it the time &amp;
                  care necessary for doing it in a manner creditable to myself. This I cannot give,
                  &amp; the speculative cannot afford to purchase – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilkinSimon">M<sup>r</sup> Wilkins</a> had better take Johnsons Life, to which Kippis’s Account (if it contain much additional
