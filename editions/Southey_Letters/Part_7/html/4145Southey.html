               reason for every omission was such that I am persuaded you would without hesitation
               have assented to it, had you been upon the spot. A most powerful &amp; original book it
               is, – in any one page of which, – almost in any single sentence – I should have discovered
               the author, if it had come into my hands as an anonymous publication. Notice it must

                  been so altered as to have almost the appearance of a new city. Nothing that I have
                  seen elsewhere can bear comparison with the line of houses from the Regents Park to

                  was to render the quire unendurably cold; for the whole body of cold air from the
                  dome came rushing down, – so that the attempt has been given up as hopeless.
