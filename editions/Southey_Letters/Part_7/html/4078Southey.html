               <p>The Portugueze Cortes met in one chamber, the Nobles the higher Clergy secular &amp; regular,
                  the Judges, <span class="strikethrough">the</span> certain Ministers, the Governors of the Cities &amp; Towns, &amp; such fidalgos as had full
                  power in their own domains, had seats there. the Commons consisted of two <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> deputies from every corporate town, &amp; were <span class="strikethrough">about</span> something fewer than 200. How they were originally chosen I do not know, whether by
                  the municipal authorities, or nominated by the immediate Lord, as they were latterly
                  by the Government: but certainly there was nothing like a popular election. The principle
                  of the Portugueze Constitution is the very reverse of ours: the power of making laws
                  &amp; imposing taxes is vested in the King, but the consent of the Cortes is required.
                  The King is to advise with his Councillors, &amp; the Cortes to give a popular &amp; legal
                  sanction to the measures of Government. They have been disused since the reign of
                  Pedro 2.

                  evil in that kingdom. If this were remedied &amp; the laws regularly enforced Portugal
                  would have nothing to apprehend from the revolutionary Junta. It was not against the
