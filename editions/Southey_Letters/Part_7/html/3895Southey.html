               with pleasure, that I inscribe to your Majesty a History of the most glorious war
               recorded in the British annals./ When the Regency devolved into your hands, the fortunes
               of our allies were at their lowest ebb, and neither arts nor efforts were spared for
               making the spirit of this country sink with them. At that momentous crisis every thing
               depended, under Providence, upon your single determination; and to that determination
               Great Britain is beholden for its triumph, and Europe for its deliverance./ To your
               Majesty, therefore, this faithful History is offered, as a portion of the tribute
               due to a just, magnanimous, and splendid reign, and as a proof of individual respect
               and gratitude from/Your Majesty’s/Most dutiful subject and servant,/ ROBERT SOUTHEY.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
