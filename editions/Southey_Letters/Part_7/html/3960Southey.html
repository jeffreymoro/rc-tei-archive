               de Olivarez’, <em>New Monthly Magazine</em>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <em>Account of the War in Catalonia</em> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <em>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</em> (1816); and <em>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of
                  Joseph Bonaparte</em> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray
               to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

               in Upper Canada. Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784–1841; <em>DNB</em>), Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1821–1828 was eager to extend
               this idea and produced ‘An Outline of a Plan of Emigration to Upper Canada’ in January
               1823. He proposed that parishes all over the United Kingdom should be able to mortgage
               their poor rates in order to repay loans from the government, which would finance
               sending the parishes’ paupers to Canada. Each family would receive 100 acres of land.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
