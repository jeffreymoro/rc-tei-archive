                  </div> – It has often appeared wonderful to me that any mind or body can endure the perpetual
                  wear &amp; tear of ministerial business in England. That business would be sufficient
                  for any human capacity, even without the House of Commons: &amp; I am less surprized at
                  an instance like his, of over-excitement, than that instances of insanity so produced,
                  are not more frequent, – especially in minds which have little or no religious principle

               the last month I have taken a great deal of exercise, to the material improvement
