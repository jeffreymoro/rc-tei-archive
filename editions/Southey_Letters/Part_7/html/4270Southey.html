                  loop–hole. The fellows who pirate that work would rob you in the streets, or break
                  open your house, if they dared do it; they have no sense of honour, or of right and
                  wrong to restrain them.

               requires deep attention; it is something that amuses the intellect rather than exerts
               it, and keeps it, perhaps, in a more quiescent state than it might be if left to its
               own operations. The book is as a companion with whom I can converse when I like; and
               as it is always some volume which is never taken up at any other time, there is the
               wholesome recreation which change produces. Were you in the house with me for a month,
