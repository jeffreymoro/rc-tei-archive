                  former, as the name implies, was of the worthier gender: it is as decidedly so in
                  Cats, as in grammar and in law.

                  the Rats was deservedly raised in succession to the rank of Baron, Viscount and Earl.
                  He lived to a good old age; and then being quite helpless and miserable was in mercy
                  thrown into the river. I had more than once interfered to save him from this fate;
                  but it became at length plainly an act of compassion to consent to it. And here let
                  me observe that in a world wherein death is necessary, the law of nature by which
                  one creature preys upon another is a law of mercy, not only because death is thus
                  made instrumental to life, and more life exists in consequence, but also because it
                  is better for the creatures themselves to be cut off suddenly, than to perish by disease
                  or hunger, – for these are the only alternatives.</p>

                  could have been; but their fur was fine, the colour a rich carrot, and the striping
                  like that of the finest tyger or tabby kind. I named one of them William Rufus; the

               Fidelia was a tortoise-shell cat. She was filiated upon Lord Nelson, others of the
               same litter having borne the unequivocal stamp of his likeness. It was in her good
               qualities that she resembled him, for in truth her name rightly bespoke her nature.
               She approached as nearly as possible in disposition, to the ideal of a perfect cat:
               – he who supposes that animals have not their difference of disposition as well as
               men, knows very little of animal nature. Having survived her daughter Madame Catalani,

               <p>Bona Fidelia left a daughter and a grand-daughter; the former I called Madame Bianchi

                  she had been bred up in all respects like her gentle mother, in the same place, and
                  with the same persons. The nonsense of that arch-philosophist Helvetius would be sufficiently
                  confuted by this single example, if such rank folly contradicted as it is by the experience
                  of every family, needed confutation.

                  once since my return for so long a time that he was actually believed to be dead and
                  veritably lamented as such. The wonder was whither did he retire at such times – and

                  suspicion, and he would have been in danger of passing for a Witch in disguise, or
                  a familiar. The mystery however was solved about four week’s ago, when as we were

                  The conqueror was perhaps in part indebted for this superiority to his hardier habits
                  of life, living always in the open air, and providing for himself; while Rumpel (who

                  undoubtedly the seat of honour. His eyes which are soft and expressive are of a hue
                  between chrysolite and emerald. Hurlyburlybuss’s are between chrysolite and topaz.

                  meantime a confidence which made him keep the field. Dreadful were the combats which
                  ensued as their ears, faces and legs bore witness. Rumpel had a wound which went through
                  one of his feet. The result has been so far in his favour that he no longer seeks
                  to avoid his enemy, and we are often compelled to interfere and separate them. Oh
