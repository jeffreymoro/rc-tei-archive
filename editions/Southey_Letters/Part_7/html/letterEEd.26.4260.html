                  he live to enter it,) his fathers head will in all likelihood be laid low. But he
                  is a sweet, docile, hopeful creature, – so exactly at this time the living image of
                  what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">his dear brother</a> was when you were at Keswick in 1813, – that I regard him at times almost with as

               <p>You mention <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>. I left him in February last with the mournful impression that I had seen him for
                  the last time. He will, I suspect, hold the reins of the Quarterly, till they drop
                  from his hands. As long ago as when he first communicated to me his inability to continue
                  the management, &amp; his difficulty in finding a successor, I named both to him &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> a person whom they both knew, &amp; who had every qualification for the office, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</a> – a nephew of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">S.T.C’s</a>. Were they to search these kingdoms they could not find a man better qualified; he
                  is an excellent scholar, thoroughly bred at Eton &amp; at Oxford; – his talents they have
                  tried &amp; known; – a man of sound judgement, great discretion, excellent opinions, &amp;
                  high principle, – &amp; what is of some importance, a lawyer by profession. The matter
                  has been repeatedly all but settled with him, &amp; yet it is not settled, nor likely
                  to be so. The reasons I take to be these; – a natural unwillingness in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> formally to resign even in part a management which he can no longer direct; – a notion
                  as natural in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> that he may get the business done at a cheaper rate, &amp; be in great measure his own
                  manager: – an apprehension on the part of both that the Journal in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridges</a> hands would take its bias in some degree from me, – for I am considered by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> as too bigoted, &amp; by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> as too liberal; the certainty, alike unwelcome to both, that no articles would be
                  admitted which could have no other effect than to wound the feelings &amp; injure the
                  fortunes of an obnoxious author: – that there would be none of that injustice &amp; cruelty
                  &lt;(for example)&gt; which was shown towards Keats,
