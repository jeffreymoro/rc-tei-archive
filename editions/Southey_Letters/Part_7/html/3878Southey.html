         <div class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">6.. </span><span class="noteBody">Herbert Hill’s eldest son, Edward Hill, was about to attempt to become a King’s Scholar
               at Westminster School, which would allow him to proceed to a Closed Scholarship at
               either Christ Church, Oxford, or Trinity College, Cambridge. Wordsworth as Master
               of Trinity College may have given partial advice that Cambridge was a better option
               for a young man seeking a life at university; there was no certainty that a King’s
               Scholar would receive a Fellowship once he graduated. But at Christ Church, a King’s
               Scholar immediately became one of the body of Students, with a modest stipend that
               was guaranteed for life, if the recipient wished and he obeyed the rules of the College.
               If the Students took university degrees in a timely fashion then their stipend would
               increase. However, the rules governing Studentships were strict and anyone who married,
               did not take Holy Orders or accepted a paid occupation had to resign. Edward Hill
               chose Christ Church, Oxford.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
