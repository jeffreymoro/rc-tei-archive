               <p>I have heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> upon the subject on which our good friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> communicated with you.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           1824–1825.</span></div>
                  </div> He says <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</a> is the only person except myself to whom he had mentioned his thought of retiring: <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</a> spoke of it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CoplestonEdward">Copleston</a>, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CoplestonEdward">Copleston</a> mentioned Whately,

                           and later Archbishop of Dublin 1831–1863. He was also at this time a private tutor
                           and a writer on a wide variety of subjects, including for the Quarterly Review.</span></div>
                  </div> a man whom he (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>) considers as totally out of the question. – I will transcribe what he says in reply
                  to my suggestion – “Your young friend had not occurred to me; – indeed I thought that
                  he was fully given up to law, – the young men of his standing have often mentioned
                  him to me as one in whom they saw the future Judge. I know him to be all that you
                  say &amp; more. I wish I dared to hint to him, that latterly I have remarked, or fancied
                  I remarked a slight tendency in his writings to what we call the <span class="ital">Saints</span>, – the language as it were of the Christian Observer,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Christian Observer (1802–1874), evangelical periodical with a wide readership in the
                           Church of England.</span></div>
                  </div> – but <span class="ital">basta</span>!”
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Spanish for ‘enough’.</span></div>
                  </div> – He goes on to state what the chief difficulty will be for whoever may chance to
                  succeed him; you will easily divine where it lies. Then he proceeds thus – “I do not
                  meditate an immediate retirement; but my life, &amp; the possession of the faculties which
                  are yet spared me, seem to partake so much of the nature of a miracle, that I doubt
                  their existence from day to day. Hence a good deal of my anxiety. I cannot describe
                  to you my weakness, nor the scantiness of my breath; &amp; yet, such is the goodness of
                  the Almighty, my spirits do not seem to flag, nor my love of reading of abate.”</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">From this it seems likely, as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</a> had said to me, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> will probably continue to keep the journal in his own hands, as long as he is able
               to conduct it. It is plain that he has no successor in his eye; – &amp; when he is compelled
               to think of one, it is my opinion that you will be uppermost in his thoughts, as a
               person possessing “all the moral &amp; intellectual qualifications required for such an
               office”. – these were the words <span class="strikethrough">dxx</span> which I had used to him.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It would give me the greatest satisfaction to see the Review under your direction.
               At present it has no fixed principles upon points of taste, &amp; upon many other points
               it is as often wrong as right, saying &amp; unsaying with pitiable inconsistency. Many
               articles are in a vile spirit; those which relate to America are very mischievous;
               &amp; it has also heavy sins of omission. I know that you see these things in the same
               light as I do; &amp; I am sure that if it were steadily carried on in the tone which you
               would give it, its influence would be increased tenfold, for there would be nothing
               to subtract from it. I hope &amp; think that this may come to pass but the contingency
               on which it depends, is of such a nature that it cannot influence your arrangements
               in any other way, than in inducing you, perhaps, rather to strengthen what hold you
               have in the journal, than to relax it.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">My brother Henry</a> left me this morning, – &amp; such separations however they make act upon the heart are
               but bad cordials for the spirits. We have &lt;had&gt; a fortnights thorough enjoyment, within
               doors &amp; without, &amp; have gone over some of the ground which we first explored together
               some eighteen years ago with no sensible diminution of strength, &amp; with a pleasure
               higher perhaps in degree &amp; in kind. One magnificent day we had upon Saddleback, where
               I would have given much to have had <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> with us. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KennawayCharlesE">Charles Kennaway</a> was of the party, – this is the third season that he has past at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, &amp; I took to him from the first the more readily perhaps because he reminds me very
               strongly of what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">my old friend Bedford</a> was at his age. My guests have done me essential service by leading me into a course
               of brisk exercise, which has put me in excellent condition. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> orders me to keep it up thro the winter, as much as is compatible with my necessary
               pursuits at the desk: &amp; this I shall endeavour to do – for my tenement was more out
               of repair this summer than I ever remember it to have been.</p>

               <p>I intend to visit London in the latter end of February, or the beginning of March,
                  so as to make some promised visits in points as widely distant as Crediton, &amp; Norwich,
                  &amp; return to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> by the time the leaves are beginning to open.
