               in his bodily feelings could derive from any thing. My catarrh of this year deserves
               to be called a cat-a-mountain-arrh. The extreme heat of the weather aggravates it.
               I spend about half my time on the sofa with my eyes shut, &amp; the other half in blowing
               my nose. Nothing ails my eyes but the weakness which this violent cold produces. However
               my spirits are not a jot the worse, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs Coleridge</a> <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> can bear testimony that I practise all varieties of intonation in sneezing. She can
               testify also that I never sneeze like a sneaker. No! I let the house, &amp; the town &amp;
               the mountain echoes hear me.</p>

                  I insist upon it that there is no sense so good as your honest, genuine nonsense.
