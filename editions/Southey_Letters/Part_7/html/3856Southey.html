               <p>The greater part of your Treatise is employed in very ably and pleasantly supplying
                  the deficiencies of my Preface, in points wherein it was necessarily deficient because

                  </div> The remarks which are directed against my own hexameters appear to me altogether ill

                  </div> I have distinctly stated that the English hexameter is not constructed upon those

                           this form, but in addition lines are grouped into couplets whose last word rhymes.
                           Southey stated that his hexameter ‘bears the same analogy to the ancient hexameter
                           that our ten-syllable or heroic line does to iambic verse: iambic it is called, and
                           it is so in its general movement; but it admits of many other feet, and would, in
                           fact, soon become insupportably monotonous without their frequent intermixture’ (xiii).</span></div>
                  </div> I have explained the principle of adaptation which I had chosen, and by that principle
                  the measure ought to be judged.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You bring forward arguments which are derived from music. But it by no means follows
                  that a principle which holds good in music, should therefore be applicable to metre.
                  The arts of music and poetry are essentially distinct, and I have had opportunities
                  of observing that very skilful musicians may be as utterly without ear for metre,
                  as I am myself without ear for music. If these arguments were valid, they would apply
                  to the German hexameter as well as to the English; but the measure is as firmly established
                  among the Germans as blank verse is with us, and having been sanctioned by the practice
                  of their best poets, can never become obsolete so long as the works of Voss, and Göethe,

                  because it lay upon the surface. It is doubly fallacious: first, upon your own principle;
                  for if the English verse is not isochronous

                           was used as the fifth foot, ‘for the sake of variety, or of some particular effect’

               to show the effect of the measure. I certainly think that any paragraph of the poem
               containing from ten lines upward would confute all the reasoning which you have advanced,

                  all the reasoning in the world will ever persuade any one that the pudding which he
                  dislikes is a good pudding, or that the pudding which pleases his palate and agrees
                  with his stomach can be a bad one. I am glad that I have made the experiment, and
