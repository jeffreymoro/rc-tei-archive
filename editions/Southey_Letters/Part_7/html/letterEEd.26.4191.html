                  only written twelve letters, which bring me only into the twelfth year of my age.
                  Alas this is not the only case in which I feel that the remaining portion of my life,
                  were it even to be protracted longer than there is reason to expect upon the most
                  favourable calculation of chances, must be too short for the undertakings which I
                  have dreamt of compleating. It is however the case in which I can with least inconvenience
                  quicken my speed, &amp; frail as by humiliating experience I know my own resolutions to
                  be I will nevertheless endeavour to send off a letter from this <span class="strikethrough">time</span> time forth at the <span class="strikethrough">beginning</span> &lt;end&gt; of every month. Matter for one more will be afforded before I take leave of

                  rather half crazed: &amp; it was such a merry craziness, that it would have been wishing
                  him ill to wish him otherwise. The bliss of ignorance is merely negative; there was
                  a positive happiness in his insanity; it was like a perpetual drunkenness, <span class="strikethrough">kept a</span> sustained just at that degree of pleasurable excitement, which in the sense of present
                  enjoyment is equally regardless of the future &amp; of the past. He fancied himself a

                  more rusty wig, &amp; his old cocked hat. Whenever he entered the school room he was greeted
                  with a shout of welcome, all business was suspended, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; if</span> he was called upon from all sides to give us a rhyme, &amp; when the masters countenance
                  offered any encouragement, he was intreated also to ask for half a holyday, which
                  at the price of some <span class="strikethrough">rhymes</span> &lt;doggerel&gt; was sometimes obtained. You will readily believe <span class="strikethrough">that</span> he was a popular poet.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1"><span class="strikethrough">It is now become</span> The talent of composing imitative verses has become so common in our days, that it
               will require some evidence to make the next generation believe <span class="strikethrough">that any</span> (what&gt; sort of verses were received as poetry fifty years ago &lt;when any thing in
               rhyme past current.&gt;. The magazines however contain proof of this; the very best of
               them <span class="strikethrough">containing</span> &lt;abounding in&gt; such trash as would be rejected now by the provincial newspapers Whether
               the progress of society which <span class="strikethrough">has</span> so greatly favours the growth &amp; developement of imitative talent, is equally favourable
               to the true poetical spirit, is a question which I may be led to consider hereafter.
               But as I had the good fortune to grow up in an age when poets, according to the old
               opinion, were born &amp; not made <span class="strikethrough">so</span> – &amp; as at the time to which this part of my reminiscences relates, the bent of my
               nature had decidedly shown itself, I may here make some observations upon the grounds
               &amp; consequences of that opinion.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In <span class="strikethrough">former</span> the earliest ages certain it is that they who possessed that gift of <span class="strikethrough">tongues</span> &lt;speech&gt; which enabled them to clothe ready thoughts in measured or elevated diction,
               were held to be inspired. False oracles were uttered in verse; &amp; true prophecies delivered
               in poetry. &lt;There was therefore some reason for the opinion.&gt; A belief akin to this
               prevails even now among the ignorant, &amp; was much more prevalent in my childhood, when
               very few of the lower classes could write or read &amp; when in the classes above these
               those who really were ignorant, knew that they were so. In dark ages slight of hand
               past for magic, slight of tongue for inspiration; &amp; the ignorant, &lt;when they were&gt;
               <span class="strikethrough">tho</span> no longer <span class="strikethrough">so ignorant as</span> to be thus deluded, still looked upon both as <span class="strikethrough">something</span> extraordinary &amp; wonderful. The power <span class="strikethrough">of</span> especially of arranging words in a manner altogether different from the common manner
               of speech, ( – a power which has now become as easy &amp; therefore is every day becoming
               more &amp; more a common acquirement,) appeared to them what it originally was in all
               poets &amp; always will be in those who are truly such: &amp; &lt;even now&gt; tho there are none
               who <span class="strikethrough">now look upon</span> &lt;regard&gt; its possessor with superstitious reverence, there are still many who regard
               look upon him as <span class="strikethrough">something</span> &lt;one who in the constitution of his mind is&gt; different from themselves. As no madman
               ever pretended to <span class="strikethrough">inspiration</span> &lt;a religious call&gt; without finding some open-eared listeners ready to believe in
               him, so perhaps no one ever composed verses with facility, who had not in his own
               little circle some to admire &amp; applaud him. This was even the case with so poor a
               creature as D<sup>r</sup> Jones. And to the intoxication of conceit which the honest admiration of the ignorant
               has produced in half crazed rhymers, like him, it is owing that some marvellous productions
               have found their way to the press.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>D<sup>r</sup> Jones was a doggrelist of the lowest kind. One other such I once met with, when I
                  was young enough to be <span class="strikethrough">infinitely</span> &lt;heartily&gt; amused<span class="strikethrough">ent</span> with an exhibition which farcical as it was, would now make me mournful. He was a

                  a bear, &amp; far better success. I do not remember that I set out with any dislike, or

               that resulted in the election of a group of 40 King’s Scholars, who were taught apart
               from other boys in ‘College’. King’s Scholars could proceed to a Closed Scholarship
               at either Christ Church, Oxford, or Trinity College, Cambridge. There was no certainty
               that a King’s Scholar would receive a Fellowship, once he graduated from Trinity College,
               Cambridge. However, at Christ Church, a King’s Scholar immediately became one of the
               body of Students, with a modest stipend that was guaranteed for life, if the recipient
               wished and he obeyed the rules of the College. If they took university degrees in
               a timely fashion then their stipend would increase. The rules governing Studentships
               were strict and anyone who married, did not take Holy Orders or accepted a paid occupation
               had to resign.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note40_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
