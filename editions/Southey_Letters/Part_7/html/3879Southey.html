                        on correspondent: Identified by subject matter. The content makes it likely that this
                        letter is to Richard Garnett. Southey’s correspondent had been researching the life
                        of Simon Ockley, who was a family connection of Richard Garnett’s first wife, Margaret
                        Heathcote (1795–1828). The letter also displays an interest in many of Garnett’s enthusiasms,
                        including writings published in Germany and medieval literature.</span></div>
