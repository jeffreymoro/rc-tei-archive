                           that he should have given the substance only, compressed and abridged according to
                           the relative importance and interest of the documents’ (Quarterly Review, 29 (April

                  </div> And as for the arrangement of the Portugueze insurrection it only appears defective
                  to him, because he is accustomed to consider Portugal in the lump, &amp; not to regard

                           rising against the French occupation in 1808 were ‘carelessly presented to the reader,
                           and want that judicious combination into masses which would have given them both importance
