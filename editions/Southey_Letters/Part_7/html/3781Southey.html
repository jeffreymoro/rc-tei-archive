               <p>There is, (I repeat it), a great deal of sterling friendship in the world. It is very
                  true that as men get higher in this world they are less able to act from feeling &amp;
                  inclination. They are involved in party obligations. &amp; political considerations must
                  of necessity predominate over personal ones. This is the case officially with all

                  upon the specific subject of your wishes, (to which however I see there is an end,
                  by your letter of today) I should really think the surest &amp; easiest way of serving <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</a> would be by endeavouring to secure his promotion in his own office, where he has the
