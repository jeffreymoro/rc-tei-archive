               occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming
               Henry): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their
               departure, fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded,
               and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (<em>Glasgow Herald</em>, 12 August 1822). The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and
               was fired as part of the annual Keswick Regatta.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
