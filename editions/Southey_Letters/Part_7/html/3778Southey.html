               from his present creed in politics, and of a lamentable soreness at the success of
               those who have laughed at his affectations, or eclipsed, by their superior talents,
               his former fame as a poet’ (422). Southey responded by accusing Jeffrey, the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>’s editor, and author of this article, of ‘pitiful malevolence’; Southey to the Editor

               criticised Southey from the hustings at Appleby. Southey debated at length whether
               to make a public riposte to him – but in the end did not. He also fantasised about
               what he would do should he receive a challenge to a duel from Brougham. His jokey
