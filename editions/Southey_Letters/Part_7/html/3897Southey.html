                           occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming
                           him): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their departure,
                           fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded,
                           and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (Glasgow Herald, 12 August 1822).
                           The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part
                           of the annual Keswick Regatta.</span></div>
                  </div> The wound is rapidly closing, &amp; he has been out of doors. Seldom I believe has there
                  been a more providential recovery. The eye which there was great reason to apprehend
                  he would never be able to open, is safe: &amp; he is likely to suffer no other inconvenience
                  than that of wearing a plate upon the forehead to protect the place of the fracture.
                  Had the hot weather which we had about three weeks ago occurred immediately after
                  the accident it is hardly possible that he could have lived thro it. It remains to
                  be seen whether this merciful deliverance will have any effect upon his conduct in
                  after life. Were I his parent I should endeavor to make him profit by it.</p>
