                  And having now been again informed from Madrid that they are not to be procured in
                  that city, &amp; indeed not known there, I have bethought myself as the last forlorn hope,
                  of writing to you to enquire if they are in your possession, &amp; if so, to request the
                  loan of them. Should it be in your power thus to oblige &amp; assist me, the readiest
                  mode of conveyance will be to send them thro <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">M<sup>r</sup> Murray</a> the bookseller, apprizing him what the parcel contains, that no time may be lost.</p>
