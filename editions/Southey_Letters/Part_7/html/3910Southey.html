               talents and the immorality of his poems; the ‘little effect which our advice had,
               on former occasions, produced’; and the belief that Byron could only interpret the
               <em>Quarterly</em>’s silence as ‘an appeal, of not the least impressive kind’ to repent. The fact that
               Murray was the publisher of both Byron and the <em>Quarterly Review</em> was not mentioned. The article (pp. 514–524) defended orthodox Christianity against
               the arguments put forward by the characters in Byron’s <em>Cain</em>, especially on the issue of the compatibility of a supreme deity with the existence
