               perfectly new and delightful. For many hours after this experiment, he imagined that
               his taste and smell were more acute, and is certain that he felt unusually strong
               and chearful. In a second experiment, he felt pleasure still superior – and has since
               poetically remarked, that he supposes the atmosphere of the highest of all possible
               heavens to be composed of this gas.’ In Humphry Davy, <em>Researches, Chemical and Philosophical; Chiefly Concerning Nitrous Oxide, or Dephlogisticated
                  Nitrous Air, and its Respiration</em> (London, 1800), p. 508, Southey reported that he ‘felt a fulness in my chest afterwards;
               and during the remainder of the day, <span class="ital">imagined</span> that my taste and hearing were more than commonly quick. Certain I am that I felt
               myself more than usually strong and chearful. / In a second trial, by continuing the
               inhalation longer, I felt a thrill in my teeth; and breathing still longer the third
               time, became so full of strength as to be compelled to exercise my arms and feet.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
