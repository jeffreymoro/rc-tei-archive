               <p>I have just received a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</a>, in which he says – “you mention my namesake Caroline. If you write, do make my warmest

                  </div> – There was only one copy in Bath, – no one read a word of it, no one thought of buying
                  it, no one spoke of it. I was the first in this neighbourhood to bring it into notice.
                  I spoke to every one with the utmost warmth of it, as deeply affecting in story, &amp;
                  beautiful in genuine language of poetry. I trumpeted it to Lord &amp; Lady Lansdowne,

                  will find there all that he found in the former publication &amp; more. I have shown it
                  to many persons &amp; in no one instance have I been disappointed of seeing it produce
                  the effect which I expected. I have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LightfootNicholas">a friend</a> with me now whom I had not seen since we parted at College, eight &amp; twenty years ago

                  beginning to make themselves felt. You can better feel what the feelings of such a
                  meeting are, than I could express them. I should not have recognized him so much is
                  he changed: he says he should have known me any where. We have been comparing notes,
                  &amp; find our hearts &amp; views just as much in unison as they were when we, literally,
                  lived together at college, – for we breakfasted together every morning, read together,
                  &amp; past every evening together. In this respect I have been peculiarly fortunate, that
                  most of my friendships have been formed for eternity, &amp; grown stronger as they have
