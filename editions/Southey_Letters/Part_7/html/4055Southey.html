               <p>Sometimes when Williams was in good humour, he suspended the usual business of the

                  a man with red hair, who was heir to a good estate, &amp; was carrying a hare in his hand.
                  Another time he called upon all of a certain standing to write a letter, each upon
                  what subject he pleased. You will perhaps wonder to hear that <span class="strikethrough">not</span> no task <span class="strikethrough">had</span> ever perplexed me so wofully as this. I had never in my life written a letter, except
                  a formal one at Corston before every holydays, every word of which was of the masters
                  dictation.

                  wrote in a tradesman like stile, soliciting orders, or acknowledging them. For my
                  part I actually cried for perplexity &amp; vexation. Had I been a blockhead this would
                  have provoked Williams but he always looked upon me with a favourable eye, &amp; expressing
                  wonder rather than anger he endeavoured both to encourage &amp; shame me to the attempt.

                  gave my name, &amp; was ushered into a private room. Nothing could be more gracious that
                  his recognition of a person whom he must have past twenty times in the street during
                  the last three months – we had been schoolfellows at such a place, at such a time

                  execute such a work, for the very sufficient reason that I was wholly ignorant of
                  several languages the thorough knowledge &lt;of which&gt; was indispensable in such researches.
                  This produced more blarney, &amp; an explanation that <span class="strikethrough">such a work as I seemed to</span> my answer did not exactly apply to what his proposal intended. What he meant was this,
                  there were a great many elegant words, which persons, like himself, – whose education
                  had been neglected, – would often be glad to use in conversation, – (<span class="strikethrough">he spoke</span> he said this feelingly, – it had often been his own case,) – they would be glad to
                  use them, if they only knew their meaning: &amp; what he wanted was a Glossary or Dictionary
                  of such words, – a little book, which might be carried in the pocket; it would certainly
                  command a large sale: I could make the book; – he had a large acquaintance, &amp; could
                  procure subscribers for it, – &amp; we might make a thriving partnership concern in this
                  literary undertaking. Before he arrived at this point, the scene had become far too
                  comical to leave any room in my feelings for anger. I kept my countenance – (which
                  has often been put to much harder trials than my temper, &amp; is moreover a much more
                  difficult thing to keep,) – declined his proposal decidedly but civilly, took my leave
