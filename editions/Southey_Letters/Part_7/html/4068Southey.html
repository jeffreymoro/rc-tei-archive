               <em>DNB</em>). They were the sisters of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</a>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752–1815; <em>DNB</em>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent
               the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna
               Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815;
               <em>DNB</em>), the maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir
               Charles Malet’s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791);
               Henry Charles (1793–1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied Malet to Britain
               in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married,
               in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785–1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810–1833, Rector of Folke,
               Dorset 1833–1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843–1854. Southey is probably
               referring here to Louisa Malet.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

Southey had reviewed extensively for the <em>Annual Review for 1802</em>, 1 (1803) until the <em>Annual Review for 1808</em>, 7 (1809) and written the historical sections of the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</em> (1810) until the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</em> (1813). Essays I–III in <em>Essays, Moral and Political</em>, 2 vols (London, 1832), I, pp. [3]–72, and Essays XI–XII in <em>Essays, Moral and Political</em>, 2 vols (London, 1832), II, pp. [277]–328, were mainly drawn from the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>. None of Southey’s contributions to the <em>Annual Review</em> formed the basis of an essay, but parts of Southey’s review of Thomas Malthus (1766–1834;
               <em>DNB</em>), <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em> (1803), <em>Annual Review for 1803</em>, 2 (1804), 292–301, were grafted onto Essay IV of <em>Essays, Moral and Political</em>, 2 vols (London, 1832), I, pp. [73]–155, which was mainly taken from Southey’s review
               of Patrick Colquhoun (1745–1820; <em>DNB</em>), <em>Propositions for Ameliorating the Condition of the Poor: and for Improving the Moral
