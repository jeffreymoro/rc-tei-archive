                           illness, but recovers at the end of the novel.</span></div>
                  </div> is a great favourite here, &amp; well deserves to be so. The tale is beautifully told,
                  &amp; every where true to nature; – if there be a little of that ideal colouring which
                  belongs to this species of composition as much as to poetry, it is in your hero rather
                  than your heroine. The tragic catastrophe would, as you say, have made the story more
                  perfect, – but it would have made the book painful instead of pleasing in recollection.
                  I am sure that I should not have looked at it a second time, compared one part with
                  another, &amp; dwelt upon particular scenes, if there had been death at the end. And this
                  I think is not so much the weakness of my individual temper as it is a natural feeling.
                  The theatres show it to be so, by the preference which is given to comedy. They who
                  have borne a part in the tragedies of real life (&amp; who is there that can go thro the
                  world without it?) – shrink even from the sorrow which is produced by fiction.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Quarterly Review will be much better employed in recommending Madeline to notice,
                  than in pointing out in the Pirate beauties which every body has seen, &amp; defects which
                  nobody can have overlooked.
