               calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad
               on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland
               in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey
               to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League
               of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. Southey had responded with
               a letter to the Editor of the <em>Courier</em>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776, published there on 11 January 1822.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
