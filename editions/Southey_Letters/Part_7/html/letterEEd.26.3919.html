               The new law had faced severe opposition in the House of Lords and was encrusted with
               amendments deliberately designed to make it unworkable. Nevertheless, Phillimore,

               passed to secure the point that previous marriages which contravened these rules,
               but where the parties were still living together, should be legalised unless either
