                  a single duodecimo volume, – &amp; that even when enlarged it is still a mere epitome
                  for the most part, – in which I should feel that a display of authorities was out

                  to expect credit: – &amp; in fact the more my credit is examined, the higher it will stand.
                  Whoever may examine my Collections for this, &amp; for my other historical works (&amp; doubtless
