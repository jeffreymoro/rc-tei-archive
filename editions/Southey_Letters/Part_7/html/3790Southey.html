                  taking must have the effect of excluding his works from sight at least, &amp; very much

               calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad
               on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland
               in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey
               to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League
               of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               to Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> (1819), whose suppressed ‘Dedication’, mocking Southey, had circulated widely.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
