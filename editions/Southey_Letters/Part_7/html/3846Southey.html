               of modern poetry, without naming any one poet. In the ‘Appendix’ to ‘The Two Foscari’,
               <em>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</em> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: ‘I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey’s
               calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad
               on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland
               during his continental tour of May–August 1817. Byron believed that Southey had subsequently
               spread rumours that Byron and Shelley engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their
               residence in Switzerland in 1816. Byron continued: ‘One of his [Southey’s] consolations
               appears to be a Latin note from a work of a Mr. Landor, the author of “Gebir”, whose
               friendship for Robert Southey will, it seems, “be an honour to him when the ephemeral
               disputes and ephemeral reputations of the day are forgotten.” [<em>Vision of Judgement</em>, pp. xix–xx] I for one neither envy him “the friendship”, nor the glory in reversion
               which is to accrue from it, like Mr. Thelusson’s fortune in the third and fourth generation.
               [Peter Thellusson (1735–1797) left his fortune in trust for his descendants, but nothing
               to his living relatives] This friendship will probably be as memorable as his own
               epics, which (as I quoted to him ten or twelve years ago in “English Bards”) Porson
               said “would be remembered when Homer and Virgil are forgotten, and not till then.”
               [Byron, <em>English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers; A Satire</em> (London, 1809), p. 9] For the present I leave him.’ (p. 329).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

This was published in the <em>Courier</em> on 11 January 1822. In the conclusion to his letter, Southey had advised Byron: ‘When
               he attacks me again let it be in rhyme. For one who has so little command of himself,
               it will be a great advantage that his temper should be obliged to keep to tune.’ Unfortunately
               for Southey, Byron responded with <em>The Vision of Judgment</em>, a parody of <em>A Vision of Judgement</em> (1821), published in <em>The Liberal</em>, 1 (October 1822), 3–39.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
