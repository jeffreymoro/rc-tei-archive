                  </div> but I remember that I used to compare the attempting at eliciting any thing like common
                  sense from poor Catcott to that of trying to strike fire with a wooden mallet from
                  a lump of lead. – Townsend of Pewsey has written a book of <span class="strikethrough">some</span> good repute with the view as thus concerning which you enquire, – its title I believe
                  is ‘the character of Moses as an historian vindicated.
