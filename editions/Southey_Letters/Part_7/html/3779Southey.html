ALS; 3p.<br> Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), III, p. 293.<br> Note on MS: This letter originally enclosed Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford,
               6 January 1822, Letter 3778. This was left unsealed to allow Rickman to read Southey’s
               letter to the Editor of the <em>Courier</em>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776, which was itself enclosed in the letter to Bedford.</p>
