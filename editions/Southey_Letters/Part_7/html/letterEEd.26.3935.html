               <h1><span class="head">3935. Robert Southey to [<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Sara Coleridge</a>] [fragment], <span class="date">[c. mid-December 1822]</span></span></h1>
            </header>
            <p>MS: British Library, Add MS 47891. ALS; 1p.<br> Unpublished.<br> Dating note: This dates from Sara Coleridge and her daughter’s visit to the south
               of England, 1822–1823. They had left Keswick by 8 November; see Robert Southey to
               Nicholas Lightfoot, 8–12 November 1822 (Letter 3915). They spent about a month staying
               with Elizabeth Evans near Derby. This letter probably dates from mid-December 1822,
               when they were in transit between Derby and the Clarksons’ home, Playford Hall, Suffolk;
               see Southey to John May, 5 December 1822 (Letter 3927). On their way to the latter,
               they paid a brief visit to Cambridge, where Derwent Coleridge was a student.<br> Note on MS: This fragmentary letter (or at least the surviving version of it) was
               possibly not sent to Sara Coleridge but instead dispatched at an unknown date to Grosvenor
               Charles Bedford, a connoisseur of Mrs Coleridge’s linguistic practice, as an example
               of her lingo grande. This is suggested by the fact that the manuscript survives as
               part of a short run of letters to Bedford and – unusually – opens (top of fol. 1r)
               with an address to him: ‘And so-oh-oh/ Dar Miscumber Bedfordiddlededford/ I sub&lt;cum&gt;scribe
               myself – your sincumcere friendiddledend/ Robcumbert Southeydiddledouthey/ Student
               of the Lingo Grande, Graduate in Butlerology, Professor of/ the Science of Noncumsensediddledence,
               of sneezing, &amp; of vocal music –/ P.L. &amp; LLD.’ This nearly duplicates the closing salutation
               of Southey to Bedford, 24 December 1822 (Letter 3940), perhaps indicating that this
               fragment was sent to Bedford shortly after this date.</p>
