                  should be allowed to indulge that vile English humour of breaking it to carry away
                  a fragment. Our nation is infamous for this – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Robert Lovell</a> has just been groaning over an example of it in Bedes chair, – certainly the most
                  venerable relic in these kingdoms, which is utterly defaced &amp; half destroyed by those

                           but also believed to have the property of improving the chance of bearing many children.
