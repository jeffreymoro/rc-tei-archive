                  </div> In some of the Italian cities the streets are paved in stripes, the wheels run upon
                  two lines of smooth pavement, as over a bowling green, with little sound &amp; no jolting,
                  &amp; the space between where the horses go is common pitching. This is the case at Milan
                  &amp; at Como, – &amp; probably in most other places.

                           Murray responded with a pamphlet, ‘Notes on Captain Medwin’s Conversations of Lord
