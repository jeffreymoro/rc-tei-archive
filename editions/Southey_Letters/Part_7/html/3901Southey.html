                  </div> this evening, &amp; am glad to perceive by it that if no luckier occupation is afforded
                  him, authorship will not be to him, as it is to so many, – a desperate profession:
                  &amp; that if there is, he may still find in it <span class="strikethrough">an</span> a profitable &amp; honourable pursuit.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The play is not, I think suited for representation: &amp; at this time there is very little
                  likelihood that any bookseller would undertake the risk of publishing it, – the book-trade
                  more than any other having felt the effects of that retrenchment which those who formerly
                  had money to spare are now compelled to make. My advice to him is that he should chuse
                  a subject adapted for the stage, where if he gets a footing, he may easily obtain
                  a good subsistence. And I would recommend a happy catastrophe as likely to promote
                  its success. The old mixed drama

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Tragicomedy, popular on the English stage in the first half of the seventeenth century.</span></div>
                  </div> must always be more popular, – more fitted to gratify <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> a mixed audience, – more congenial in fact to general feelings, than pure tragedy,
                  which few but the young can bear.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">There is a great deal of true feeling &amp; genuine poetry in this play. The plot has
               some improbabilities, – of a kind to excite displeasure. And the versification frequently
               requires a mute syllable to be pronounced, which generally baulks a reader, &amp; always
               attenuates the rhythm. In our verse the syllables bear better to be crowded than stretched.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>These are trifling faults, &amp; easily corrected, if it were worth while. But it is better
                  to build upon a new foundation, &amp; chuse an unexceptionable subject. There are very
                  serious objections to the present. The story if it were true, would be monstrous,
                  – therefore in my judgement unfit for the stage, or for relation. But in point of
                  fact, it is as false as the tale, still asserted by Romish writers that Henry 8 married
                  Anna Boleyn knowing her to be his own daughter.
