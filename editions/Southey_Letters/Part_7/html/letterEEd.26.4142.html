                  are meant as had no right to more ceremonious treatment. I have &lt;been&gt; unpacking,
                  arranging, &amp; idling over the long looked for box of books from Italy, &amp; a parcel of
                  some forty volumes which I dispatched from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</a>. I have been enjoying an old coat &amp; old shoes, – habits so regular that the clock
                  might be regulated by them, – my usual breakfast, my usual hours, my <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> after-dinner sleep – the consciousness of being at rest, – in a word home after a
                  long absence. <span class="strikethrough">Every</span> All things are now resuming their old course. The children come to me regularly with
                  their lessons, &amp; I go down to supper with folio under my arm, to be taken with the

               <p>I had been absent fifteen weeks wanting one day. To say nothing of the arrears of
                  business which so long an interruption occasions, there were heavy arrears of sleep;
                  &amp; if on the former score I am debtor, here I am on the creditor side of the account.
                  By a fair calculation not less than three hundred &amp; forty five hours of good honest
                  sleep were due to me when I reached home, at the rate of three hours lost in every
                  twenty-four, besides six nights past in stage coaches. Such arrears are like the national
                  debt, too large to be paid off; &amp; having taken out a small part, I am making a magnanimous
                  resolution to cancel the remainder of the debt, &amp; rise as early as I did in London.
                  The produce of this time before breakfast will find its way to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Buckland">Buckland</a>, &amp; before you receive this letter I shall have made a beginning.
