               <p>I very much approve your laudable curiosity to know the precise meaning of that noble
                  word horsemangandering.

From this substantive
                  the verb has been formed to denote an operation performed by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">the said daughter</a> upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">the said Aunt</a>, – of which I was an astonished spectator.

                  the kitchen into the middle of the parlour, the motion of the horsemangandered person
                  at every jump being some thing like that of a paviours rammer,
