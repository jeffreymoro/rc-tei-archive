            <p class="indent1">Thank you for following my directions in halving the note, I shall gain by it another
               letter, &amp; yet the advice was given in sober prudence, &amp; not with that selfish purpose.
               I am heartily glad that you have reached home safely, &amp; with so few disagreables on
               the way, that the fear of such a journey will not stand in the way of your repeating
               it, for I will not believe that you have taken leave of these mountains for ever.
               You must not talk of <span class="ital">sunset</span> pleasures yet. Your evening is far distant, &amp; many such pleasures as this country
               can afford (they are not light ones) – are in store I hope both for you &amp; for me.
               If you are half as desirous of partaking them again, as I am that you should do so,
               the difficulties in the way will only be thought of with the view of overcoming them.
               Whatever we may think of dreams, you will allow that day dreams may have some truth
               in them, &amp; you have borne no small part in mine since your departure. These at least
               may bring about their accomplishment.</p>
