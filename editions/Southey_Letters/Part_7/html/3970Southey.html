                           military intervention.</span></div>
                  </div> I should approve its interference, and heartily wish it success. But the French are
                  a faithless nation: they have ever been so, and, upon the first favourable opportunity,

                  as I verily think the grounds of their interference are, the question of expediency
                  is a very difficult one. When they get to Madrid (which may be done without difficulty),
                  the work is far from being over. They may make a new government, or restore the old
                  despotism, but how is it to be supported? The old difficulty of the finances recurs;
                  and thus government will require, not our auxiliary troops to keep the country quiet,
                  but loans to maintain it, till credit and prosperity are restored. France may have
                  some reason to apprehend discontent at home, and the explosion of her own combustibles,
                  if the struggle be prolonged; or, to prevent this, it is not improbable that she may
                  be willing to provoke a war with England, for which the Portuguese seem disposed to
                  give her a pretext.

                           forces might invade Portugal and, later in 1823, both a British naval squadron and
                           5,000 British troops were dispatched to Portugal to prevent this eventuality.</span></div>
                  </div> If they assist the Spaniards, and the French, in consequence, invade Portugal, we
                  can no longer remain neutral.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Here, then, are two evils in prospect; that France may acquire such ascendency over
               Spain as Louis XIV. aimed at, and that we may be drawn into a war, in support of those
               very revolutionary opinions against which we have struggled so long. And this is what
               the Whigs desire. The very persons who would have had us desert Spain and the Portuguese
               when they resisted Buonaparte, are now endeavouring to force us into a war in their
               behalf. Undoubtedly they hope that it would end in a revolution at home by the embarrassments
               which it would produce. In this they are greatly deceived, for it would restore agricultural
               prosperity, and give a new spur to our manufactures. But this would be dearly purchased.
               Our policy is to preserve peace and order wherever our influence extends.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have written hastily, and may very possibly have failed to make myself understood.
               The upshot is this; it is a struggle in Spain between two extremes which are both
               so bad that one can hardly form a wish on either side; and that the one thing to be
               desired is, that order should be restored there. If France were an upright power,
               her interference would be desirable; – being what she is, it is to be wished that
               the Peninsular were left to itself.</p>
