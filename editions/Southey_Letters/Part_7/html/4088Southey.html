                           religious feeling, to be as delightful as it is original’. Lamb took offence and responded
                           with ‘Letter of Elia to Robert Southey, Esquire’, London Magazine, 8 (October 1823),
                           400–407.</span></div>
                  </div> which I had not before had an opportunity of seeing, and I now take the first interval

            <p class="indent1">Nothing could be further from my mind than any intention or apprehension of any way
               offending or injuring a man concerning whom I have never spoken, thought, or felt
               otherwise than with affection, esteem, and admiration.</p>
            <p class="indent1">If you had let me know in any private or friendly manner that you felt wounded by
               a sentence in which nothing but kindness was intended – or that you found it might
               injure the sale of your book – I would most readily and gladly have inserted a note
               in the next Review to qualify and explain what had hurt you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You have made this impossible, and I am sorry for it. But I will not engage in controversy
               with you to make sport for the Philistines.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The provocation must be strong indeed that can rouse me to do this, even with an enemy.
               And if you can forgive an unintended offence as heartily as I do the way in which
               you have resented it, there will be nothing to prevent our meeting as we have heretofore
               done, and feeling towards each other as we have always been wont to do. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Only signify a correspondent willingness on your part, and send me your address,
