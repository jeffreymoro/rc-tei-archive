                  Addressed to the two Houses of Parliament</em> (1801). Ireland’s work was then plagiarised in a later tract, <em>Essay on the Scripture Doctrines of Adultery and Divorce, and on the Criminal Character
                  and Punishment of Adultery, by the Ancient Laws of England and Other Countries</em> (1822). The latter’s author was Henry Virtue Tebbs (1797–1876), a Proctor, i.e. a
               lawyer qualified to practise in the ecclesiastical courts that dealt with divorce.
               Tebbs’s plagiarism was brought to light in a review of his and Ireland’s works in
               <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 28 (October 1822), 179–188. The close friendship between Gifford and Ireland was
               probably the only reason why this obscure matter made its way into the pages of the

               illegal. In the Treaty of Paris (1814) France only agreed to move towards this situation
               over a five-year period, though Napoleon Bonaparte unilaterally (if ineffectually)
               abolished the French slave trade in 1815. Following a revolution by the slave population,
               France had finally lost control of its colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), on the
               western part of the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, in 1804. However, the French government
               did not recognise the independence of Haiti and sent a mission to the country in October
               1814 to try and persuade the Haitian leaders to accept French rule (there were further
               unsuccessful French missions in 1816 and 1819). </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">11.. </span><span class="noteBody">This story is impossible to verify; but France clearly wished to recover Haiti, and
               Haitians feared that French reluctance to abolish the slave trade was part of a French
               plan to repopulate Haiti with slaves once it was re-conquered. An intensive propaganda
               war between France and Haiti began in 1814, with British abolitionists urging their
               government to press France not to intervene in Haiti. The story Southey refers to
               may have circulated in this context.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               <em>DNB</em>), a Scottish soldier and confidence-trickster. He claimed to be the ruler of Poyais,
               a fictional country in Central America, and persuaded many people to invest in loans
               to, and land in, the country. About 250 settlers sailed to Poyais in 1822–1823. MacGregor’s
               fraud was uncovered when a British ship discovered the survivors in May 1823, though
               this news did not reach London until October 1823. Barrow’s article concentrated on
               the trade in bonds issued by the ‘Poyais government’, whose value had risen dramatically,
               only to crash when doubts arose about the security of a huge loan issued by the Colombian
