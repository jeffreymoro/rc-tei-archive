                  </div> was a long while before it reached me. I have now perused it, and find – what I expected
                  – an exuberance of power which you do not know how to direct. Writers who have the
                  mere talent of imitation (which is all that ninety-nine out of the hundred possess)
                  soon attain to all the perfection of which they are capable, and write as well at
                  sixteen as they would do at threescore. Like ginger-beer, they are soon ripe; but
                  where the liquor is generous, it must have time for ripening.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I advise you not to publish ‘Nero,’ because there is little likelihood that it would
                  pay the expense of publication, and because all it could do for you would be no more
                  than what your ‘Legend’

                  </div> has done; that is, it would convey sure evidence of genius to those persons who are
                  capable of discovering it – a much smaller number than is generally supposed.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Only have patience, and you will surely rise to your natural station.</p>

                  </div> ripen in your mind than begin upon it, till you are better able to construct the plan
                  of a poem. Your easiest way to distinguish yourself is by the drama, and not by aiming
                  at its highest branches at first. Choose some graceful subject with a romantic interest,
                  one which requires more poetry than passion; form your plan first, and if you construct
                  that well, there will be no fear of your failing in the execution.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">One thing more I would say: you may be a great poet without being a classical scholar.
               Do not suppose that I undervalue the advantages of a regular education; but the attempt
               to supply by severe application that want of one and to make yourself a scholar, must
               be deeply injurious to your health, and could not be successful. Remember how many
               poets have excelled without <span class="ital">this</span> kind of learning, for after all this is <span class="ital">only one kind</span>.</p>

               <p>Shall I keep your manuscript till I have an opportunity of returning it by a private
                  hand, which will surely occur in the course of the summer? You have given a wrong
                  pronunciation to two of the names: the accent in Natalis should be on the middle syllable;
                  in Tigellinus on the last but one.
