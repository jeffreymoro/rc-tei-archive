                  </div> of Boston, in New England, is equally distinguished in his own country by the fervour
                  and eloquence of his preaching, and the primitive virtues of his life. I take the
                  liberty of introducing him to you, because you will feel yourself in accord with him
                  upon many of the most important points, and because I am very desirous that he should
                  see and converse with one who holds as high a rank in Old England as he does in America.
                  I have learnt from him with some surprise that, under the name of Unitarianism, Arianism

                  that persuasion. But I have told him that he will find himself much more in sympathy
                  with our clergy than with the Dissenters, and this he already apprehends. He is in
                  opulent circumstances, and has devoted, and almost spent, himself in the ministerial
                  duties.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I need say no more of him; his conversation and the truly Christian temper of his
                  mind, notwithstanding the doctrinal errors which he holds, will sufficiently recommend
                  him. But I feel the necessity of apologising for the liberty which I am taking with
                  you. You will, I trust, impute it to the true cause, and not be offended, if, in excuse
                  for it, I say to you that having had the good fortune once to hear you in the pulpit,
