                  leave home at the end of April, &amp; try as the only probable means of escaping it, to

            <p class="indent1">The bottom of the lake in that part (near <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lodore">Lodore</a>) is covered with aquatic plants, growing in a soft vegetable mould which is <span class="strikethrough">about xxxx</span> hardly a foot thick, &amp; lies upon a bed of peat, – that bed is six feet in thickness
               &amp; rests upon a stratum of fine white clay. From time to time a quantity of <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;gas&gt; is generated (whether in the peat, or below it remains to be discovered) which
               fills this peat, till it becomes so buoyant that it is seperated from the clay, &amp;
               then that part of the bottom of the lake floats &amp; rises to the surface. But so great
               was the accumulation when this took place that it has made a rent in the bottom some
               fifty yards long, &amp; some six feet deep. Upon probing the gas comes out freely but
               not so plentifully, on the sides of this chasm, – as in another portion at some little
               distance, where instead of forcing for itself a vent, the gas has puffed up the bottom
               in a convex form. Then when a pole is thrust down, the air rushes out like a jet.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We have had rain enough in the course of the lake to raise the lake full four feet.
               The convex part is therefore now under water, – &amp; probably the two other pieces, or
               the sides of the chasm will soon subside.</p>
