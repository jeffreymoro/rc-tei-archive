               this idea and produced ‘An Outline of a Plan of Emigration to Upper Canada’ in January
               1823. He proposed that parishes all over the United Kingdom should be able to mortgage
               their poor rates in order to repay loans from the government, which would finance
               sending the parishes’ paupers to Canada. Each family would receive 100 acres of land.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
