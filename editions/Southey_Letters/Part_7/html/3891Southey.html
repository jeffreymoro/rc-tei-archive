                  me as long as his holidays would allow; and I believe no men ever met more cordially
                  after so long a separation, or enjoyed each other’s society more. I shall never forget
                  the manner in which he first met me, nor the time in which he said that having now
                  seen me, he should return home and die in peace. We took many of the walks which you
                  and I performed together, and which every year become dearer to me, for the recollection
