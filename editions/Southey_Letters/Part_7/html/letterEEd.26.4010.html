                           The Maria carried 53 settlers. Some of those from Cumberland had received assistance

                  – (3£ per head was the passage money in the Maria) &amp; that with the exception of a
                  very few cases where two or three pounds have been given, they are left entirely to
                  their own resources when they arrive in America. Indeed the reason assigned for not
                  giving them money has been because they should come back.</p>

                  those who went from Carlisle. And probably at least an equal number are Scotch, from
                  the opposite <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> &amp; coast of the Solway. In the instances which I have been able to ascertain the emigration
                  has taken place from the more thinly peopled parts of the county. The parishes of
                  Abbey Holm &amp; Bolton are specified.
