                           Battle of Corunna (1809). Southey used this to compose ‘Lines. To the Memory of a

                  </div> They are exceedingly affecting, – so much so indeed as to make me feel how flat &amp;
                  unprofitable any composition must appear when compared with the plain narration of
                  such circumstances. However what I am contemplating will not be liable to any such
                  comparison, – otherwise I might well be deterred from the attempt. – In my youth,
                  the more striking <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> a story appeared to me, the stronger was my inclination to clothe it in verse; whereas
                  in later years the feeling that circumstances affecting in themselves are more likely
                  to be marred than rendered more so by versifying them, has repeatedly withheld my
                  hand. – But for this subject, it will not be out of mind till I see how to cast it.</p>
