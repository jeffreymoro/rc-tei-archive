               <p>Thank you for your little volume.

                  </div> I received it yesterday evening. It was with pleasure that I saw it advertised, &amp;
                  with more pleasure that I saw it turn up among the contents of a heavy parcel. Have
                  I perused it with pleasure? both with as much pleasure &amp; as much pain as you have
                  wished to excite. And whether most to find fault with you for chusing such deeply
                  tragic subjects, or to praise you for the manner in which you have treated them I
                  know not.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">For the execution, it is not too much to say that you have become such a poetess as
               I believed &amp; hoped from the first. You have the ear &amp; the eye &amp; the heart of poetry,
               – &amp; you have them in perfection. Had this volume appeared thirty years ago, England
               would have rung from side to side with its praises. And gay as the flower market now
               is, take my word for it it will flourish when all the annuals of the season have faded.</p>

                  </div> would to my judgement, have <span class="strikethrough">been</span> made two poems with advantage. – The picture which is, like all your pictures, true,
                  &amp; finely coloured by itself; – but it is too chearful, too happy, for the tale which
                  follows

                  </div> – Your tragedy is always in the right tone, having with it the true &amp; only balm. Yet
                  it is too painful. I feel it to be so, &amp; in this respect I may judge of others by
                  myself. We are less able to bear these emotions as we advance in years. Youth courts
                  them, because youth has happiness as well as health &amp; spirits in excess. But at my
                  time of life, tranquillity is the treasure of &lt;the&gt; mind, – &amp; if it must be broken,
                  more willingly would I have it done by comedy or farce that makes the sides ache,
                  than by any thing which <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> excites a heartache for imaginary distress, – especially with such possible &amp; actual
                  scenes as that of your Editha,

                  </div> – perhaps the more painful to me because I have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">a daughter</a> of that name.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Give me I intreat you, a picture in summer &amp; sunshine, – a tale that in its progress
                  &amp; termination shall answer to the wishes of the reader. Make the creatures of your
                  imagination as happy as you would make them if they were real beings whose fortunes
                  depended upon your will. Your poem will then be read again &amp; again with delight. You
                  will please more readers, &amp; please them more. It is a road to popular favour which
                  has not been tried in this country, &amp; it is a sure one. Goethe &amp; Voss have found it
                  so in Germany. And I speak sincerely when I <span class="strikethrough">say that</span> express my belief that you can produce as fine a poem as the Herman &amp; Dorothea, or
                  the Luise.

                  </div> – which is throughout in a fine tone both of feeling &amp; versification. At P. 95 you
                  should have written ‘<span class="ital">ignes fatui</span>’, – but marsh-fires would <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;be&gt; better, if the word marshes did not occur in the next line.
