                  </div> passes is this: if it be of a nature that the bookseller thinks worth a moment’s consideration,
                  he requests some other author of whose judgment he happens to think well to look at
                  it (sometimes the most incompetent person in the world) and acts upon his opinion.
                  The recommendation of one who is a friend of the writer goes for nothing. If you have
                  any friend in London to whom you can entrust this sort of commission, let him take
                  the manuscript to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a>, or any other respectable publisher, &amp; ask as speedy an answer as may be convenient.
                  If you have not, &amp; the manuscript is in your own writing, a more summary way may be
                  to have the first sheet printed in Dublin – for a sheet will be as sufficient a sample
                  as a volume. The idlest person to whom it may be referred will glance over it, – whereas
                  a manuscript if not very legibly written is always regarded with some degree of dismay.
                  You can then enclose your sample in a frank to the publisher-elect, who may then very
                  likely form his own opinion – &amp; is in good manners bound to deliver it without delay.
                  The time and trouble which this method will save, I should think worth the cost. If
                  the bookseller declines the undertaking, you can try others. ... I like a book in
                  which the writer shows himself to be what he is, &amp; is not ashamed of a little honest
                  egotism. Do not expect too much from it. Public opinion is as little to be relied
                  on in such things as the wind and weather in this uncertain climate. And no author
                  who knows what the public is, and by what mere caprice it is determined to the right
                  or left, will either be elated by success or dispirited by failure. … <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">My little boy</a> is in the honey-moon of puerile happiness, having just put on that fashion of apparel
