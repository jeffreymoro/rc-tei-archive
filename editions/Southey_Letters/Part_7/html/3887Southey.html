                  circumstances suited. But my own conviction is that I am best where I am. I do not
                  think that the QR. would be offered to me in case of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</a> withdrawing. He as well as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> would think me an impracticalable person, which in certain points most certainly I
                  should prove: for as I would suffer nothing to appear in the journal of which I should
                  be ashamed, or which I could not in principle maintain, I should have to turn out
                  half the contributors, or make them conform to my notions of propriety &amp; justice.
                  Would the object be worth the trouble which it would involve me in, – or should I
                  be justified in sacrificing more time than I already do, to a perishable &amp; temporary
                  work? I think not. My wish would be that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</a> should succeed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>. He, I know, would conduct it in the same spirit, as I should do. If it fall into

               with pleasure, that I inscribe to your Majesty [George IV] a History of the most glorious
               war recorded in the British annals./When the Regency devolved into your hands, the
               fortunes of our allies were at their lowest ebb, and neither arts nor efforts were
               spared for making the spirit of this country sink with them. At that momentous crisis
               every thing depended, under Providence, upon your single determination; and to that
               determination Great Britain is beholden for its triumph, and Europe for its deliverance./To
               your Majesty, therefore, this faithful History is offered, as a portion of the tribute
               due to a just, magnanimous, and splendid reign, and as a proof of individual respect
               and gratitude from/Your Majesty’s/Most dutiful subject and servant,/ROBERT SOUTHEY.’
