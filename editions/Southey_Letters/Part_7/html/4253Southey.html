               of which he has plenty of merrymen to supply at half price. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">The Megistonos</a> is quite penny-wise &amp; pound-foolish enough for this. If there is an intentional incivility
               (&amp; of this there is certainly every appearance at this time) it is because he has
               played the tradesman with me in the most barefaced manner &amp; knows that I am perfectly
