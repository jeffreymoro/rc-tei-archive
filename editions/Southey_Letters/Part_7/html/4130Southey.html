               <p>I am the more vexed at not having seen you in Devonshire, because it has been in no
                  slight degree thro my own sin of omission that the disappointment has arisen. Having
                  a wide circuit to take in the western counties first &amp; then in Norfolk &amp; Suffolk,
                  it was necessary for me every where to fix the day of arrival &amp; departure. I counted
                  upon finding you at Exeter &amp; passing a few hours with you either on my way to Crediton
                  or on the day when I should leave that place &amp; take <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AclandThomasSir">Sir T. Aclands</a> on my return. To my great vexation M<sup>rs</sup> Keenan

               with letters upon all sorts of subjects, – in such numbers that I have now a portfolio

                  I learnt that she was no longer in that town, &amp; taking up a Leeds paper, saw there

                           is that Southey read this news in the Leeds Mercury of 8 November 1823, which also
                           announced Lydia Browne’s second marriage to John Addenbrooke (formerly Homfray) (1759–1837)
