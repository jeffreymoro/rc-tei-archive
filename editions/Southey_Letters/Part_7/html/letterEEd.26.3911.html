                           Olivarez’s Account of the War in Catalonia (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville,
                           1815; Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War (1816); and Memoirs of the Spanish

                           However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try
                           and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, The Collected Letters
