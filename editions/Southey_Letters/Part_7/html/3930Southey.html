               A strong possibility is Jane Webb, née Blackburne (1775–1860), the wife of William
               Webb and sister of Francis Blackburne (1782–1867; <em>DNB</em>).</p>

                  trouble &amp; no inconvenience. It is by procuring for me a book published at Rome in

                           the Societé des Illuminés d’Avignon, founded in 1786. The Society practised a mixture
                           of Freemasonry and mysticism. Southey had already discussed this subject in Letters
