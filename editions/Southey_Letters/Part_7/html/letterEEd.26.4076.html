                  It is very possible that we may arrive in London at night, this being a matter in
                  which we shall have no choice, but must take the chance of the road. As the time is
                  thus uncertain, so is the day, depending upon the weather. Rain may prevent us from
                  seeing some of the objects which we hope to visit. If all things prove favourable
                  we may sleep at Matlock on Saturday the 8<span class="strikethrough">xx</span> <sup>th</sup> pass the Sunday morning there, &amp; proceed <span class="strikethrough">after</span> in the afternoon to Derby. There we shall part with our fellow travellers,
