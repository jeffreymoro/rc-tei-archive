                  Hugh, the Earls foster-brother. Twelve years may be allowed to elapse, during which
                  the boy has grown wild, his guardian being always engaged in political turmoils, &amp;
                  the Priest an indulgent man: <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxx</span> The Earls heart is then brought home from the Holy Land to be <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> deposited in the same grave with his wife. And then an interval of seven or eight
                  years more, when the proper story of the poem commences – with a service for the souls
                  of the Earl &amp; his Wife. After the service Father Hugh takes the opportunity of mildly
                  lecturing <span class="strikethrough">Robin</span> the young Earl Robert, for his propensities to forest sports, &amp; inferior company,
                  &amp; his utter neglect of knightly accomplishments, – it having previously been shown
                  that this had arisen from his guardians constant absence, &amp; entire neglect. It appears
                  now that <span class="strikethrough">Ranulph xxx family</span> intention is to <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> bring about a marriage between Robert, &amp; his only <span class="strikethrough">dau</span> child Aveline. – But Aveline has already given her heart to Gilbert with the white
                  hand, a Squire of Low Degree, &amp; Robin as his comrades have from childhood called him
                  declares his determination never to marry any body but Maid Marian the Millers daughter.
                  Marian is a skylark, – &amp; Aveline a turtle dove. Gilbert of a gentle, poetical disposition,
