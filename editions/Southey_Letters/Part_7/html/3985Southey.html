                  I cannot set forth before the month of May,

                  This is vexatious on many accounts. It would have been very pleasant to me to have
                  travelled with you, – &amp; very desirable for me to have returned to this country before
                  the summer commences. – I hope you will halt with us by the way.</p>

                  you in it two or three years hence. I am not apprehensive that we shall be drawn into
                  a war, – the Cortes will most probably render that impossible by their own violence.

                  </div> – Yesterday I had a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteJosephBlanco">Blanco</a>, &amp; you may like to see his opinion upon the state of things in his own country. He
                  says “the prospects of Spain are, to me, more gloomy than ever. The invasion is unjustifiable,
                  while the Constitution against which it is directed, is not capable of defence. There
                  is nothing to stop the French army, if the soldiers do not mutiny against their leaders.
                  But what can prevent the <span class="ital">Radical</span> government from supporting a civil war, till every source of wealth is destroyed,
                  &amp; the whole country reduced to a state not unlike that of the neighbouring Africans?
                  As to the Army of the Faith,

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The difficulty is, not in establishing a better Government at Madrid, but in giving
                  it effect, &amp; in supporting it, – for it will be absolutely without resources. The
                  Cortes has only been supported for the last two years by the loans which it raised
                  here.

                  </div> As for the interference of France, if it could be effectual, it would be perfectly
