               they should? Would it not be preposterous to <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> suppose it?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This supposition therefore being proved to be absurd, which in mathematics is equal
                  to a demonstration that the contrary must be true, it remains <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> to enquire into the real origin of their stupendous qualities. Both the &lt;ancient&gt;
                  Heathens &amp; the Romanists <span class="strikethrough">believe</span> &lt;teach&gt; that certain Images of the Gods or of the Saints have been made without the

                  called such images Diopeteis, as having fallen from the sky, &amp; I could enumerate were
                  it needful sundry Catholic Images which are at this day venerated as being either
                  of angelic workmanship or celestial origin. We cannot however have recourse to this
                  solution in the present case; for Glover is so veracious a man that if he had found
                  these figures in his workshop without knowing how they came there, – or if he had
                  seen them grow into shape while he was looking on, – he would certainly not have concealed
                  a fact so extraordinary. All <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> &lt;would have known it. It must have become as notorious as Prince Hohenloe’s
