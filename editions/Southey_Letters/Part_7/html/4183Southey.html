               <p>In the evil habit of answering familiar letters without having them before me, I forgot
                  to notice your question respecting the nitrous oxyde; which however I should not have
                  done had the thing been as hopeful as you supposed it to be.

                           Institution in Bristol. See Thomas Beddoes, Notice of Some Observations Made at the
                           Medical Pneumatic Institution (Bristol and London, 1799), p. 11, where Southey’s reaction
                           to the inhalation is described thus: ‘For many hours after this experiment, he imagined
                           that his taste and smell were more acute, and is certain that he felt unusually strong
                           and cheerful. In a second experiment, he felt pleasure still superior – and has since
                           poetically remarked, that he supposes the atmosphere of the highest of all poss…</span></div>
                  </div> What I said was simply this, that the excitement produced by the inhalation was not
                  followed by any consequent debility or exhaustion; on the contrary that it appeared
                  to quicken all the senses during the remainder of the day. – One case occurred in
                  which the gas seemed to produce a good effect upon a palsied patient.
