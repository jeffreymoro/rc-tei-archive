               <div class="salute">My dear R.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am carrying on an active peninsular correspondence with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Freres brother</a>, who was with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">him</a> in Spain, &amp; at one time supplied his place there.

                           (1823–1832).</span></div>
                  </div> It is of more use to me than whole packets of official papers. By asking questions
                  concerning men &amp; things, &amp; setting his recollection to work, I get at those master
                  facts by which difficulties are unlocked.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The new system in the public offices of promoting men by merit &amp; not according to
               seniority, seems to me just so much patronage given to the heads of those departments,
               – a measure sure always to produce a feeling of injustice, &amp; in most cases no doubt
               with good reason. The principle of regular succession is one which satisfies every
               body, – they know what they have to expect when they enter the office, &amp; go on contentedly.</p>

               <p>I am glad for his own sake that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> is in office, but I do not anticipate any accession of strength or popularity to the
                  Government, from its alliance with the Grenvilles

                           January 1822. Several Grenvillites achieved office. Wynn joined the Cabinet and became

                           arming local men at his own expense to guard Ardfinnan bridge. He concluded the letter:
