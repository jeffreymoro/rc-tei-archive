                  with the booksellers is not very frequent. But this parcel has been a fortnight longer
                  than it should have been, on the way, owing I suppose to the accumulation of packages
                  in the warehouse during the continuance of snow. The panegyrical Elegy

                  matter of perfect indifference. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ShelleyPercyBysshe">Shelleys</a> is a flagitious history, and by far the worst tragedy in real life which has ever
                  fallen within my knowledge. As I told him myself in the last communication I had with
                  him, it is truly the Atheist’s Tragedy.
