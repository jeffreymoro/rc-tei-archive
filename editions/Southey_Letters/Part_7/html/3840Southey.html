                  than the descriptive and sentimental parts. In the reasoning ones you sometimes appear
                  to me to have fallen into <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd’s</a> prosing vein. The verse, indeed, is better than his, but the matter sometimes (though
                  rarely) like much of his latter compositions, incapable of deriving any advantage
                  from metre. The seventh stanza

                  </div> is the strongest example of this. On the other hand, this is well compensated by many
                  rich passages, and a frequent felicity of expression.</p>

                  that no other individual ever occasioned so much wretchedness and evil as the direct

                  him in it condemn it without reserve. That war in its progress and consequences has
                  not cost so little as a million of lives, and the account is far from being closed.</p>

               <p>You will not like Bonaparte the better, perhaps, if I confess to you that, had it

                  the unlawfulness of war, in its full extent. But when I saw that he was endeavouring
                  to establish a military despotism throughout Europe, which, if not successfully withstood
                  abroad, must at last have reached us upon our own shores, I considered him as a Philistine,
                  or a heathen, and went for doctrines, applicable to the times, to the books of Judges
                  and of Maccabees.
