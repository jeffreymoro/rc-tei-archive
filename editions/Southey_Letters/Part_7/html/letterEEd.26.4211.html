            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Since I wrote last I have been &amp; indeed continue to be on the sick list. My annual
               catarrh has settled into a cough, which tho in itself not very troublesome, lies deep,
               &amp; is accompanied with a feverish pulse. In this state it has been for some six weeks,
               &amp; what with starving, want of exercise when the catarrh made me incapable of bearing
               the light, &amp; physicking, it will I fear be more than tonics are able to do (when I
               can venture to take them), to bring me into condition again this season. – Your appearance
               would do me more good than any thing else. What I told you respecting as the French
               would say, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswicks</a> being brought one night nearer to London, relates to the journey up: The mail which
               used to arrive in town about six in the morning arriving now between nine &amp; ten at
               night. If you wish to escape a night on the road in coming down you should take the
               day coach to Grantham, or Stamford: but then there is the chance of not finding a
               place next morning in the Carlisle Mail. – When you reach Penrith, you will find a
               Mail Coach starting from thence for Whitehaven; which will give you time to wash,
               shave &amp; breakfast, &amp; deposit you here a little before twelve o clock.</p>
