                           in Portugal, this was to Southey ‘a moral fault, as well as a political error.’</span></div>
                  </div> I am glad of this disclaimer, as it shows that the justice of the censure is felt.
                  There is no person whom, judging from his official correspondence, I am led to respect
                  more highly that Sir Hew. One of the few facts which I deemed it expedient to withhold
                  from this generation is one which would have shewn how entirely &amp; scandalously he
                  was left to act without instructions in the first communications with the Spaniards.
