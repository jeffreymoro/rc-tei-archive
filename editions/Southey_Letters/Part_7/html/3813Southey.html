               <p>I can tell you now thank God that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">your godson</a> appears to be perfectly recovered, – which till to day I could not have said. He had
                  a bilious remittent fever upon him for about ten days; &amp; tho at no time in what is
                  called danger, you very well know, how soon such a disease might have taken an alarming
                  form, – especially when typhus is prevalent, as it is in these parts. I am not the
                  better for this anxiety. This corporal tenement of mine is not in the best condition;
                  it has begun to feel the effect of time in more ways than one. – I am going to Rydal
                  for two or three days, for the sake of change. I should be glad now if I kept a carriage,
                  but that I shall never do. A long walk I dare not venture on, – not for want of strength,
                  or inclination, but because of an infirmity which makes a short one inconvenient,
                  &amp; must end in disabling me from <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> exercise.
