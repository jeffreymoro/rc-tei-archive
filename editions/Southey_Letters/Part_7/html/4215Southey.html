               <p>When <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> settled at Bristol she brought with her a proud contempt for Bristol society. In fact
                  she had scarcely any acquaintances there, &amp; seldom saw any company, except when <span class="strikethrough">the</span> some of her Bath friends came to Clifton for the summer, or when the players took

                  delight which I have had in seeing him perform, &amp; hardly less was that which I have
                  felt in listening to his conversation. The days when he dined with us were almost
                  our only gala days. At such times – &amp; when she went out, her appearance &amp; manners <span class="strikethrough">wh</span> were those of a woman who had been bred in the best society &amp; was equal to it: but <span class="strikethrough">her way of life was as singular as it was uncomfortable, &amp;</span> if any stranger or visitor had caught her in her ordinary apparel she would have been
                  as much confused as Diana when Actaeon came upon her bathing place,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                           as Diana), while she was bathing. She turned him into a deer and he was killed by
                           his own dogs.</span></div>
                  </div> – &amp; almost with as much reason: for she was always in a bedgown, &amp; in rags. Most people
                  I suspect have a weakness for old shoes: ease &amp; comfort &amp; <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;one’s own&gt; fire side are connected with them in fact <span class="strikethrough">one</span> we never feel any regard for shoes till they attain to the privilege of age<span class="strikethrough">x</span> &amp; then they became almost as much a part of the &lt;wearer&gt; as his corns. This sort of
                  feeling <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my aunt</a> extended to old clothes of every kind, the older &amp; the raggeder they <span class="strikethrough">became</span> &lt;grew), the more unwilling she was to cast them off. But she was scrupulously clean
                  &lt;in them&gt; indeed the principle upon which her whole household oeconomy was directed
                  was that of keeping the house clean, &amp; taking more precautions against dust, than
                  would have been needful against the plague in an infected city. She laboured under
                  a perpetual <span class="ital">dustophobia</span>, &amp; a comical disease it was, but whether I have been most amused or annoyed by it,
                  it would be difficult to say. I had however in its consequences an early lesson how
                  fearfully the mind may be enslaved by indulging its own peculiarities &amp; whimsies,
                  innocent as they may appear at first.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The discomfort which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tylers</a> passion for cleanliness produced to herself as well as to her little household was
               truly curious: to herself indeed it was a perpetual torment, to <span class="strikethrough">me &amp;</span> the two servants a perpetual vexation, <span class="strikethrough">except when</span> &amp; so it would have been to me if Nature had not blest me with an innate hilarity
               of spirit which nothing but real affliction can overcome. That the better rooms might
               be kept clean, she took possession of the kitchen, sending the servants to one which
               was underground; &amp; in this little &lt;dark confined&gt; room with a stone floor, &amp; a skylight
               &lt;(for it must not be supposed that it was a best kitchen which was always as it was
               intended to be a comfortable sitting room. This was more like a scullery)&gt; we <span class="strikethrough">ate &amp; lived always</span> took our meals, &amp; generally lived. The best room was never opened but for company,
               except now &amp; then on a fine day to be aired, &amp; dusted, if dust could be detected there.
               In the other parlour I was allowed sometimes to read, &amp; she wrote her letters, – for
               she had many correspondents; &amp; we sate there sometimes in summer, when a fire was
               not needed, for fire produced ashes, &amp; ashes occasioned dust, &amp; dust visible or invisible
               was the plague of her life. I have seen her order the tea kettle to be emptied &amp; refilled,
               because some one had past across the hearth while it was on the fire, preparing for
               her breakfast. She had indulged these humours till she had formed for herself notions
               of uncleanness almost as irrational &amp; as inconvenient as those of the Hindoos. She
               had a cup once buried for six week to purify it from the lips of one whom she considered
               unclean; – <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> all who were not her favourites were included in that class. A chair in which an
               unclean person had sate was put out in the garden to be aired; &amp; I never saw her more
               annoyed than when a man who called upon business once sate down in her own chair;
               how the leather cushion was ever &lt;again&gt; to be <span class="strikethrough">purified she knew not</span> rendered fit for her use, she knew not. On such occasions her <span class="strikethrough">sha</span> fine features assumed <span class="strikethrough">an expression</span> &lt;a character&gt; either fierce or tragic, her expressions were vehement <span class="strikethrough">almost</span> &lt;even&gt; to irreverence, – &amp; her <span class="strikethrough">gestilucat</span> gesticulations those of the deepest distress – hands &amp; eyes uplifted as if she were
               in hopeless misery, or a paroxysm of mental <span class="strikethrough">agony</span> anguish.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As there are none who like to be upon ill terms with themselves, – most people find
               out some device &lt;whereby they are&gt; <span class="strikethrough">for</span> reconciled <span class="strikethrough">themselves</span> to their own faults: <span class="strikethrough">my</span> &lt;&amp; in this propensity it is that much of the irreligion in the world, &amp; much of its
               false philosophy have originated. My&gt; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Aunt</a> used frequently to say that all good natured people were fools; <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> Hers was a violent temper rather an ill one; there was a great deal of kindness in
               it, <span class="strikethrough">but</span> &lt;tho&gt; it was under no restraint. She was <span class="strikethrough">in fact</span> at once tyrannical &amp; indulgent to her servants, &amp; they usually remained in her service
               a long while partly I believe from fear, &amp; partly from liking; – from liking, because
               she sent them often to the play, (which is probably to <span class="strikethrough">them as</span> &lt;persons in that condition <span class="strikethrough">like</span>, as it is&gt; to children the <span class="strikethrough">greatest of all</span> most delightful of all amusements) – &amp; conversed with them much more than <span class="strikethrough">was</span> is usual for persons in her rank of life. Her habits were so peculiar that the servants
               became in a certain degree her confidants; she therefore was afraid to change them,
               &amp; they even when they wished to leave her were actually afraid to express the wish,
               knowing that she would regard it as a grievous offence, &amp; dreading the storm of anger
               which it would produce. Two servants at different times left her for the sake of marrying:
               &amp; tho they had both lived with her many years, she never forgave either <span class="strikethrough">of them</span>, nor ever spoke of them without some expression of bitterness. I believe no daughter
               was ever more afraid of disclosing a clandestine marriage to a severe parent, than
               both these women were of making their intention known to their mistress: such was
               the ascendency that she possessed over them. She had reconciled herself to the indulgence
               of <span class="strikethrough">this</span> &lt;her&gt; ungoverned &lt;anger&gt; <span class="strikethrough">temper</span>, by supposing that <span class="strikethrough">it</span> &lt;a bad temper&gt; was naturally connected with a good understanding &amp; a commanding mind:
               <span class="strikethrough">&amp; one of her favourite remarks was that all good natured people were fools.</span></p>
            <p class="indent1">Besides her servants there were two persons over whom she had acquired the most <span class="strikethrough">compleat</span> &lt;absolute&gt; controul. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</a> was the one, a more compleat example could never be found of that magic which a strong
               mind exercises over a weak one. The influence which she <span class="strikethrough">exercised</span> &lt;possessed&gt; over <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> was equally unbounded &amp; more continual, but otherwise to be explained. It was the
               ascendency of a determined &amp; violent spirit over a gentle &amp; yielding one. There was
               a difference of twelve years between their ages, &amp; the authority which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a> had first exerted as an elder sister, she never relaxed. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My Mother</a> was one of those few persons &lt;(for a few such there are)&gt; who think too humbly of
               themselves, – <span class="strikethrough">there are such &amp; they are very few</span>. Her only fault was that of yielding <span class="strikethrough">to</span> submissively to this imperious sister <span class="strikethrough">against</span> to the sacrifice of her own inclination &amp; judgement, &amp; sense of what was right. She
               had <span class="strikethrough">been bred up in fear &amp; awe</span> &lt;grown up in awe &amp; admiration&gt; of her, as one who moved in a superior rank &amp; &lt;with
               the advantage of a fine form &amp; beautiful person&gt; possessed a superior understanding;
               withal she loved her with a true sisterly affection which nothing could diminish.
               But never did I know one person so entirely subjected to another, &amp; never have I regretted
               any thing so deeply as that <span class="strikethrough">submission</span> &lt;subjection&gt;, which most certainly in its consequence shortened her life</p>
            <p class="indent1">If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> had not been disfigured by the small pox the two sisters would have strikingly resembled
               each other except in complection, my mother being remarkably fair. The expression
               however of the &lt;two&gt; countenances was as <span class="strikethrough">dif</span> opposite as the features were alike, &amp; the difference in disposition was not less
               marked. Take her for all in all I do not believe that any human being ever brought
               into the world &amp; carried <span class="strikethrough">out</span> thro it a larger portion of original goodness than <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my dear Mother</a>. <span class="strikethrough">She</span> Every body who knew her loved her, for she seemed made to be happy herself – &amp; to
               make every one happy within her little sphere. Her understanding was as good as her
               heart, – it is from her that that I have inherited that alertness of mind &amp; quickness
               of apprehension, without which it would have been impossible for me to have undertaken
               half of what I have performed. God never blessed a human creature with a more chearful
               disposition, a more generous spirit, a sweeter temper, or a tenderer heart. I remember
               that when first I understood what death was, &amp; began to think <span class="strikethrough">it</span> of it, the most fearful thought it induced was that of losing <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a>, – <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> it seemed to me more than I could bear, &amp; I used to hope that I might die before
               her. Nature is merciful to us. We learn gradually that we are to die, – &lt;a knowledge&gt;
               which if it came suddenly upon us in riper age would be more than the mind could endure:
               we are gradually prepared for <span class="strikethrough">death</span> &lt;our departure&gt; by seeing the objects of our first &amp; deepest affections go before
               us; &amp; even if no keener afflictions are dispensed to wean us from this world, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">place</span> &lt;remove&gt; our tenderest thoughts &amp; dearest hopes to another, mere age brings with
               it a weariness of life till death becomes to the old as natural &amp; desirable as sleep
               to a tired child.</p>

Shad, as we called him was just my own age &amp; had been taken into
                  her service soon after she settled in Bristol. He was a good natured, active, handy
