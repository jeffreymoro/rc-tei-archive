ALS; 9p. <br> Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), III, pp. 417–424.<br> Note on MS: The letter survives in three versions, two in Southey’s hand. Our copy
               text is taken from the version Southey sent to Edith May, now British Library, Add
               MS 47888. A second autograph, fair copy version, with variants from the British Library
               text, is in Bristol Reference Library, MS B19266. A third copy in another hand (probably
               Edith May’s) is held by Keswick Museum and Art Gallery (KESMG 192/ WC 243) and was
               possibly made from the original letter sent to Edith May (now Add MS 47888). The version
               in Add MS 47888 was originally accompanied by an enclosure that gave the punch line
               to the extended joke. The enclosure contained a small picture of a heraldic lion,
               salient, facing left, in a wrapper on which was written ‘Not to be opened till the
               Letter has been read, on pain of excommunication, &amp; my heaviest displeasure.’ The
               wrapper remains with the manuscript but the enclosure has been lost. The fair copy
               at Bristol Record Office lacks the enclosure and the wrapper. However, the version
               at Keswick includes a copy of the enclosure and its wrapper.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
