               <p>I thought I had told you that as my journey had been so long delayed I should probably
                  put it off till the autumn, when I could take up <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</a> with me to pay her promised visits in the South. The 16<sup>th</sup> sheet of my second vol. of this B of the Ch. is on the table, – but I have still three
                  Chapters to write:

                  </div> &amp; certain it is, whatever may be the cause that I have not the same alacrity in writing
                  as when I was younger. The cold which <span class="strikethrough">seizes</span> &lt;fastens upon&gt; me every year at this season sometimes disables, &amp; more often indisposes
                  me for employment. And the only remedy is in a continued course of exercise, – occasioning
                  an expense of time which I can very ill afford.</p>

I can hardly escape a visit thither this year, but I should much rather make it
                  at any other time than when he is there.
