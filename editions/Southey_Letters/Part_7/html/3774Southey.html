            <p>MS: MS has not survived; text taken from <em>Courier</em>, 11 January 1822.<br/> Previously published: <em>Courier</em>, 11 January 1822; Robert Southey, <em>Essays, Moral and Political</em>, 2 vols (London, 1832), II, pp. 191–196; and Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), V, pp. 349–354. In addition to these versions authorised
               by either Southey or his estate, the letter was widely reprinted in Southey’s lifetime
               without his permission. For example, George Clinton, <em>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Lord Byron</em> (London, 1828), pp. 479–482; <em>The Poetical Works of Robert Southey, complete in one volume</em> (Paris, 1829), pp. xv–xvii; <em>The Complete Works of Lord Byron, including his supressed poems</em> (Paris, 1833), IV, pp. 507–508 [in part].<br/> Note on MS: Three autograph drafts of this letter survive: one, dated 5 January 1822,
               in the National Library of Scotland, MS 42552; and two, both undated, in the Huntington
               Library, HM6655. Their texts are reproduced in Appendix 3.</p>

               action against those who issued pirated, cheaper versions, ironically enough because
               the <em>Wat Tyler</em> case brought by Southey in 1817 had shown that copyright could not be enforced unless
               a work was proved not to be seditious or blasphemous.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note21_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
