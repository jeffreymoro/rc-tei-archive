            <p>MS: Pforzheimer Collection, New York Public Library, Misc MS 3795. ALS; 2p.<br> Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), III, pp. 197–198 [misdated ‘July 1820’].<br> Dating note: Dating from content. Southey refers to the month of May being over and
               that he had received John Hughes’s <em>Itinerary of Provence and the Rhone made during the year 1819 </em>(1822). As the book arrived in the same parcel as Washington Irving’s <em>Bracebridge Hall, or The Humorists. A Medley</em> (1822), which Southey thanked John Murray for on 29 June 1822 (Letter 3863), then
               this letter must have been written at some stage in June 1822.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I hope you are not in London during this delightful season, which is what summer used
               to me in old times. We had really an honest old English April this year, with sunshine
               &amp; warm showers; &amp; an honest old English May, such as to make the poetry of former
               days intelligible. You appear to hope that old English feelings may also be reviving.
               I wish they may, – but I confess that I cannot think so. There are so many disorganizing
               &amp; destroying principles at work, – that were it not for a reliance upon Providence,
               I should say neither the Church of England, nor the Monarchy would last another half
               century.</p>
