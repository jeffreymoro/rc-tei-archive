            <p>MS: Victoria University Library, Toronto, Coleridge Collection. ALS; 1p. (c).<br> Unpublished.<br> Dating note: Dating from content. <em>The Book of the Church</em> was published on 2 February 1824. Southey left London for Norwich on 23 January.
               This letter was probably written very shortly before his departure. He returned to
               London on 5 February; see Robert Southey to Nicholas Lightfoot, 18 February 1824 (Letter
               4136).</p>
