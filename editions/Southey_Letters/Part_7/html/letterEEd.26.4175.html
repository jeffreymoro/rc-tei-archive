                  manner that the grand alliance is not at an end, – by sending you back the substance
                  of your own lines in another form.

                  </div> You shall see them taken up &amp; recast when the first canto is finished, – but I will
                  not delay telling you that you must not be disheartened, because you have failed to
                  satisfy yourself with your first lesson in a new stile of art. It is what would happen
                  to you in music, or in painting. That it is difficult to fall into this mode of versification
                  I believe because you find it so, &amp; because one other person who tho not like yourself
                  a poet in heart &amp; soul, rhymes with sufficient ease &amp; dexterity, made an attempt &amp;
                  failed in it.

                  </div> But that it of all modes the easiest when once acquired I am perfectly certain &amp; so
                  you will find it. But rather than break the alliance, we would turn it into rhyme.
                  This will not be required.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You have only to learn what the simple principles are upon which these lines are constructed,
               – perhaps they may be reduced to their simple &amp; single one, that every line should
               in itself be a compleat verse, – a rule which, in the ordinary heroic cadence, would
               admit lines of four, six eight &amp; ten syllables. That cadence (the Iambic, – that is
               to say the short syllable followed by the long – for example</p><br><p class="indent3">What h<span class="ital">ear</span>t is f<span class="ital">irm</span>, what <span class="ital">na</span>ture <span class="ital">so</span> sev<span class="ital">ere</span></p><br><div class="wrapper">
               <p>should not be mixed with a different one (the trochaic, which is long &amp; short, – nor
                  the galloping ones <span class="strikethrough">of three syllable</span> with one accent in three syllables) – in the same sentence, unless for the sake of
                  producing a peculiar &amp; designed effect. And there they must &lt;be&gt; blended, – as you
                  shade colours into each other in your landscapes. Look at some of my Minor Poems,
                  &amp; at parts of Thalaba,

                  </div> &amp; you will see what experiments I have made in this way. – I wish I were with you.
                  I would teach you as boys are taught to compose Latin verses, by making them write
                  mere nonsense till they learn the tune &amp; the mechanism of the metre.</p>
