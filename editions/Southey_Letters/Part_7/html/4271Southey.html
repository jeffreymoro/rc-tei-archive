                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Davies Gilbert (1767–1839; DNB), Cornish engineer, antiquarian and MP for Helston
                           1804–1806, Bodmin 1806–1832. Gilbert was a friend of Thomas Beddoes and early patron
                           of Humphry Davy. His ‘brother-in-law’ was probably John Lewis Guillemard (1764–1844).
                           In 1804 he married Mary Philippa Gilbert (1769–1850), sister of Davies Gilbert. Guillemard
                           was part of a well-known family of Huguenot silk-weavers and an active member of many
                           learned societies, including the Royal Society, the Royal Geographical Society and
                           the Royal Institution, of which he was Secretary 1811–1813.</span></div>
                  </div> to whom I had given a letter of introduction to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a>, – little apprehending in what state it would find him. The tenour of your letter
                  leaves me very little hope, – tho some there is, from the strength of constitution
                  which he has shewn, &amp; from the uncertain nature of the disease. You had not told me
                  of the apoplectic <span class="strikethrough">symptom</span> attack.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">There are many things worse than death. Indeed I should think any reasonable person
               would prefer it to old age if he did not feel that the prolongation of his life was
               desirable for the sake of others, whatever it might be for himself. If the event be
               dreaded, the sooner it is over the better, if it be desired, the sooner it comes;
               – &amp; desired or dreaded it must be. If there were a Balloon-Diligence to the other
               world, I think it would always be filled with passengers. You will not suppose from
               this that I am weary of life, blest with enjoyments as I am, &amp; full of employment.
               But if it were possible for me (which it is not) to regard myself alone, I would rather
               begin my travels in eternity than abide longer in a world, <span class="strikethrough">where</span> in which I have much to do, &amp; little to hope.</p>
