            <p class="indent1">I am much obliged to you for your letter. There is a satisfaction in knowing the whole
               on these mournful occasions, &amp; there is a comfort also, – when the circumstances as
               in this case, are such as to have mitigated, in all that is possible, – the severest
               of all afflictions. – I am old enough never to enter upon a new year without an aweful
               sense of the uncertainty of life, – &amp; a fear of what it may take from me &lt;in its course&gt;.
               Last year deprived me of my poor fellow traveller <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a>, who was half domesticated with us; – &amp; of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BrowneWade">your excellent father</a>, for whom I had a most sincere respect &amp; regard, &amp; whose hospitable house I hoped
               often to have revisited. These are serious losses. At my age new friends are rarely
               made, – &amp; there is hardly life enough before me for them to become old ones.</p>

                  is not perhaps to be accounted a misfortune, if it has saved him from the risque of
                  a voyage in this tempestuous &amp; most perilous season. His travels have been more interesting
                  than if he had pursued the course which he had purposed. They have led him among stranger
                  people, &amp; thro countries which are much less generally known. I shall be glad to hear

                           had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’
                           Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had

                  </div> There is some satisfaction in knowing that a letter published thro that channel finds
                  its way to all whom one wishes to see it. I am sure you know my temper well enough
                  to believe that it has not been disturbed on this occasion. In fact I never let my
                  family know the provocation which had been given me, till my letter had been written,
                  sent over to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Wordsworth</a> for his inspection &amp; opinion, &amp; transcribed for transmission to the Courier. I hate
                  controversial writing because it is a waste of time, not because it <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> can in any way disquiet me. And in this instance <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</a> impudent abuse would have past without notice from me, if there had not been a direct
                  charge of slander which required a direct denial, &amp; which gave me an opportunity of
                  again holding up <span class="strikethrough">him</span> to public view the abominable tendency &amp; purport of his works. This I have reason
                  to believe has not been without some effect. And I have no wish to pursue the subject
                  farther. Indeed he has now thrown off the mask &amp; made so open an avowal of the vilest
                  principles both moral &amp; religious, that the well-meaning part of the world will <span class="strikethrough">be</span> need no &lt;farther&gt; warning against those of his works in which the poison is covertly
