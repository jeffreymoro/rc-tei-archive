                  which she has never bestowed upon me; tho perhaps the uncommon richness &amp; even exuberance

               In your case, there is a smile which plays about her towse, &amp; the look belies the

                  </div> found himself in bad odour, thro the prejudice which these very conceited &amp; extravagant
                  letters had excited. But it is a very odd book, as well as a most impudent one, &amp;
                  the most curious thing in it is a plan for improving the English language, by altering
                  its structure. For this purpose it was seriously proposed by the said Pinkerton that
                  the most learned men in the three kingdoms should incorporate themselves in an Academy,
                  publish a grammar &amp; dictionary of the improved English, &amp; use it themselves both in
                  writing &amp; discourse, thus asserting what he called their proper power over the mob,
                  till the revolution in our speech (for it was nothing less) should be compleatly effected.
                  The leading principles of his scheme were to get rid of all sounds which were unpleasing
                  to his ear, to throw away the consonant at the end of a certain class of words, add
                  his favourite vowel O to it in others, &amp; form the plural of all nouns in a. As a specimen

               <p>I mention it now, because I have compared the Pinkertonian Lingo with the Lingo-Grande;
                  &amp; it is surprizing how far below <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs Coleridge</a>, Pinkerton must be placed in this department of genius. For example, snuffers he
                  would call thea snuffera; with us they are snuffumpers. Candles he would ask for by
                  the name of thea candela; our inventress calls them candeels-candowls-candoals. He
                  would call the bells, thea bella, our bell is the bellabbity when we are told to twyke
                  it. A gig with him would be a giggo; here it is gidge, <span class="ital">euphoniea gratiâ</span>;

                  </div> &amp; in like manner bag, which he would make baggo, is softened into badje. Then how
                  poor are his doggo &amp; foggo when compared with our dogroggarum &amp; fogogrum or fogrogrum!
                  He would say spasmea for spasms, in our Lingo they are spaddelcoms. Lumbago he would
                  leave unchanged because it terminates in the vowel which he so greatly affects; but
                  here the word is ennobled into lumbaggarum whenever the inventress feels a pange resembling
                  it. Puddles he would call puddela; with us they are pulkers &amp; pillpulkers; &amp; if it
                  be a great, broad, sprawly, disagreeable pillpulker, then it is denominated a pulker-peeler.
                  What would Pinkerton make of thimble which could equal thimblumb, &amp; thimbōlion? And
                  what of that lower region, the seat of frequent aches, which could at once be so euphonious
                  &amp; delicate as belteerian? Here perhaps she would exclaim for forshammanum, if she
                  knew that I were writing that word; but how unjust should I be to her merits, were
                  I to omit it!</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The Pinkertonian scheme is inconvenient, as requiring perpetual attention to its principles;
               &amp; indeed I may venture to say, that it is impracticable because it requires a total,
               &amp; therefore an impossible change in <span class="strikethrough">our mother tongue</span> &lt;the language of the country.&gt; But the Lingo-grande is not liable to such objections.
               It does &lt;not&gt; propose to alter our dictionary, but to enlarge it: <span class="strikethrough">by</span> &lt;not to reconstruct our mother-tongue, but to adorn &amp; beautify it, – to&gt; enrich<span class="strikethrough">ing</span> it with <span class="strikethrough">adornments</span> &lt;graces&gt; &amp; elegancies of speech; – flowers, yea rather gems of language. The Pinkerton
               Lingo displays no invention: whereas this is eminently <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> distinguished by its inventiveness. When a word is wanted here, there is no tarrying
               for rule, or reason, etymology, or analogy. I do not mean to say that some remote
               analogy, – some recondite etymon, the germ, or seminal principle of the word may not
               sometimes be discovered; this is often the case, &amp; such vocables have a peculiar force;
               but quite as often &lt;the neologism, if I may so express myself,&gt; is fatherless &amp; motherless,
               <span class="strikethrough">to express myself more clearly by help of these metaphorical words</span>, – a clear case of equivocal generation, – an arbitrary sound, – a pure creation.
               Instances of both kinds will be found in the examples which I am about to adduce;
               – &amp; your discrimination will know how to distinguish them.</p>
            <p class="indent1">If the weather is ramping &amp; tearing, this great inventress &lt;complains of rampasity,
               &amp; says&gt; <span class="strikethrough">calls</span> it is a taarampeter of a day. Should one of the childereelions be <span class="strikethrough">pakum</span> poakun &amp; frumping &amp; rouking in a work-badje, she tells them not to be dabdobbering
               there, for it gives her a feeling of pōakãrōakãtur. &lt;Has she been in dull company?
               she describes the conversation of such stupossums as drigdraggery.&gt; A brook she calls
               the running splash. &lt;When she takes a dose of physic it is to give her constitution
               a jerk; &amp; if I sneeze in her presence, she declares that it makes all the addle come
               into her head.&gt; She objected to a new bonnet one day, as being glombollical. I could
               not ascertain in what glombollicality consists nor would she explain it to me. I believe
               it gratifies her when she perceives that I cannot penetrate into the signification
               of an uncommonly difficult neologism. She has left &lt;me&gt; till this hour entirely unable
               even to guess at what is meant by spackwhangular; &amp; if she does not accidentally betray
               the meaning, I verily <span class="strikethrough">believe</span> &lt;think&gt; I shall die in ignorance of it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Drote &amp; thrapple are the throat. The under jaw is called the under-jabbarum, <span class="ital">unde</span> jabbarumpeter one of the words for mouth (mouto in M<sup>r</sup> Pinkertons language.) &lt;By the bye she uses a tooth broom.&gt; The nose is poggarout.
               Stumper is the stomach: Cruppōkur, the part which is accommodated with a saddle when
               we ride. The feet are wattlykins, &amp; foottels-toottles, they are known also by other
               appellations, some diminutive &amp; endearing, others augumentative &amp; opprobrius which
               were noticed in my former letter. Every body else’s legs are legrums, if not hormangorgrums;
               but her own, for some reason which I cannot divine, she calls her inconveniences.
               I know that it was formerly deemed indelicate in Portugal to speak of <span class="strikethrough">them</span> legs by their own innocent name, &amp; they were called therefore in all polite circles,
               the walkers, or the goers; as in some parts of Germany a pettycoat used to be called
               a consideration, &amp; a pair of gouty shoes, a pair of Excellencies. One understand this,
               but I cannot comprehend why she should call her legs her inconveniences.</p>
