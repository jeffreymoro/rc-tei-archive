               de Olivarez’, <em>New Monthly Magazine</em>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <em>Account of the War in Catalonia</em>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <em>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</em> (1816); and <em>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of
                  Joseph Bonaparte</em> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray
               to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</em>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</em>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</em>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.
               Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <em>History of the Peninsular War</em> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Finally, Southey had sought
               the assistance of George Canning.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
