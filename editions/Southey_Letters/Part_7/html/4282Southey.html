            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>A sad account of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HughesMaryAnne">M<sup>rs</sup> Hughes</a> sent me about ten days ago is all I had heard of him since your former letter, till
                  that of to day arrived. It came originally from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">M<sup>rs</sup> Wynn</a>, – &amp; the inference I drew from it was that a paralytic stroke had deprived him of
                  his intellect. Had there been any better tidings I thought <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> himself would have communicated them, – but all I have seen of his handwriting for
                  some months has been upon your cover this day. What the ground is for hope I cannot
                  tell, as I am quite at a loss to guess even at the nature of the disease, – but it
                  is plain that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KiddJohn">Kidd</a> has hoped, – &amp; the <span class="ital">vis vitae</span>

                  </div> appears to have been unusually strong, that even on that ground hope may be entertained</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am convinced that both the will &amp; the power exist in the quarter where you &amp; I wish
                  to find them, &amp; might reasonably look for one &amp; expect to find the other. But I think
                  that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">he</a> is not fully aware of his own power, unless it be exerted in the immediate straight
                  course of office, &amp; that his will is palsied by a sort of indolence, – which makes
                  (or used to make) him always late upon a journey, or in whatever he had to do, – &amp;
                  always disposed rather to be doing anything else, than that which ought then to be
                  done. If this had not been the case, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> – whom it would always have been an honour to have preferred, would not have gone
                  without preferment so long, – nor have obtained so poor a preferment at last.

               <p>But the kindness of his heart &amp; the steadiness of his attachments are his own, – the
                  drawbacks are constitutional &amp; accidental: – a regular political life, to which he
                  has been trained from his youth up, tends to sear all feelings; – the statesmen of
                  this country are a bad <span class="ital">cast</span>e, &amp; of all that caste the Grenvilles are the coldest the proudest &amp; the most selfish.

               <p>His attachment to me I believe to be unabated, many as are the causes which might
                  have weakened or worn it out. Difference of rank &amp; circumstances I do not take into
                  the account, – because they existed at the beginning, far more than at present – when
                  I have won for myself (tho not a fortune) a station in society. But there is little
                  sympathy in our taste, &amp; in some of our opinions – the most decided opposition, –
                  &amp; that too upon <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> points to which he has pledged himself with most warmth: &amp; which I considerable as
                  demonstrably most perilous to the <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> vital interests of these kingdoms.
