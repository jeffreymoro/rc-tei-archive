                           3 (May 1818), 196–201. From this it was a short step to ‘King of Cockaigne’ as Cockaigne

               For example, in ‘To Mr. Leigh Hunt, King of the Cockneys’, <em>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</em>, 3 (May 1818), 196–201. From this it was a short step to ‘King of Cockaigne’ as Cockaigne
               was a medieval term for an imaginary land of luxury and idleness, such as London was

               of modern poetry, without naming any one poet. However, this was clearly a riposte
               to Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em> (1819), whose suppressed ‘Dedication’, mocking Southey, had circulated widely.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

Its author was John Taylor Coleridge.
               Byron’s mistaken belief that it had been written by Southey was publicised in Thomas
               Medwin (1788–1869; <em>DNB</em>), <em>Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron: Noted During a Residence with his Lordship
                  at Pisa, in the Years 1821 and 1822</em> (London, 1824), pp. 149–150. Byron lived in Pisa November 1821–August 1822, the period

               that ‘he will do none of the good he once hoped to do, nor yet have the bitter satisfaction

               and for his own sake it is to be hoped, moulder unknown in those which are to follow’.
               In his letter to Robert Gooch, 14 April 1813, Southey had described Hunt as ‘a man
               of good feelings, who was led astray by them, &amp; who was taking a course which would
               lead him irretrievably wrong’ and that ‘His opinions will become dead to him’ (<em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</em>, Letter 2247).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
