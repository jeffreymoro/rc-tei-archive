      <p>This appendix makes available annotated transcripts of three manuscripts relating
         to Southey’s letter to the Editor of the <em>Courier</em> (see Letter 3775), published in the <em>Courier</em> on 11 January 1822.</p>
      <p class="indent1">The first (3.1) is dated 5 January 1822 and is now in the Murray archive. Its text
         is very close to that published in the <em>Courier</em>. The second and third manuscripts (3.2.1 and 3.2.2) contain undated drafts of material
         for the letter and represent Southey’s work in progress.</p><br/><div class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">
