                  </div> which I received at a time when it was not possible to answer it; for from the time
                  you saw me till the middle of February I was perpetually engaged in travelling or
                  in society. During that course of locomotion your circular reached me, &amp; if I could
                  have written any thing for your well-intended volume, in any way tolerable, you should
                  have had it.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Montgomery sent a circular letter to over twenty leading writers, soliciting contributions
                           to The Chimney-Sweeper’s Friend, and Climbing Boy’s Album (1824), designed to draw
                           attention to the plight of young boys employed to climb chimneys to clear soot. Eight
                           writers contributed, including Bernard Barton, Allan Cunningham and others also known
                           to Southey.</span></div>
                  </div> But the truth is that from long disuse, I have lost all facility of writing upon occasional
                  subjects. – These matters premised, – now for the reason why I have neglected to write
                  to you ever since. It is not a very good one I confess, &amp; yet such as it is, it must
                  be told. Before I departed from London, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> sent me Prose by a Poet “from an Old Friend.”

                  </div> I meant to read it in the country, but when I packed up my boxes for exportation thither,
                  by some accident these volumes were left behind: they had as they were likely to do,
                  found readers, – &amp; it was not till the day before yesterday, that they found their
                  way to me in a box of varieties from the Great City. Meantime in daily expectation
                  of their arrival, I have waited week after week, not liking to thank you for them
                  till I could say that I had perused them with pleasure, – tho that I should peruse
                  any thing of yours with that feeling <span class="strikethrough">is what</span> might <span class="strikethrough">be</span> with the strictest truth have been said.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The poetry would have filiated itself; the prose might otherwise have puzzled me where
               to father it; tho there also I find a clue in the localities, &amp; in the first page
               of the second volume, which fixes the age of the writer to be within a few years of
               my own. With these indications, &amp; with the moral, political, &amp; religious features
               of the book, I could not long be at a loss where to look for the author. The title
               <span class="strikethrough">page</span> is quite appropriate, – none but a Poet could have written such prose.</p>
