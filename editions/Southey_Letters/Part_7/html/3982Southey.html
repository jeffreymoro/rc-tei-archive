                           Dorothy, née Spearman (dates unknown). Fenwick lived in Durham when Tom Southey farmed
                           in the county and was well known to Henry Herbert Southey. He was a wealthy local
                           radical. Whoever the Fenwicks were, Tom Southey owed them money and was seeking to

                  </div> – before he writes to you. I believe they are cherishing some expectations from that
                  quarter which are without any reasonable foundation. He talks of sailing from Maryport,
                  where it seems there are good opportunities of obtaining passage to Quebec, – &amp; of
                  taking his family at once, instead of going over to prepare for them, which he at
                  first intended. They calculate upon hospitality both at Quebec &amp; Montreal from her
                  relation Matthew Bell,

                  the point I will do all I can to assist. But I hold out no prospect of this at present,
                  because he would think that assistance might as well be bestowed in eking out his
                  income here, &amp; would make no effort at establishing his family <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> as long as it were possible to put off the evil day. Indeed he has often said, that
                  the great object for him is to <span class="ital">put on</span>; – which is only another phrase for <span class="ital">putting off</span>.</p>
