                  good spirits. I know not how he has managed to pick up a strong West-country pronunciation.
                  He talked very rationally concerning his own condition &amp; prospects &amp; what little he

                  just expired, &amp; he is in treaty for one at Cheltenham: if that fails he expects to

               Somerset, by his first marriage. The elder Edward Hill married, as his second wife,
               Margaret Bradford (1710–1782), the mother of Southey’s mother, Margaret Southey, and
               of his uncle, Herbert Hill. There was a severe family rift between the younger Edward
               Hill and his half-brother, Herbert Hill.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               source of the rumour that Hill had ‘left a family’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
