It mentioned Olivarez’s <em>Account of the War in Catalonia</em>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <em>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</em> (1816); and <em>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of
                  Joseph Bonaparte</em> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray
               to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</em>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</em>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</em>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.
               Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <em>History of the Peninsular War</em> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Finally, Southey had sought
               the assistance of George Canning. It is possible that this letter to Wynn was prompted
               by the news that the books could not be found at Madrid, and was accompanied by a
               note asking for a search to be made at Seville; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 9 May
