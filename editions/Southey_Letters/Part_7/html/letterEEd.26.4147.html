               University of Rochester, Robert Southey Papers A.S727. ALS; 1p.<br> Unpublished.<br> Note on correspondent and dating: as this letter asks for help in placing a student
               at the University of Cambridge and assumes knowledge of James Dusautoy, it was very
               probably written to Samuel Tillbrook, a Fellow of Peterhouse College, Cambridge, who
               had aided Dusautoy. Writing to Peter Elmsley on 3 April 1824 (Letter 4166), Southey
               stated he had ‘lately’ attempted to help James Dusautoy’s brother, so his letter to
               Tillbrook probably dates from c. March 1824.</p>
