               <p>Not seeing your name either in the debates or the divisions this session, I was afraid
                  to enquire the cause, till to my great joy I found that you had lately been present
                  at a public meeting. I did not know of your domestic affliction,

                           Wilberforce had temporarily retired from public life on the advice of his doctors,
                           though he started attending the House of Commons again in late March 1822 and spoke
                           on 1 April. Southey had probably seen an account of Wilberforce’s presence at a meeting
                           of the Friends of Ireland on 26 March 1822, ‘promoting the Education of the Native
                           Irish, through the medium of their own language’.</span></div>
                  </div> till I heard of it from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>. Such afflictions are not the heaviest with which we may be visited, inasmuch as
                  it is more tolerable to lose a child than to see one become miserable or unworthy:
                  but I believe that no other griefs are felt so keenly, or are so unmixed. There is
                  a wide difference between that fortitude which perhaps is natural to the heart of
                  man, &amp; that resignation which we know to be our duty, &amp; which brings with it consolation
                  &amp; hope. You my dear Sir know where the only balm is to be found.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I should hardly have intruded upon you now, if I had not felt a strong impulse to
                  address you upon a question on which I know what your sentiments must be, &amp; which

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Sir Alexander Boswell, 1st Baronet (1775–1822; DNB), Scottish poet, bibliophile and
                           MP for Plympton Erle 1816–1821, was mortally wounded on 26 March 1822 in a duel with
                           James Stuart (1775–1849; DNB), lawyer, journalist and Whig supporter. Boswell had
                           attacked Stuart vociferously in anonymous articles in the Tory newspaper the Glasgow
                           Sentinel (1821–1823).</span></div>
                  </div> has brought into full notice at this time. My own mind has long been made up upon
                  duelling. No provocation, &amp; no fear of man, or mans opinion, should ever make me accept
                  a challenge. I cannot however but think that is in the power of the legislature to
                  put an end to this absurd &amp; wicked practice; by <span class="strikethrough">throwing</span> placing such impediments in the way, &amp; affixing such penalties to it, as few persons
                  would be able to surmount, or would chuse to incur. The magistrates at present when
                  they suspect an intention of this kind, bind the parties over to keep the peace, –
                  within a certain district only, – the parties then have only to adjourn to the next
                  county. Why should they not be bound to keep the peace within his Majestys dominions?
                  Would not an act requiring the Magistrates to do this have the effect of preventing
                  the meeting altogether in many, or most cases?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You try the duellist for murder if he kills his opponent, – &amp; this is a mere mockery
               of law; no such case was contemplated by those who made the law against murder; neither
               judge nor jury will ever condemn upon such an indictment, nor if they did, would public
               opinion go with the sentence. <span class="strikethrough">Xxx</span> A punishment should be appointed which if it did not deter men from the offence,
               would be willingly inflicted by the courts of justice: – for instance a heavy fine
               for sending a challenge or endeavouring to provoke one; &amp; for the parties themselves,
               (if they went into the field,) &amp; their seconds, banishment for a certain term. I cannot
               but think that this should prove effectual. And that if you were to bring the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> matter forward, there would be a probability of immediate success, a <span class="ital">certainty</span> of eventually succeeding.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Windham would have defended this practise <span class="strikethrough">which</span> &lt;with&gt; that perverseness of intellect which made the noblest-minded man of his age
                  so often act in direct opposition to his own better feelings.

                  </div> It would come from you better than from any other person. I will not say that it would
