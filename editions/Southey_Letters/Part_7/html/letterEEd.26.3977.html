                  </div> In octavo they would not exceed six sheets, in duodecimo four would comprize them:
                  my guess must therefore be near the mark when I suppose that five &amp; twenty pounds
                  would cover the expences of 500 copies. – If you take the risk yourself, I am so well
                  aware how little sale there is for poetry upon the score of its intrinsic worth, that
                  I should advise half that number; – as for the purpose of feeling his way it is no
                  matter how small the edition is. I read his article with pleasure, tho without the
                  slightest suspicion of it being his. By all means keep that door open. Lord John Russels
