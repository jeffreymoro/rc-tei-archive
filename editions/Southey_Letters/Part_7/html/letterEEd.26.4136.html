                  on Thursday the 5<sup>th</sup>. in time to keep an engagement for dinner; went to Richmond on the Saturday, back
                  to London on the Tuesday following, on the Friday seated myself in the Carlisle mail,
                  &amp; on Sunday reached my own home in safety, after having been absent fifteen weeks,
                  &amp; travelled fifteen hundred miles. God be thanked I found all well, &amp; arrived in perfect

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This is the third day, &amp; I am not yet got fairly into joint. I was never before absent

                           22 April 1817 and did not return until 18 August 1817, making this absence slightly
                           longer than that of 3 November 1823 until 15 February 1824.</span></div>
                  </div> There is so much to do that I hardly know where to begin. The first business however
                  is to clear off heavy arrears of letter-writing, – for I have brought home with me
                  a huge pile of letters from all sorts of people upon all sorts of subjects: a whole
                  host of unknown persons seeming all perfectly to agree in supposing that I can have
                  no other earthly business than to attend to them &amp; their concerns.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">As yet I seem hardly awakened from a long dream. Already however the days appear to
               pass as rapidly, as they did slowly a week ago. The journey has been profitable in
               the best way; it has freshened old recollections, &amp; laid in store of new ones. And
               I can now retrace at leisure the scenes which I was too much hurried to enjoy thoroughly
               while they lasted. Crediton has left upon me a very lively &amp; very pleasing impression.
               A few names indeed have dropt thro the holes of a memory which begins to be the worse
               for the wear; – but every thing else is clear &amp; vivid. I have nowhere enjoyed myself
               more; nowhere seen a happier family, a happier man, – one who has more cause to be
               happy, or more deserves to be s[MS missing]</p>

                  were none whom he had paid so ill as myself. He admitted this to be the case.) And
                  if the Book should obtain a regular sale, as an essential part of English history,
                  nowhere else to be found in a connected narrative, or legible form, it may become
