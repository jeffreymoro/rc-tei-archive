                  with him, but once, which was many years ago, when he wrote to request that I would
                  lend him a portrait of myself to be engraved for his magazine, &amp; also communicate
                  to him some particulars of my life.

                           Part Four, Letter 2434. An engraving of Southey appeared, together with a ‘long Memoir’,
                           in Colburn’s New Monthly Magazine, 1 (January–July 1814), Frontispiece; 566–571.</span></div>
                  </div> It happened that a most methodistical mis-likeness of me had been exhibited some little
                  time before in the European Magazine,

                  </div> – &amp; as I was willing enough to supersede it by something better, I told <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColburnHenry">Colburn</a> where he might borrow a bust,

                  </div> which was the only satisfactory resemblance that existed: at the same time I stated
                  in as few words as possible the time &amp; place of my birth, &amp; the course of my education
                  saying that this would suffice for his purpose, &amp; that the public had no business
                  to expect any thing more in the way of memoirs while the subject in question was alive. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColburnHenry">M<sup>r</sup> Colburn</a> however was not satisfied with this. He borrowed the bust, &amp; got someone to attempt
                  the impossible task of making a portrait from it, which he engraved as an original
                  picture: – a miserable looking wretch it is, – something in physiognomy between assassin
                  &amp; hangman. And he produced a long memoir of my private life, evidently written by
                  some person who must once have been my guest, – or he could not have known so much,
                  – &amp; yet <span class="strikethrough">could</span> had been in no degree intimately acquainted with me, – or he could not have made so
                  many grossly erroneous statements. Of course I thought myself ill used, but this sort
                  of usage is too common to excite either surprize or anger.</p>

                  in need of no such interference. There has been but one opinion of all <span class="strikethrough">the books which you have published</span> &lt;your writings&gt;, &amp; they are of a character always to excite as much interest as when

               <p>As to the form of publication, booksellers ought to be the best advisors. To me the
                  common octavo is the least agreable form in which a book can appear, as being too
                  large to be held conveniently in the hand, &amp; yet not large enough to require a table.
                  The crown octavo is a much pleasanter size; but I believe the other is the more economical
                  way of printing. In either shape two duodecimos <span class="strikethrough">volumes</span> may very well be comprised in one volume. – When the Works are published
