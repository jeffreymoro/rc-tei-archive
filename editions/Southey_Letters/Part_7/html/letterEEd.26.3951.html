            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My earliest dreams of authorship were, as you might anticipate from such circumstances,
               of a dramatic form, &amp; the notion which I formed of dramatic composition was not inaccurate.
               It is the easiest thing in the world to write a play! said I to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</a>, as we were in a carriage on Redclift Hill, one day, returning from Bristol to Bedminster.
               Is it my dear? was her reply. Yes, I pursued, for you know you have only to think
               what you would say if you were in the place of the characters, &amp; to make them say
               it. This brings to mind some unlucky illustrations which I made use of about the same
               time, to the same Lady, with the view of enforcing what I thought good &amp; considerate
               advice. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</a> was visiting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> at Bedminster: they had fallen out, as they sometimes would do, &amp; these bickerings
               produced a fit of sullenness in the former, which lasted some days, &amp; while it lasted
               she usually sate with her apron over her face. I really thought she would hurt her
               eyes by this, &amp; told her so, in great kindness – for you know <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</a> said I, that everything gets out of order if it is not used. A book which is never
               opened will become damp &amp; mouldy, – &amp; a key if it is never turned in the lock gets
               rusty, just when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> entered the room, – Lord, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a>, said the offended Lady, what do you think this child has been saying? he has been
               comparing my eyes to a rusty key &amp; a mouldy book! – The speech however was not without
               some good effect, for it restored good humour. Miss Palmer was an odd woman with a
               kind heart, – one of those persons who are not respected so much as they deserve,
               because their dispositions are better than their understanding. She had a most generous
               &amp; devoted attachment to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a>, which was not always requited as it ought to have been. The earliest dream which
               I can remember related to her, &amp; it was singular enough to impress itself indelibly
               in my memory. I thought I was sitting with her in her drawing room (- chairs, carpet
               &amp; every thing are now vividly present to my minds eye) when the Devil was introduced
               as a morning visitor Such an appearance, – for he was in his full costume of horns,
               black-bat-wings, tail &amp; cloven feet, – put me in ghostly &amp; bodily fear; – but she
               received him with perfect politeness, called him Dear M<sup>r</sup> Devil, desired the servant to put him a chair, &amp; expressed her delight at being favoured

                  </div> – who ever laid hand on me in anger. At home too <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my Father</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">my Uncle Thomas</a> used to shake their heads at me, &amp; pronounce that I never should write a decent hand.
                  The cyphering book however made some amends in my masters eyes. It was in this that
                  his pains &amp; the proficiency of his pupils were to be shown. The books he used to sew
                  himself, – half a dozen sheets in the common quarto size, &amp; they were ruled with double
                  red lines, &amp; the lines which were required in the sums were also double, in red ink.
                  When the book was filled, <span class="strikethrough">x</span> pencil-lines were carefully rubbed out, &amp; Williams tearing off the covers deposited
                  it in an envelope of fine cartridge paper, on which he had written in his best hand,
                  the boys name to whom it belonged <span class="strikethrough">And</span> When there were enough of these to make a volume, – they were consigned to a poor
                  old man, the inhabitant of an alms-house, who obtained a few comforts beyond what
                  the establishment allowed him, by binding them. Now tho I wrote what was called a
                  stiff cramp hand, there was a neatness &amp; regularity about my books, which were peculiar
                  to them. I had as quick a sense of symmetry as of metre: My lines were always drawn
                  according to some standard of <span class="strikethrough">regularity &amp;</span> proportion, so that the page had an appearance of order at first sight. I found the
                  advantage of this when I came to have business with the press. The method which I
                  used in my cyphering book led me to teach the printers how to print verses of irregular
                  length upon a regular principle.

            <p class="indent1">I remained at this school between four &amp; five years, which if not profitably, were
               at least not unhappily spent. And here let me state the deliberate opinion <span class="strikethrough">wh</span> upon the contested subject of &lt;public or private&gt; education which I have formed from
               what I have experienced &amp; heard &amp; observed. A juster estimate of ones-self is acquired
               at school than can be formed in the course of domestic <span class="strikethrough">education</span> &lt;instruction&gt;; &amp; what is of much more consequence, a better intuition into the characters
               of others than there is any chance of learning in after life. I have said that this
               is of more consequence than ones self-estimate, because the error upon that score
               <span class="strikethrough">x</span> which domestic education tends to produce is in the right side – that of diffidence
               &amp; humility. These advantages a day-scholar obtains, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; he escapes more much of the pollution &amp; all the unhappiness</span> &amp; he avoids great part of the evils which are to be set against them. He cannot indeed
               wholly escape pollution, – but he is far less exposed to it than a boarder. He suffers
               nothing <span class="strikethrough">from</span> &lt;from&gt; tyranny, – which is carried to excess in schools, – nor has he much opportunity
               of acquiring or indulging malicious &amp; tyrannical propensities himself. Above all his
               religious habits, which it is almost impossible to retain at school, are safe. – I
               would gladly send a son to a good <span class="strikethrough">day</span> school by day, but rather than board him at the best I would educate him myself.
               What I have said, applies to public schools as well as private; of the advantages
               which the former possess I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</p><br><p class="indent0"><span class="date">Jan<sup>y</sup>. 19. 1823</span></p>
