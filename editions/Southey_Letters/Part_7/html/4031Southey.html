                           two female cousins and their husbands. Both couples had eloped to Gretna Green and
                           were now seeking to remarry in the Church of England. Wynn asked Southey to vouchsafe
                           – if required by the Vicar – that both women now had their father’s (William Wynne
                           of Peniarth, 1774–1834) permission to wed. The women were Elizabeth Wynne (1805–1826)
                           and her younger sister, Elinor Wynne (1806–1869). Their respective husbands were William

                  at times; but their general conduct has been such as if they sought rather to attract
