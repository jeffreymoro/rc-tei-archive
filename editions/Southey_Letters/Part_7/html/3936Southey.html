               by the revolution of 1820. It might have embarrassed him if it had become known that
               he had offered to fight alongside the Supreme Junta in Seville that had assumed the
               monarch’s powers – much as the revolutionary forces had in 1820–1823.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note24_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
