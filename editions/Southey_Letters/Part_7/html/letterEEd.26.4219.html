            <p>Address: To/ The Reverend Herbert Hill/ Streatham/ Surry<br> Stamped: KESWICK/ 298<br> Postmark: E/ [illegible] 4/ 1824; [partial] 10.F.NOON.10/ J<br> MS: Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, WC 246. ALS; 3p.<br> Unpublished.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Since I heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</a> that the hooping cough had appeared at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</a>, I have neither heard of, nor from you. Hoping however that all may be going on well,
               I write now concerning <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edwards</a> journey, that you may determine upon his plan of operations.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The surest, shortest &amp; easiest mode of conveyance, is to take the mail, which will
               bring him in six &amp; thirty hours from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BullandMouth">the Bull &amp; Mouth</a> to Penrith; where he will find another mail ready to start for <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> when he has breakfasted. In that case it is at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BullandMouth">the Bull &amp; Mouth</a> that the place must be taken, &amp; in the Carlisle Mail. There is another Carlisle mail
               at some other Inn which would carry him round by Manchester &amp; Kendal &amp; delay him two
               or three hours at the former place.</p>
            <p class="indent1">If the fatigue of travelling two nights successively is thought too much, there day
               coaches from London to Birmingham thence to Manchester, &amp; thence again to Kendal,
               – from whence there is a morning coach to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> every day except Sunday. In this he would arrive here at 11 o clock on the fourth
               morning, after travelling three whole days. The former plan brings him to his journeys
               end on the second morning at 12, after travelling two nights &amp; a day: – &amp; it must
               be remembered that the three whole days begin early, – &amp; are indeed days &amp; quarters.
               – If he can sleep, or even doze in a coach, it will save as much fatigue as time to
               come by the mail.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</a> are looking for him with some impatience, &amp; I can assure him that he will not despise
               them as companions upon the mountains.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My cold I hope has nearly run its career. There are very little remains of the cough,
               &amp; I am about to begin upon a tonic course this day. The attack this year has been
               so serious, that if it be possible, I will endeavour to escape it by flying next season
               before the time of its usual return.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We have heard of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</a> arrival on the Devonshire coast, – where <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> it is to be hoped she will wear out more shoes upon the shore than in ball-rooms.</p>
