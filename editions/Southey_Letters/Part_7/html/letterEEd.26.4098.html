            <p>Endorsement: [illegible]<br> MS: British Library, Add MS 47889. ALS; 3p.<br> Unpublished.<br> Dating note: This letter was written on a ‘Wednesday evening’ in December 1823; as
               Southey had procured a frank for Caroline Bowles, he must have been in London, rather
               than Streatham, making 3 December the most likely date.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have procured a frank for you, but alas it is not so easy to find time for filling
               it, in this abominable city. Would I that were out of it, – I had almost said never
               to return to it again.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My present plans are to start for Exeter on the third of January, &amp; in about a fortnight
               afterwards set out from Taunton to Salisbury as the nearest way to you, consistent
               with my movements. If I find no ready conveyance from Salisbury, I will take chaise
               rather than lose time. How glad I shall be to set out upon that journey!</p>
