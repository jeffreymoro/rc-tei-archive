               <p>It is quite necessary that the Editor of the QR. should be a person in whom Government

                  in such things less than for its own interest, &amp; the interests of the country it ought
                  to do. Upon the course to be pursued by such a Journal, you &amp; I are perfectly agreed.

               <p>What you said concerning the payment of a printers bill may perhaps rather imply need
                  in the printer than in the bookseller. There is much competition for a great publisher’s
                  employ; &amp; the booksellers (who as far as I know them, have the true trading spirit,
                  in the worst meaning of the words) – take advantage of it, so as to pay the lowest
                  possible price, &amp; take eighteen months credit, while they collect their own debts
                  half-yearly. – The QR is the foundation of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</a> fortune. When he moved from Fleet Street, it was an adventure hazarded in consequence

                  At present I rather doubt his judgement as a publisher, than his prosperity. He must
