                           was clearly a riposte to Byron’s Don Juan (1819), whose suppressed ‘Dedication’, mocking

                  I dare say, to the best of his recollection, faithfully performed the worshipful office
                  of retailing all the effusions of spleen, slander, and malignity, which were vented
                  in his presence. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</a> is the person who suffers most by this; and, indeed, what man is there whose character
                  would remain uninjured if every peevish or angry expression, every sportive or extravagant
                  sally, thrown off in the unsuspicious and imagined safety of private life, were to
                  be secretly noted down, and published, with no notice of circumstances to shew how
                  they had arisen, and when no explanation was possible? One of the offices which has
                  been attributed to the devil, is that of thus registering every idle word.

               Shelley, without naming them. Byron was accused of ingratitude, denigrating marriage,
               and committing adultery and incest with his sister; Shelley, of being expelled from
               university for atheism, breaking the heart of his wife by ‘cruelty and infidelity’
               and of describing himself as an atheist in a visitors book after viewing sublime mountain
               scenery. This last accusation referred to Mont Auvert, a summit near the Mer de Glace
               and a popular tourist destination. At its top was a small building in which travellers
               could take shelter. It contained an album in which visitors could write their names
               and comments. Shelley had visited in July 1816 and had written the names of his party
               in the album and against them the phrase, in Greek, ‘Atheists one and all.’ Southey
               had recorded this information in his travel journal on 26 June 1817 and conveyed it
               in Southey to John May, 1 August 1817, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</em>, Letter 3005.

               (perilous as they were), and trusted that, meantime, a kind and generous heart would
               resist the effect of fatal opinions which he had taken up in ignorance and boyhood.
