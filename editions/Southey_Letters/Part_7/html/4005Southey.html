                           parishes all over the United Kingdom should be able to mortgage their poor rates in
                           order to repay loans from the government, which would finance sending the parishes’

                           3 November 1823. As the new Lord Mayor was Robert Waithman (1764–1833; DNB), Whig

               sending the parishes’ paupers to Canada. Each family would receive 100 acres of land.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
