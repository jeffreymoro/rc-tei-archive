               is required before I can fairly get into joint again, after so complete a dislocation;
               and I bring back with me a formidable accumulation of letters, which followed and

                           of the Remains of Henry Kirke White (1807). In 1823–1824 unauthorised versions were
                           published by the firms of Jones &amp; Company, Orlando Hodgson, a congeries led by W.

                  </div> They argued the point like two lawyers; the former taking my view of the question,
                  the latter holding an opinion that the rascals may shelter themselves under the letter

I saw <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</a> also, and told him in what manner I considered the case. The matter will now be properly
                  investigated, – whether justly determined is another thing. It sets upon the wording
                  of the act;

                           to 28 years. Works published in 1800 to 1814, and where the author had died before
                           the old term of 14 years was over, were also protected for 28 years. Southey clearly
                           believed that this latter clause meant that copyright in the Remains of Henry Kirke
                           White (1807) was protected for 28 years, as Henry Kirke White had died in 1806. However,
                           the ‘pirates’ interpreted the law as meaning that copyright in this work had ended
                           14 years after its first publication, i.e. in 1821. This was probably because Henry

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey’s consultation with Longman was about the possibility of bringing legal action
               to prevent the publication of pirated copies of Henry Kirke White’s poems and of parts
               of the <em>Remains of Henry Kirke White</em> (1807). In 1823–1824 unauthorised versions were published by the firms of Jones &amp;
               Company, Orlando Hodgson, a congeries led by W. Baynes and Son, and A. Robertson and
               Co.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">2.. </span><span class="noteBody">The Copyright Act (1814) had extended an author’s copyright in new works from 14 years
               to 28 years. Works published in 1800 to 1814, and where the author had died before
               the old term of 14 years was over, were also protected for 28 years. Southey clearly
               believed that this latter clause meant that copyright in the <em>Remains of Henry Kirke White</em> (1807) was protected for 28 years, as Henry Kirke White had died in 1806. However,
               the ‘pirates’ interpreted the law as meaning that copyright in this work had ended
               14 years after its first publication, i.e. in 1821. This was probably because Henry
               Kirke White was not the person responsible for publishing the <em>Remains</em>, which had appeared posthumously, so it could be argued that the 28 years protection
               given to works published in 1800–1814 did not apply in this case. The only way to
               establish the law’s meaning was through a suit in the Court of Chancery, which was
               potentially very expensive – hence Longman and Rees’s hesitation in taking action.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
