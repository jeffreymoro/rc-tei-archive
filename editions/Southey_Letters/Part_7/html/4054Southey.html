               Portuguese Princess, Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705; <em>DNB</em>), Southey noted ‘we happen to possess a relation drawn up at the time by the Portugueze
               ambassador’ and drew on this extensively (189–196). This manuscript was no. 3857 in
               the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. The leading figure on the Portuguese side
               of the negotiations was Francisco de Melo e Torres (c. 1610–1667).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
