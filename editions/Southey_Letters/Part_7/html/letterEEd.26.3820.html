               <p>I received your little volume a few days ago.

                  </div> It is sometimes convenient to thank an author for his book before you have perused
                  it; but in this case I chose to read the book first, – knowing very well that I should
                  read it, as I have done, with great pleasure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The first time I took up one of the London Magazines
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                  </div> (about fifteen months ago), I recognised your hand there, and was not a little pleased
                  at finding it. You have now acquired for yourself a claim upon public attention. Your
                  powers have developed themselves, and you have improved in the art of poetry, even
                  more than might have been expected, since I first saw a specimen of your compositions.
                  You have only to go on and prosper. But the more you rely upon yourself, the better.
                  Admiration naturally leads to imitation; but, by bearing another author too much in
                  mind, either in the choice of your story or the conception of a character, you will
                  do an injustice to yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I like your dramatic language; it is of the right stamp – free and forcible. And the
               play is full of poetry, without being overlaid by it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I thank you sincerely for offering to send copies to any of my friends. But this is
               too much for me to desire. As far as my private voice can recommend it, it shall not
               be wanting. I have no public one in such cases, so false is the common opinion that
               I am actively employed in criticising contemporary writers.</p>
