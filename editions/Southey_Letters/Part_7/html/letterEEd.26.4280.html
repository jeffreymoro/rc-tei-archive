                           History of the Peninsular War (1823–1832), published by Murray.</span></div>
                  </div> Indeed I do not think it will affect <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray’s</a> interest, who is the person interested. For the intended work will prove a military
                  history exclusively. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">The Duke</a> refused to communicate any paper to me upon the grounds that he reserved them for
                  such a work. He said that I should do as every one who wished to make a popular work
                  would, – ascribe more to the Spaniards than was due to them. In this, he is mistaken.
                  But <span class="strikethrough">he want</span> the truth is he wants a whole length portrait of himself, – &amp; not an historical picture,
                  in which a great many other figures must be introduced. – By good fortune I have had
                  access to papers of his – of a much more confidential nature than he himself (I am
                  very sure) would entrust to any one. And I have only to wish the work which he patronizes
                  may come out as soon as possible, – that I may make use of it. For my third volume
                  in all likelihood it will come in time; – &amp; then it will save me some trouble, for
                  I may rely upon its authority in mere military points.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This must be the reason why <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> announces my second volume so prematurely, when only 26 sheets are printed – out of
                  100.
