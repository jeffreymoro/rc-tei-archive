Our journey however was
                  not wholly without adventures. About six in the morning we felt a great shock, behold
                  we had run against a tilted cart, &amp; as in such cases the weakest goes to the wall,
                  the cart was overset. There were in it two men &amp; a woman on their way to market, none
                  of whom, most fortunately received any hurt. But if they had a basket of butter with
                  them, it would <span class="strikethrough">x</span> not be the better, &amp; if they were carrying eggs, the eggs would be a great deal the
                  worse. The Guard &amp; some of the outside passengers got down to give what help they
                  could, but the people were so angry that they would accept of no assistance, &amp; the
                  matter is likely to end in a law-suit. They were in the middle of the road, which
                  they ought not to have been &amp; must have seen our lights, if their eyes were open;
                  besides it was not a dark morning. But they were the more angry from a mishap of the
                  Guards, for when he went to <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> help them out from under the tilt, where they were lying men, woman, butter &amp; eggs
                  one upon another, the poor womans clothes were so discomposed that he took her by
                  the knee instead of the elbow; &amp; as she did not like a cold hand upon her knee at
                  six o clock in the morning, they <em>twarld</em> about that as well as about the overturn: &amp; they were in a great passion when we drove
