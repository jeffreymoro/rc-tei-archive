               <p>You deserve to be rated for saying that nothing is so cold as friendship, in saying
                  which you belie yourself, &amp; in inferring it as my opinion from what I said, you belie
                  me. A friend will not take half the trouble to do you a trifling service, or afford
                  you a slight gratification, that an enemy would to <span class="strikethrough">you</span> do you a petty mischief, or <span class="strikethrough">inflict</span> annoy your comfort or injure your reputation. But this same enemy would not endanger
                  himself for the pleasure of doing you a serious injury, whereas the friend would go
                  thro fire &amp; water to render you an essential benefit, – &amp; if need were risque his
                  own life to save yours. Now &amp; then indeed there appears a Devil-incarnate who seems
                  to find <span class="strikethrough">their</span> &lt;his&gt; only gratification in the exercise of malignity, – but these are monsters, &amp;
                  are noted as such. If I formed an estimate of human nature from what I observed at
                  school, I should conclude that there was a great deal more evil in it than good, if
                  from what I have observed in after life, I should draw the contrary inference. Follies
                  disappear, – weaknesses are out grown, &amp; the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> discipline of society corrects more evils than it breeds.

                  would be of more use, or who would make more use of them. My end is not answered by
                  borrowing books of this description: &amp; I will explain to you why. When a book is my
                  own, I read or look thro it &amp; mark it as I proceed, &amp; then by very brief references
                  am enabled to refer to &amp; compose from it at any future time. But if it is a borrowed
                  book, the time which it costs to provide myself with extracts for future use may be
                  worth more than the cost of the work: a lesson which I have learnt of late years <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> at no little price.</p>
