                  expresses in her letters a very warm sense of the kindness she is experiencing.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have heard that I am engaged in an incredible number of works. The booksellers
                  are to blame for sometimes announcing as an intention what has been mentioned as a
                  project for consideration, – but the truth is twofold, to wit 1<sup>st</sup> that I have (&amp; am aware of having) a propensity for planning works “of great pith
                  &amp; moment”

                  </div> which leads me to dream of more than can ever by possibility be fulfilled, – &amp; 2<sup>dly</sup> that in pursuing any one of my determined engagements, I am continually meeting with
                  something applicable to other schemes, not yet in course of execution, &amp; in this way
                  while rearing one edifice, I collect materials for others. It is not with me as it
                  would be if I had nothing to consider but how to employ my time either most worthily
                  or most agreably to my own desires. While I have some thing before me to be pursued
                  for its own sake, I must of necessity have something in hand for the Ways &amp; Means
                  of the year, – something on the present sale of which I can rely. If I have many irons
                  in the fire, one reason therefore is <span class="strikethrough">because</span> &lt;that&gt; there is a large pot to boil. Now I have <span class="strikethrough">rea</span> grounds for believing that the part of my time which must be devoted to this essential
                  object could in no way be so profitably employed as in sketching our civil history,
                  with a view of showing the growth &amp; progress of our institutions, &amp; treating those
                  portions fairly &amp; fearlessly, <span class="strikethrough">upon</span> &lt;concerning&gt; which the greatest prejudices prevail.
