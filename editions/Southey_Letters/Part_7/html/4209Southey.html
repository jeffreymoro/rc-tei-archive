                  </div> is as bad as you describe it, and there is truth enough in your view of his character
                  to justify its severity. Yet he has his better points, and I verily believe the worst
                  thing he ever did was writing those Memoirs; for, as they stand, they have the deadly
                  sin of dulness, and as he left them they were much more sinful. By way of explaining
                  his domestic history, he intended to publish details which ought not have been whispered
                  even in a confessional.

                  </div> Perhaps I am the more inclined to excuse him, because his wife has made a very disagreeable
                  impression upon me by a silly, or worse than silly, essay called “The Triumph of Acquaintance

                  </div> I like him, not for his writings as you may well suppose, but for his love of literature.
                  It is so rare a thing to find a man in Hayley’s rank who prefers it to dogs, or horses,
                  or guns, the common dissipations, or the common business of the world (which is not
                  much better), that I could forgive him even if his epitaphs had been more numerous
                  and worse than they are. You are right about the nature of his feeling; it was of
                  a kind that easily worked itself off. As far as my observation extends, those persons
                  recover soonest from their sorrow who let it take its full course at first.</p>

               <p>Whether I have done as well with Hayley as you are pleased to say I should have done
                  with a broomstick you will probably soon see. But for your sake I certainly will try
                  what I can do with the latter subject;
