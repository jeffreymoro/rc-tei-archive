                           War (1823–1832); see Southey to Herbert Hill, 18 July 1813, The Collected Letters
                           of Robert Southey. Part Five, Letter 2283. However, when the History grew from the
                           two volumes proposed in 1813 to three, Murray raised this to £1,500.</span></div>
                  </div> – You have dealt fairly &amp; uprightly with me, – as I was confident you would do, &amp;

               <p>I can readily believe that if this history had been brought out close upon the termination
                  of the war, the immediate sale might have been greater than it has been now. But I
                  am perfectly sure, that in the end, the delay which has intervened will prove not
                  less conducive to your interest, than it was due to the subject, &amp; my own reputation.
                  For if the execution of the work be in any degree worthy of the subject, the story
                  is so important in itself, so varied in its details, &amp; so honourable to us as a nation,
                  that sooner or later the book will find its way into every English<span class="strikethrough">mans</span> &lt;Gentlemans&gt; library: &amp; this it could not do if it had been composed hastily, upon
                  insufficient materials. – On the other hand I am plainly a loser by the delay. Had
                  we been to treat concerning the work when I was last in town,

                  it is needless for me to say, that tho I live almost wholly by my writings (&amp; that
                  too, hitherto, from hand to mouth) this thought has never in the slightest degree
                  abated the interest which I take in pursuing the history, nor the desire which I feel
                  of rendering it as compleat as the most conscientious diligence can make it. That
