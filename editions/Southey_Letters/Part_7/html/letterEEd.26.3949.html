It stood <span class="strikethrough">upon a bye road</span> &lt;in a lane&gt; some 200 yards from the <span class="strikethrough">begx</span> great western road. You ascended by several &lt;semi-circular&gt; steps into what was called
                  the fore court, but was in fact a flower garden, with a broad pavement from the gate
                  to the porch. That porch was in great part lined as well as covered, with jessamine;
                  &amp; many a time have I sate there with my poor sisters,

                  with diamond-shaped <span class="strikethrough">stx</span> flags, on the right hand was the parlour, which had a <span class="strikethrough">black</span> brown or black boarded floor <span class="strikethrough">&amp; a Lis</span> covered with a Lisbon mat, &amp; a handsome time piece over the fire place. On the left
                  was the best-kitchen, in which the family <span class="strikethrough">alway</span> lived. The best-kitchen is an apartment <span class="strikethrough">which</span> &lt;that&gt; <span class="strikethrough">in now</span> belongs to other days, &amp; is now no longer to be seen except in houses which &lt;having&gt;
                  remained unaltered for the last half century, are inhabited by persons a degree lower
                  in society than their former possessors. The &lt;one&gt; which I am now calling to mind
                  after an interval of forty years, was a chearful room, with an air of such <span class="ital">country</span> comfort about it, that my little heart was always gladdened when I entered it, during
                  my grandmothers life. It had a stone floor, which I believe <span class="strikethrough">distinguished</span> &lt;was the chief distinction between&gt; a best-kitchen <span class="strikethrough">from</span> &amp; a parlour. The furniture consisted of &lt;a clock&gt; a large oval oak table, with two
                  flaps, over which three or four fowling-pieces had their place, a round tea table
                  of cherry-wood, Windsor-chairs of the same, &amp; two large armed ones of that easy make
                  (of all makes it is the easiest) – in one of which my grandmother always sate. On
                  one side of the fire place the china was displayed in a beaufet &lt;(that is a cupboard
                  with glass doors)&gt;, on the other were <span class="strikethrough">cupboards</span> &lt;closets&gt; for articles less <span class="strikethrough">sight</span> ornamental but more in use. <span class="strikethrough">There were some old maps against</span> The sides of the room, which were wainscotted, were ornamented with some old maps,
                  &amp; these with a long looking glass &lt;<span class="strikethrough">in a white frame</span>&gt; over the fire place &lt;&amp; a tall one between the windows, both in white frames&gt;. The
                  windows looked into the fore court, &amp; were as chearful &amp; fragrant in the season of
                  flowers, as <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> roses &amp; jessamine which grew luxuriantly without could make them. There was a passage
                  between this apartment &amp; the kitchen, long enough to admit of a large airy pantry,
                  &amp; a larder on the left hand, the windows of both opening into the <span class="strikethrough">yard</span> &lt;barton&gt;

               house on the third, &amp; walled on the fourth. A vine covered one side of the house here,
               &amp; grew round my grandmothers window, out of which I have often reached the grapes.
               &lt;The pigeon house was here &amp; the pump under which the fatal dippings were performed.&gt;
               The yard or barton was of considerable size, its entrance <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> was from the lane thro some large folding gates, with a horse chestnut on each side,
               &amp; here another building fronted you as large as the house, containing, the dairy,

               windows. At the one gable end were the coal &amp; stick houses. And on the left side of
               the barton was a shed for the cart – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">for</span> while my Grandfather lived, for an open carriage, which after his death was no longer
               kept. Here too was the horse block beautifully overhung with ivy from an old wall
               against which it was placed. The other gable end was covered with fruit trees, &amp; at
               the bottom was a raised camomile bed.</p>

               <p>An old fashioned birds-eye view, half picture, half plan would explain all this more

                  you will perceive that the <span class="strikethrough">house had txxx front xxxxx xxx</span> paved court formed a square with the house. Behind both was a piece of waste ground
                  left for the passage of carts from the barton to the orchard; but considerably wider
                  than was necessary for the purpose. It was neatly kept in grass, with a good wide
                  path from the <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> court to the kitchen garden. This was large &amp; excellently stocked. It was walled off
                  from the waste ground by a <span class="strikethrough">low</span> wall about breast high surmounted with white rails, <span class="strikethrough">as</span> far as the range of outhouses, – the back of these was covered with fruit trees –
                  the green gages I remember were particularly excellent, one side was walled, – the
                  other separated by a hedge from the lane leading to the orchard, – from which the

                  every luxury of this kind which an English sun can ripen was there in abundance.&gt;
                  Just by the <span class="strikethrough">gate</span> orchard gate was a fine barberry bush, &amp; the peculiar odour of its blossoms is still
