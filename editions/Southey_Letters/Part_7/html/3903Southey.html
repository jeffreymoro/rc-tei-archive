            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It gives me great pleasure to hear from yourself of your safe return to England.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                  </div> Travelling is indeed delightful for those who have no cares or anxieties to distract
                  them and draw their thoughts homeward. Even in the least interesting parts of a foreign
                  land there is always something to excite curiosity, to deserve notice, to keep the
                  mind on the alert. But to visit the most interesting of all countries, to be capable
                  of understanding and enjoying whatever is most interesting there, and to enjoy it
                  at leisure as you have done, is what I should envy, if it were allowable to envy anything.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Canova,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Antonio Canova (1757–1822), Italian sculptor, whom Beaumont had met in Rome.</span></div>
                  </div> as you describe him, is not less admirable as a man than as an artist. I would fain
                  think, as well as hope, that this is usually the case with those who are most eminent
                  in any intellectual pursuit, that exceptions when we see them are deviations from
                  the course of nature, and that a wicked man of genius is a monster in the moral world.
                  From what you say of him, I should think he must sometimes wish himself a painter.
                  To me the finest sculpture compared with a picture seems like a cold abstraction.
                  But on the other hand there is a durability in marble which affects my mind very strongly:
                  no term can be assigned to its duration, no common accident is likely to reach it,
                  and in this world of decay and change it is consolitary to contemplate anything over
                  which time has no power. Therefore if, like Canova, I could have chosen between the
                  two arts, I should, like him, have trusted my fame to marble rather than to canvas.</p>

                  </div> My health suffered a good deal in the early part of the year. A violent catarrh, to
                  which I have been subject for the last twenty years as regularly as the summer begins,
                  laid stronger hold upon me than it had ever done before, and effected a lodgment in
                  my chest, which might easily have become serious. Withal my whole system was sadly
                  relaxed. As soon as I was capable of exertion, I resolved to try a course of continued
                  exercise. This I began about midsummer; a succession of guests assisted in drawing
                  me out; and I have persevered in it with wonderful effect, though too much to the
                  derangement of my needful pursuits. But it has brought me into such good condition,
                  that I am at this time as capable of any exertion among these mountains as I ever
                  was in my life. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">My brother</a>, the Doctor, made me a short visit lately, and left me with strict injunctions to
                  keep up the same course as far as possible through the winter. At the end of February,
                  or beginning of March, I must visit town.
