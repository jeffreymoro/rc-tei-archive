               <p>My mornings for the last three weeks have been pretty closely employed upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Frere’s</a> papers which will occupy a fortnight yet before I shall have got thro them.

                  </div> They gave me all the information of which I was in want for that stage of the war
                  in which my materials were most defective.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</a> life is so precarious at this time, &amp; the probability of his being unable to conduct
               the QR. even if he recovers, so great, that the question of <span class="ital">succession</span> becomes <span class="strikethrough">one</span> of some interest to me. I wish <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</a> to be the Editor, being a man who unites in himself all the requisites, &amp; with whom
               I could act cordially. Unless I am very much mistaken, the character of the Journal
               would be raised, &amp; its influence greatly increased, by the firm &amp; consistent language
               which it would hold under his management, &amp; the utter exclusion of such splenetic
               effusions as often disgrace it now.</p>

               <p>“The Liberal,” is quite what it ought to be.

                  </div> If I hated <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</a> as deeply as he does me, I could not wish it to be worse. It cannot, I think, reach

               benefit to me, &amp; I hope to keep in the same good condition, till you see me early
               in the spring.</p>
