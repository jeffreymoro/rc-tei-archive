               <p>The Peninsular War is going on well. 20 sheets of the second vol. are printed.

                  </div> does not hurry me, neither do I hurry the printer; having found by long experience
                  that after letting a narration rest awhile, it is renewed with fresh spirit. It is
                  proceeding well, the best proof of which is that I am well satisfied with it myself.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My literary employments have never in the slightest degree injured my health. For
               in truth I neither am, nor ever have been a close student. If I do not take sufficient
               exercise, it is not from any love of the desk, but for the want of a companion or
               an object to draw me out when the season is uninviting; – &amp; yet I overcame this <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> dislike of solitary walking, &amp; every day unless it be a settled rain, walk long enough
               &amp; far &amp; fast enough, to require the wholesome process of rubbing down on my return.
               At no time of my life have I ever applied half so closely to my employments, as you
               always do to yours. They impose upon me no restrictions, there is nothing irksome
               in them, – no anxiety connected with them. – they leave me master<span class="strikethrough">s</span> of my time &amp; of myself. Nor do I doubt but that they would prove conducive to longevity,
               if my constitution were disposed for it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>With regard to the prudence of working up ready materials rather than laying in more,
                  upon whatever I employ myself I must of necessity be doing both. The work which I
                  am most desirous of compleating is the Hist. of Portugal, as being that for which
                  most preparations have been made, &amp; most time bestowed on it.

                  </div> And when the Peninsular War shall be completed – by Gods blessing, – a week will not
                  elapse before it goes to the press, – for it has been long in much greater forwardness
                  than any work which I ever before began to print.</p>

                  might be done, &amp; another to dream of doing it. – No doubt wherever <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TelfordThomas">M<sup>r</sup> Telford</a> is travelling he cannot help seeing a line of road ought to be carried, <span class="strikethrough">or</span> a harbour improved, or a pier carried out – In like manner I see possibilities &amp; capabilities
