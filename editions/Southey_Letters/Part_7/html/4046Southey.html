                  It was in great danger of being carried from school to Cambridge, since the Colleges
                  has been full, &amp; the town crowded with undergraduates. Some who had proceeded <span class="ital">Beasts</span> from school took advantage of the license which lodgings allowed them to annoy those

                  has been one of the reasons for enlarging the Colleges there with the view of not
                  permitting any person to lodge out of their walls. – I heard this last year from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">D<sup>r</sup> Wordsworth</a>.</p>
