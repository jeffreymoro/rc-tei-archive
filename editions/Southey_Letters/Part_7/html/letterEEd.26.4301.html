               a sustained attack on Southey. (The latter eventually decided not to take legal action.)
               Southey believed that the letter was a response to the one he had written to the Editor
               of the <em>Courier</em>, 8 December 1824, Letter 4289 (published 13 December 1824) – which was, in turn,
               a reply to the material on Southey in Thomas Medwin (1788–1869; <em>DNB</em>), <em>Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron: Noted During a Residence with his Lordship
