               <p>There is little chance of any circumstance drawing me from this country to reside
                  in the vicinity of London – at least I can forsee none. The question whether or not
                  the Quarterly Review should do so has been fairly considered &amp; decided in consequence
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</a> dangerous illness. He had written to me soon after you left us, saying that he could
                  not long continue to conduct the Review &amp; that he knew not where to look for a successor.
                  He was not ill at the time; &amp; therefore my consideration of the matter was not hastily
                  but deliberately made. If I had chosen to propose myself, the office must have been
                  mine, of course. The objections to it were, that the increased expenditure which I
                  must incur near London, would fully consume any <span class="strikethrough">advantage</span> increase of income which I should have obtained; &amp; therefore the time consumed in
                  the mere management of the journal, would have been a dead loss. This time would be
                  unpleasantly as well as unprofitably spent, in corresponding upon the mere business
                  of the review, examining communications, &amp; either correcting them myself when there
                  was any thing erroneous, imprudent, or inconsistent with those coherent opinions which
                  the journal should have maintained under my care, – in persuading the respective writers
                  to amend &amp; alter according to that standard. Lastly it seemed that there was nothing <span class="strikethrough">in</span> <span class="strikethrough">the</span> <span class="strikethrough">change of</span> which could recompense me for the sacrifice which it needs would be to quit a country
                  in which I take so much delight, &amp; of which all my family are as fond as myself: &amp;
                  there was this weightier consideration that if I gave up the quantity of time which
                  the management of such a journal requires, it would take away all reasonable hope
                  of my compleating the various great works
