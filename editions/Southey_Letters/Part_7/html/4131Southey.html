                           assistance) and obtained his BA in 1829. He became a clergyman and was Perpetual Curate

               He will not find his progress difficult under good tuition. These are the objects
               to which he must attend. English will come of itself. Is there a good school at Sheffield?
               It is of main importance that he should be placed now under judicious guidance. Let
