It was not till
                  Monday last that I had an opportunity of seeing his letter:

                           religious feeling, to be as delightful as it is original’. Lamb took offence and responded
                           with ‘Letter of Elia to Robert Southey, Esquire’, London Magazine, 8 (October 1823),
                           400–407.</span></div>
                  </div> – it was less offensive that I might have anticipated, if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</a> had not given me a previous account of it; &amp; the perusal only confirmed the intention
                  with which I left home, of addressing him in a manner correspondent to the feelings
                  which I have always entertained towards him. We came here, as you know, on the Tuesday,
                  &amp; on Wednesday my first business was to write him a letter,

                  disclaimed all intention of injuring or wounding him, – told him that if he had complained
                  to me in any private or friendly manner, I would have inserted a note in the next
                  review which should entirely have satisfied him that his letter had rendered this
                  impossible, &amp; I was sorry for it. But that nothing should provoke me to engage in
                  a public controversy with him to make sport for the Philistines, – &amp; that if he could
                  as heartily forgive an unintended offence, as I did the way in which he had resented
                  it, he had only to say so, &amp; I would take the earliest opportunity of going to shake
