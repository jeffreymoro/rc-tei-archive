            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I was truly rejoiced to receive your letter from London, both for the tidings which
                  it contained of your last communications from the Rio, &amp; because it assured me of
                  your safe arrival.

                           September 1822. May was deeply concerned about the fate of his business transactions
                           in Rio de Janeiro.</span></div>
                  </div> The contents of your former letter, upon mature consideration I did not think proper
                  to impart to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs Coleridge</a>, because the total silence upon the subject which she had maintained towards <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">her sister</a> &amp; me, &amp; which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</a> also maintained towards <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">her cousin</a>, implied either a want of confidence where confidence ought to have been placed,
                  or a sense of impropriety in the affair; &amp; also because no communication was necessary,
                  the attachment having to all appearance been dismissed as lightly as it was established.

                           occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming
                           him): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their departure,
                           fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded,
                           and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (Glasgow Herald, 12 August 1822).
                           The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part
                           of the annual Keswick Regatta.</span></div>
                  </div> – so well indeed that when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">the General</a> returns from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</a> I shall remind that it will be proper to return thanks for his recovery, – prayers
                  having been put &lt;up&gt; for it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">The General</a> himself has had an adventure <span class="ital">in</span> the Lake which I will not repeat because you will hear it from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> whenever you see him. The weather has been very stormy, &amp; with much rain; – the other
                  morning <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cupin</a> heard there was like to be a flood, &amp; immediately said that he would get out his Noahs
                  Ark. – I hear him now on the way to give me the good-night kiss.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will be glad to hear that your visit compleated what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoots</a> had begun; &amp; that in consequence of the exercise which I took with him first &amp; immediately
               afterwards with you, I am in better bodily condition than I had been for twenty months
               before, – being indeed for the present a sound man. But I hardly can hope this will
               last till I take my journey to the south.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I look back upon your visit with great satisfaction, – &amp; this more so because I look
               forward with some confidence to another, at no long interval. This is the sort of
               intercourse which I desire with those whom I love &amp; esteem; &amp; one thing which endears
               this place of abode to me is that I enjoy more of it here than I should be likely
               to do any where else. I should see you, for instance much more frequently, if I lived
               near London; – but in twenty years I should not see so much of you as by having you
               two or three weeks under my roof.</p>
            <p class="indent1">– I must not forget to deliver a message from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LockerEdwardHawke">Locker</a>, – that he shall be very glad to show you Greenwich Hospital, – as a means of becoming
               better acquainted with you; – &amp; that he would have said this himself if he had known
               you were about to depart when he saw you last.</p>
            <p class="indent1">And now concerning the QR. Few things would give me more pleasure than to see it in
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridges</a> hands, because I am assured it would be to the national good, &amp; to his individual
               comfort &amp; advantage. I have already mentioned it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a>, who is in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</a> confidence, – &amp; I now close the letter in order to mention it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> himself.</p>
