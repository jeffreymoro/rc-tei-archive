               <p>Thank you for the Salmon report in which I found more amusement than you anticipated.

                  </div> I could have had no conception that the destruction made by seals &amp; porpoises is so
                  great as is there stated.</p>

                           for political reform.</span></div>
                  </div> – which I must say is well deserved by those who proceed upon the vile system of deserting
                  their friends in the hope of conciliating their enemies. It is well that the objects
                  of separation &amp; Catholic ascendancy should be broadly avowed, – &amp; as the crisis is
                  inevitable, it cannot come too soon. I only hope the mischief may not extend here;
                  – but certain it is that the English Radicals have had Agents in Ireland. The common
                  revolutionary purpose cannot however prove a bond of union, when the rebellion assumes,
                  as it will without delay or disguise, the character of a religious war.</p>
