                  Christian Knowledge, from the Commencement of its Connexion with the East India Missions,
                  A. D. 1709, to the Present Day</em> (1814); and of the Church Missionary Society’s <em>Missionary Register</em> (1813–1824), no. 1962 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. The latter organisation
               was founded in 1799 by evangelical Anglicans and had been at work in New Zealand since
               1814. However, Southey did not write his proposed article on New Zealand.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
