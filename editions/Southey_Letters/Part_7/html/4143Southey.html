               <p>I told you that before you received my letter I should have returned to my old habit
                  of writing verses before breakfast, – (at which time nine tenths at least of Thalaba,

                  </div> Five &amp; twenty years ago I should have written three times as much in one. Without
                  inquiring whether what is lost in measure is xxx gained in weight, there is satisfaction
                  enough in knowing that even at this rate a long poem may be compleated in twelvemonths.
                  And that if I hold on – (as I <span class="ital">will</span> do <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;provided&gt; you bear your part,) – &amp; you keep pace with me, half that time will compleat
                  our purpose, &amp; we may publish at the close of the year.</p>

               is already written. You have here a beginning, which when I receive a copy of the
               book “from the author” I shall gravely pronounce to be a very good imitation of my
               own manner: – &amp; honestly add that it is quite as good as I could produce <span class="ital">myself</span>. The fragments shall be forwarded to you, as I proceed, – written all in the same
               form, for convenience of arrangement. Now – dear Caroline, go you to work with the
               same mind &amp; the same will, &amp; we shall build something <span class="strikethrough">than the</span> more durable if not more beautiful than the best castle that either of us has ever
               erected – great architect as we both have been in that line.</p>
