                  </div> can be of no avail. The question that a bookseller will ask is not whether it be a
                  work of merit, but whether it is likely to sell. Without this assurance the praise
                  which I should bestow – to wit – that it is a work of great power &amp; promise, would
                  not suffice: nor indeed with it, unless the bookseller himself saw reason to expect
                  a remunerating sale. You can do no harm by offering it to a publisher, – but I am
                  afraid you will not find one who will take upon himself the risque of publication,
                  – much less advance any thing for the copyright. Nor am I sure that eventually it
                  would be serviceable to you to have it before the world. With all its merit it is
                  a juvenile performance; &amp; you have already given proof of poetical genius.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I am glad to hear of your lecturing, because it leads you to prose composition; &amp;
               it by writing for magazines that you may with most facility help out your ways &amp; means.
               But your great object with this view should be to get a piece upon the stage, something
               of the mixed drama rather than tragedy, of an attractive, romantic character, – designed
               to please, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> rather than to affect too deeply. Construct the plan first if you succeed in that,
               you have little or nothing to learn in execution.</p>

                  </div> is not a subject upon which you can derive any aid from books. The Bible is the sole
                  history of that early age of the world, &amp; every thing relating to manners must be
                  matter of invention, not research. What the circumstances of the world then were it
                  is impossible to know: your business therefore is to describe them such as they may
                  with some appearance of reason be supposed to have been. There is a German poem upon
                  the subject, in hexameters, by Bodmer;
