               <p>I have just learnt that the emigration to Canada is going on from this coast to a
                  very considerable extent but I am afraid in a manner which must soon tend to excite
                  a strong feeling against it. Parishes are shipping off their paupers, – they go in
                  crowded vessels without any surgeon on board &amp; when they arrive they will find themselves
                  upon the wide world without any person to direct them &amp; forward them to the spot where
                  Government according to your plan would give them allotments &amp; secure them the means
                  of subsistence till those plots be made available. There are 70 such persons going
                  in the vessel from Maryport in which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> has taken his passage.

                           which vessel he was hoping to take from Maryport. He eventually sailed from Whitehaven
                           on 20 April 1823 on the brig Maria and reached Quebec on 27 May. The ship contained
                           53 settlers.</span></div>

                           in Upper Canada. However, Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784–1841; DNB), Under-Secretary
                           of State for War and the Colonies 1821–1828, was eager to extend this idea and produced
                           ‘An Outline of a Plan of Emigration to Upper Canada’ in January 1823. He proposed
                           that parishes all over the United Kingdom should be able to mortgage their poor rates
                           in order to repay loans from the government, which would finance sending the parishes’
                           paupers to Canada. Each family would receive 100 acres of land; see Southey to Charles…</span></div>
                  </div> Now tho it is never desirable for Government to interfere with what it desires to
                  be done without its interference. This appears to me one of those cases in which the
                  object must be frustrated without a proper superintendence being exercised. Immediate
                  relief from the surcharge of the poor is not all which must be looked to want to have
                  regular outlets opened by which the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx may</span> overflow may always be carried off. But emigrants who go out in this manner must inevitably
                  send back, if they do not <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> some of them bring back the most discouraging reports. This will be a great evil looking
                  at it from a mere political light, &amp; if humanity were out of the question. But <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> both for policy &amp; humanity &lt;the sooner&gt; a regular system be set in action the better;
                  for we are come to think that stage in society in which emigration is as necessary
                  a part of our <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> social system, as swarming is of the economy of a beehive.</p>

               We expect his credentials from the colonial office in three or four days. You will
               not wonder that this presses heavily upon my spirits, – so much so indeed as in some
