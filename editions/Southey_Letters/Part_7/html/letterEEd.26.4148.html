               <div class="salute">My dear Harry</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">This is an ugly specimen of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> printing, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> never having thought either of inspecting &lt;it&gt; himself before it was struck off,
               or of desiring the Printer to let me do it for him. However it answers its purpose,
               as he has left me a quire of them to get rid of, this is the first use I make of paper
               smooth enough to be very disagreable. I found him equally out of spirits &amp; out of
               humour, – complaining that he has only been able to raise five pounds this year, &amp;
               that by begging from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>. This is the only intimation he ever gave me of ever having had recourse to him.
               A draft for 20 £ which I gave him has so compleatly restored his temper, as to make
               the change observable to those who know nothing of the cause. As soon as that supply
               is gone, no doubt he will return to the old subject, &amp; urge me to get something for
               him – for that it is in my power to do this is a persuasion in which he seems determined
               to persist. – Do not touch upon this subject in your reply.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am vexed as well as disappointed that there has been no letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">E May</a> since my return because I am anxious to hear of the little girl.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Some five minutes after I had seated myself in the stage it occurred to me that I
               had left you to pay the hackney coachman, – for an agreable ride to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BullandMouth">the Bull &amp; Mouth</a>. This arose from the same sort of hurry which made me leave the great coat behind
               when I set out for Norwich, – both in some degree proof that my wits are a little
               the worse for wear, &amp; are not as prompt on <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> sudden occasion as they used to be.</p>

                           Robinson (d. 1836), a Beverley draper, who was seeking to lead a group of local Methodists
                           into union with the Church of England. Robinson’s letter is published in Charles Cuthbert

                  of a party, which counts among its members many exemplary Clergymen not sufficiently
                  alive either to the necessity of order or to the prejudice resulting to religion from
                  the aspersions thrown on the characters of their brethren, who differ with them in
                  opinion on particular points. I am however not without hopes that in certain situations,
                  more especially in parts of the colonies a union of purpose &amp; action at least may
                  silently take place, which under discreet management would be productive of much advantage
                  to the one great cause: – but this must be effected by prudent use of opportunities,
                  &amp; not I think by formal treaty.”

               Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <em>History of the Peninsular War</em> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Finally, Southey had sought
