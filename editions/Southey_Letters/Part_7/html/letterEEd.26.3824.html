                  </div> The scheme of sending him to be under his mothers eye is <span class="strikethrough">so</span> preposterous, even if it were possible. What authority can a mother exercise over
                  a man of six &amp; twenty,—the very disease of whose nature is an impatience of all ordinary
                  observances, &amp; &lt;of&gt;, the restraints which he owes to himself as well as others! –
                  I cannot understand how <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> can be kept in ignorance of his sons conduct, – nor indeed how he can be ignorant
                  of it at this time, if it has been such as to render his abode at Highgate impossible,
                  &amp; to eject him from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontaguBasil">Montagues</a>: knowing these irregularities, what is there in a fresh instance which is to prove
                  fatal to him if revealed?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>M<sup>r</sup> Gillmans drift is evident, &amp; I am surprized that he should have formed so senseless
                  a scheme. By his own account the possibility of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">H’s</a> obtaining testimonials is now postponed sine die:

                  </div> I believe indeed for ever. He has no means of living but by his pen; this we all know
                  to be a miserable thing, but he has brought himself to it, &amp; nothing remains but to
                  make the best of it. But to live thus he must be in London, upon the spot, within
                  reach of books &amp; booksellers, editors to set him to work, &amp; printers devils to goad
                  him for copy. The same habits which disqualify him for orders, unfit him also for
                  a tutor. Writing is his only resource; &amp; it is in London that he must follow it.</p>
