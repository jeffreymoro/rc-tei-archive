            <p class="indent1">Thank you for this seasonable supply. – The worst symptom of advancing age which I
               am sensible of in myself, is a certain anxiety concerning ways &amp; means; – to that
               cause I impute it, for I am sure it does not belong to my disposition</p>

               <p>You tell me it is not politic to work entirely for posthumous fame. Alas Grosvenor,
                  had you forgotten when you wrote that sentence that by far the greater portion of
                  my life has been consumed in providing for my household expences? As for reputation,
                  of that God knows I have as much as either I deserve or desire. If I have not profited
                  by it as some of my contemporaries have done by theirs, the fault is not owing to
                  my <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> living out of sight. What advantage could it possibly be to me to meet great men at
                  dinner twice or thrice in the season, &amp; present myself as often at court? There is
                  I dare say good will enough among some of the men in power to serve me, – if they
                  knew how: – but if they asked me how, I should not be able to point out a way. <span class="strikethrough">For thx xxxxxxx xxx</span> The reason why you see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</a> bust in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ChantreyFrancis">Chantreys</a> study, is because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir G.
