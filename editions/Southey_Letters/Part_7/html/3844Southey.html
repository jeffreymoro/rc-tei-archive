               <div class="salute">My dear Lightfoot</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The pleasure which I always feel in receiving a letter from you is in the present
               case somewhat abated by finding that you did not receive my last reply. For certainly
               I wrote one, &amp; tho its loss on the way is of no other consequence, yet I am sorry
               to think I should have so long seemed guilty of neglect towards an old friend whom
               I often think of, &amp; sometimes see in a dream. – Be assured that no letter of yours
               will ever long remain<span class="strikethrough">ed</span> unanswered by me, while I am able to answer it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the month of July I shall be, God willing, where I am now, – that is to say, where
               I like best to be, – at home, in the quiet &amp; steady exercise of my vocation. I wish
               you would be persuaded to pass that month with me, &amp; take some delightful excursions
               among these Lakes &amp; Mountains, while we are yet able to enjoy them. I know not what
               alteration time may have made in you, but for myself I can feel that eight &amp; twenty
               years which have <span class="strikethrough">gone by</span>&lt;elapsed&gt; since you &amp; I shook hands at our last parting, have left very perceptible
               effects upon my earthly part. Some of the strength of manhood, &amp; all the enterprize
               of youth are gone. I should be very unwilling now to walk the whole of a long summers
               day. Yet on the whole there are probably few men in better trim at the completion
               of their 48<sup>th</sup> year. Come then while it is yet in my power to show you that I can handle an oar
               upon Derwentwater, as well as I ever did upon the Isis. All that I learnt at Oxford
               was to row &amp; to swim.</p>

                  </div> But I believe the perpetual plague of solicitation which patronage always draws after
                  it, makes it a dear purchase.</p>

               to health, &amp; I have not heard of him since: There is no possibility of rescuing him
               from the way of life which he has chosen for himself; – &amp; all that we can do is to
