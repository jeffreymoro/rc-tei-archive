                  </div> I do not believe you could obtain ten subscribers; I am sure that I could not obtain

                  while green. Whatever power he might possess, no man ever attained to greatness unless
                  he worked his way patiently. There is no way of getting up the hill but by climbing

                  in the periodical publications, – offer a ticket now and then to the lottery of the
                  theatre, – and work up a great poem at leisure. “The Deluge,” if now completed and
