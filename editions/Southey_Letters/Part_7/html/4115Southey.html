               <p>A man of letters may ask a favour of you in aid of his pursuits, without danger of
                  being thought impertinent &amp; obtrusive. For two years I have vainly been endeavouring
                  to obtain two Spanish works, which I am led to believe contain very interesting particulars
                  relating to the <span class="strikethrough">Spanish</span> &lt;Peninsular&gt; War. The one is a history of the war in Catalonia, the other anecdotes
                  of the chief Catalan officers, – supplementary to it, both by Francisco da Oliveira.

               Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <em>History of the Peninsular War</em> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
