               be looked for, – the object being the separation of the two countries, &amp; the establishment
               of the worst of all existing superstitions in its worst form. On the subject of that
               abominable system there is not a shade of difference between us; – but I deduce from
               my detestation of it, this principle that no person who holds it ought ever to be

                           Landor had Franklin expound an enormous scheme of reform in Irish affairs, including
                           the reorganisation of the Anglican Church of Ireland, endowment of the Catholic clergy,
                           security of tenure for tenants and the appointment of Irishmen only to government

                  to do without. We have far more to dread from those who would endeavour to expel not
