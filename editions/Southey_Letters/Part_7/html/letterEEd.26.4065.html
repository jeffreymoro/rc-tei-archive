               <p>I must begin by performing a commission, arising, I am sorry to say, as you will be
                  to hear, from the death of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Mr. Edmondson</a>. By his desire I am to say that a hamper of yours, which was left in his care, will
                  be as secure with his family as it was during his lifetime. This most useful and meritorious
                  man died on Monday last, worn out by an internal disease, with which he had struggled
                  for the last two years. A subscription is proposed for placing a tablet in the church
                  to his memory.

                  </div> His professional skill, the conscientiousness of his charges, and the laborious course
                  of duty in which his life was passed, deserve this tribute. It will be creditable
                  to the people of this place that this should be done, and you do men good by raising
                  them in their own esteem when you engage them in anything which partakes of a generous
                  or a grateful feeling. What a different world would this be if half the pains were
                  taken to call forth good feelings which are employed in exciting and fostering evil
                  ones!</p>

                  of seeing him again is nevertheless felt as a loss, and is one in reality. He may
                  be nearer to us than when he existed in the same world, and even more intimately sensible
                  of our regard for him. This is a consolatory thought. But all our associations connected
                  with the dead change their character, and thus our happiest recollections die before
                  us. The longer we live the stronger those ties become which attract us toward another
                  world, and the fewer and the weaker those that attach us to this. Faith and hope then
                  become essential parts of our nature, and thus we gain more than we lose.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I should indeed be delighted to enjoy Rome in your company. The hope of seeing that
               city is among my dreams, but whether the dream will ever be fulfilled is very doubtful.
               My course of life, though in every respect the happiest (I verily believe) into which
               a merciful Providence could have led me, seems at present not very likely to afford
               me the means or the leisure. Nevertheless I dream of such things, and have lived to
               realise some things which appeared less feasible.</p>
