                  </div> No doubt you have heard from him to the same effect. – I have promised to help him
                  occasionally, – in hopeless good will. – His paper – in spite of every possible advantage,
                  is dying of the incurable disease of dulness. The only sure means of saving it would
                  be to put it into the hands of a new editor, which – if he could bear to do it, –
                  he could not afford to do.</p>

               one. If any adequate person, or any person supposed to be adequate, could have been
               found, I am not without a suspicion that my recommendation would have stood in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">J.C’s</a> way, both in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</a> opinion &amp; in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray’s</a>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">G.</a> holding me to be too <span class="ital">liberally</span> inclined, &amp; Murray on the other hand <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> entertaining an equal fear of my <span class="ital">bigotry</span>. Both therefore would be disinclined to an Editor who would confide in me, &amp; in whom
               I could confide. – The change will be of serious advantage to the Review, &amp; as far
               as that Review acts upon the public, a very desirable one. And for myself I shall
               write with the better will, as being no longer liable to capricious mutilations, –
               nor in any danger of having what I have said in one number, purposely contradicted
