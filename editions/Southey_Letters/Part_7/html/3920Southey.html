               in early October 1822, Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 11 October 1822, Letter
               3906. These papers were to aid Southey in writing the second volume of his <em>History of the Peninsular War</em> (1823–1832).</p>

                  It is not my business to hint at this. I shall do him full justice for the good service
