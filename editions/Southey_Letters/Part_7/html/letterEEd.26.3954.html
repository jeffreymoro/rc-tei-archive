            <p class="indent1">By the time this reaches you your holydays will be over, &amp; you will have settled once
               more to your routine of labour; which with all its discomforts, has some advantages
               over many, or most other employments. You are unequivocally doing good. You are not
               called, like the physician to prescribe for maladies which no human skill can remedy,
               &amp; witness sufferings of body &amp; of mind to which you can administer no alleviation,
               nor have you like the lawyer important interests of others dependent <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> upon the success or failure of your management. You are neither in danger of losing
               a good cause, nor bound by your profession to do your utmost in favour of a bad one.
               It is better to deal with young blockheads (an illustrious trio for example) than
               with full grown knaves. And tho you are obliged to read the same books again &amp; again,
               they are some of the best books in the world. On the whole you may well be deemed
               a happy man, &amp; so I know you think &amp; feel yourself, – even tho the holydays are over.</p>

               But this is also a reference to Aesop’s (c. 620–c. 560 BC), <em>Fables</em> and the story of the ‘Ant and the Grasshopper’, used to illustrate the value of hard
               work – the grasshopper sings all summer, while the ant stores up food for the winter.
               Southey implies that while he enjoyed himself in the summer months, like the grasshopper,
               he also worked hard in the winter.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

It mentioned Olivarez’s <em>Account of the War in Catalonia</em> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <em>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</em> (1816); and <em>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of
                  Joseph Bonaparte</em> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray
               to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.
