                           and obtained his BA in 1829. He became a clergyman and was Perpetual Curate of New

            <p class="indent1">If your sons abilities are above the common standard, &amp; you can rely upon him for
               diligence &amp; prudence, the best <span class="strikethrough">x</span> course which could be chosen for him is to place him at one of the Universities,
               with a view to his gaining a fellowship. With good abilities &amp; good conduct the way
               would be plain before him, &amp; if that step were gained, he becomes immediately independent,
               the means of fortune are within his reach, &amp; his advancement in life would depend
               less upon accident or patronage than upon his own exertions &amp; desert. What nature
               has done for him, you are well able to judge, &amp; also to <span class="strikethrough">x</span> judge whether his <span class="strikethrough">possesses the</span> disposition is such as would lead him to <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> employ his talents to the best account. Diligence, regularity, &amp; that spirit of just
               frugality without which there can be no independence, are indispensable to his success
               in this career, – as they are indeed to his happiness in any.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The next point is – what are his acquirements? how far has he advanced? &amp; at what
                  school has he been placed. Eighteen is a good age for going to college, – &amp; a great
                  deal may be done in two years. – The choice between Oxford or Cambridge would depend
                  in a great degree upon his aptitude for mathematics.

                  to some persons who if any good offices should be in their power will gladly render
