               <p>My winter has not been idly spent, but it has not carried me so far forward as I had
                  anticipated, chiefly because writing a book is like building a house, – a work of
                  more time &amp; cost than the estimate <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> has been taken at. This is the chief reason. But something I confess must be set down
                  to my besetting sin, – a sort of miser-like love of accumulation. Like those persons
                  who frequent sales &amp; fill their own houses with useless purchases, because they may
                  want them some time or other, – so am I for ever making collections &amp; storing up materials
                  which may not come into use till the Greek Calends.

                  who had been actors in the events which it was their business to record, – &amp; thus

               calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad
               on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland
               in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey
               to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League
               of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. Southey had responded by
               writing to the Editor of the <em>Courier</em>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. His letter was published in the <em>Courier</em> on 11 January 1822.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
