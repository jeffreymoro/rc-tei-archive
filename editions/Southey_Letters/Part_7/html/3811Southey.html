               <p>In this age of reformation &amp; improvement, a very needful improvement has been undertaken
                  at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, – to which I have been desired to solicit your contribution. It is that of making
                  a safe &amp; commodious church-path. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#StangerJames">Mr Stanger</a> has given as much of his field as is necessary for widening the church lane, where
                  it is proposed to form a raised path of a sufficient width, secured from carriages
                  by a curb-stone. The estimate is 27 £. – there is a hedge to be grubbed, another planted,
                  fenced &amp;c. &amp; if there be any overplus, as it is hoped there will, it goes to improve
                  the path between the church lane &amp; the town. Greenwich Hospital
