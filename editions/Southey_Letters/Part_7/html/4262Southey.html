               <p>With regard to any labours in English history, the plan which I not long ago communicated
                  to you of sketching it in a Book of the State down to the accession of the reigning
                  family &amp; following that by the Age of George 3<sup>d</sup>.

                  be brought to bear, &amp; for which no other person is at present, or is likely to be
                  hereafter, so well qualified, – because the materials, the disposition &amp; the ability
                  are little likely to meet. Such a work was the Hist. of Brazil,
