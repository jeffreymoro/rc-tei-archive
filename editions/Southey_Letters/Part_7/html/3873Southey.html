                  spared for making the spirit of this country sink with them. At that momentous crisis
                  everything, under Providence, depended upon your single determination, and to that
                  determination Great Britain is beholden for its triumph, and Europe for its deliverance.</p>

            <p class="indent1">To you, therefore, this faithful history is offered, as a portion of the tribute which

            <p class="indent1">In inscribing to your lordship this “History of the Peninsular War,” I am actuated
               not less by private than by public considerations.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am one of many persons who, at the beginning of the French revolution, were deceived
                  by its specious promises. The error is not one upon which I look back either with
                  compunction or shame. It was connected with generous feelings, and pursued with an
                  utter disregard of worldly interests. Youth, ignorance, and an ardent mind, rendered
                  me easy to be so deluded. I believed that the war in which this country was engaged
                  against France was unjust in its commencement, and iniquitous in its object; and I
                  was ill-informed enough to suppose that popular governments must needs be free, and
                  that whenever such governments could be established, there, in the natural course
                  of things, the people would become virtuous and happy. Thus prejudiced, I suffered
                  myself to be persuaded that the crimes of the revolution were caused by the resistance
                  which was opposed to it; and when the character of that revolution had so developed
                  itself as to make it evident that worse danger was to be apprehended from republican
                  France than that from which Europe had been delivered by the efforts of Great Britain,
                  and the consummate abilities of Marlborough,

                           the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1713), which prevented France dominating continental
                           Europe.</span></div>
                  </div> still I thought a war which in its origin had been injurious, carried with it a sin
                  from which no change of circumstances in its progress could purify it.</p>

                           ended hostilities between the two countries, though war resumed on 18 May 1803.</span></div>
                  </div> was concluded, and there were many who partook in the same erroneous feeling. No act
                  of amnesty ever produced such conciliatory consequences as that Peace. It restored
                  in me the English feeling which had been deadened; it placed me in sympathy with my
                  country, bringing me thus into that natural and healthy state of mind upon, which
                  time, and knowledge, and reflection, was sure to produce their proper and salutary
                  effect. Now that your lordship has retired from administration, it may not be unpleasing
                  to you, at the close of a long and honourable career, to receive this public and grateful
                  acknowledgement.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The occasion which I have taken is a fitting one. The work records the glorious termination
               of a war commenced under your ministry with the full accord of the nation, and in
               just reliance upon God and a good cause. Throughout all the vicissitudes of that long
               and eventful struggle, whether you were in or out of power, there was no change in
               your conduct – your heart and voice were always with your country. No factious motives
               stand upon the record against you; no malevolent opposition; no opinion or sentiment
               which you could wish to recall. Pursuing the same straightforward course at all times,
               you supported the honour of Great Britain when you no longer directed its counsels,
               and finally bore a part in those counsels when the most arduous contest in which Great
               Britain ever was engaged was brought to a triumphant close.</p>
            <p class="indent1">That your Lordship may long live to enjoy the approbation of your own heart, and the
               esteem of all who value as they ought the institutions of their country, is the wish
               of him who subscribes himself, with sincere respect, </p>
