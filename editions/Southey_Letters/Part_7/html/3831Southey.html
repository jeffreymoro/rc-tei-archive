               by herself, except on a visit to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> – which was like being in another home. I shall join her for the purpose of bringing
               her back about the end of May. She goes provided with a sketch-book which if the weather
               permit she will make good use of; for she sketches now so quickly &amp; so well that in
               this respect I should be very well satisfied with her for a travelling companion.</p>

                  I know not when to expect him. When he thinks of coming there is no being sure of
                  him because Taffy has a house on the way.
