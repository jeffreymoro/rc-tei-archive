               of the Constitution of 1812 and was imprisoned by the absolutist regime in 1814–1820.
               After the 1820 revolution he was Minister of the Interior 1820–1821 and a deputy to

               of delicate diplomatic missions and may well have been a government spy. In 1815 he
               was appointed one of the Commissioners of Liquidation, Arbitration and Deposit, who
               adjudicated on claims by British citizens for loss of property against the French
               government. Southey had met him in Paris in May 1817 and Mackenzie had provided the
               information about his role in the evacuation of the Spanish Army of the North from
               Denmark that appeared in Southey’s <em>History of the Peninsular War</em>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 657–658.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Spanish liberal regime. The guests of honour were Juan Jabat Aztal (1772–1825), the
               Spanish Ambassador 1822–1823, João Francisco de Oliveira (dates unknown), the Portuguese
               chargé d’affaires 1821–1822, and Lorenzo Fernandez de Villavicencio y Canas, 3rd Duke
               of San Lorenzo and Valhermoso (1778–1859), formerly Spanish Ambassador to France.
               Littleton was one of a number of eminent speakers and proposed a toast to ‘Civil and
               Religious Liberty all over the World’. Littleton was a supporter of Canning, but might
               be expected to know the thoughts of Wellington[WellesleyArthurWellington] and his
               brother, Marquess Wellesley[WellesleyMarquis], on Spain as he was married to Wellesley’s
               daughter, Hyacinthe Mary (d. 1849).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               motion attacking the Church of Ireland on 4 March 1823 was heavily defeated in the
