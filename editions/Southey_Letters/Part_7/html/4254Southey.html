                  that I was obliged to keep the house, &amp; did not know for what cause. It was from haemorrhoids,
                  or a relaxation connected with them;

                  </div> at that time in such a state that I could not walk a mile without bleeding profusely.
                  This lasted for about a week, but after keeping house about as much longer that the
                  vessels might fairly close, I was enabled to resume <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> my regular exercise, – for in truth my habits are not so sedentary as you suppose.
                  I walk every day from one to two hours, unless the weather is too bad: &amp; not unfrequently
                  take a longer stretch, &amp; the longest time I ever remain at my desk <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> is from tea time till supper. My self-management has not been unsuccesful, – <span class="strikethrough">aftx</span> I learnt by experience long ago not to pursue any one subject – or train of thought,
                  so closely as to let it possess my mind &amp; disturb my rest: for whenever I have done
                  this, I have suffered for it. No man can be freer from <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> hypochondriacal fancies, or valetudinarian feelings. The evil to which I am subject
                  is that periodical catarrh which I must <span class="strikethrough">have</span> often have mentioned, occurring as surely &amp; as soon as the summer begins, &amp; continuing
                  ten or twelve weeks, latterly affecting the chest, &amp; this year for the first time, <span class="strikethrough">laying</span> fixing itself there somewhat obstinately. I escaped it the year when I went into Switzerland
                  at that season;

                  </div> &amp; I believe that my only chance of escaping it, is by travelling at the time of its
                  usual return: enabling the system by change of air &amp; excitement to resist its attack.
                  This I shall do if possible next year.

                  in my movements, – I cannot move without this great advantages, – that the very act
                  of travelling diminishes my means even more than it increases my expences. If my works
                  had proved as profitable to me as they ought to have been, &amp; as the world supposes,
                  it is likely that I should ere this have wound up my accounts with the public. Montaigne
                  liked better to forge his mind that to furnish it, he says:
