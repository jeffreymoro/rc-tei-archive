               St Lawrence, Exeter, and St John, Broadclyst. The patron of the latter church was
               Sir Thomas Acland, who was also a friend of Marriott. Southey had stayed with him
               on 6 January 1824 on his visit to the West Country. While he was on this trip, Southey
               received an anonymous poem, ‘The Poetic Epistle to Southey from his Cats’, which he
               liked and kept; it was later printed in <em>The Doctor</em>, 7 vols (London, 1834–1847), VII, pp. 580–582. Marriott is indeed the most likely

               ‘M<sup>r</sup> Caldicott’ was probably one of their six sons. The most likely candidate is William
