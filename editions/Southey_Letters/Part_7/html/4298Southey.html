                        Southey to John Taylor Coleridge, 21 December 1824 (Letter 4300) indicates that Southey

                           Southey believed this to refer to his Letters Written During a Short Residence in

               dismissed in 1807 for acting as the second in a duel. O’Meara’s conduct had been attacked
