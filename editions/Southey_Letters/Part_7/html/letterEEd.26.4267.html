               <p>I received yesterday the frank containing your letter and the first sheet of “Sir

                           writer on a huge range of subjects. ‘The Whole Works and Correspondence of Sir Thomas
                           Browne, Knt. M. D. of Norwich’ was at this time advertised as forthcoming with Longmans,
                           for example, in the London Courier and Evening Gazette, 2 October 1824. This was an
                           early indication of Simon Wilkin’s edition, which did not appear until 1835–1836,
                           though from the contents of this letter, he appears to have begun experimenting with
                           printing the book as early as 1824. Southey acquired a copy and it became no. 376

                  </div> It cannot be worth while to send that sheet back, as I have no remarks to make upon
                  it, further than to say that it is in every respect what could be wished. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilkinSimon">Mr. Wilkin</a> seems to have taken infinite pains in collecting editions and MSS., and nothing can
                  be better than the printing. It might be worth while to try whether or not the appearance
                  would be improved by printing the notes in columns. I am inclined to think it would
                  be pleasanter for the eye where the type is so small, and also as distinguishing them
                  in a more marked manner from the text.

                  </div> This might be tried upon a single page. I am quite certain that in a folio the eye
                  is less fatigued when the page is divided into columns, than when it has to move to
                  and fro along a long line; and the effect must be the same in small printing upon
                  an octavo page. A man thinks of these things as he approaches the age at which it
                  becomes necessary for him to economise his sight.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Having written so recently, I have nothing to add, except to request that you will
                  present my compliments to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilkinSimon">Mr. Wilkin</a>, and tell him I am very glad he has taken the edition into his own hands, for I verily
                  believe he will bestow upon it more diligence than any other person would or could
                  have done. I have no memoranda upon the subject which could be of any use to him,
                  but I will be of all the use I can when the work is published, and with the least
                  possible delay. I hope there will be a portrait, and the name given in an autograph.
