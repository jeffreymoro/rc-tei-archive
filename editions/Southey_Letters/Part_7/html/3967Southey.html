                           (1500–1558; Holy Roman Emperor 1519–1556) had imposed Habsburg authority in northern

                           Habsburgs had ruled Milan from 1707 and Tuscany from 1737. The Congress of Vienna
                           had allotted Lombardy and Venetia to Austria, while a junior branch of the Habsburgs
