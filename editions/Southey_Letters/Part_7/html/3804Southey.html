                           (STN). Ostervald was in Portugal in the 1790s and was secretary to the legation and

               <em>DNB</em>), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary 1771–1800, was in Britain. Ostervald
               was an old friend of Herbert Hill and Southey had written to him during his continental
               journey in 1817. This letter had produced some correspondence with Ostervald’s nephew,
               Jean Baptist Isaac Harlé (1773–1854), a merchant at St Quentin; see <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</em>, Southey to Herbert Hill, 15 March 1818, Letter 3093.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad
               on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland
               in his continental tour of May–August 1817. Byron believed he had subsequently spread
               rumours that Byron and Shelley engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence
               in Switzerland in 1816. Southey had responded by writing to the Editor of the <em>Courier</em>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776.
