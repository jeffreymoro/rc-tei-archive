               <p>Your letter would not have remained a single post unanswered – if it had been in my
                  power to have replied to it. But I found it yesterday on returning from the first

                  </div> seems to have been the natural &amp; ordinary termination of life, but with which not
                  one in ten thousand, – even of those who attain to a good old age, is now blest. You
                  have been fortunate in possessing her so long, – &amp; fortunate even in seeing her depart
                  before the infirmities of age became what they too frequently are, humiliating as
                  well as painful to humanity. This affliction – deep as it is, – has occurred in the
                  due course of nature it was neither unforeseen, nor untimely; – no human care, – no
                  circumstances could have averted, or delayed it. It is a grief which the heart can
                  endure to remember, – which has every thing to hallow it &amp; which time will soon ripen
                  so that it <span class="strikethrough">will</span> shall lose all its bitterness.</p>

                  </div> I have been very much shaken at the completion of mine. This is the third year in
                  which my annual catarrh has ended in a cough, &amp; this year the cough came on early,
                  lay deep, &amp; keeps still a lingering hold, – as if laying claim to its inheritance
                  tho not perhaps taking livery &amp; seizin of it as yet. The relaxation which this summer
                  visitation always brings on brought with it this year a most unpleasant symptom, –
                  that of a hæmorrhage from the rectum upon walking even a mile, – &amp; once indeed in
                  merely walking the room. I was at one time apprehensive that this would entirely have
                  confined me to the house, but a few cautious trials have given me hope. If I can bring
                  myself into a condition that will allow me to leave home, it is my full purpose next
                  spring to try whether I can avert the yearly attack by running away from it, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> frequent change of air &amp; much exercise – in a word travelling is the best chance –
                  &amp; I have almost promised the Bp of Limerick[Jebb] (who came here in the hope of taking
                  me to Ireland with him) – that I will visit him next May.
