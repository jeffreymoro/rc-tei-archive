                  </div> in a way which threatens to lay me up. As soon as the catarrh threw me out of condition,
                  the old complaint returned – a necessary consequence of relaxation. When it was proper
                  to use tonics, young Edmondson

                  </div> I gained strength, &amp; was getting in tone again, – well enough indeed to take a mountain
                  walk this day week, without any inconvenience. But on Saturday morning soon after
                  breakfast, as I was standing at one of the bookshelves, I felt myself bleeding, without
                  any previous pain or sensation in the part, &amp; a considerable discharge of blood took
                  place. Not being alarmed, &amp; thinking there was no danger of its return, I went about
                  three o clock to the lake side, – every thing having been prepared for dining that
                  day beside the water. When I reached the water the haemorrhage again came on, &amp; of
                  course I made the best of my way back. Sunday I kept house. Monday attempted to walk
                  &amp; having got as far as the turnpike was forced to turn back. Tuesday I laid by again,
                  – Wednesday (that is yesterday) ventured out in fear, &amp; yet got nearly to the How
                  &amp; back without mishap. To day I went out without apprehension, &amp; in <span class="strikethrough">far</span> less than ten minutes returned bleeding profusely. The blood flows fast, but soon
                  appears to stop. How this is to be prevented, or how remedied in this place, where
                  there is no surgical aid that can be trusted to except in common cases – I know not;
                  – nor do I suppose that you can tell me. But you will plainly see what a dilemma I
                  am in. Nothing but air &amp; exercise will put me in condition, – &amp; after so many trials
                  I shall not dare go beyond the garden, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> while this tendency to bleeding continues. It is the more unlucky because this is
                  precisely the time of the year when I should be in full exercise.</p>
