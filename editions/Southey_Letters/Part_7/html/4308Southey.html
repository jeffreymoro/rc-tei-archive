                           Lord Byron’, which contained a sustained attack on Southey. The latter consulted Turner
                           about possible legal action against the newspaper, but eventually decided not to proceed.</span></div>

                           a trial in which Southey could counter the paper’s attack on him under oath in court.
                           However, as this would be a private prosecution, Southey faced the possibility of
                           incurring heavy costs.</span></div>

                  has made them. He wishes to avoid any appearance of an attack on my part upon the
                  Press, &amp; the Morning Chronicle, whereas it appears to me that if I have an opportunity
                  of <span class="strikethrough">bringing that paper to justice</span> punishing that newspaper for its abuse of the press, I ought just as much to do it
                  in this case, as I would bring a fellow to justice for assaulting me on the highway.
                  Allowing them as large a latitude as they desire for political abuse, I would rest
                  solely upon the charge of impious &amp; blasphemous obscenities.

                  all bounds of political or even personal animosity. There can be no villainy of which
                  a man would not be capable, who is capable of bringing forward such charges upon such

                  longer, the Catholic Religion will show itself so plainly in its true colours every
                  where, that the broad distinction between Protestants &amp; Papists will place us in perfect
                  safety. But to the first question I answer without any hesitation that the concession
                  would most materially endanger the Church of England. An object which all the enemies
                  of that Church are united in seeking, must be injurious to it. The Dissenters – the
                  Whigs – the Liberals – what care they for the Catholics? they have their own views

               of a second article that appeared in <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 32 (June 1825), 1–42. This was (ostensibly) a review of <em>An Abstract of the Annual Reports and Correspondence of the Society for Promoting
