                           the Commons were at a loss what to do with him after two doctors reported he was of
                           unsound mind. He was eventually committed to Cold Bath Fields prison as a ‘dangerous
                           person’, where he remained until 1828. Gourlay was an eccentric farmer, statistician,
                           reformer and writer whose life was dominated by his attempt to vindicate himself over
                           his expulsion from Upper Canada in 1819.</span></div>
