               Kent was created in the early seventeenth century, in the beech trees near the keeper’s
               lodge, but it died out in the early nineteenth century. Heron started to fall out
               of fashion as a table bird in the late eighteenth century and maintained heronries

               in his youth – an event recorded in ‘Inscription for a Tablet at Penshurst, the birthplace
               of Sir Philip Sidney’, <em>Morning Post</em>, 7 December 1798.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
