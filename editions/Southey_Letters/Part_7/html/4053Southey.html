               <p>Much to my vexation, &amp; the more so, because it has been in some degree by my fault,
                  your letter of June 29 has only this day come to my hands. Reasons not worth explaining
                  here having made me put off my southern expedition from summer till the latter end
                  of autumn,

                  </div> I desired <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</a> to send me such letters as might be waiting for me, – in an official frank. Had this
                  been done yours would have arrived with little more delay than its circuitous route
                  would have occasioned. But instead of this he sent them by a private hand, &amp; they
                  have been Heaven knows where, in their course.</p>

               <p>I hope this will find you <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> at Leamington &amp; still with the intention of proceeding. We have had the worst weather
                  that I remember in this country; it is well that you have not been here to be imprisoned
                  by it; – &amp; we live in hopes of being recompensed for it by a fine autumn. I do not
                  believe you could find any air more restorative than that of these mountains. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">A very intimate friend of mine</a> had been very long &amp; dangerously affected with an inflammation of the liver.

                  was more shocked than when I first saw him. But I took him on the lake &amp; on the fells,
                  – &amp; the result was that in two months he went back, thoroughly recovered, &amp; has never
                  had the slightest recurrence of the complaint for thirteen years.</p>
