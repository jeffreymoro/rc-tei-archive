               <p>I am under the visitation of my annual cold, which condemns me for a great part of
                  every day to idleness. In the morning I do not rise before breakfast, because this
                  visitor rises with me, &amp; very soon afterwards I am fain to lie back on the sopha,
                  &amp; close my eyes, which have no complaint of their own, but are incapable of bearing
                  the light while the membrane which lines the nose &amp; the throat are in a state of such
                  extreme excitability. First I tried repose, – &amp; that almost long enough to disable
                  me from exertion, by putting me what is called out of condition; – then I tried exercise,
                  – &amp; am now again resigned to inaction &amp; a darkened room, with an upper lip which no
                  razor dare approach, &amp; a proboscis half excoriated by the frequent visits of the pockethandkerchief.
                  In 1799 when I had the first of these inveterate cararrhs (which I never failed to
                  have every year since, except when I was in Portugal) – I write an Ode, upon it being
                  at that time Poet Laureate to the Morning Post
