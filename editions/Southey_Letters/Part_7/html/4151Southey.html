            <p class="indent1">If you can render any assistance in furthering this subscription, I need not say that
               <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> it will be rendering me a service. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> will print 750 copies provided we can procure 200 subscribers to begin with. That
               we shall be able to do this I am by no means confident; but it must not fall to the
               ground for want of exertion on my part.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The plan was of my suggestion. The subject cannot be treated in any other way so well,
               for it includes the whole of the islands, &amp; therefore has neither national or territorial
               unity. At proper intervals I shall assist him with general views, – &amp; throughout with
               such materials &amp; remarks as my multifarious pursuits have brought within my reach.
               – It will be a very respectable book, bringing together a great deal of matter from
               scattered sources, &amp; filling up a portion of history which disgraceful as it is in
               every point of view to every nation whom it concerns, ought nevertheless to be known</p>

                  </div> – for which I have been obliged to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</a> ever since I have resided in this place. In the years 98 &amp; 99 I was his Poet Laureate

                  </div> That pay was then a great object to me; &amp; I must say of him that of all persons with

                  no longer receive it. I could very well be content with my weekly Westmorland Gazette,
