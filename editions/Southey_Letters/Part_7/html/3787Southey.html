                  </div> &amp; I perceive a consequence of the Convention of Cintra which has not (I believe) yet
                  been pointed out: – that Elvas (if not Almeida), would certainly have held out till
                  the dispersion of the Spanish armies, &amp; that a movement of the French to relieve it,
                  which would of course have been made, would have drawn them to Portugal in that direction,
                  at the time when we only waited for their approach, to abandon Lisbon. Severer terms
                  ought to have been imposed; but we did not then understand how to treat with the French;
                  – neither indeed did we learn it even when we had learnt to beat them thoroughly.
                  You will very soon see in what manner this transaction is treated; I hope &amp; think
                  you will find it in accord with your own feelings; – but if it appears erroneous or
                  unjust in any point, only let me know, &amp; I will reconsider it. For the chance of some
                  such suggestions I shall always detain the proof sheet till the third post, instead
