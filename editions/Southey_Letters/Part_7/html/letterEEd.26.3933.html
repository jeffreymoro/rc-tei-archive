                           Arbitration and Deposit, who adjudicated on claims by British citizens for loss of
                           property against the French government. Southey dined with him in Paris on 17 and

                  of the announcement of my undertaking. Certainly I shall derive more advantage from
                  these letters than from any other series of documents. You will therefore allow that
