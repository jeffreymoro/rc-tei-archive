               <p>Dear Sir, – Your little volume has been safely delivered to me by your friend Mr G.
                  Macdonald, and I thank you for it.

                  </div> It has given me great pleasure. To paraphrase sacred poetry is the most difficult
                  of all tasks, and it appears to me that you have been more successful in the attempt
                  than any of your predecessors. You may probably have heard that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeberReginald">the Bishop of Calcutta</a> (before he was appointed to that see) was engaged in forming a collection of hymns
                  and sacred pieces, with the hope of having them introduced into our English churches.

                  </div> Some of yours are so well adapted to that object that I will send out a copy of your
                  book to him.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Deprivations such as you speak of are our portion here. I hope what have fallen to
               my lot have had their natural and proper effect in loosening the ties that bind us
               to this world. That effect affliction has produced upon you also; and I cannot but
               wish that talents and feelings such as yours were employed in the ministry of the
               gospel, where you would find your happiness in the performance of your duty – you
               are young enough to think of this.</p>
