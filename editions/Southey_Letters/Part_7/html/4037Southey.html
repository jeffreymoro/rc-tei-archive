               tour of Scotland in August–September 1819. He wrote three ‘Inscriptions for the Caledonian
               Canal’: ‘Inscription for a Tablet at Banavie, on the Caledonian Canal’, <em>Friendship’s Offering. A Literary Album</em> (London, 1826), pp. [167]–168; and ‘At Clachnacharry’ and ‘At Fort Augustus’, <em>The Anniversary; or, Poetry and Prose for MDCCCXXIX</em> (London, 1829), pp. 194–197. Southey enclosed the last of these inscriptions with
               this letter.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               remarkable, and to invigorate the affections’. Southey quoted these lines in his <em>Poems</em> (Bristol, 1797), p. [54], as the epigraph to his series of eight inscriptions in
               the volume. His source was Edward Williams (1747–1826; <em>DNB</em>), <em>Poems: Lyrical and Pastoral</em>, 2 vols (London, 1794), II, p. 256. Triads are a rhetorical form found in medieval
               Welsh manuscripts; they group objects together in threes.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               The eighteen poems that were finished were grouped together in <em>Poetical Works</em>, 10 vols (London, 1837–1838), III, pp. 122–156.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               sixth stanza of ‘Scotland, an Ode’, lines 48–77. The poem was Southey’s New Year’s

               Southey was beginning to write his poem. Southey had hoped that Wellesley would be
               able to suppress rural disorder in Ireland, though there was little sign of this by
               July 1823.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               would have allowed English Catholics to vote in parliamentary elections (as Irish
               Catholics had been able to do since 1793). The Bill was defeated 80–73 in the House
               of Lords on 9 July 1823. Peel had supported the Bill in the House of Commons on 18
               June 1823.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               claimed there were 500,000 Catholics in England, a figure that would have represented
               more than twice the number of Methodists, if it was correct.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
