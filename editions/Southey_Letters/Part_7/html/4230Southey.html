                  </div> for the pleasure which I felt, after speaking, &amp; thinking &amp; dreaming of him as dead,
                  in hearing that he was likely to recover; – a pleasure worth all the previous pain,
                  – &amp; of that kind indeed that I know nothing which can be compared to it. When I was
                  within reach of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a>, we saw a great deal of each other; &amp; he is one of those friends from whose society
                  I have derived not merely temporary enjoyment, but permanent benefit. The chances
                  of life have separated us for many years, without in any degree weakening our mutual
                  regard; &amp; upon hearing of his death I felt that I had lost what in declining years
                  we can ill afford to part with, an object of esteem &amp; affection, – one of the friends
                  of my youth. Certainly I never received so much delight from any letter, as from that
                  which told &lt;me&gt; he was alive, &amp; recovering. – He is well enough to have left Oxford
                  for the house of his sister-in-law

                  </div> which looks as if it would have been efficacious, – if I could have taken it. But
                  in one respect my constitution is an unlucky one, –(we talk about constitutions <span class="strikethrough">now</span> you know in politics &amp; in medicine without knowing much about them) – the smallest
                  quantity of laudanum deranges the action of the liver, &amp; totally suspends the course
                  of the bile; – &amp; this of course cannot be done with impunity. Therefore I cannot venture
                  upon any prescription which contains laudanum, – tho that medicine, &amp; that alone I
                  believe, would cut short this obstinate catarrhal affection, on its annual appearance.
                  I am tolerably well recovered now, – tho still with some remains of cough; – but it
                  is no longer attended with a feverish pulse. &amp; as a proof that my strength has pretty
                  well returned, I took a six hours walk this morning, &amp; crost <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> on my return at about three parts of its elevation.</p>

                  </div> there are some weighty objections opposed to a very strong inclination. In the first
                  place I have many works in hand, (- you would think me a most rash &amp; audacious man
                  did you know how many) – &amp; am – this day – fifty years old: it is time therefore seriously
                  to ask myself what upon the common calculations of life I could possibly have time
                  to perform. And secondly were I to undertake such a view of our civil history, the
                  inconvenience of having no great library within reach could only be obviated by an
                  outlay in books which it would be very inconvenient for me to afford: for it has so
                  happened that no mans gains in this generation have been so little in proportion to
                  his reputation &amp; his labour as mine.</p>
