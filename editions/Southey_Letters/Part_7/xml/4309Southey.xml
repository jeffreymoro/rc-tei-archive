The Fellows then decided at their weekly meetings whether to elect the candidate. It was not a requirement to be a practising scientist and many Fellows were senior clergy, army or navy officers or lawyers. It was quite common for London physicians to become members and Henry Herbert Southey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 25 April 1825.</note>

He later served with the East India Company Army, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.

Arthur is not a good name, because the first r eats up the second. William is perhaps the most euphonious of all English names.</p>
