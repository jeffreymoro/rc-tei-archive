        <p rend="indent1">I am very much obliged to you for your aid at the Colonial Office.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey was investigating whether he might emigrate to Canada.</note> The next business is to learn what steps are to be taken, &#8211; understanding, as I do, that the promised facilities imply a grant of lands. Would not the best &amp; easiest method of proceeding be for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> S.</ref>to call upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilmot?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1821&#8211;1828 and an indefatigable promoter of emigration schemes. He was later Governor of Ceylon 1831&#8211;1837.</note> If you approve of this, have the goodness to say to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilmot that he will do so, &amp; give him a line (at 15 <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Q. Anne Street</ref>) to let him know that you have so done. Or advise me, if any other mode be better. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">I did not know that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Tom</ref> had written to Lord Bathurst,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst (1762&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1812&#8211;1827.</note> till your inclosure informed me of it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Burnets is a book which I should very much like to take for the subject of a paper.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Gilbert Burnet (1643&#8211;1715; <title>DNB</title>), <title>History of his own Time: from the Restoration of King Charles II, to the Conclusion of the Treaty of Peace at Utrecht, in the Reign of Queen Anne</title> (1724&#8211;1734). A new edition by Martin Routh (1755&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>) appeared in 1823, and was reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 29 (April 1823), 165&#8211;213, published 27&#8211;28 September 1823. The book was no. 498 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; You will not however be surprized that the more I look into English history, &#8211; the more I feel the want of an adequate historical library, &#8211; &amp; the consequent chasms in my knowledge of its different periods. &#8211; At this time I grievously feel the want of a Corpus Hist.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A &#8216;corpus historicus&#8217;, or body of history, i.e. a state-sponsored series of publications of British historical documents.</note>
