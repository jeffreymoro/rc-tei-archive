        <p rend="indent1">I have to thank you for a brace of Pheasants, which reached me this day, &amp; for your obliging note. It is very gratifying to me that my letter in the Courier appears to have been felt as it was intended.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">In the &#8216;Appendix&#8217; to &#8216;The Two Foscari&#8217;, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: &#8216;I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey&#8217;s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.&#8217; Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May&#8211;August 1817. The &#8216;calumnies&#8217; Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a &#8216;League of Incest&#8217; during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. Southey had responded by writing to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. His letter was published in the <title>Courier</title> on 11 January 1822.</note> Had it not been for the sake of again pointing out in strong terms the abominable tendency &amp; purpose of <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</ref> writings, I should no more have thought of noticing his coarse &amp; insolent charges against me, than of replying to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HoneWilliam">Hone</ref> or <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref>. He has sent over for publication viler things than have yet appeared<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), a parody of Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), was first published in the <title>Liberal</title>, 1 (October 1822), 3&#8211;39; and <title>Heaven and Earth; a Mystery</title> in the <title>Liberal</title>, 2 (January 1823), 165&#8211;206. Murray had declined to publish them.</note> &amp; such as no bookseller will venture to touch, unless he be one of the <hi rend="ital">ames damn&#233;es</hi>
