        <p rend="indent1">I have been writing to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> to procure <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom&#8217;s</ref> credentials for Canada, without delay. A vessel sails from Maryport, on the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of April, in which he talks of embarking, to reconnoitre the land, &amp; prepare the way for his family.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">In fact, Tom Southey sailed from Whitehaven on 20 April 1823 on the brig <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> and reached Quebec on 27 May. He investigated emigrating to Canada but decided against this option. </note> That there was no other possible course for him to pursue, I have long perceived, without overlooking the difficulties in this. But it is a course, which in his circumstances I should certainly long ago have pursued. This however does not lighten the weight <del>which such</del> with which it lies upon my spirits.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Yesterday I heard from Knox,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John William Knox (1784&#8211;1862), clergyman, scholar and usher at Westminster School 1806&#8211;1821.</note> on his arrival in London. Perhaps you will have seen him ere this reaches you; as he announced his intention of walking to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref> as soon as he should have settled himself in town quarters. From him I hear that <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> was fifth in the challenge; &#8211; if so, there is little doubt of his getting in.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Hill had taken &#8216;The Challenge&#8217;, a gruelling examination at Westminster School to select the school&#8217;s King&#8217;s Scholars. This position had considerable advantages, including the right to proceed to a Closed Scholarship at either Trinity College, Cambridge, or Christ Church, Oxford. Usually, ten boys were chosen each year, so Edward Hill was guaranteed a place.</note>

        <p rend="indent1">I cannot yet see the time of my departure,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was planning a journey to London but did not leave until 3 November 1823.</note> but am working strenuously towards that end. As usual my book<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> grows under my hands, &amp; what was intended for a small duodecimo, will be a full sized octavo volume; &#8211; - a good &amp; useful one, I really hope.
                  Probably I shall bring some work with me to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>. So many persons have asked me about Spanish affairs, that I have asked <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> whether he wishes me to take up the subject; if he replies in the affirmative, I shall begin the paper here, &amp; finish it under your roof, &#8211; which will be no trifling advantage.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this article for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note>
