        <p rend="indent1">Both your Dedications are very good, &#8211; the second very beautiful, tho a little hurt by the alteration, &#8211; the alteration however is advisable, &#8211; not that it would give offence, but that it is right to avoid any thing which might maliciously be pointed out as offensive.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton, <title>Napoleon and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), p. [v], was dedicated to George IV. Barton had asked Southey&#8217;s advice about the dedication; see Southey to Bernard Barton, 18 August 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

        <p rend="indent1"> I was much pleased with the Poets Lot, &#8211; no, &#8211; not with his lot, &#8211; but with the verses in which he describes it. But let me ask you, &#8211; are you not pursuing your studies intemperately, &amp; to the danger of your health?? To be writing &#8220;long after midnight&#8221;, &amp; &#8220;with a miserable headache&#8221; <del>xxx</del> is what no man can do with impunity; &amp; what no pressure of business, no ardour of composition, has ever made me do.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;The Poet&#8217;s Lot&#8217; was not published until <title>Poetic Vigils</title> (London, 1824), pp. 111&#8211;117; it did not include the lines to which Southey objected.</note> I beseech you remember the fate of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke White</ref>; &#8211; &amp; remember that if you sacrifice your health (not to say your life) in the same manner, you will be held up in your own community as a Warning, &#8211; not as an example for imitation.

        <p rend="indent1"> You will take this as it is meant, I am sure.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My friend, go early to bed: &#8211; &amp; if you eat suppers, read afterwards but never compose, that you may lie down <del>xx</del> with a quiet intellect.
