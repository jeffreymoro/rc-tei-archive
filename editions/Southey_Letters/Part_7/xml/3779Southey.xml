               Note on MS: This letter originally enclosed Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 6 January 1822, Letter 3778. This was left unsealed to allow Rickman to read Southey&#8217;s letter to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776, which was itself enclosed in the letter to Bedford.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">I send the inclosure open,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 6 January 1822, Letter 3778, and its enclosure Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776.</note> that you may see in what manner I have dealt with <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref>, &#8211; who may now properly be called the <hi rend="ital">Avenger of Abel</hi>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In the &#8216;Appendix&#8217; to &#8216;The Two Foscari&#8217;, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: &#8216;I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey&#8217;s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.&#8217; Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May&#8211;August 1817. The &#8216;calumnies&#8217; Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a &#8216;League of Incest&#8217; during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. For Southey&#8217;s response, see Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. The letter appeared in the <title>Courier</title> on 11 January 1822. In <title>Genesis</title> 4: 1&#8211;16, Abel was murdered by his brother, Cain. Southey probably means that Byron had tried to justify Cain by writing <title>Cain, A Mystery</title>, but the poem was so disreputable it had instead avenged Abel.</note> You have I hope seen his attack. If he returns to it, I have more stones from the brook, &amp; my aim is sure.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1 <title>Samuel</title> 17: 40, David chose &#8216;five smooth stones out of the brook&#8217; to hurl from the sling which he used to kill Goliath, the giant Philistine warrior.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are works of his come over for publication which are so bad (<hi rend="ital">even after D Juan</hi>) that <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> will not touch them.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819&#8211;1824), the first two cantos of which were published anonymously by Murray on 15 July 1819. The &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, which attacked Southey and others, was suppressed, though it soon became well-known. Murray had, however, declined to publish Byron&#8217;s play &#8216;Heaven and Earth&#8217; with <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821). He was also hesitating over whether to publish Byron&#8217;s <title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), a parody of Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821); eventually, it was published by John Hunt (1775&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>) in <title>The Liberal</title>, 1 (October 1822), 3&#8211;39.</note> This I hear from <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>.

          <p rend="indent1">This will follow you I suppose into Sussex &#8211; but time is of no consequence. <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">His</ref> attack has been published in our <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Broughamite</ref> papers.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron&#8217;s criticism of Southey in his &#8216;Appendix&#8217; to &#8216;The Two Foscari&#8217; had been widely published in opposition newspapers, including the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 19 December 1821 and the <title>Examiner</title>, 726 (23 December 1821), 810. Southey had first seen it in his local Whig paper, <title>Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle</title>, 29 December 1821.</note> They I suppose will not insert my reply, &#8211; but I will take care that his attack shall appear in the opposite paper with it, having as much to gain by bringing them together as he has to lose.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">By &#8216;opposite paper&#8217; Southey means the pro-government <title>Westmorland Gazette</title>, the main local rival to the Whiggish <title>Westmorland Advertiser</title>. On 12 January 1822, the <title>Westmorland Gazette</title> printed both Southey&#8217;s denunciation of &#8216;the Satanic School&#8217; of modern poetry from <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), &#8216;Preface&#8217;, pp. xvii&#8211;xxii, and an extract from Byron&#8217;s attack on Southey in the &#8216;Appendix&#8217; to the &#8216;Two Foscari&#8217;. Southey&#8217;s response to the latter, his letter to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776, was then printed in the <title>Westmorland Gazette</title> on 19 January 1822. This was done after a direct request from Southey to the newspaper; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 6 January 1822, Letter 3778.</note>
