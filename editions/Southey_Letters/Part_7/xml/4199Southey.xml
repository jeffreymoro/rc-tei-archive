        <p rend="indent1">Your welcome letter of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> would have been more welcome, if its contents had not led me to infer that you have no intention of visiting the Island this summer. Had you been here last year, you might have obtained full information concerning Jersey from <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesCaroline">Miss Bowles</ref>, who is by the mothers side of Jersey parentage.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles&#8217;s mother was Anne Burrard (1753&#8211;1817), the daughter of Madeleine Ann Durell (1728&#8211;1792) of Jersey. Madeleine Ann Durell&#8217;s parents were Jean Durell (1704&#8211;1739), Advocate-General of Jersey 1726&#8211;1739, and Anne Le Cloche (1709&#8211;1789), heiress of Longueville Manor. Caroline Bowles grew up in a household that included her grandmother, Madeleine Ann Durell, and great-grandmother, Anne Le Cloche, both of whom were bilingual in French and English.</note> By <hi rend="ital">her</hi> account I believe it is a delightful place, but where a state of happy &amp; enviable simplicity has of late years been altered without being improved. I am acquainted with only one account of this &amp; the neighbourhood Island, &amp; that account is nearly 200 years old, having been drawn up by Peter Heylyn,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Heylyn (1600&#8211;1662; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Survey of the Estate of France and Some of the Adjoyning Ilands</title> (1656), no. 1187 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. This work included an account of the Channel Islands that Heylyn wrote while he was chaplain to Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby (1573&#8211;1643; <title>DNB</title>), Governor of Guernsey 1621&#8211;1644. It was on Danby&#8217;s recommendation to William Laud (1573&#8211;1645; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of London 1628&#8211;1633, Archbishop of Canterbury 1633&#8211;1645, that Heylyn was appointed a chaplain to Charles I (1600&#8211;1649; King of Great Britain 1625&#8211;1649; <title>DNB</title>) in 1630.</note> &amp; presented by him to Laud then Bp of London. It is historical, political &amp; ecclesiastical, &amp; Laud approved of it so highly that he recommended the Author to be one of the Kings Chaplains. This is a very able book, &amp; I have reason to regret that I had not read it before my Book of the Church<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> was published, &#8211; as it contains something of importance which must be inserted in some future edition of that work. &#8211; I am not acquainted with any <del>other</del> thing else upon the subject, except that there is an Account of Guernsey &amp; the other Channel Islands, by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Macculloch, in the first volume of the Geological Transactions, published in 1811.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John MacCulloch (1773&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>), &#8216;Account of Guernsey, and the other Channel Islands&#8217;, <title>Transactions of the Geological Society</title>, 1st series, 1 (1811), 1&#8211;22.</note> Probably this is merely a mineralogical paper; it may however be worth while to look at it, &amp; it is a book which you will be sure to find in the library of the Royal Institution.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Library of the Royal Institution of Great Britain (founded 1799) in Albemarle Street, London.</note> There is a new establishment of this kind, called the Metropolitan Literary Institution,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The Metropolitan Literary Institution was founded in 1823 at 6 Chatham Place, London. Members could take advantage of a circulating and a reference library and a reading room, and attend lectures by invited speakers. Its Honorary Secretary was James Jennings.</note> &amp; they have been pleased to elect me an honorary member. To a person resident in town this might be of some advantage, &amp; I wish the usufruct could be transferred to some one who might profit by it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  I am much obliged to you on the score of my brothers[Southey,Tom] book,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was seeking subscribers for Tom Southey, <title>Chronological History of the West Indies</title> (1827).</note> &amp; should have to send his acknowledgements &amp; kind remembrances, if I had seen him since yours of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> arrived. For myself, I have been now ten days a close prisoner with my annual catarrh, which has made its attack this year with its usual violence; but as its course has been more rapid than usual, I hope its departure will be proportionally speedier. It laid me up for the greater part of <del>the</del> a week upon the Sopha, in a darkened room, &amp; this is the first day that I have been able to pursue my wonted employments without intermission. It <del>hxxx xxxxx</del> is in my chest that I feel it now, where I trust it is not likely to remain long, &#8211; but it will be some time before I shall get into good condition, [MS missing] relaxed.</p>
