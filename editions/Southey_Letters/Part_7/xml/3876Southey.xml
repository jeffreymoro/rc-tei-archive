        <p rend="indent1">It seems an age since I have seen your handwriting. You see mine for this reason; the printer has now commenced upon my concluding chapter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 15, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 756&#8211;806. Thomas Davison (1766&#8211;1831) was the book&#8217;s printer. The chapter concerned the British army&#8217;s retreat to Corunna in 1808&#8211;1809 under the command of Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), in which Courtenay had participated.</note> which contains Sir J Moores Campaign, &amp; I have desired that proof may be sent to you &#8211; which you will send to <ref type="m" target="people.html#CourtenayThomas">Courtenay</ref>. If he has any remarks to make upon them, I will weigh them well, &#8211; &amp; shall for the chance of receiving them, keep my proofs 48 hours instead of 24. I do not anticipate any corrections of importance but shall be glad to correct even the smallest error or inaccuracy. Time &amp; reflection have only confirmed my first views of that miserable campaign; &#8211; &amp; I have had very little to alter in the narrative as it was given in the Ed. An.

[iii]: &#8216;It is with peculiar fitness, as well as with pleasure, that I inscribe to your Majesty a History of the most glorious war recorded in the British annals./When the Regency devolved into your hands, the fortunes of our allies were at their lowest ebb, and neither arts nor efforts were spared for making the spirit of this country sink with them. At that momentous crisis every thing depended, under Providence, upon your single determination; and to that determination Great Britain is beholden for its triumph, and Europe for its deliverance./To your Majesty, therefore, this faithful History is offered, as a portion of the tribute due to a just, magnanimous, and splendid reign, and as a proof of individual respect and gratitude from/Your Majesty&#8217;s/Most dutiful subject and servant,/ROBERT SOUTHEY.&#8217; The Preface was on pp. [v]&#8211;vi.</note>
