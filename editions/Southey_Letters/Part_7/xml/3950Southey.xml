        <p rend="indent1">I send you a long biographical letter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 8 January 1823, Letter 3949.</note> &#8211; inconveniently interlined &amp; interpolated. However tho unsightly it is not I believe more illegible than usual. The next letter<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 10&#8211;19 January 1823, Letter 3951, though Southey did not discuss his earliest compositions until he wrote to John May on 29 June 1824, Letter 4208.</note> will touch upon my earliest studies &amp; compositions. We have got on very slowly hitherto, &amp; yet some progress has been made, &#8211; I am surprized to see how much, in looking at my transcribed copy.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">No news as yet of the strong beer, &#8211; but I live in daily hope. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">Our last news of the travellers was that they were to be at Highgate<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Sara</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara Coleridge</ref> were on an extended journey during which they visited <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</ref> at Highgate in January 1823.</note> on New Years Day. &#8211; Many happy new years to you &amp; yours.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">We are all going on well, God be thanked. I am working hard at the B of the Church,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> &#8211; at my second volume, &#8211; &amp; now &#8211; <hi rend="ital">pei mihi</hi>!<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;oh my!&#8217;</note> at reviewing, &#8211; as the time comes round. But in the present case I have no right to complain, for taking Gregoires history of the Theophilanthropists<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Henri Gr&#233;goire (1750&#8211;1831), &#8216;Histoire de la Th&#233;ophilantropie, depuis sa Naissance jusqu&#8217;&#224; son Extinction&#8217;, part of Gr&#233;goire&#8217;s <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu&#8217;a l&#8217;Epoque Actuelle, sont N&#233;es, se sont Modifi&#233;es, se sont &#201;teintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title>, 2 vols (Paris, 1814), II, pp. 55&#8211;171, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 493&#8211;536, published 8 July 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Theophilanthropy was a deistic religion that was particularly prominent in France in 1797&#8211;1799.</note> to begin with, I mean to offer some remarks upon infidelity, which I hope may do less discredit to the QR, &amp; prove more useful to those who need it, than the late discourse upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref>, which needed nothing but a text to make it read like a dull sermon.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The review of Byron&#8217;s <title>Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice. An Historical Tragedy, in Five Acts. With Notes. The Prophecy of Dante, a Poem</title> (1821) and <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy.
