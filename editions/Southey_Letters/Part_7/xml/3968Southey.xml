<salute>My dear G.</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Your letter comes in aid of a purpose which I had entertained of putting together what I have said upon the Catholic question in the Ed. An. Register, re-casting it, &#38; publishing it with some needful additions, in the form of a pamphlett.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not publish this pamphlet, but <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 7–12, 104–132, and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title>, 4.1 (1813), 115–139, were eventually recast and published in <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), II, as Essays XI and XII, ‘On the Catholic Question’, pp. [277]–328. Southey was totally opposed to equal political rights for Catholics.</note> About a week ago I put down in my note-book the first sketch of an arrangement; &#38; actually began to <del>piece or compose xxx fragments which</del> compose what I have to say, <del>in fox</del> as a letter to some M.P. Not that it was meant to be addressed to any individual one; but having argued with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">Wilberforce</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#AclandThomasSir">Sir Thomas Acland</ref> upon this subject,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Edith Southey, 28 April 1817, <title>Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 2981.</note> I knew in what light they considered it. The course which affairs have taken in Ireland<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">There was persistent unrest in rural Ireland 1821–1824.</note> will probably have the good effect of quashing the question for this year; &#38; in that hope I am willing to postpone my own purpose till a season which may be more convenient to myself, &#38; when aid of this kind may be more needed.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">The arguments lie in a nutshell. The <del>law</del> &#60;restraints&#62; which exclude<del>s</del> the Catholics from political power<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Test Act (1673) confined public office to communicants of the Church of England.</note> <del>xx</del> &#60;are&#62; not the cause of the perpetual disorders in Ireland, – their removal therefore cannot be the cure. Suppose the question carried, two other grow from it, – like two heads from the hydras neck when one is amputated: – a Catholic establishment for Ireland, at which Irish Catholics <hi rend="ital">must</hi> aim, &#38; which those who desire rebellion &#38; separation will promote, – a rebellion must be the sure consequence of agitating this. The people in Ireland care nothing for the Emancipation, – why the Devil should they? but make it a question for restoring the Catholic Church, &#38; they will enter into it as zealously as ever our ancestors did into a crusade.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The other question arises as home, &#38; brings with it worse consequences than any thing which can happen among the potatoes. The repeal of the Test Act will be demanded, &#38; must be granted. Immediately the Dissenters will get into the Corporations – every where: <hi rend="ital">their</hi> members will be returned; men as hostile to the Church &#38; to the Monarchy as ever were the Puritans of Charles’s age;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles I (1600–1649; King of Great Britain 1625–1649; <title>DNB</title>).</note> – the Church property will <del>then</del> be attacked in Parliament, as it is now at mob-meetings, &#38; in radical newspapers: reform in Parliament will be carried, – &#38; then – farewell a long farewell to all our greatness. – I, who see what is coming, shall have time to determine whether I will quit the kingdom, or stay in it &#38; be hanged: – &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> will either lose his senses or break his heart at the miserable consequences of his own infatuation.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn favoured Catholic Emancipation.</note></p>
	<p rend="indent1">My belief is that if we can stave off this question &#38; that of reform for the next ten years, the country will be tired of both, especially as it becomes prosperous – And if those who think rightly will exert themselves in Parliament, &#38; out of Parliament, I, for one, will do my duty strenuously &#38; perseveringly.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">Our constitution consists of Church &#38; State, &#38; it is an absurdity in politics to give those persons power in the <hi rend="ital">state</hi>, whose duty it is to subvert the <hi rend="ital">Church</hi>. This argument is unanswerable. – I am in good hopes that my Book of the Ch.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> will do yeomans service upon the question.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Thank you for the Cup – which I shall be very proud of. I shall call it <hi rend="ital">the Bedford-cup</hi>, &#38; endeavor to believe that Benvenuto Cellini<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571), Italian sculptor. Bedford possessed a glass cup of which he was immensely proud and which he believed to be the work of Cellini. He had ordered a copy to be made for Southey.</note> was the sculptor who made it. Pray get it packed &#38; send it me with “<hi rend="ital">glass</hi>” written on it &#38; moreover “<hi rend="ital">with care</hi>”. the mail from <ref type="m" target="places.html#BullandMouth">the Bull &#38; Mouth</ref> will be a safer conveyance that the wagon, because it will go upon springs.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have not time to enter upon the question of Spain<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">In Spain the liberal Constitution of 1812 had been restored by a military revolt in 1820.
