        <p rend="indent1">In the hope &amp; expectation of seeing you soon, (&amp; the sooner the better) I will ask you to pay <ref type="m" target="people.html#MorrisonJohn">Morrison</ref> for me the sum of six pounds, seventeen shillings, &#8211; being the balance of my half years rent, &#8211; after deducting 13 shillings for roof repair, &#8211; &amp; 30&#163; expended at this time by an agreement with the Landlord,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Tolson, Jnr (1756&#8211;1842), a commission agent in Liverpool and the owner since 1815 of Greta Hall.</note> of which he (<ref type="m" target="people.html#MorrisonJohn">Morrison</ref>) has been apprized. &#8211; The balance is less than I like to draw for, &#8211; &amp; an awkward sum to send, &#8211; where there is no direct carrier to whom it may be entrusted.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The packet which you brought for me, containing some interesting communications concerning the campaigns of 1809 &amp; 1810 in Portugal, &#8211; from Sir Nicolas Trant,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Brigadier-General Nicholas Trant (1769&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>), an Irish army officer who was assigned to command Portuguese forces. He served with distinction in many actions in the Peninsular War 1808&#8211;1813.</note> who performed the good service of occupying Coimbra after the battle of Busaco,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">After the Battle of Bussaco (27 September 1810), French forces continued to advance on the defensive Lines of Torres Vedras, leaving their sick and wounded at Coimbra. Trant re-occupied the city on 6 October and acted as its governor throughout the winter, while the French retreated to wait out the bad weather. He then played a major role in forcing the French Army to abandon its plans to occupy central Portugal and instead leave for Spain in March 1811.</note> &amp; thereby securing the most fertile provinces from the French.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The change of weather commenced just on your return. We had the finest month of April that I ever remember in this country, &#8211; they had rain on seventeen days out of the thirty, at Kendal, &#8211; &amp; certainly we had it not on seven at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. But this week has been almost one continued storm, &#8211; the waters are out &amp; many acres have just been sown in time to lose the seed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">You will come I hope as soon as the weather becomes good &#8211; I shall enjoy a little laking &amp; mountaineering with you. &#8211; We expect <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> in a few days. They have made a long progress, &amp; I shall not begin mine till July, &#8211; the book<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> which was to have been one volume, having grown into two. This sort of work is something like building a house, &#8211; the cost is very apt to <del>double</del> &lt;exceed&gt; the estimate twofold.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The aspects on the continent are not favourable for your plans.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">France had invaded Spain on 7 April 1823.</note> &#8211; When armies are in motion, or even on foot, there is no knowing how far the inconvenience which they occasion extends. I had once after a long &amp; fatiguing days journey in the mountains, to ride about the streets of a popular city (Tavira) from house to house, begging a nights lodging <hi rend="ital">por amor de Dios e Maria Santissima</hi>,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;for the love of God and Most Holy Mary&#8217;.</note> &#8211; because the place was full of soldiers.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">This incident occurred on 15 April 1801, while Southey was travelling in Portugal, at a time of tension on the border between Spain and Portugal (<title>Robert Southey: Journals of a Residence in Portugal 1800&#8211;1801 and a Visit to France 1838</title> (Oxford, 1960), ed. Adolfo Cabral, pp. 42&#8211;43).</note> And we were literally in danger of passing the night in the streets. Our kindest remembrances to all your friends -</p>
        <p>
          God bless you &#8211; <lb/>
          yrs affectionately<lb/>
