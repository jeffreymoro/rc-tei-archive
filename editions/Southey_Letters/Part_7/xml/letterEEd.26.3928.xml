        <p rend="indent1"> You will deliver me from one of the evils of this world if you will send me some money.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">It is a long while since I have heard from you, &#8211; or indeed from any person in town. My last news of poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> was a report from <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> that he was still very ill, &#8211; &amp; the last notice I had of the QR was in a letter from &#8211; the Lands end, saying it was all but settled that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> should become the editor &#8211; but this was good authority coming from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref>, who is as intimate with him as I am with you. &#8211; However desirable it <del>may be</del> might be for me to have obtained a certain income adequate to my expenditure (&amp; God knows desirable it would be!) yet I am perfectly satisfied that I decided rightly in not seeking to obtain the editorship for myself; &amp; of this I believe the few persons by whose judgement I could wish to have my own confirmed, agree with me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will tell <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> whither to send a copy of my first volume for Mackenzie,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832), for Colin Alexander Mackenzie (1778?&#8211;1851), a wealthy Scot who was employed on a number of delicate diplomatic missions and may well have been a government spy. In 1815 he was appointed one of the Commissioners of Liquidation, Arbitration and Deposit, who adjudicated on claims by British citizens for loss of property against the French government. Southey dined with him in Paris on 17 and 19 May 1817 and Mackenzie provided information for Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>.</note> &#8211; there is also &lt;one&gt; placed at your disposal for Gen. Hawker as an acknowledgement for the use of his sketches.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Major-General Samuel Hawker (1763&#8211;1838), who had served in the Peninsular War  between 1808 and 1811 as commander of the 14th Light Dragoons. His sketches were used in <title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey&#8217;s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &amp;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These pictures could be inserted into the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &#8211; The concluding sheets from p 745 &#8211; with the preface &amp;c have never reached me, &#8211; if therefore they ever past thro your hands, they have been lost on the way, &#8211; which I am sorry for, as they spoil a copy. &#8211; I think you will like the Dedication which says a great deal in few words.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, p. [iii]: &#8216;It is with peculiar fitness, as well as with pleasure, that I inscribe to your Majesty [George IV] a History of the most glorious war recorded in the British annals./ When the Regency devolved into your hands, the fortunes of our allies were at their lowest ebb, and neither arts nor efforts were spared for making the spirit of this country sink with them. At that momentous crisis every thing depended, under Providence, upon your single determination; and to that determination Great Britain is beholden for its triumph, and Europe for its deliverance./ To your Majesty, therefore, this faithful History is offered, as a portion of the tribute due to a just, magnanimous, and splendid reign, and as a proof of individual respect and gratitude from/ Your Majesty&#8217;s/ Most dutiful subject and servant,/ ROBERT SOUTHEY.&#8217;</note>

The stanza is to my ear singularly pleasing; &#8211; the verses not discreditable, <del>xxxxx</del> the utmost that can be expected in compositions of this kind, &#8211; which differ from impositions, only as a forced loan does from a tax. That family shows me great civilities, which I acknowledge so much less that I ought to do in the way of visiting them that I was the more ready to show my sense of their attention in this manner.</p>
