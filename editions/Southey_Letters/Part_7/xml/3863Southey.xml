           <salute> My dear Sir</salute></opener>
           <p rend="indent1"> I return with the proof, the duplicate revise, which came instead of it, several weeks ago.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A proof of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the books. I do not wonder at Irvings success.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Murray had sent Southey a copy of Washington Irving (1783–1859), <title>Bracebridge Hall, or The Humorists. A Medley</title> (1822).</note> He is a remarkably agreable writer, – &#38; writes with a feeling &#38; temper which ought to conciliate every reader.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> With regard to Jeremy Taylor,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Jeremy Taylor (1613–1667; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Down and Connor and of Dromore 1661–1667 and a writer whom Southey greatly admired. He did not write a book on Taylor, but Reginald Heber published <title>The Whole Works of the Right Rev. Jeremy Taylor, D.D., Lord Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore: with a Life of the Author, and a Critical Examination of his Writings</title> (1822), no. 2782 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> I hesitate for two reasons. First because it is one of those subjects by which more expectations are raised than it is easy, or perhaps possible, to fulfill: &#38; this I am afraid from what I hear <ref type="m" target="people.html#HeberReginald">Reginald Heber</ref> will find. There is not enough known of Taylor to make his life interesting by the course of events, or any personal feeling that can be excited; &#38; the task of delineating his intellectual character is a presumptuous one, from which the most confident writer might well shrink</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> You have pointed out the best course which could be taken, – that of bringing into view the great clerical character of his age. But here my second cause of hesitation applies, – I am not within reach of their works, – &#38; should not feel myself competent to enter upon that subject unless I were to spend a week in a library of old divinity. On this subject I know enough to know where &#38; how far I am deficient.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteJosephBlanco">Blanco Whites</ref> book has found its way to me. A very good book it is, &#38; will give me a good text.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Letters from Spain by Don Leucadio Doblado</title> (1822). Southey did not review it for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">During my indisposition when I was unable to do any thing else, I got on with transcribing my Colloquies.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> This is a book of which I wish to have the whole ready before it goes to press, that it may have the advantage of being seen by one or two persons whose comments may enable me to improve it.</p>
