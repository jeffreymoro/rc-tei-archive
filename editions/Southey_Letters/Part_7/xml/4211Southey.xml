          <salute>    My dear G.</salute>

        <p rend="indent1">Your letter gave me as much surprize as hope, for I had heard that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> was dead,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been misinformed on this subject by Mary Ann Watts Hughes.</note> &#8211; &amp; you may very well suppose had been thinking of him by day &amp; by night. &#8211; I shall look for your next letter with great <del>anxiet</del> anxiety.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  Since I wrote last I have been &amp; indeed continue to be on the sick list. My annual catarrh has settled into a cough, which tho in itself not very troublesome, lies deep, &amp; is accompanied with a feverish pulse. In this state it has been for some six weeks, &amp; what with starving, want of exercise when the catarrh made me incapable of bearing the light, &amp; physicking, it will I fear be more than tonics are able to do (when I can venture to take them), to bring me into condition again this season. &#8211; Your appearance would do me more good than any thing else. What I told you respecting as the French would say, <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswicks</ref> being brought one night nearer to London, relates to the journey up: The mail which used to arrive in town about six in the morning arriving now between nine &amp; ten at night. If you wish to escape a night on the road in coming down you should take the day coach to Grantham, or Stamford: but then there is the chance of not finding a place next morning in the Carlisle Mail. &#8211; When you reach Penrith, you will find a Mail Coach starting from thence for Whitehaven; which will give you time to wash, shave &amp; breakfast, &amp; deposit you here a little before twelve o clock.</p>

There was a bookbinder here,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Crampton (c. 1785&#8211;1843), a Keswick bookseller, had obtained a copper plate to forge one-guinea banknotes of the Whitehaven Bank of Johnston, Adamson, Hope &amp; Co.

The fellow fancied it would be a better trade to make Whitehaven Bills than to vamp old books, &#8211; accordingly he procured a plate from <del>Bxxx</del> Birmingham, set to work, was detected before he <del>xx</del> could set half a dozen notes in circulation, &amp; is now upon the stool of repentance in Carlisle jail, waiting for the Assizes to know whether he shall be hanged or transported for life. &#8220;I could have better spared a better man&#8221;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
