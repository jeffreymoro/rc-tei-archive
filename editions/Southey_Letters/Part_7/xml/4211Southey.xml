        <salute>    My dear G.</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Your letter gave me as much surprize as hope, for I had heard that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> was dead,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been misinformed on this subject by Mary Ann Watts Hughes.</note> – &#38; you may very well suppose had been thinking of him by day &#38; by night. – I shall look for your next letter with great <del>anxiet</del> anxiety.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">  Since I wrote last I have been &#38; indeed continue to be on the sick list. My annual catarrh has settled into a cough, which tho in itself not very troublesome, lies deep, &#38; is accompanied with a feverish pulse. In this state it has been for some six weeks, &#38; what with starving, want of exercise when the catarrh made me incapable of bearing the light, &#38; physicking, it will I fear be more than tonics are able to do (when I can venture to take them), to bring me into condition again this season. – Your appearance would do me more good than any thing else. What I told you respecting as the French would say, <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswicks</ref> being brought one night nearer to London, relates to the journey up: The mail which used to arrive in town about six in the morning arriving now between nine &#38; ten at night. If you wish to escape a night on the road in coming down you should take the day coach to Grantham, or Stamford: but then there is the chance of not finding a place next morning in the Carlisle Mail. – When you reach Penrith, you will find a Mail Coach starting from thence for Whitehaven; which will give you time to wash, shave &#38; breakfast, &#38; deposit you here a little before twelve o clock.</p>

          <p rend="indent1">  <del>There has been</del> &#60;We have had&#62; a forgery here also,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford reported to Southey in a letter of 4 July 1824 that he had uncovered an instance of fraud in his work at the Audit Office.</note> – &#38; in one of my departments, – which tho it gives me none of the sort of anxiety that you have suffered, will deprive me of a very useful person. There was a bookbinder here,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Crampton (c. 1785–1843), a Keswick bookseller, had obtained a copper plate to forge one-guinea banknotes of the Whitehaven Bank of Johnston, Adamson, Hope &#38; Co. He was condemned to death at Carlisle Assizes on 26 August 1824 but recommended to mercy and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.</note> whom I was employing to mend &#38; letter old books &#38; – so by little &#38; little to bring my ragged regiments into a state of discipline &#38; equipment. The fellow fancied it would be a better trade to make Whitehaven Bills than to vamp old books, – accordingly he procured a plate from <del>Bxxx</del> Birmingham, set to work, was detected before he <del>xx</del> could set half a dozen notes in circulation, &#38; is now upon the stool of repentance in Carlisle jail, waiting for the Assizes to know whether he shall be hanged or transported for life. “I could have better spared a better man”<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The First Part of Henry the Fourth</title>, Act 5, scene 4, line 103.</note></p>

It is money very well bestowed. Will there ever come a time when the Public as that many headed beast is called, will show their regard for a good &#38; meritorious man while he can profit by it, – instead of letting him die half 
            -starved &#38; half-heart broken, – &#38; then subscribing for his family – or perhaps for his monument!</p>
