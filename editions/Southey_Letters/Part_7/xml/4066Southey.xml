<salute>My dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I received with much pleasure the account of your ubiquitarian movements, &#38; the assurance of good health &#38; good spirits which such movements imply. For myself, tho having (thank God) no cause to complain on the score of either, I have not moved beyond the limits of this vale since you left it.

Whatever time could be spared from my desk I wanted to enjoy in excursions with our friends of the Island.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#CharterLouisa">Louisa Charter</ref>, and Elizabeth Charter (1782–1860), friend of the poet George Crabbe (1754–1832; <title>DNB</title>). They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), the maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir Charles Malet’s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793–1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied Malet to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785–1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810–1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833–1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843–1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> The season has been singularly unpropitious for such parties, – by much the worst within my remembrance which extends now to twenty years in this country. Thro the spring we lived in hope of what summer might bring with it, thro the summer our hopes were for autumn, October is now come &#38; the weather still as unsettled as <del>however</del> ever. However we have taken advantage of every interval.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">We made successful ascents of <ref type="m" target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref> &#38; of Cawsey Pike, down chimney of which the Ladies came in great style, Miss Charter, <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> S.</ref> &#38; one or two more (for we moved in great force) who were afraid of the ascent, awaiting us at the bottom with a very respectable pic-nic set out. Our next dinner of the same kind was by the Lake side in Manesty Woods. Another day I led the ladies up Walla Crag by a way which would not have suited your friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Awdrey.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Awdry (1766–1844) was married to Jane, née Bigg-Wither (1770–1845), sister of Herbert Hill’s wife. Awdry was a solicitor and minor landowner, and Southey had stayed with him in Switzerland in 1817 soon after Peachy had visited Awdry.</note> Last Monday we dined just where the descent into Borrodale, from Buttermere Haws commences – we were three carts &#38; five saddle horses, &#38; I know not how many more than twenty persons (your friends M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Portel &#38; his daughter<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably William Portal (1755–1845) of Ashe Parke, Hampshire, his wife Sophia, née Slade (1760–1837), and their daughter, Sophia Portal (d. 1875).

She is lodging at Timmy Ladymans,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Ladyman (1774–1846), a Keswick ironmonger.</note> but takes her departure in the course of next week. Your friends are very much pleased with her, &#38; she with them.</p>
