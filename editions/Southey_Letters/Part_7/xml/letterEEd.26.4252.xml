Since my return I have been living upon the Church,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> &#8211; <del>xx</del>

            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (January 1824), published 28 August 1824, did not contain Southey&#8217;s review of John Johnson (1769&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Southey&#8217;s article appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263&#8211;311, published 11 March 1825.</note> which would have put me to some inconvenience if there had not been <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to have recourse to. This has put me out of humour with the said Q &#8211; (which is likely to be Q in the corner<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Q in the corner&#8217; was a popular pseudonym for authors, especially of letters to newspapers and journals, and had been widely used since the anonymous <title>Junius Letters</title> (1769&#8211;1772). However, it was also used in chess as shorthand for &#8216;Queen in the corner&#8217;, i.e. a difficult and unwanted situation, and it is probably in this sense that Southey uses it here.</note> with me) &amp; into humour with other things which have sometimes been laid aside for it. A certain medical acquaintance of yours<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Dr Dove, the central figure in Southey&#8217;s novel, <title>The Doctor</title> (1834&#8211;1847).</note> is likely therefore to be introduced to the world, before I put pen to paper again for that Journal; &amp; the Tale of Paraguay<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> will be followed up by Oliver Newman.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s unfinished epic, &#8216;Oliver Newman&#8217;, set in New England. A fragment was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale (Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1&#8211;90.</note> I am advanced some way in the third canto of the Tale which will consist of four only.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There has been no return of haemorrhage since I applied to you. The ointment I did not apply, &#8211; having found it useless in 1819, &#8211; the zinc &amp; sulph. acid<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a reference to zinc sulphate, long used in medicine to combat diarrhoea. Southey had been suffering from a rectal prolapse and bleeding.</note> I took, probably with good effect: &amp; have taken exercise, more or less, &amp; with more or less inconvenience, sometimes without any, pretty regularly. There were a few days when the weather invited me to bathe, &amp; I believe it was of great service; but the weather prevented me from continuing it.</p>
