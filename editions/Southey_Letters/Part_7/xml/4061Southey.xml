He had famously insisted on pronouncing ‘aches’ as ‘aitches’ in Shakespearean roles. Southey is here referring to Carne’s inability to pronounce the letter ‘h’ at the beginning of words.</note> – but his stories are not the worse for the want of aspirates, – nor his pronunciation the better for being Ionic as well as Stafford or Lancashire.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The initial letter ‘h’ was not pronounced in Ionic dialects of Ancient Greek. This was the most prestigious version of the language as it was associated with leading figures of Greek literature, including Homer. The initial ‘h’ was also often dropped from spoken English in the West Midlands and Lancashire.</note></p>
