I have had my after dinner nap, spoken to Rumpelstilzchen, &#38; seen Hurlyburlybuss<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Two feline members of the Southey household.</note> from the window.

I dare say they had a pleasant journey: &#38; it was not inconvenient to them that he was obliged to whisper having lost his voice by a cold. The first night was said by the Coachman to be the very worst which he had ever endured, for wind, rain &#38; sleet. His great coat was literally encrusted with ice.
