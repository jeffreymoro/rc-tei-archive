        <p rend="indent1">I have this day heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#Tilbrook">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tillbrook</ref>. His advice is that your son should not commence his residence at Cambridge before Oct. 1825.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Ebenezer Elliott (1807&#8211;1871), eldest son of Ebenezer Elliott. He matriculated at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, in 1825 as a sizar (i.e. a student receiving some form of financial assistance) and obtained his BA in 1829. He became a clergyman and was Perpetual Curate of New Mill, Huddersfield 1841&#8211;1843, and Lothersdale, near Skipton 1844&#8211;1848, later going to St Kitts in the West Indies and serving as Rector of Christ Church, Nichola Town, and St Mary&#8217;s, Cayou.</note> The intermediate time may bring him greatly forward, under proper tuition, &amp; he then promises him &#8220;fair play, &amp; kind treatment, &#8211; with the hope also of the best piece of patronage he can bestow upon an under-graduate, &#8211; that of Chapel Clerk, &#8211; provided he is qualified for it. For this office it is an indispensable qualification that he should profess the orthodox principles of the Church of England. &#8211; There is nothing of which I am more clearly, fully &amp; conscientiously convinced than that those principles are the genuine truths of the Gospel, &amp; that Unitarianism has not even the shadow of evidence for its support. It is in fact but the shadow of Christianity.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The Chapel Clerk has nothing to pay for rooms, or for dinner in the Hall: this is fairly worth 20&#163; per annum Other little allowances which are given him amount to about 30&#163; more per annum. And should he obtain an additional scholarship that may be 8 or 10&#163; more.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At the outset the expence of furnishing his rooms is estimated at 25&#163;. Should he get him the Clerkship, (which is highly probable, &amp; depends very much &lt;<hi rend="ital">almost wholly</hi>&gt; upon himself) he will come into its receits at the Xmas following his entrance; &amp; after that time <ref type="m" target="people.html#Tilbrook">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tillbrook</ref> says 20&#163; a year will more than pay his College Tutors bill, after the deductions due to him have been made. If he can command from 100 to 150&#163;, <del>that sum will</del> the whole of his collegiate expences during his undergraduateship will be provided for.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">This is a very desirable prospect. &#8211; <del>Xxx</del> Nothing in the University can be gained without desert, &amp; every thing by it. Give my best wishes to him &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Elliott,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Frances Gartside (b. 1781). She and Ebenezer Elliott had married in 1806 and had thirteen children.</note> &amp; believe me</p>
