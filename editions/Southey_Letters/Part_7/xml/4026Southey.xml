<salute>My dear friend</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent3">I thought that by this time my intended journey would have been compleated, &#38; that I should have returned to enjoy the summer here, where of all places in England, the lakes &#38; mountains render it most enjoyable. And so it would have been if my Book of the Church had been comprized in one volume, according to the original design.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> I have never dilated, or even dwelt upon parts that are either uninteresting or unimportant; but the subject led me into more details than I had anticipated. I came to events, – especially in the age of the Martyrs,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 141–251, dealing with the martyrdom of Protestants under Mary I (1516–1558; Queen of England 1553–1558; <title>DNB</title>).</note> where I found – in the worthy old Fuller’s words, that all <hi rend="ital">compendium</hi> would be <hi rend="ital">dispendium</hi> thereof:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘For it is all so excellent, that compendium would be dispendium thereof’, Thomas Fuller (1608–1661; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Abel Redevivus; or, the Dead yet Speaking. The Lives and Deaths of the Modern Divines</title> (London, 1651), p. 18, no. 1133 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Southey had used this quotation from Fuller before in his review of <title>The Works of the Reverend William Huntington, S. S. Minister of the Gospel, at Providence Chapel, Gray’s Inn Lane, Completed to the Close of the Year 1806</title> (1811), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24 (January 1821), 483, published 6 April 1821.</note> – &#38; so, as it was better to spoil my summer than my book, here I am still at my desk, – the printer is nearly half thro the second volume, &#38; I am far advanced in the chapter relating to Elizabeths reign, better pleased with the work than with the delay which it occasions in my movements.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 252–312, dealing with the reign of Elizabeth I (1533–1603; Queen of England 1558–1603; <title>DNB</title>).</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">My attention has been for some time devoted to this one object more entirely than is comformable either to my inclination or usual habits. But as the extent of the work has been doubled, &#38; as my ways &#38; means depend mainly upon it this becomes unavoidable. The terms with <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> must of course be re-considered, &#38; I believe I shall recur to the original ones, that I have half the profits of this first edition, &#38; two thirds of any succeeding ones.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824) went through three editions in 1824 and reached a ninth edition in 1885.</note> Perhaps it would have been more productive, (relatively so at least) in one volume. Still I think it a more promising adventure than any which I have yet sent abroad; – for I know no view of our Ecclesiastical history which is in so succinct, continuous &#38; readable a form. – One inconvenience arises, &#38; for this I must have recourse to you. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brother Tom’s</ref> ways &#38; means for his Canadian expedition are dependent upon me, &#38; were to have arisen from this book.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey was considering emigrating to Canada but decided against doing so after visiting the country.</note> But this delay compels me to request you before the end of this month to pay into the hands of his agent 100£ – the Agents name is Hincksman, &#38; he lives in Great Russell Street – the number I do not know, but he succeeded to Peytons business.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Hinxman (1759–1844) was a navy agent, whose business was based at 72 Great Russell Street. William Grenfell Peyton (b. 1784) had gone bankrupt in 1822.</note> Will you have the goodness to call upon him &#38; tell him this in case any draft from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> should arrive in the meantime.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I think I have a fair prospect of getting in advance of the world during the next few years, if it please God to continue me in health &#38; ability. Just now I am, according to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harrys</ref> advice, fighting strenuously against my annual catarrh, which has made its regular attack, &#38; has hitherto been kept with some success at bay. Today I had a consultation with <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref>, &#38; the result is that on the day when I succeed in suspending the cold, I am to fortify the system with bark.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Willow bark, a common remedy for colds and headaches. </note> This is to be tried tomorrow, &#38; with good hope of subduing a very troublesome enemy.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Coleridge</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">her daughter</ref> are now at Bristol, from hence they will commence their journey home in a few days.</p>
