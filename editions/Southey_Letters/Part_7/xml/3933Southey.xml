        <p rend="indent1">Mackenzie<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had asked for a copy of the first volume of <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832) to be delivered to Colin Alexander Mackenzie (1778?&#8211;1851), a wealthy Scot who was employed on a number of delicate diplomatic missions and may well have been a government spy. In 1815 he was appointed one of the Commissioners of Liquidation, Arbitration and Deposit, who adjudicated on claims by British citizens for loss of property against the French government. Southey dined with him in Paris on 17 and 19 May 1817, and Mackenzie provided information for Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>.</note> enabled me to make the narrative of Romanas escape<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Mackenzie had related to Southey his role in the evacuation of the Spanish Division of the North from northern Europe in August 1808, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 657&#8211;659. The Division&#8217;s commander was Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of La Romana (1761&#8211;1811).</note> as compleat as you see it, &#8211; by delivering me in writing, what he related to me at Paris. To Sir Augustus Fraser<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Augustus Simon Frazer (1776&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>), a career soldier, had seen service in the Peninsular campaign as a highly effective senior commander of horse artillery.</note> I am obliged, thro his brother in law <ref type="m" target="people.html#MoorEdwardMajor">Major Moor</ref> for the largest body of communications which I have been able to obtain, consisting of a series of his letters describing the whole <del>course</del> progress of the army while he was with it from <del>the</del> 1810 to the end of the war, transcribed into a large volume, with plans &amp;c, as at one time intended for publication, &#8211; an intention I believe laid aside in part because of the announcement of my undertaking. Certainly I shall derive more advantage from these letters than from any other series of documents. You will therefore allow that both Sir Augustus (whom I have never seen) &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MoorEdwardMajor">Major Moor</ref> who transcribed the letters &amp; offered them to me, are richly entitled to this return. I think I mentioned in my list that both copies should be consigned to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> care, he being Moor&#8217;s publisher. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MoorEdwardMajor">Moor</ref> is author of the Hindoo Pantheon &amp; of course intimate with my friends Yamen, Seeva &amp;c.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Moor, <title>The Hindu Pantheon</title> (1810), which described the gods Yamen (Yama) and Seeva (Shiva), who had also featured in Southey&#8217;s <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note>
