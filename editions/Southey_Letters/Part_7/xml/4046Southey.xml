Like his father he was educated at Westminster School (1817&#8211;1824) and Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1828, MA 1831). In later life he was variously a Clerk at the Board of Control 1827&#8211;1832, a barrister and a Liberal MP for Leominster 1852&#8211;1857. In 1820 Phillimore had passed &#8216;The Challenge&#8217; examination and become one of 40 King&#8217;s Scholars at Westminster. They had their own house known as &#8216;College&#8217; and considerable privileges, including the right to proceed to closed scholarships at Trinity College, Cambridge, or Christ Church, Oxford.</note> has been playing the tyrant in College over <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">a cousin of mine</ref>, &amp; has got into a scrape about it. He did not get this despotism from <ref type="m" target="people.html#PhillimoreJoseph">his father</ref>, &#8211; &amp; for his fathers sake I am truly sorry that he has shown it. The masters of our public schools are very reprehensible for not effectually putting a stop to this evil. It was in great danger of being carried from school to Cambridge, since the Colleges has been full, &amp; the town crowded with undergraduates. Some who had proceeded <hi rend="ital">Beasts</hi> from school took advantage of the license which lodgings allowed them to annoy those whom they had been accustomed to ill treat, challenges were the consequence, &#8211; &amp; this has been one of the reasons for enlarging the Colleges there with the view of not permitting any person to lodge out of their walls. &#8211; I heard this last year from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wordsworth</ref>. </p>
