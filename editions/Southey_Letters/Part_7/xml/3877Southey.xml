        <p rend="indent1"> A page or two of corrections is all that remains to be sent &#8211; they are more properly additions, drawn from papers which I did not receive till the sheets to which they relate were printed</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Some time ago I mentioned to you as desiderata the historical writings of Francisco de Olivarez &#8211; they are &#8216;the war in Catalonia&#8217; &#8211; Anecdotes of Chief in the Catalonian war, &amp; Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy from the reign of Ferdinand &amp; Isabel to the usurpation of Joseph Buonaparte.&#8221;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford&#8217;s &#8216;On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez&#8217;, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221&#8211;223. It mentioned Olivarez&#8217;s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; and 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693.</note> Pray get them if it be possible, &#8211; the two former I want at this time for the commencement of the second volume.</p>
