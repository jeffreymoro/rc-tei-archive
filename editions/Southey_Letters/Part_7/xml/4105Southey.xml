        <p rend="indent1">I should perhaps have made leisure for writing to you sooner concerning these last sheets,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was helping to censor Landor&#8217;s <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title> (1824) for publication. </note> if I could have better satisfied myself as to what should be expunged.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Were I to consult my own judgement only I should certainly omit two speeches in pp. 228&#8211;9, which might be struck out without leaving a chasm. If however the two lines which are offensive to good manners<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably, Dialogue XII of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, p. 228, between &#8216;Prince Maurocordato&#8217; and &#8216;General Colocotroni&#8217;: &#8216;a remonstrance against the letting of urine at the corners of streets, or lanes, or stable doors&#8217;; this passage and the surrounding two speeches were retained.</note> be got rid of, the rest may pass</p>
        <p rend="indent1">p 231 I would omit &#8211; <del>In as</del> from &#8220;at present to the bottom of the page,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This passage was omitted on p. 231. It attacked monarchy.</note> &amp; in p 241 from He has reason &#8211; to every thing that <hi rend="ital">is</hi>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue XIII of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 237&#8211;258, was between Vittorio Alfieri (1749&#8211;1803), Italian dramatist and &#8216;Salomon the Florentine Jew&#8217;. This passage was omitted. It was probably a criticism of aristocracy.</note> &#8211; What cannot be made unexceptionable we must be content with making less offensive. The opinions may be right, or wrong. The personalities (even if the facts are true) are unbecoming &amp; unworthy. And with these expurgations the sheets I think may be struck off. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">I am obliged to you for the Magazines.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Taylor had sent Southey copies of the <title>London Magazine</title>, which he published 1821&#8211;1829. Southey had introduced Henry Taylor to John Taylor, and Henry Taylor had gone on to contribute to the <title>London Magazine</title>.</note> And I thank you also on <del>Henry Taylors</del>  account. If I had not been well assured of his talents &amp; acquirements I should not have introduced him to you, but the attention which that introduction has obtained deserves my thanks as much as it has gone beyond my expectations.</p>
