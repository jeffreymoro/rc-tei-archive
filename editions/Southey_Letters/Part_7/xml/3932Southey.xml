Poet Laureat&#8217;, <title>The Bijou: Or Annual of Literature and the Arts</title> (London, 1828), pp. 81&#8211;88.

            <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814) was the only one of Southey&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s odes to have been published by this time (although &#8216;Ode, Written in December 1814&#8217; had appeared in <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. [225]&#8211;238. Southey had originally intended this as his New Year&#8217;s ode for 1815, but abandoned his plan on Bedford and Croker&#8217;s advice.) His New Year&#8217;s odes were not published in one collection until they appeared in <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), II, p. 248; III, pp. 179&#8211;211, 253&#8211;257, 263&#8211;292; X, pp. 183&#8211;188. Even then, they were not grouped together, nor was their origin identified.</note> &#8211; &amp; printed in due order, they will do me no discredit.</p>
