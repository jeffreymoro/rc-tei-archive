Southey believed that the letter was a response to the one he had written to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 8 December 1824, Letter 4289 (published 13 December 1824) – which was, in turn, a reply to the material on Southey in Thomas Medwin (1788–1869; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron: Noted During a Residence with his Lordship at Pisa, in the Years 1821 and 1822</title> (1824).</note> – Thanks you for marking &#38; knowing how heartily – in the Swedes english – I do contempt it – </p>
