            <p rend="indent1">These are indeed magnificent subjects, – nothing can be finer in their kind &#38; they have fallen into good hands.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall was producing <title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey’s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &#38;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> Under the river scene you had better say “Passage of the Tagus at Villa-Velha,” not Villa-Velha simply, because that is the name of a wretched old town which is not seen in the print. I cannot send you the reference to this, because it will occur in the last chapter, where I must put in a sentence on purpose <del>for</del> to introduce it.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, p. 758, where Southey noted that the crossing of the Tagus at Villa Velha was ‘a point, which, in former wars, has been considered the key to Lisbon’.</note> The other you must either call <del>Marvao xx with</del> Marvão; with that mark over the ã, or Marvam which is the manner whereby the same sound is denoted to a Portugueze eye, &#38; which I have always followed. The reference to this is Vol 1.
