Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &amp;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These could be inserted into the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> Under the river scene you had better say &#8220;Passage of the Tagus at Villa-Velha,&#8221; not Villa-Velha simply, because that is the name of a wretched old town which is not seen in the print. I cannot send you the reference to this, because it will occur in the last chapter, where I must put in a sentence on purpose <del>for</del> to introduce it.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, p. 758, where Southey noted that the crossing of the Tagus at Villa Velha was &#8216;a point, which, in former wars, has been considered the key to Lisbon&#8217;.</note> The other you must either call <del>Marvao xx with</del> Marv&#227;o; with that mark over the &#227;, or Marvam which is the manner whereby the same sound is denoted to a Portugueze eye, &amp; which I have always followed. The reference to this is Vol 1. Ch. 10. p. 483.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
