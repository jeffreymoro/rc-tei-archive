            <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, p. 758, where Southey noted that the crossing of the Tagus at Villa Velha was &#8216;a point, which, in former wars, has been considered the key to Lisbon&#8217;. Southey admitted that inserting this passage meant putting &#8216;a peg in on purpose&#8217; to justify Westall&#8217;s picture; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 2 July 1822, Letter 3865.
