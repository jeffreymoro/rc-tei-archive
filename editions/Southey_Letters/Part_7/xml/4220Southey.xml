          <salute> My dear Montgomery</salute></opener>
           <p rend="indent1"> You wrote me a very kind &#38; gratifying letter in November last,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had visited Sheffield on 17 November 1823 on his way south to London and spent the evening with Montgomery and Ebenezer Elliott.</note> which I received at a time when it was not possible to answer it; for from the time you saw me till the middle of February I was perpetually engaged in travelling or in society. During that course of locomotion your circular reached me, &#38; if I could have written any thing for your well-intended volume, in any way tolerable, you should have had it.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Montgomery sent a circular letter to over twenty leading writers, soliciting contributions to <title>The Chimney-Sweeper’s Friend, and Climbing Boy’s Album</title> (1824), designed to draw attention to the plight of young boys employed to climb chimneys to clear soot. Eight writers contributed, including Bernard Barton, Allan Cunningham and others also known to Southey. </note> But the truth is that from long disuse, I have lost all facility of writing upon occasional subjects. – These matters premised, – now for the reason why I have neglected to write to you ever since. It is not a very good one I confess, &#38; yet such as it is, it must be told. Before I departed from London, <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> sent me Prose by a Poet “from an Old Friend.”<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">James Montgomery, <title>Prose, by a Poet</title> (1824).</note> I meant to read it in the country, but when I packed up my boxes for exportation thither, by some accident these volumes were left behind: they had as they were likely to do, found readers, – &#38; it was not till the day before yesterday, that they found their way to me in a box of varieties from the Great City. Meantime in daily expectation of their arrival, I have waited week after week, not liking to thank you for them till I could say that I had perused them with pleasure, – tho that I should peruse any thing of yours with that feeling <del>is what</del> might <del>be</del> with the strictest truth have been said.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  The poetry would have filiated itself; the prose might otherwise have puzzled me where to father it; tho there also I find a clue in the localities, &#38; in the first page of the second volume, which fixes the age of the writer to be within a few years of my own. With these indications, &#38; with the moral, political, &#38; religious features of the book, I could not long be at a loss where to look for the author. The title <del>page</del> is quite appropriate, – none but a Poet could have written such prose.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Do you know that your vision of Pen, Ink &#38; Paper<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Montgomery’s essay, ‘Pen, Ink and Paper’, <title>Prose, by a Poet</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. 1–28 (Southey appeared at pp. 19–20).</note> has been stolen, &#38; altered to fit the ill-feelings of the thief? – I saw it in a number of the Ladys Magazine,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">‘The Modern Poets; a Vision’ in <title>The Lady’s Magazine; or, Mirror of the Belles-Lettres, Fine Arts, Music, Drama, Fashions, &#38;c</title>. n.s., 5 (February 1824), 61–62: ‘Southey, with an air of supercilious arrogance, wrote some stanzas which he seemed to think excellent, and then retired with a look of self-complacency. But his feeble strains melted away while I perused them.’</note> &#38; had the satisfaction of finding in it as much abuse of myself, as any reasonable man could desire to meet with. By the way, let me tell you, that in your friendly judgement, as expressed in this Vision, you are mistaken in representing me as a rapid writer. Unfortunately I have for many years been a very slow  omprised.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Your experiment upon Ossian<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Montgomery’s essay and verse fragment ‘Morna’, <title>Prose, by a Poet</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. 29–36. Montgomery turned into verse one of the episodes in Gaelic legend made famous in James Macpherson (1736–1796; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Fingal, An Ancient Epic Poem in Six Books, Together with Several Other Poems Composed by Ossian, the Son of Fingal, Translated from the Gaelic Language</title> (1761).</note> confirms a remark which I remember to have heard <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> make some five &#38; twenty years ago, that Macphersons rhythm was made up of fragments of hexameters &#38; pentameters. You will see how apparent this is in your own version, – which to my ear is very pleasing.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> My heart goes with you in your moral speculations. Such papers as those upon Old Women, &#38; upon Juvenile Delinquency,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Montgomery’s essays ‘Old Women’ and ‘Juvenile Delinquency’, <title>Prose, by a Poet</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. 37–52 and 87–105.</note> cannot be sent into the world without producing some good. I too have been probing the wounds of society, &#38; hope in the course of the next season to send you my speculations upon its Progress &#38; Prospects, in a series of Colloquies;<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> to which I have prefixed as a motto, three pregnant words from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Bernard – <hi rend="ital">Respice; aspice; prospice</hi>.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Look to the past, the present, the future’, words attributed to St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153). They appeared on the title page [unpaginated] of vol. 1 of <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>, 2 vols (London, 1829).</note> You may differ – yet not I think materially – from some of the opinions advanced there; but the general tendency, &#38; fundamental principles will have your full concurrence. I want more order, more discipline; – less liberty to do ill: – more encouragement – more help – to do well. I want to impress both upon the Rulers &#38; the People a sense of their respective duties. For in truth we have at this time reached a more critical period in the progress of Society, than history has ever before unfolded. The full effects of the discovery of printing have never been apprehended till now; – the pressure of population has never till now been felt in a Christian country – (I hope you know that I abhor Malthus’s abominable views)<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Malthus (1766–1834; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Essay on the Principle of Population</title> (1798).</note> – the consequences of an unlimited &#38; illimitable creation of wealth have never before been dreamt of; – &#38; to crown all there is even a probability that the art of war may soon be made so excellently destructive as actually to put an end to it. How I should like to talk with you upon some of these wide-branching subjects – among these mountains.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  Before these Colloquies appear I shall show you that I am not altogether defunct as a poet. At present I am in good resolute earnest, finishing my Tale of Paraguay<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> which was commenced ten years ago. The delay has been in no small degree owing to the choice of metre, – for it is written in Spensers stanza,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The stanza of eight lines of iambic pentameter and a concluding hexameter, as used in Edmund Spenser (1552/1553–1599; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Faerie Queene</title> (1590–1596).</note> which I found very easy four &#38; thirty years ago (when I planned &#38; commenced a continuation of the Faery Queen!)<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Before I was fifteen I had resolved to finish the Faery Queen, – three cantos of the intended continuation was part of a huge pile which some years ago I committed to the flames.
