          <salute>My dear Edith</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1">I had intended that my next letter should have been to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, but as I <del>have</del> am now able to tell you what has past with <ref type="m" target="people.html#LambCharles">Charles Lamb</ref>, it may better be related to you, than thro one of the children. It was not till Monday last that I had an opportunity of seeing his letter:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had commended Lamb&#8217;s <title>Essays of Elia</title> (1823) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 524, published 8 July 1823, but commented that the book &#8216;wants only a sounder religious feeling, to be as delightful as it is original&#8217;. Lamb took offence and responded with &#8216;Letter of Elia to Robert Southey, Esquire&#8217;, <title>London Magazine</title>, 8 (October 1823), 400&#8211;407.</note> &#8211; it was less offensive that I might have anticipated, if <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref> had not given me a previous account of it; &amp; the perusal only confirmed the intention with which I left home, of addressing him in a manner correspondent to the feelings which I have always entertained towards him. We came here, as you know, on the Tuesday, &amp; on Wednesday my first business was to write him a letter,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Charles Lamb, [19 November 1823], Letter 4088.</note> which <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> has transcribed. It was short, &amp; in all respects, I think, what it ought to be. I disclaimed all intention of injuring or wounding him, &#8211; told him that if he had complained to me in any private or friendly manner, I would have inserted a note in the next review which should entirely have satisfied him that his letter had rendered this impossible, &amp; I was sorry for it. But that nothing should provoke me to engage in a public controversy with him to make sport for the Philistines, &#8211; &amp; that if he could as heartily forgive an unintended offence, as I did the way in which he had resented it, he had only to say so, &amp; I would take the earliest opportunity of going to shake hands with him &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#LambMaryAnne">his sister.</ref>
          <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Lamb was living with her brother at this time at Colebrook Cottage, Islington.</note> &#8211; This letter he found this morning at the India House, &#8211; &amp; I have just received his reply,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Lamb to Robert Southey, 21 November 1823, published in Thomas Noon Talfourd (1795&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Letters of Charles Lamb, with a Sketch of His Life</title>, 2 vols (London, 1837), II, pp. 136&#8211;137. Lamb worked for the East India Company, at East India House, Leadenhall Street in the City of London.</note> &#8211; which is full of shame &amp; contrition &amp; kindness. So all is as it should be, &amp; on Monday, if the weather permits, I shall as he requests, take <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref>
          <del>xx</del> with me, &amp; call upon them at their house at Islington.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">This house you must know is near the New River,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The New River was an artificial waterway opened in 1813 to supply London with drinking water. It begins in Hertfordshire and originally terminated in the Clerkenwell area of Islington, although most of its water is now diverted into a reservoir at Stoke Newington.</note> &amp; thereby hangs a tale. The river makes a turn there, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#DyerGeorge">George Dyer</ref> lately coming from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LambCharles">Lambs</ref> in broad noonday, &amp; not seeing an inch before his nose, instead of turning where the river turned &#8211; walked straight on, into the water, &#8211; to his own utter astonishment, &amp; the great satisfaction of a man<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> who is stationed in a public house near, to be on the look out for accidents of this nature: his fee for taking any person out of the river being five shillings.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I am sure you will be glad that I did not suffer myself to be angry with poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref>. His letter, as we learn from <ref type="m" target="people.html#HutchinsonSara">Miss Hutchinson</ref>, had given <ref type="m" target="people.html#LambMaryAnne">his sister</ref> great uneasiness. All is now set to rights, &amp; in such a way that no unpleasant feeling will be left behind on either side</p>
        <p rend="indent1">You have had the history of our proceedings from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Thrym</ref>. She returned to town last night with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">her Uncle</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">Aunt</ref>, &amp; how she has been disposed of today I know not. I have been quietly at work here, &amp; tomorrow walk in to breakfast with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, &amp; to dine &#8211; I know not where. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> having full power to <hi rend="ital">let</hi> me, &#8211; probably at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Monkhouses,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Monkhouse (1783&#8211;1825), a London merchant and cousin of Mary Wordsworth.

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> has just given me the Miniature.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">A miniature of Southey painted by Edward Nash in 1820 (now in the National Portrait Gallery).</note> Having told you this as I can add nothing which would give you more pleasure I may conclude. So God bless you. Kiss the children for me, &#8211; tell me how <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cupn</ref> liked his book &amp; his letter. You would hardly believe how pleased <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> was to direct it &amp; seal it with his official seal. &#8211; I am sitting (woe is me!) to a deaf &amp; dumb painter.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Lane (1780&#8211;1859; <title>DNB</title>). The portrait is now in Balliol College, Oxford.</note> Whether it be for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> or <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref> I know not. &#8211; We go to <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> on Friday next.
