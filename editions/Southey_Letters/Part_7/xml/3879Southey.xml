               Note on correspondent: Identified by subject matter. The content makes it likely that this letter is to Richard Garnett. Southey’s correspondent had been researching the life of Simon Ockley, who was a family connection of Richard Garnett’s first wife, Margaret Heathcote (1795–1828). The letter also displays an interest in many of Garnett’s enthusiasms, including writings published in Germany and medieval literature.</note></head>

His account of being haunted by a poltergeist later became a famous instance of an allegedly supernatural event.</note> is certainly well worth preserving as one of the many stories for which no satisfactory solution can be offered. It is a case in which imposture is clearly possible, but highly improbable: – the question <hi rend="ital">cui bono</hi><note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘who benefits’.</note> <del>X</del> applying with more force to it if considered as a trick, than as the freak of some superhuman agent of Jefferys family.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey, <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, p. 442.

She used a horn to try and drive the rats out of the house.</note></p>

            <p rend="indent1">The Spanish ballads, like our own, have undergone all sorts of alterations; – every reciter, while they were orally preserved, adding &#38; omitting at pleasure, &#38; frequently supplying parts which he had forgotten, or imperfectly remembered. The German Collection I have not seen.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">It is not clear which collection of Spanish ballads Southey is referring to here, as a number had been published in Germany, including: Jacob Grimm (1785–1863), <title>Silva de Romances Viejos</title> (1815); Georg Bernhard Depping (1784–1853), <title>Sammlung der Besten Alten Spanischen Romanzen</title> (1817); Friedrich Diez (1794–1876), <title>Altspanische Romanzen</title> (1818–1821); and Johann Nikolaus Bohl von Faber (1770–1836), <title>Floresta de Rimas Antiguas Castellanas</title> (1821–1825).</note> My own version of the two ballads to which you allude (they are two of the best Romances) was made from the Guerras de Granada.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Gines Perez de Hita (c. 1544–c. 1619), <title>Historia de los Vandos, de los Cegries, y Abencerrages, cavalleros moros de Granada, y los civiles guerras que huvo en ella, hasta que el Rey Don Fernando el Quinto la gano</title> (1731–1733), no. 3403 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. It is not clear which two ballads Garnett alluded to, but they might have been Southey’s translations, ‘Thro’ the city of Granada’ and ‘Moor Alcayde, Moor Alcayde’, published in <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (London, 1808), pp. 371–374, which were drawn from Perez de Hita’s work.</note></p>
