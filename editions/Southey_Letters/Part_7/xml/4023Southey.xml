            <p rend="indent1">Westall has sent me four of the six prints for Roderick,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Westall (1765–1836; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths, by R. Southey. Illustrated with Engravings from the Designs of R. W.</title> (1824), nos 2627–2628 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Southey had secretly invested in this project, published by Longman. Readers could buy the prints and insert them into copies of Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). </note> the others are not yet finished: I am very much pleased with these. If I were persuaded according to the custom of these times, that it is absolutely necessary to find some fault with every thing, I might perhaps say that the engraver has aimed at throwing too much expression into the eyes, in some of the plates. Those which are come are Roderick at the foot of the Cross,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 1, lines 189–200.</note> – Adosinda shewing him the dead bodies,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 3, lines 233–271.</note> – Florinda at her confession,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 10, lines 79–138.</note> – &#38; the death of Count Julian.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book 24, lines 217–263. The two prints that were not yet finished referenced <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title>, Book 15, lines 225–249, and Book 25, lines 178–204.</note> The first strikes me as the best &#38; for this reason; that the subject is altogether picturesque, it explains itself sufficiently; whereas to know what the others mean, the poetical situation must be understood. – I am much more desirous that this <del>xxx</del> speculation should succeed on Westalls account than on my own. He had set his heart upon it, in the belief that it would be of service to me to have my poems thus illustrated (as the phrase is), – &#38; in the feeling that <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">the publishers</ref> were acting unhandsomely in having such things done for every writer of any note except myself. The success would have been certain had it been done some years ago. At present it is very doubtful.</p>

These could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> arrived at the same time.

The view of Lisbon is not well chosen. Zaragoza, Tudela, Villa Velha &#38; above all Marvam are very beautiful.</p>
