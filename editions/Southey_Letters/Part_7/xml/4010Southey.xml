<opener><salute>My dear Wynn</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I learn that this system of transportation is carried on by the parish authorities:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey sailed from Whitehaven on 20 April 1823 on the brig <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> and reached Quebec on 27 May. He investigated emigrating to Canada but decided against this option. The <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> carried 53 settlers. Some of those from Cumberland had received assistance from their parishes to emigrate.</note> that at which has been done for the poor emigrants is paying their passage to Quebec – (3£ per head was the passage money in the Maria) &#38; that with the exception of a very few cases where two or three pounds have been given, they are left entirely to their own resources when they arrive in America. Indeed the reason assigned for not giving them money has been because they should come back.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">My information states that the number of persons departed here from Cumberland in the course of last year was 106, – &#38; in the present 95. but this does not include those who went from Carlisle. And probably at least an equal number are Scotch, from the opposite <del>xxxx</del> &#38; coast of the Solway. In the instances which I have been able to ascertain the emigration has taken place from the more thinly peopled parts of the county. The parishes of Abbey Holm &#38; Bolton are specified.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The parishes of Holme Cultram and Bolton, near Wigton in northern Cumberland.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">It is very evident from these proceedings that the poor will gladly come into &#60;any&#62; reasonable &#38; compassionate scheme for their removal to Canada, &#38; that the Parishes will not, if they transport them in this pityless manner at so much cheaper a rate. Which bad as it is has been going on for several years.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Other vessels are expected to call at Whitehaven for passengers of this description, &#38; in this case am promised farther intelligence if more is to be obtained.</p>
