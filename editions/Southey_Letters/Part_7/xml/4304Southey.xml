          <p rend="indent1">  I venture to request one of those favours which it is not difficult either to ask or grant. My brother, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey</ref>, is desirous as it now becomes him, to be a member of the Royal Society. Will your Lordship oblige me by signing his Certificate for ballot,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">At this time, anyone wishing to become a Fellow of the Royal Society was obliged to obtain at least three endorsements from existing Fellows on a certificate applying for membership. The Fellows then decided at their weekly meetings whether to elect the candidate. It was not a requirement to be a practising scientist and many Fellows were senior clergy, army or navy officers or lawyers. It was quite common for London physicians to become members and Henry Herbert Southey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 25 April 1825.</note> – which on the part of his own profession will have the signatures of Sir Henry Halford<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Henry Halford (formerly Vaughan), 1st Baronet (1766–1844, <title>DNB</title>), a well-connected society doctor. He served as physician to various members of the royal family 1793–1844 and was President of the Royal College of Physicians 1820–1844.</note> &#38; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Babington?<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Babington (1756–1833, <title>DNB</title>), an Irish physician and mineralogist. He was Physician to Guy’s Hospital 1795–1811.</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that the Quarterly Review is consigned to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John Coleridge’s</ref> hand, a person <hi rend="ital">omne exceptione major</hi>,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Beyond all exception’, a legal term often used of reliable witnesses.</note> who will neither suffer severity to be used when it is not called for, nor withheld when it is well-deserved. – I have long desired to have that channel open for the Catholic question,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Quarterly Review</title> was neutral on the question of political rights for Catholics – as was the Government.</note> – a question upon which all the strength that can be called forth will be needful, for there is evidently a crisis at hand. – I had almost promised <ref type="m" target="people.html#JebbJohn">the Bishop of Limerick</ref> to visit him in the ensuing spring, that I might obtain some satisfactory knowledge of the state of that country, from seeing it myself, &#38; from the information which he is so excellently able to supply. But the rebellion is likely to break out before that time. Sooner or later it must come. It may be doubted whether any consistency &#38; vigour could now prevent it; &#38; if they could, – I know not where they are to be found. – But I am no despondent: My trust in Providence is too well-founded &#38; too firm.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The Methodist who wrote to me from Beverley,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had sent Howley a letter (13 January 1824) from Mark Robinson (d. 1836), a Beverley draper, who was seeking to lead a group of local Methodists into union with the Church of England. It is reprinted in Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <title>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</title>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), V, pp. 161–164. The ‘Church Methodists’ in Beverley did separate from the main body of Methodists in 1825 and built their own church in the town.</note> has, I see, with some of his associates been expelled from the Society, &#38; they are trying, as in Ireland, to collect a body of Church Methodists.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The main body of Irish Methodists had exited the Church of Ireland in 1818, leaving behind a smaller group, known as the ‘Primitive Wesleyans’.</note> Methodism appears to have reached that point in which it will lose more by schisms that it can gain in proselytes, &#38; its numbers are likely to be kept up only by natural increase. But they will take part with the Church, when the other Dissenters make common cause with the Roman Catholicks; &#38; they are numerous enough to make this of some consequence when the sense of the country is to be expressed.</p>
