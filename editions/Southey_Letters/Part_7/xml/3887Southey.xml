        <p rend="indent1">There can be no better proof how greatly I have been engaged of late with guests &amp; visitors, than that I have not found time for talking per-pen with you. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> &amp; his son<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John May (1802&#8211;1879).</note> left us on Monday.

He means to write his travels in England, &amp; intersperse them with an account of our living Poets.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Am&#233;d&#233;e Pichot, <title>Voyage Historique et Litt&#233;raire en Angleterre et en Ecosse</title>, 3 vols (Paris, 1825), II, p. 422&#8211;463, contained Pichot&#8217;s assessment of Southey and his poetry.</note>

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#LockerEdwardHawke">Locker</ref> was here lately. Like many other persons he would fain tempt me to the neighbourhood of London, &#8211; &amp; by way of temptation mentioned that a house on May&#8217;s Hill<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">There is a May&#8217;s Hill in Bromley, Kent. However, Southey did not know this area well, and it is more likely he has phonetically spelled Maze Hill, Greenwich, with which he was acquainted; see Southey to Tom Southey, 16 March 1797, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 206. Greenwich was also where Locker was based, in his work for Greenwich Hospital. He may well have been tempting Southey with one of the houses at Vanbrugh Fields at the top of Maze Hill.</note> was now vacant. I guessed at once what house it was, &amp; certainly there is no situation to which I should remove more willingly, &#8211; if I were to remove at all, &amp; time &amp; other circumstances suited. But my own conviction is that I am best where I am. I do not think that the QR. would be offered to me in case of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> withdrawing. He as well as <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> would think me an impracticalable person, which in certain points most certainly I should prove: for as I would suffer nothing to appear in the journal of which I should be ashamed, or which I could not in principle maintain, I should have to turn out half the contributors, or make them conform to my notions of propriety &amp; justice. Would the object be worth the trouble which it would involve me in, &#8211; or should I be justified in sacrificing more time than I already do, to a perishable &amp; temporary work? I think not. My wish would be that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> should succeed to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>. He, I know, would conduct it in the same spirit, as I should do. If it fall into the hands of a man who steers a different course, <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> abdication will be the signal for my secession.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I have some notion of bringing up a certain ms.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

Southey had corrected the spelling of Stewart&#8217;s name in his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> the misspelling was from James Moore,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">James Moore (1763&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Narrative of the Campaign of the British Army in Spain, Commanded by His Excellency Lieut.-General Sir John Moore, K.B. &amp;c.

Moore consistently misspelt Stewart&#8217;s name as &#8216;Stuart&#8217;.</note> &amp; the official accounts. &#8211; You will admire the skill with which in two places I have dove-tailed in additions to the amount of two pages in each places.

At that momentous crisis every thing depended, under Providence, upon your single determination; and to that determination Great Britain is beholden for its triumph, and Europe for its deliverance./To your Majesty, therefore, this faithful History is offered, as a portion of the tribute due to a just, magnanimous, and splendid reign, and as a proof of individual respect and gratitude from/Your Majesty&#8217;s/Most dutiful subject and servant,/ROBERT SOUTHEY.&#8217; The &#8216;Preface&#8217; appeared at pp. [v]&#8211;vi.</note> &#8211;</p>
