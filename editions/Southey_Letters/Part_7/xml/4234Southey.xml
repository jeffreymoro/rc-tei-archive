        <p rend="indent1">Having pretty well got rid of a cough which lay deep &amp; staid long, I am attacked now by my old enemy<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey suffered from a rectal prolapse and haemorrhoids.</note> in a way which threatens to lay me up. As soon as the catarrh threw me out of condition, the old complaint returned &#8211; a necessary consequence of relaxation. When it was proper to use tonics, young Edmondson<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Edmondson (d. 1847), who had taken over the business of his father, John Edmondson, as surgeon and apothecary in Keswick.</note> gave me zinc;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a reference to zinc sulphate, used in medicine to combat diarrhoea.</note> I gained strength, &amp; was getting in tone again, &#8211; well enough indeed to take a mountain walk this day week, without any inconvenience. But on Saturday morning soon after breakfast, as I was standing at one of the bookshelves, I felt myself bleeding, without any previous pain or sensation in the part, &amp; a considerable discharge of blood took place. Not being alarmed, &amp; thinking there was no danger of its return, I went about three o clock to the lake side, &#8211; every thing having been prepared for dining that day beside the water. When I reached the water the haemorrhage again came on, &amp; of course I made the best of my way back. Sunday I kept house. Monday attempted to walk &amp; having got as far as the turnpike was forced to turn back. Tuesday I laid by again, &#8211; Wednesday (that is yesterday) ventured out in fear, &amp; yet got nearly to the How &amp; back without mishap. To day I went out without apprehension, &amp; in <del>far</del> less than ten minutes returned bleeding profusely. The blood flows fast, but soon appears to stop. How this is to be prevented, or how remedied in this place, where there is no surgical aid that can be trusted to except in common cases &#8211; I know not; &#8211; nor do I suppose that you can tell me. But you will plainly see what a dilemma I am in. Nothing but air &amp; exercise will put me in condition, &#8211; &amp; after so many trials I shall not dare go beyond the garden, <del>xxx</del> while this tendency to bleeding continues. It is the more unlucky because this is precisely the time of the year when I should be in full exercise.</p>
