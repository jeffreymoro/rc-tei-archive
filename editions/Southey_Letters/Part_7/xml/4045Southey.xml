        <p rend="indent1">I thought I had told you that as my journey had been so long delayed I should probably put it off till the autumn, when I could take up <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref> with me to pay her promised visits in the South. The 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> sheet of my second vol. of this B of the Ch. is on the table, &#8211; but I have still three Chapters to write:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 313&#8211;528.</note> &amp; certain it is, whatever may be the cause that I have not the same alacrity in writing as when I was younger. The cold which <del>seizes</del> &lt;fastens upon&gt; me every year at this season sometimes disables, &amp; more often indisposes me for employment. And the only remedy is in a continued course of exercise, &#8211; occasioning an expense of time which I can very ill afford.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Your note puts me in fear that <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref> may ask me to meet <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Ld Grenville</ref> at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Lowtherestate">Lowther</ref>. I can hardly escape a visit thither this year, but I should much rather make it at any other time than when he is there.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Though Grenville was Charles Watkin Williams Wynn&#8217;s uncle, and the head of the political group of which Wynn was a member, Southey had come to dislike Grenville for his advocacy of Catholic Emancipation and his critical attitude to the government&#8217;s conduct of the war in Spain and Portugal in 1808&#8211;1814. In his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, p. 55, Southey had condemned the &#8216;factious animosity&#8217; with which the Grenville group had criticised government policy. </note>

        <p rend="indent1">I have just heard that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Tom</ref> is this day returned. To go in three months from <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> to the Falls of Niagara &amp; back is pretty quick work.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey had sailed from Whitehaven on 20 April 1823 on the brig <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> and reached Quebec on 27 May.
