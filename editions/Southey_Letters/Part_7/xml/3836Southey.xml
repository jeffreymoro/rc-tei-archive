           <p rend="indent1"> I cannot be glad at any event which may in any degree inconvenience you; – &#38; yet as the disappointment of our plan<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had informed Senhouse that he would be unable to travel to the Netherlands that year; see Southey to Humphrey Senhouse 11 February 1822, Letter 3799.</note> was so much like the breach of an engagement on my part, &#38; sate therefore somewhat uneasily on my conscience, there is some satisfaction in knowing that it is better for you at this time to be at home than abroad. – We may look forward to Holland at a more convenient season, &#38; while we are mountaineering in finer scenery than any which is to be found between the Land of Lakes &#38; the Jura, tho we shall not fare so well upon the way as if the waters of the Rhine placed its wine within <del>x</del> our reach, we shall have the comfort of being near home.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I expect my old friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> (whom I think you have seen at my brother <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry’s</ref>) on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of next month.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son, John May (1802–1879), visited Southey at Keswick 5 August–2 September 1822</note> His stay is limited to a fortnight, &#38; after that time I shall be ready to take the field with you, whenever you may find it most convenient. I thank you for your friendly invitation to a house where I feel myself at home, &#38; where amusement is never wanting. But I think <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Mrs S.</ref> will not be induced to leave home this year. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> is at Harrogate with <ref type="m" target="people.html#HutchinsonSara">Miss Hutchinson</ref>, &#38; I think of going thither next week, to escort them home.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> My view of the Catholic question<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was totally opposed to opening public office to men who were not members of the Church of England.</note> agrees entirely with yours. It is not for Peter only that we are opening the door, but for all Jacks bastard children.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Here Southey refers to Catholics as ‘Peter’, as the Pope claimed to be the successor of St Peter (d. AD 64–68), while Nonconformists were followers of ‘Jack’, i.e. the theology of John Calvin (1509–1564).</note> Away goes the Test Act;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Test Act (1673) confined public office to communicants of the Church of England.</note> the Dissenters make their way into all the <del>xxxx</del> Corporations; their members will attack the Tythes, – &#38; when we know, (as I certainly do) that an intention of selling them was entertained by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pitt,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Local clergymen had the right to receive a proportion of agricultural produce in their parish. This system was much-disputed and William Pitt (1759–1806; Prime Minister 1783–1801, 1804–1806; <title>DNB</title>) had ordered a survey of tithes in 1791–1792, but had not proceeded with any reforms.</note> how can we expect that so supple an Administration as the present will risque any thing by defending them against the combined forces of the Dissenters, the Agricultural Interest, &#38; the Liberales of all descriptions? That the Catholic question will be carried ere long, I do not doubt. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">The King</ref> is not a man to make a stand against it on the ground of principle, like his father.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">George III (1738–1820; King of Great Britain 1760–1820; <title>DNB</title>). His opposition to political rights for Catholics had led to the resignation of ministries in 1801 and 1807.</note> The nation will be <hi rend="ital">scribbled</hi> into it, as &#60;they&#62; may be scribbled into any thing: – &#38; popular opinion is already the supreme power in England. It is idle to talk of a balance of powers, – the Democracy is every thing, &#38; the inevitable tendency of our institutions has long been to make it so. Every thing will be popularized, – that is to say, vulgarized &#38; debased.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> But I must conclude, – for your servant is come for the letter: The Peninsular War<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> is far advanced; – the proof on the table carries me to p. 616. Westall is engraving a series of views to accompany it,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey’s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &#38;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> – he has sent me two proofs, which are some of the finest things of their kind. – The Book of the Church<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> is an odd looking title, of an old fashion but it served my purpose better than any other which I could devise, – especially as I thought of accompanying it with a sketch of our political history upon a like plan, to be called the Book of the Constitution.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this work.</note> I once hoped that these things would do some good; – but the evil I fear is too far gone. However order will one day succeed to anarchy, – our grandchildren will have to build up what their fathers have pulled down, &#38; there will come a generation when these warnings may not be useless.</p>
