           <salute> My dear friend</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I was truly rejoiced to receive your letter from London, both for the tidings which it contained of your last communications from the Rio, &#38; because it assured me of your safe arrival.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son, John May (1802–1879), had visited Southey at Keswick 5 August–2 September 1822. May was deeply concerned about the fate of his business transactions in Rio de Janeiro.</note> The contents of your former letter, upon mature consideration I did not think proper to impart to <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs Coleridge</ref>, because the total silence upon the subject which she had maintained towards <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">her sister</ref> &#38; me, &#38; which <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> also maintained towards <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">her cousin</ref>, implied either a want of confidence where confidence ought to have been placed, or a sense of impropriety in the affair; &#38; also because no communication was necessary, the attachment having to all appearance been dismissed as lightly as it was established.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">During their visit, the younger John May had become infatuated with Sara Coleridge; however, she seems to have taken the matter lightly.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"> The influx of visitors has not abated yet. Almost every day brings somebody. I have however found time to get thro half a paper for the Q Review, &#38; it will be sent off by this nights post to be set up by the printer while the other half is preparing.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s next article published in the <title>Quarterly Review</title> was his review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), published 15 February 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> When a guest leaves me I relapse into habitual inaction; my farthest walks since your departure, have been to the How on one side, &#38; to Castlet on the other. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your goddaughter</ref> &#38; I reached the latter point this morning, &#38; sate there about half an hour enjoying a most delightful autumnal day.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> The youth at the island is going on well;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Edward Henry (1807–1833), the younger of Peachy’s two stepsons. The accident occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming him): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their departure, fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded, and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (<title>Glasgow Herald</title>, 12 August 1822). The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part of the annual Keswick Regatta.</note> – so well indeed that when <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">the General</ref> returns from <ref type="m" target="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</ref> I shall remind that it will be proper to return thanks for his recovery, – prayers having been put &#60;up&#62; for it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">The General</ref> himself has had an adventure <hi rend="ital">in</hi> the Lake which I will not repeat because you will hear it from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref> whenever you see him. The weather has been very stormy, &#38; with much rain; – the other morning <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cupin</ref> heard there was like to be a flood, &#38; immediately said that he would get out his Noahs Ark. – I hear him now on the way to give me the good-night kiss.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You will be glad to hear that your visit compleated what <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoots</ref> had begun; &#38; that in consequence of the exercise which I took with him first &#38; immediately afterwards with you, I am in better bodily condition than I had been for twenty months before, – being indeed for the present a sound man. But I hardly can hope this will last till I take my journey to the south.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I look back upon your visit with great satisfaction, – &#38; this more so because I look forward with some confidence to another, at no long interval. This is the sort of intercourse which I desire with those whom I love &#38; esteem; &#38; one thing which endears this place of abode to me is that I enjoy more of it here than I should be likely to do any where else. I should see you, for instance much more frequently, if I lived near London; – but in twenty years I should not see so much of you as by having you two or three weeks under my roof.</p>
