        <p rend="indent1"> I am glad to see some Cymmrodorion Transactions advertised, &amp; shall send for the volume.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Transactions of the Cymmrodorion, or Metropolitan Cambrian Institution</title> (1822), no. 2829 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Wynn had played a central role in re-founding the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion in 1820 as a society of London-based Welshmen interested in the history of Wales. Southey was elected a member of the Society in 1821.</note> &#8211; What a surprizing difference there is between the Welsh &amp; the Scandinavian poems! partly because the Welsh were divided toto ab orbe.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Totally from the world&#8217;.</note> While the Northern nations were more or less connected with it. I have felt this difference very strongly of late while reading the second volume of the Edda, published for the first time four years ago.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edda Saemundar hinns Froda. Edda Rhythmica seu Antiquior, Vulgo Saemundina Dicta</title> (1787&#8211;1828), no. 918 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. The second volume appeared in 1818.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am indeed gradually acquiring some insight into the northern languages, the better to qualify myself for writing a history of English literature &amp; manners, &#8211; subjects which according to my present view, may best be united, as relieving &amp; throwing light upon each other. My notes have been accumulating for many years.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">This project did not result in a book; the surviving notes that Southey put together were posthumously published as &#8216;Collections for the History of Manners and Literature in England&#8217;, <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1850), I, pp. 439&#8211;578.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Has O Connor published his second volume?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles O&#8217;Conor (1764&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores Veteres</title>, 4 vols (1814&#8211;1826), no. 2112 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. This was an edition of some of the manuscripts in the library at Stowe. The second volume did not appear until 1825.</note>

        <p rend="indent1">Foreign interference in the affairs of Spain would be desirable, if it could be effectual,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A French army was preparing to invade Spain to reimpose royal absolutism. It crossed the Spanish border on 7 April 1823 and defeated the liberal regime.</note> &#8211; which I think it could not be. Suppose a French army were to reach Madrid, rescue Ferdinand<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833). He was virtually a prisoner of the liberals 1820&#8211;1823.</note> head &amp; all, &amp; reestablish him as absolute king, or as a chartered one.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">A king who was compelled to observe a constitution, such as the Charter that the victorious powers had imposed on the French monarchy, as a condition of its restoration in 1814.</note> I neither see how he could support himself, nor who could support him; for the country would continue in a state of anarchy &amp; he would find himself without a revenue. Spain can never be reduced to order till it has a strong government, but such a government must be able to maintain a strong army, &amp; the resources by which this should be done are absolutely dry.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">You I think are among those persons who will feel that <del>xx</del> it would have been unwise in me to have taken <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> place. It would have given me a certain instead of a precarious income; &#8211; but the discomfort of a removal, the necessary increase of expenditure, &amp; above all the great sacrifice which must have been made of worthier pursuits would heavily have overbalanced this advantage. This last consideration alone would be decisive. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> is also a much fitter man than I should have been, he knows better how to deal with men, &amp; he has more discretion.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was campaigning for John Taylor Coleridge to succeed William Gifford as editor of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note>
