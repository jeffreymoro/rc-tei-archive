          <salute>  My dear Madam</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am indebted to your report of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley&#8217;s</ref> death<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Hughes&#8217;s letter of 4 July 1824, Letter 4210, had misinformed Southey of Elmsley&#8217;s death. He did not die until 8 March 1825.</note> for the pleasure which I felt, after speaking, &amp; thinking &amp; dreaming of him as dead, in hearing that he was likely to recover; &#8211; a pleasure worth all the previous pain, &#8211; &amp; of that kind indeed that I know nothing which can be compared to it. When I was within reach of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref>, we saw a great deal of each other; &amp; he is one of those friends from whose society I have derived not merely temporary enjoyment, but permanent benefit. The chances of life have separated us for many years, without in any degree weakening our mutual regard; &amp; upon hearing of his death I felt that I had lost what in declining years we can ill afford to part with, an object of esteem &amp; affection, &#8211; one of the friends of my youth. Certainly I never received so much delight from any letter, as from that which told &lt;me&gt; he was alive, &amp; recovering. &#8211; He is well enough to have left Oxford for the house of his sister-in-law<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Elmsley (c. 1775&#8211;1831), n&#233;e Hallowell, the widow of John Elmsley (1762&#8211;1805), Chief Justice of Upper Canada 1796&#8211;1802 and of Lower Canada 1802&#8211;1805. Her house was at Waddon, near Croydon.</note> near Croydon, where <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> visited him about a fortnight ago, &amp; found him so confident of his own strength as to talk of seeing <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> this year, as a possible thing.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Had I been less occupied I should have thanked you for a prescription<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Anne Watts Hughes had sent Southey a prescription to counteract his hay fever.</note> which looks as if it would have been efficacious, &#8211; if I could have taken it. But in one respect my constitution is an unlucky one, &#8211;(we talk about constitutions <del>now</del> you know in politics &amp; in medicine without knowing much about them) &#8211; the smallest quantity of laudanum deranges the action of the liver, &amp; totally suspends the course of the bile; &#8211; &amp; this of course cannot be done with impunity. Therefore I cannot venture upon any prescription which contains laudanum, &#8211; tho that medicine, &amp; that alone I believe, would cut short this obstinate catarrhal affection, on its annual appearance. I am tolerably well recovered now, &#8211; tho still with some remains of cough; &#8211; but it is no longer attended with a feverish pulse. &amp; as a proof that my strength has pretty well returned, I took a six hours walk this morning, &amp; crost <ref type="m" target="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</ref> on my return at about three parts of its elevation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will not be displeased to hear that my second volume<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> is making good progress in the press, &#8211; so that I am once more in the receit of proof sheets, which I am lucky enough to regard as one of the pleasures of life. As to a Book of the State,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write his planned &#8216;Book of the State&#8217; as a companion volume to his <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> there are some weighty objections opposed to a very strong inclination. In the first place I have many works in hand, (- you would think me a most rash &amp; audacious man did you know how many) &#8211; &amp; am &#8211; this day &#8211; fifty years old: it is time therefore seriously to ask myself what upon the common calculations of life I could possibly have time to perform. And secondly were I to undertake such a view of our civil history, the inconvenience of having no great library within reach could only be obviated by an outlay in books which it would be very inconvenient for me to afford: for it has so happened that no mans gains in this generation have been so little in proportion to his reputation &amp; his labour as mine.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must not conclude without thanking you for setting <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walters</ref> pen in motion. He wrote me a very friendly letter, to which I returned an immediate answer<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Anne Watts Hughes had visited Scott at Abbotsford, provoking a letter to Southey. Southey responded with his letter to Sir Walter Scott, 8 July 1824, Letter 4212.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">  All below unite in kind regards. The girls are in expectation of the arrival of <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">a Welsh Uncle</ref> tomorrow &#8211; (a boy of fifteen, from Westminster,) whom they have never seen. He is coming to pass his holydays with me, &amp; is at this time in the mail coach somewhere about Leming Lane.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The section of the Great North Road between Boroughbridge and Greta Bridge in Yorkshire.</note> I have seldom seen a boy more after my own heart.</p>
