        <p rend="indent1">In the evil habit of answering familiar letters without having them before me, I forgot to notice your question respecting the nitrous oxyde; which however I should not have done had the thing been as hopeful as you supposed it to be.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had inhaled nitrous oxide in 1799 as part of the experiments at the Pneumatic Institution in Bristol. See Thomas Beddoes, <title>Notice of Some Observations Made at the Medical Pneumatic Institution</title> (Bristol and London, 1799), p. 11, where Southey&#8217;s reaction to the inhalation is described thus: &#8216;For many hours after this experiment, he imagined that his taste and smell were more acute, and is certain that he felt unusually strong and cheerful. In a second experiment, he felt pleasure still superior &#8211; and has since poetically remarked, that he supposes the atmosphere of the highest of all possible heavens to be composed of this gas.&#8217;</note> What I said was simply this, that the excitement produced by the inhalation was not followed by any consequent debility or exhaustion; on the contrary that it appeared to quicken all the senses during the remainder of the day. &#8211; One case occurred in which the gas seemed to produce a good effect upon a palsied patient.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Beddoes, <title>Notice of Some Observations Made at the Medical Pneumatic Institution</title> (Bristol and London, 1799), p. 19, described the unnamed tailor&#8217;s case: a gradual recovery from a paralysis brought on by &#8216;a course of excessive debauchery, especially with regard to fermented liquors&#8217;.</note> A fellow <del>in the institu</del> who had lost the use of his hands (a taylor by trade) was so far cured, &#8211; that he was turned out of the house for picking <del>xx</del> pockets. -</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The difficulty in finding 200 subscribers<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was seeking subscribers for Tom Southey&#8217;s <title>Chronological History of the West Indies</title> (1827).</note> arises from this, my dear Grosvenor, &#8211; that our friends are never so ready to bestir themselves in our affairs, as our enemies. There are half a score persons in the world who would take some pains to serve me, &#8211; &amp; there are half a hundred who would take a great deal more to injure me. The former would gladly do any thing for me which lay in their way: &#8211; the latter would go out of theirs to do any thing against me &#8211; . I do not say this complainingly, for no man was ever less disposed to be querulous; &amp; perhaps no one <del>hxx</del> ever had more friends upon whose friendship he might justly pride himself. But it is the way of the world, &#8211; &amp; the simple reason is, that enmity is a stronger feeling than good will</p>

        <p rend="indent1">  I am much concerned at what you say of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref>. He said in a letter to me some two months ago that his digestive powers were out of order, &amp; that if they continued so he should forego his intended journey into France, rather than be out of the way of medical advice. &#8211; So you have fallen in with Bigge,<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles William Bigge (1773&#8211;1849), a landowner, banker and colliery owner in Northumberland. Southey and Bedford had known him at Westminster School.</note> &#8211; he is a great person in Northumberland. &#8211; Did I tell you that young Levett<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Levett (1775&#8211;1845), Rector of Ingestre 1809&#8211;1829, Deene 1811&#8211;1825, Church Eaton 1825&#8211;1829, and an old friend of Southey from Westminster School. His wife is unidentified.</note> &amp; his wife met me, on my late travels, in Hampshire? He has no children &amp; having a good income with his wife (about 700 &#163; a year I was told) had resigned a living of about the same amount from a very honourable motive. It had been given him by Lord somebody<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot (1777&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>), Lord Lieutenant of Ireland 1817&#8211;1821. He was a contemporary of Edward Levett at Christ Church, Oxford, and had been married to Frances Thomasine Lambart (d. 1819). Levett certainly had not broken with Talbot, as the latter appointed Levett to the Rectory of Church Eaton in 1825. The story of the reprobate peer may therefore refer to Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan (1760&#8211;1837), who appointed Levett as Rector of Deene in 1811. Cardigan was not, though, an Oxford contemporary of Levett.</note> &#8211; a College friend: &#8211; that Lord, after leading an exemplary domestic life till he was nearer 50 than 40 &#8211; chose to plant a mistress near his own abode in so scandalous a manner, that Levett found it necessary for his own feelings to withdraw from the neighbourhood, &amp; break off <del>in this manner</del> all connection with a man whom he could not reclaim &amp; who had forfeited all claim to his esteem. &#8211; We met very cordially, &amp; on both sides there would be a good disposition to meet again.</p>
