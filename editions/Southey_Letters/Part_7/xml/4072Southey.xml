            <p rend="indent1">Thank you for following my directions in halving the note, I shall gain by it another letter, &#38; yet the advice was given in sober prudence, &#38; not with that selfish purpose. I am heartily glad that you have reached home safely, &#38; with so few disagreables on the way, that the fear of such a journey will not stand in the way of your repeating it, for I will not believe that you have taken leave of these mountains for ever. You must not talk of <hi rend="ital">sunset</hi> pleasures yet. Your evening is far distant, &#38; many such pleasures as this country can afford (they are not light ones) – are in store I hope both for you &#38; for me. If you are half as desirous of partaking them again, as I am that you should do so, the difficulties in the way will only be thought of with the view of overcoming them. Whatever we may think of dreams, you will allow that day dreams may have some truth in them, &#38; you have borne no small part in mine since your departure. These at least may bring about their accomplishment.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">On the day that you reached Oxford, we effected our Watenlath excursion. Go whither I will among these lakes &#38; mountains, I have more ghosts than Sir Thomas More<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829), in which Southey as ‘Montesinos’ (man of the mountains) conversed with the ghost of Sir Thomas More (1478–1535; <title>DNB</title>), lawyer, philosopher, statesman and Lord High Chancellor 1529–1532. </note> to accompany me, – there is scarcely a spot but brings with it some indelible recollection of those whom I have loved &#38; lost. But the predominant feeling on this day was regret that you were not with us. Since then I have been close at work, preparing for my departure, &#38; yet after all I must take with me work to finish at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824), which Southey wished to complete.</note> We set out on Monday Nov. 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> &#38; I shall leave the Ladies of the Island<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#CharterLouisa">Louisa Charter</ref>, and Elizabeth Charter (1782–1860), friend of the poet George Crabbe (1754–1832; <title>DNB</title>). They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir Charles Malet’s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793–1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied Malet to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785–1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810–1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833–1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843–1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> at Derby, &#38; go to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George Beaumonts</ref> at Cole-Orton, near Ashby de la Zouch for two or three days; probably we shall reach London on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. From thence you shall hear of my movements. I have a wide way to travel, &#38; the sunniest spot in the prospect is the New Forest. </p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb’s</ref> letter<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had commended Lamb’s <title>Essays of Elia</title> (1823) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 524, published 8 July 1823, but commented that the book ‘wants only a sounder religious feeling, to be as delightful as it is original’. Lamb took offence and responded with ‘Letter of Elia to Robert Southey, Esquire’, <title>London Magazine</title>, 8 (October 1823), 400–407.</note> I have not seen, &#38; your account of it is the first intimation which I have received of its temper. It will not disturb mine. I am sorry that he should have acted thus rashly &#38; unreasonably; but no infirmity of mind on his part shall make me act or feel unkindly towards one whose sterling goodness I respect as much as I admire his genius. If the matter of the letter requires answer or explanation from me, I shall probably give it at the end of the Quarterly Review as the writer of the article. Any thing personal, if I notice it at all, I shall notice privately by letter.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not refer to this matter in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, but wrote to Lamb; see Southey to Charles Lamb, [19 November 1823], Letter 4088.</note> You can hardly imagine how inirritable I am to any attacks thro the press.
