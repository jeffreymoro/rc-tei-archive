            <p rend="indent1">The corrections, &#38;c., will be in <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman’s</ref> hands before this
               reaches you. I have incorporated part of the preface to the third volume, added the rest of it after the “Life,” and inserted in the
               “Life” some things noted from the letters which were last in my possession.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had added a
                  new ‘Preface’ to the 9th edition of Southey’s <title>The Remains of Henry Kirke White</title>, 3 vols (London, 1822), III, pp.
                  [iii]–xvi. The third volume of this 1822 edition was a ‘supplementary volume’ to the original edition of 1807, containing additional
                  letters and poems by Kirke White. The 10th edition of the <title>Remains</title>, 2 vols (London, 1823), compressed the material
                  into two volumes and required Southey to combine some of his ‘Preface’ with the ‘Life’ of Kirke White at pp. [v]–lxviii, adding the
                  remainder at pp. [lxix]–lxxiii. He also added references to letters in the third volume of the 1822 edition to the 1823 version of
                  the ‘Life’.</note> The proofs are to be sent me, that I may carefully revise the whole. One gap is left for you to fill up with the
               name of the college at which Almond was entered.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Remains of Henry Kirke
                  White</title>, 2 vols (London, 1823), I, p. xlviii. Robert White Almond (1785–1853) was an old schoolfriend of Kirke White’s from
                  Nottingham. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 1 July 1803 (he is identified as a Trinity College student in the
                     <title>Remains</title>), but migrated within a few months to Queen’s College, Cambridge (BA 1808, MA 1813). He was ordained in
                  1810 and was Rector of St Peter’s, Nottingham 1814–1853.</note> I am heartily glad that the supplementary volume has done its work
               so well. The “Remains” have yet one stage to reach; they must one day be printed in a smaller form for the pocket, and for popular
               sale.</p>

                  Stonor (1781–1834) had married Mary Butler (1782–1829), daughter of Charles Butler, in 1809. He was a member of an old English

               them, but I could not join in their exultation; – a bad government, indeed, had been overthrown, but a better had not been substituted

                  Constitution of 1812, devised by the Cortes elected in 1810.</note> tended decidedly (and designedly, also, no doubt) to bring about
               a democracy. I had always seen this tendency, and my disapprobation was by no means diminished when I saw it restored through the
               instrumentality of soldiers who thought it better to stay at home and subvert the Government, than obey its order by embarking for
               America.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> The Spanish Revolution has been occasioned not by any desire of change on the part of the people, but by the inability

                  (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833).</note> returned to a ruined kingdom, that is, ruined as to its finances: the colonies
               from whence the main revenues had formerly been derived were lost, and the mother–country in no condition to support taxes, everything
               having been subverted. The same cause would have overthrown the present Government two years ago, if it had not been supported by the
               loans which it raised in England,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1820–1821, the Spanish government had raised two loans
                  through the Paris firm of Ardouin, Hubbard &#38; Co. and a further ‘National’ loan from Spanish citizens.</note> and which, in all
               likelihood, will ruin all who have engaged in them. Meantime, the manner in which they have robbed the nobility and the Church of their
               property has offended both these bodies:<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The liberal government in Spain issued a stream of
                  decrees in 1820–1822 ordering the confiscation and sale of the estates of municipal bodies, Spanish military orders, Crown lands and
                  monasteries and convents.</note> the kingdom is overrun with banditti; the rabble in the large towns are become radicals, made so by
               the Government itself; the great majority of the nation detest the new order of things, but would be passive under any order if they
               could; and the braver spirits have taken arms against it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The course which the Revolutionists have taken resembles that of their French exemplars so closely that no doubt can be
               entertained of their going through the same stages of regicide and massacre if left to themselves, unless the Royalists were strong
               enough to recover the ascendency. And here a difficult question arises. Is it <hi rend="ital">expedient</hi> for France to
                  interfere?<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">French forces had been massing on the Spanish border since late 1822 and finally
                  invaded on 7 April 1823 to restore the absolutist regime.</note> To question the <hi rend="ital">right</hi> of interference is
               absurd. If my next–door neighbours were fighting, endeavouring to kill one another, and likely, moreover, in their quarrel, to set fire
               to the house, it would be madness in me not to interfere, if I could do it to any good purpose.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Therefore, if France were a power which could be trusted, and would interfere as honourably as we did when we rescued
               Spain from Buonaparte,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821; Emperor of the French 1804–1814, 1815)
                  had ordered the occupation of Spain 1808–1813. Spanish resistance was greatly aided by British military intervention.</note> I
               should approve its interference, and heartily wish it success. But the French are a faithless nation: they have ever been so, and, upon
               the first favourable opportunity, they would gladly revive the wildest schemes of Louis XIV.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"
                  >Louis XIV (1638–1714; King of France 1643–1714). His grandson inherited the Spanish throne in 1700, leading to the War of the
                  Spanish Succession 1701–1713.</note> or Buonaparte. Even could we trust them, and their conduct were to be as unexceptionable as I
               verily think the grounds of their interference are, the question of expediency is a very difficult one. When they get to Madrid (which
               may be done without difficulty), the work is far from being over. They may make a new government, or restore the old despotism, but how
               is it to be supported? The old difficulty of the finances recurs; and thus government will require, not our auxiliary troops to keep
               the country quiet, but loans to maintain it, till credit and prosperity are restored. France may have some reason to apprehend
               discontent at home, and the explosion of her own combustibles, if the struggle be prolonged; or, to prevent this, it is not improbable
               that she may be willing to provoke a war with England, for which the Portuguese seem disposed to give her a pretext.<note n="13"
                  place="foot" resp="editors">A liberal regime had been established in Portugal in 1820. It was feared that French forces might invade
                  Portugal and, later in 1823, both a British naval squadron and 5,000 British troops were dispatched to Portugal to prevent this
                  eventuality.</note> If they assist the Spaniards, and the French, in consequence, invade Portugal, we can no longer remain
               neutral.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Here, then, are two evils in prospect; that France may acquire such ascendency over Spain as Louis XIV. aimed at, and
               that we may be drawn into a war, in support of those very revolutionary opinions against which we have struggled so long. And this is
               what the Whigs desire. The very persons who would have had us desert Spain and the Portuguese when they resisted Buonaparte, are now
               endeavouring to force us into a war in their behalf. Undoubtedly they hope that it would end in a revolution at home by the
               embarrassments which it would produce. In this they are greatly deceived, for it would restore agricultural prosperity, and give a new
               spur to our manufactures. But this would be dearly purchased. Our policy is to preserve peace and order wherever our influence
               extends.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have written hastily, and may very possibly have failed to make myself understood. The upshot is this; it is a
               struggle in Spain between two extremes which are both so bad that one can hardly form a wish on either side; and that the one thing to
               be desired is, that order should be restored there. If France were an upright power, her interference would be desirable; – being what
               she is, it is to be wished that the Peninsular were left to itself.</p>

               fireside and circle. God bless you.</p>
