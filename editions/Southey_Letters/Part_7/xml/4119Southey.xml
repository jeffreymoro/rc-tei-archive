        <p rend="indent1">   Till now I have not been able to find time to thank you for your pleasant letter. I can now do it having about an hour to spare before Church begins, &#8211; &amp; the letter will announce my safe arrival in Devonshire.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I set out with <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> in a Coach called the Defiance,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The name of a regular stage-coach that ran between London and Exeter.</note> at five o clock on Friday afternoon. The night was so mild that my boot-stockings were not needed, &amp; it was impossible to travel more comfortably as far as comfort in travelling depends upon weather. We had the window partly open the whole night, &amp; at one the next day I was deposited at Sir John Kennaways<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet (1758&#8211;1836), made a fortune in the East India Company and became a landowner in Devonshire. Southey knew him through his son, Charles Edward Kennaway, who had visited Southey in the Lake District in 1819&#8211;1820. The Kennaway home, Escot House, is close to Ottery St Mary.</note> door, where Mr Pattison,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Patteson (1790&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>), a barrister and later Justice of the King&#8217;s Bench 1830&#8211;1852. On 22 April 1824 he married Frances Duke Coleridge (1796&#8211;1842), sister of John Taylor Coleridge.</note> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeWilliamHart">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> William Coleridge</ref> were waiting to see <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">my fellow traveller</ref>, before he past on to his own family at Combe Sedgewick. Our journey however was not wholly without adventures. About six in the morning we felt a great shock, behold we had run against a tilted cart, &amp; as in such cases the weakest goes to the wall, the cart was overset. There were in it two men &amp; a woman on their way to market, none of whom, most fortunately received any hurt. But if they had a basket of butter with them, it would <del>x</del> not be the better, &amp; if they were carrying eggs, the eggs would be a great deal the worse. The Guard &amp; some of the outside passengers got down to give what help they could, but the people were so angry that they would accept of no assistance, &amp; the matter is likely to end in a law-suit. They were in the middle of the road, which they ought not to have been &amp; must have seen our lights, if their eyes were open; besides it was not a dark morning. But they were the more angry from a mishap of the Guards, for when he went to <del>xxx</del> help them out from under the tilt, where they were lying men, woman, butter &amp; eggs one upon another, the poor womans clothes were so discomposed that he took her by the knee instead of the elbow; &amp; as she did not like a cold hand upon her knee at six o clock in the morning, they <title>twarld</title> about that as well as about the overturn: &amp; they were in a great passion when we drove off &amp; left them.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> And so it never occurred to you that the green seal was left in my desk as a sure means of my knowing whether any body peeped in it during my absence! You have read of talismans, &amp; this was one whereby female curiosity would be detected. It <del>xx</del> was made by a great enchanter, whose name I do not know, &amp; came to me from foreign parts.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I am very glad that you give so good an account of your drawing &amp; especially that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref> is improving in it under <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kates</ref> teaching. Be good girls, &amp; strive always in all ways to improve &amp; assist &amp; oblige one another. It is some comfort to me that the greater part of my long absence is over, &amp; that after a few weeks more of this hurrying, harassing life, I shall be with you once more. I do not expect to pass above four days more in London.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your old friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Charles Kennaway enquires very particularly for you &amp; your sisters, &amp; so does M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Keenan. Give my love to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cupn</ref>. By this time he will have received his cousin Roberts<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey, Jnr (b. 1817), the eldest son of Henry Herbert Southey.</note> letter. The weather is changed to a sharp frost; this is no inconvenience to me now &#8211; rather an improvement as it makes it better walking, &amp; even should the cold continue when I have to travel again by night, I am well provided having the old great coat for my knees, &amp; the great stockings. So <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">your Mamma</ref> must not have any uneasiness for me on that score, for I am a good traveller, practised in all means for taking care of myself. I hope I shall have a letter from her at Crediton, &#8211; my next will be from thence. My love to all. Please to tell <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> that Sir John Kennaway tells me he has heard she is very soon going to be married, but he could not inform me to whom.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Sara Coleridge had become secretly engaged to her cousin, Henry Nelson Coleridge, on 21 March 1823.</note>
