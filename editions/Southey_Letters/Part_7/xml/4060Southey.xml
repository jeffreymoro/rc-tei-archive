        <p rend="indent1">I did indeed wonder what was become of you, &amp; you would long ago have received some enquiries upon the subject, if at this season of the year I had had leisure for any employment which might be dispensed with. What a shock have you escaped in not having been with poor Bourke<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John William Bourke (c. 1773&#8211;1823), Rector of Llanwyddan 1803&#8211;1807, Vicar of Oswestry 1808&#8211;1823. Bourke was an old friend of Bedford&#8217;s from Westminster School, where he was admitted in 1788. He died on 21 August 1823, just before Bedford had been due to visit him in Oswestry.</note> at the time of his seizure!</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My dear Grosvenor why will you not lay in your stock of good air <hi rend="ital">here</hi> rather than at the sea. Come early in October, the sooner the better. At the end of that month, or a little later (if the weather be fine enough to delay us here) <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</ref> &amp; I set off on our southern travels. Our plan is to take some Ladies from the Island<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Peachy&#8217;s house on Vicar&#8217;s Island, Derwentwater, was often rented out to visitors.</note> under convoy, &amp; fill two chaises &#8211; they are the two sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">the first M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Peachy</ref>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island.</note> &#8211; their Uncles widow Lady Malet,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, n&#233;e Wales (1779&#8211;1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), maternal uncle of the Charter sisters.</note> &amp; Miss Malet,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Charles Malet had three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793&#8211;1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied him to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785&#8211;1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810&#8211;1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833&#8211;1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843&#8211;1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> Sir Charless daughter by an Indian woman. Why cannot you &amp; Henry &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</ref> come here for three or four weeks &amp; travel back in this caravan, which purposes to see the Yorkshire Caves &amp; the Peak on its way?</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I received two or three weeks ago a begging letter from one J.W. Page,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">J. W. Page, a merchant of Wood Street, was a bankrupt in 1808, but there is no mention of a J. W. Page in the <title>Record of Old Westminsters</title>.</note> who must have been at Westminster (by his age) in our time, but I have no recollection of him. His credentials are good, &amp; the story sad enough &#8211; When you pass by Hatchards,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The bookshop run by John Hatchard (1768&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>) at 187 Piccadilly, London.</note> if you will give twenty shillings in my name to his account, &#8211; you will make me feel more at ease upon this score, than I have done in letting his application lie unnoticed</p>

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brother Tom</ref> has returned from Canada, &amp; reaped nothing from his journey but the trouble of it, &#8211; for by flying thro the country as if the fever had been at his heels he made a toil &amp; a pain of it. He did not see enough, or stay long enough, to learn any thing more than he knew perfectly well before he set off, <del>xxx</del> the whole expences of the expedition have been thrown away, &amp; he seems to have gone for no other purpose than to be able to say that he has seen the country &amp; does not like it.</p>

He owned Storrs Hall on the banks of Lake Windermere.</note> the expence of time &amp; of conveyance was more than the object would have been worth, &amp; therefore I <del>xx</del> excused myself; as I have done likewise from a very obliging invitation to the Music at York, from a <ref type="m" target="people.html#YorkRichard">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> York</ref>, who married Lord Harewood&#8217;s sister.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard York invited Southey to the &#8216;Yorkshire Grand Music Festival, for the Benefit of York County Hospital, and of the General Infirmaries of Leeds, Sheffield and Hull&#8217; on 22&#8211;25 September 1823 in York Minster. Both Richard York and his brother-in-law, Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood (1767&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), were Patrons of the Festival.</note>

        <p rend="indent1">You will be pleased to hear that we have a most worthy cat, of the more worthy gender, &amp; moreover an entire cat, (for Cats never go into the boot here <del>xx</del>)<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is referring to the practice of putting a male kitten head-first into a boot in order to immobilise it while it was neutered.</note> &#8211; whose name is Earl Rumpelstilschen, Baron Macbum: Macbum being patronymical, he having been born in the house of a Bailiff.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">A bum-bailiff was a court official empowered to collect debts.</note> I hope you admire the name, &amp; I am sure you would admire the fine condition, the perfect good humour, &amp; the excellent laziness of this noble cat, who is moreover brave as he is gentle having done good-service against the rats, &amp; being often engaged in furious combat with a rival named Hurliburlibuss, who prowls round about the house.</p>
