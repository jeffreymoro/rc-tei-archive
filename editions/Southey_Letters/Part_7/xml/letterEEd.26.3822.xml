        <p rend="indent1"> It is long since I have heard from you, &amp; I am afraid one cause of this silence may have been that you have had no favourable intelligence to communicate. I look at the news from Brazil always with apprehension because of the manner in which it may affect you.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Porto in August 1820 led to the election of a Cortes in Portugal in December 1820 and demands that the monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807&#8211;1808 following the French invasion. John VI (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826) arrived back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and eventually agreed to a new liberal Constitution in October 1822. John VI appointed his son Pedro (1798&#8211;1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822&#8211;1831) as Regent in Brazil, and Pedro summoned an elected advisory council to represent the different Brazilian provinces. These events eventually led to the separation of Portugal and Brazil on 7 September 1822. John May&#8217;s business affairs in Brazil had long been in financial difficulties and finally collapsed in early 1822.</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref> writes to me but seldom, &amp; his letters when they come are not longer than so many prescriptions; so that I learn nothing from him. On Saturday however I heard something concerning you which gave me sincere pleasure. Dining at a neighbours with a M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thompson<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> he gave an excellent report of your son, from Arnold,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John May (1802&#8211;1879), after his expulsion from Eton in 1818, was being educated at a school in Laleham, near Staines, run by Thomas Arnold (1795&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>).</note> who spoke of him in the highest terms, &amp; said how glad he was to have had him under his care. This must be a great satisfaction to you, &amp; one motive for my writing is to repeat it to you because coming in this circuitous manner more weight may be given to a commendation of this kind, than if it had been said directly by Arnold to yourself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  Another motive is to remind you <del>that</del> of something like an engagement to visit <del>xxx</del> me this year, &amp; to say that the <del>xxxx after the leaves xxx not the better</del> nearer Midsummer you can come the better, <hi rend="ital">before</hi> rather than after. You should come at the end of May, &amp; be here when the days are at the longest, &amp; the country in its best dress. I cannot express how much I wish to see you under this roof.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son visited Southey for four weeks in August&#8211;September 1822.</note>

Southey included in his review (14&#8211;19) a life of Manuel de Faria e Sousa (1590&#8211;1649), an editor of the poetry of Luis Vaz de Cam&#245;es (1524&#8211;1580), who Southey felt was &#8216;entitled to a fuller account in a life of Camoens than Mr. Adamson has assigned him&#8217; (14).</note> The proofs of it were returned last week.</p>
