        <p rend="indent1"> I have been applied to by Lady Malet,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, n&#233;e Wales (1779&#8211;1868), an artist and the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>). Southey had travelled south from Keswick to London with her in November 1823, and Edith May Southey was staying at Lady Malet&#8217;s London house.</note> whom I should most gladly serve if I could, &#8211; to ask if you can assist an arrangement which she has in view</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Her fourth son George Grenville Malet<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">George Grenville Malet (1805&#8211;1856) became a Lieutenant in the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry on 21 February 1825. He rose to be Lieutenant-Colonel of this regiment and was killed in action in the Anglo-Persian War 1856&#8211;1857.</note> went to Bombay in January last as an Infantry Cadet. She has been trying ever since to get him exchanged into the cavalry at the same Presidency &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morris<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieutenant Thomas D&#8217;Arcy Morris (1792&#8211;1835) of the 12th Native Infantry, Bombay. He was a cadet of the 2nd class of season 1808 and received a captaincy in the 24th Native Infantry on 1 May 1824. Morris was also a poet, whose &#8216;The Griffin&#8217; (1821) achieved some fame in India.</note> has assured her that if she can prevail on any one to give him a Cavalry appointment, that person will get his present Infantry Cadetcy. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morris will return to him the first Cavalry appointment which falls to his lot after his re election in April, in exchange for an Infantry one. &#8211; If I understand the case, what is requested is the loan of a Cavalry appointment &#8211; subject to the chances of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morris&#8217;s life &amp; re election. What those chances may be you must know better than I can do, &amp; whether you can render this service to a very estimable family.</p>
