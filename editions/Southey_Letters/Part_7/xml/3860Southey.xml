        <p rend="indent1">  Agricultural distress is hardly felt here in comparison with what it is in the South. There are several causes for this, the principal being &#8211; that so many persons cultivate their own small estates, &#8211; &amp; that in other property the system of rack rent very generally prevailed, &#8211; so that rents which were screwed up during the war, having unscrewed in due proportion since the peace.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Rack rents gave the landlord a full economic return on his investment in the land. They were usually revised regularly according to varying economic conditions.</note>
