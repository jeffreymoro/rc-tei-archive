I have during the last three months expended more time that my finances can well afford in laying in a stock of health &amp; exercise. It has answered to the extent of my hopes but while I get rid of one ailment<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been suffering from a rectal prolapse.</note> a consumption of the purse is brought on, which is a very unpleasant disease.</p>

This I shall endeavor to do tho sorely against the grain. But I have felt the ill consequences of inaction this year too severely &amp; too seriously not to take warning.</p>
