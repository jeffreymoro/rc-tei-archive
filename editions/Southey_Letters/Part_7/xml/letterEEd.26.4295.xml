        <p rend="indent1"> I send off by this nights post three cantos of the Paraguay,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> that Richard Westall may make two designs from them for the laudable purpose of making a volume sell at 10/6 which otherwise could not be priced at more than three half crowns.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> was priced at 10 shillings and 6<hi rend="ital">d.</hi>, rather than 7 shillings and 6<hi rend="ital">d.</hi>, which Southey suggests would have been its price without its two illustrations by Richard Westall (1765&#8211;1836; <title>DNB</title>), painter and illustrator.</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> will send the mss to you, &amp; R Westall lives so near your Hospital,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall lived at 6 South Crescent, Bedford Square 1816&#8211;1828; Henry Herbert Southey was a physician at the Middlesex Hospital on Mortimer Street, 1815&#8211;1827.</note> that I may with an easy conscience request you to put it into his hands. I forget his address &#8211; but your Directory will show it, &#8211; it is in that sort of Crescent between Tottenham Court Road &amp; Russel Square, on the right hand going Eastward.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> For a subject I recommend the Jesuit in the woods C<hi rend="sup">o</hi>3 St.21. &#8211; for the other the single figure of Mooma as described in the same Canto from 37 &#8211; to &#8211; 45.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall did not take this advice. His first illustration was for Canto I, stanza 44, and showed Mooma and her family; the second was for Canto III, stanza 42, but showed Mooma and the Jesuit.</note> The poem will soon be finished now that I have begun the last canto, &amp; am impatient to have it off my hands.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  I will write to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HowleyWilliam">the Episcope</ref> as you desire, &#8211; but tell me, if I am to call it a <hi rend="ital">petition</hi>, &#8211; for the word seems an odd one.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey was asking his brother to request William Howley to support Henry Herbert&#8217;s application to become a Fellow of the Royal Society. Southey did so on 24 December 1824, Letter 4304.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">  Edmund &amp; Arthur are both good names, &amp; you may toss up for either.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey&#8217;s new child was christened William Southey (1824&#8211;1871). He was born on 16 November 1824 and later served with the East India Company Army, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. However, Southey&#8217;s advice was not totally dismissed; Henry Herbert christened two of his future sons Edmund Southey (born 1828) and Arthur Southey (born 1833). There were no Oliver or Walter Southeys though.</note> I should like Oliver better, or Walter, &#8211; which last I should have taken had I had another son, &#8211; &amp; perhaps have asked <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Walter Landor</ref> to have <del>sponsor</del> godfathered him, the two greatest Walters since Walter Tyler.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Wat Tyler (d. 1381; <title>DNB</title>), leader of the Peasants&#8217; Revolt in 1381 and subject of Southey&#8217;s play, <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Should the union which you suspect take place, I know of no single word which can express so compound a relationship as will be produced by it. You must then address the person in question as Niece, my Aunt, or Aunt, my Niece.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey may have speculated that Edith May Southey, or Bertha Southey, might marry one of Herbert Hill&#8217;s sons, especially the eldest, Edward Hill. Southey was in the habit of referring to Herbert Hill&#8217;s sons as the &#8216;Welsh Uncles&#8217; of his children &#8211; a term for older cousins. As Southey&#8217;s daughters were Henry Herbert Southey&#8217;s nieces this might produce the terms &#8216;Niece, my Aunt, or Aunt, my Niece&#8217;.</note>
