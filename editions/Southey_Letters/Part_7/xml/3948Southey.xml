<opener><salute>My dear Harry</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Your information that <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">the great man</ref> has taken the History<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), published by John Murray.</note> to himself, puts me to a more round-about way of sending a copy to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> than would otherwise have been necessary. I have desired him to send it to you; &#38; if you will send it with the inclosed note to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Our Fathers which are in the Row</ref>, they will make up a parcel according to the directions therein given, &#38; ship it accordingly.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Trant<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Brigadier-General Nicholas Trant (1769–1839; <title>DNB</title>), an Irish army officer who was assigned to command Portuguese forces. He served with distinction in many actions in the Peninsular War 1808–1813.</note> has written to offer me some papers, which are likely to be very serviceable. I have desired him to send them to you, – &#38; you may either give them to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> for an Admiralty frank, or to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> that <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> may put upon them his sign potential. He is the most ponderous of all frankers, – last week I received from him by one post, three &#60;large&#62; octavo volumes in as many franks.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am sorry <ref type="m" target="people.html#FoxHenryRichard">Lord Holland</ref> is sore,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 3–61 (esp. pp. 55–58), criticised the Whigs for opposing war with France.</note> tho it is a sign of grace in him. He has many redeeming qualities, &#38; when I come to speak of him individually I shall have to notice the compleat opposition between his feelings &#38; his votes.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), II, pp. 587–588, where Southey reported Lord Holland’s speech in the House of Lords of 8 June 1810 in support of a vote of censure of the government over its Spanish policy, but also his defence in the same speech of the idea of aiding Spanish resistance to the French invasion. </note> As for the Whigs in general, as yet they have only had a small sample of historical truth. In the subsequent volume they may be assured that I shall faithfully record their parliamentary conduct, their wishes, their opinions &#38; their prophecies during the years of which I treat.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The second vol. will go to the press as soon as <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> procures for me a Spanish hist. of the war in Catalonia,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.</note> which I have applied for many months ago. It is wanted for the first chapter. I am in forwardness, &#38; shall not require more than six months to carry it thro the press, – exclusive of the two which my journey will consume.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I know not whether <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref> can be spared to accompany me,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was planning a visit to London, though he did not leave Keswick until 3 November 1823.</note> – owing to <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.s</ref> absence. Yet I wish to take her: &#38; she wishes to go. Part of my time I must be at <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref>, – &#38; part I think at <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</ref>. – You want me to raise your spirits, – I would not exchange <hi rend="ital">mine</hi> for <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdales</ref> estates.</p>
	<p>I continue in fine condition. Every morning before breakfast I go to the Crag,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Friars Crag, a short walk from the centre of Keswick.</note> &#38; then <del>E</del> if the wind is not too high Echo hears the voice she loves,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In Greek mythology, the mountain nymph Echo was cursed to repeat the words of others. These included Narcissus, the youth she loved.</note> – &#38; I take another walk before dinner, – of length according to the weather &#38; my humour. It would often be longer if I had a companion, – but as it is, the purpose is answered.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">Do not let your carriage which is meant to give you a lift in the world, depress you. I have great confidence that both you &#38; I shall continue to go on from good to better</p>
