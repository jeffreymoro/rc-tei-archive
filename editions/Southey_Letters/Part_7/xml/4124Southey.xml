            <p rend="indent1">If your Uncle[Southey,HH] has not made any other engagement for me, I will very gladly dine with Lady Malet<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>).</note> on Thursday. I shall not be in town before the evening of Wednesday, because I must halt at Winchester, to see M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Heathcote &#38; Miss Bigg.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Heathcote (1773–1855) and Alethea Bigg (1777–1847), two sisters of Catherine Hill who shared a house at 12 Cathedral Close, Winchester.</note> To that <del>place</del> city my place is taken for tomorrow afternoon.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have got the Packing up – as you desired. But <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesCaroline">Miss B.</ref> has other unengraved things of the same kind which are still better. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BunburyHenryWilliam">Bunbury</ref> himself did not excel her in this talent.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Your liability to cold renders a London life, I am afraid, very unfit for you. And whether I can venture to take you to Norwich or not, must depend upon your capability of undertaking the journey, &#38; bearing its fatigues &#38; discomforts. I cannot therefore desire <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</ref> to take our places, as I should otherwise have done, but must myself see how you are.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I forgot to tell you in my last, that I finished my Book<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> at Crediton, &#38; found the concluding proof sheets on my arrival here.</p>
