In the final article of 27 October 1824, Stoddart paid particular attention to attacking Byron&#8217;s <title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), which had parodied Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), and defending Southey against Byron&#8217;s &#8216;vindictive hatred&#8217;.</note> His Lordship it seems found me an ugly customer, &amp; considering how ill he bore punishment, it was fortunate for him that I took <del>no</del> &lt;so&gt; little notice of his continual provocations.

Even Murray I see has been obliged to come forward &amp; prove him a liar, by his own letters.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Medwin&#8217;s <title>Conservations</title> recorded a good many criticisms of Murray by Byron. Most importantly, Medwin suggested that Murray had broken a contract between the publisher and Byron. Murray responded with a pamphlet, &#8216;Notes on Captain Medwin&#8217;s Conversations of Lord Byron&#8217; (1824), which was widely distributed to, and reproduced by, the press, for example, in the <title>Morning Post</title> and <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 6 November 1824.</note>

His army was riven by intrigue. Soult attempted to have himself proclaimed ruler of Northern Lusitania; a counter-movement was headed by General Louis Henry Loison (1771&#8211;1816), and there may also have been a small republican conspiracy against Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French 1804&#8211;1814, 1815) among lower-ranking officers. Southey covered these matters in his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London 1823&#8211;1832), II, pp. 185&#8211;195, 303&#8211;309.</note>

The first two volumes published in 1824 were not succeeded by a third until 1828.</note> He has made one of those lucky hits &lt;by&gt; which an author sometimes secures his own certain fame, by falling upon the very kind of composition which he is best able to execute. I am heartily rejoiced at it. With the utmost difference of temper, &amp; some wide differences of opinion, I never yet saw any one with whom I had so much sympathy in intellect &amp; feeling, as <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Walter Landor</ref>.</p>
