My plan grew out of Boethius,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (c. 480–525), <title>De Consolatione Philosophiae</title>, a dialogue between the author and the character of Lady Philosophy.</note> tho it has since been so modified, that the origin would not be suspected.

            <p rend="indent1">  The complaint in <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</ref> eyes is a serious inconvenience to him, but it threatens nothing worse. I have been greatly alarmed about him, this week, by hearing that he had a dreadful fall from a horse; but to day we learn that he is well. The horse ran away with him, &#38; threw him against a wall. His head was cut, &#38; bled profusely, which possibly prevented worse consequences. – <ref type="m" target="people.html#ChantreyFrancis">Chantry</ref> has made a noble bust of him.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Francis Chantrey’s bust of Wordsworth, completed in 1820.</note> [note to self: code some ampersandnbsp; here x 10] Augustus Hare<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Augustus William Hare (1792–1834; <title>DNB</title>), a clergyman and writer.</note> showed me yesterday what you had written of Wordsworth in a letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#HareJulius ">his brother</ref>. – It is a great pleasure to me when I meet with a person who knows your writings, &#38; can talk with me about them &#38; about you.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> You have I suppose seen or heard of the decorous manner in which <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> resented my comments upon the Satanic school of poetry, – &#38; of the manner in which he introduced your name.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), ‘Preface’, pp. xvii–xxii, where Southey denounced ‘the Satanic School’ of modern poetry, without naming any one poet. In the ‘Appendix’ to ‘The Two Foscari’, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: ‘I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey’s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland during his continental tour of May–August 1817. Byron believed that Southey had subsequently spread rumours that Byron and Shelley engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. Byron continued: ‘One of his [Southey’s] consolations appears to be a Latin note from a work of a Mr. Landor, the author of “Gebir”, whose friendship for Robert Southey will, it seems, “be an honour to him when the ephemeral disputes and ephemeral reputations of the day are forgotten.” [<title>Vision of Judgement</title>, pp. xix–xx] I for one neither envy him “the friendship”, nor the glory in reversion which is to accrue from it, like Mr. Thelusson’s fortune in the third and fourth generation. [Peter Thellusson (1735–1797) left his fortune in trust for his descendants, but nothing to his living relatives] This friendship will probably be as memorable as his own epics, which (as I quoted to him ten or twelve years ago in “English Bards”) Porson said “would be remembered when Homer and Virgil are forgotten, and not till then.” [Byron, <title>English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers; A Satire</title> (London, 1809), p. 9] For the present I leave him.’ (p. 329).</note> I believe he will take the advice which I gave him in reply, &#38; not meddle with me again in prose.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had responded with a letter to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. This was published in the <title>Courier</title> on 11 January 1822. In the conclusion to his letter, Southey had advised Byron: ‘When he attacks me again let it be in rhyme. For one who has so little command of himself, it will be a great advantage that his temper should be obliged to keep to tune.’ Unfortunately for Southey, Byron responded with <title>The Vision of Judgment</title>, a parody of <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), published in <title>The Liberal</title>, 1 (October 1822), 3–39.</note></p>
