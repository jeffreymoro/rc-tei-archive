           <p rend="indent1"> As soon as you departed I settled regularly to my habitual course of life which had been so much to my benefit broken up thro the summer. At the same time, I very dutifully began to observe your directions, &#38; have walked every day with the exception of one stormy one long enough &#38; far enough to require rubbing down. This is against the grain but I feel how beneficial it is, &#38; therefore do not grumble.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I finished a paper for the QR<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), published 15 February 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – the first part of which I think you saw, – &#38; the second detachment of proofs is now on the table. Something also has been done to the Book of the Church<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> – a portion of copy will be ready for the next post. But my main employment has been upon a box of papers from <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Bart. Frere</ref>, about half which I have gone thro extracting as I go.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Used in Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> They are very interesting, &#38; will give me all the information I need down to the time when Sydenhams collection<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Benjamin Sydenham (1777–1828), a soldier in India, friend of Marquess Wellesley and Commissioner of the Board of Excise 1809–1819, had sent Southey the papers of his brother, Thomas Sydenham (1780–1816), who had served in Spain 1811–1812 before becoming Minister Plenipotentiary at Lisbon 1814–1816.</note> <del>xx</del> begins. I have worked, &#38; am working at them, with great perseverance.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The American books have arrived<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been sent a consignment of books by George Ticknor.</note> &#38; I am reading with much interest Dwights Travels<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Dwight (1752–1817), <title>Travels in New-England and New-York</title> (1821–1822), no. 881 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (October 1823), 1–40, published 17 April 1824.</note> in his own country – a posthumous work. The author (whose unhappy name is Timothy) wrote in his youth some forty years ago an heroic poem upon the Conquest of Canaan,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Dwight, <title>The Conquest of Canaan</title> (1785). The book was reprinted in London by Joseph Johnson (1738–1809; <title>DNB</title>) in 1788.</note> which was puffed &#38; reprinted in London. Its stilted versification was admired in those days but it had little or no real merit. Dwight however tho a bad poet, – because of a bad school,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In heroic couplets, Dwight’s poem was much influenced by John Dryden (1631–1700; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Works of Virgil: Containing his Pastorals, Georgics and Aeneis: Adorn’d with a Hundred Sculptures, Translated into English Verse by Mr Dryden</title> (1697).</note> – was a sensible man, &#38; he kept a journal of his <del>jourxx</del> travels &#38; prepared it for publication from a conviction that a faithful description of New England in all its parts such as it then was would in a few generations become exceedingly interesting, how unimportant it might appear if published as soon as it was written. A great deal of course is only interesting locally, but on the whole the picture of what the country is, his fair views of the state of society there, with its advantages &#38; disadvantages, &#38; the number of curious facts which are brought together make it very well worth reading. I would give a good deal to see as trustworthy &#38; minute an account of the Southern States. – This is just the sort of <del>xx</del> book which might be digested into a review.</p>

The fact that Murray was the publisher of both Byron and the <title>Quarterly Review</title> was not mentioned.
