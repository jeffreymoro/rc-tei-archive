           <salute> My dear Harry</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Yesterday I received an official letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnightonSirWilliam">Sir Wm K.</ref><note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Knighton had presented a copy of the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832) to George IV, to whom it was dedicated,</note> couched in the handsomest terms, – &#38; to which, – <del>xxx</del> I dare say he will have told you, <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> himself had added “entirely approved – GR” – What can I say to this, but in the words which John Kemble<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Philip Kemble (1757–1823; <title>DNB</title>), actor-manager from a famous theatrical family. He was manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden 1803–1817.</note> was instructed to use, – “Your M. is too gracious!” – It is however a mark of special <del>mark</del> &#60;grace&#62;, – &#38; worth quite as much, in its way, as the thanks of Parliament to an officer. If <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> had been here it would have made her happy for the day. As it is <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">E May</ref> are the only persons who will know any thing about it; for were it to come to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</ref> knowledge, he would be taking some provoking step or other upon the presumption of my favour at court, such as writing to <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnightonSirWilliam">Knighton</ref>, &#38; God knows who beside. He has played tricks of this kind which must make me much more upon my guard against him than I shall ever be against an enemy.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Of course there can be no occasion for me to write a formal letter of acknowledgement. In all matters of form I follow the maxim which as you may remember, is the first lesson instilled into my young ones – that “the least which is said, is the soonest mended,” &#38; you can say to <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnightonSirWilliam">Sir Wm</ref> how much I am gratified &#38;c –</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have persevered very dutifully in taking regular exercise, – twice a day to the Crag<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Friars Crag, a short walk from the centre of Keswick.</note> being my shortest allowance, except in what may be called impossible weather. Certainly I perceive the good effect in increased appetite &#38; muscular tone, – being free from my old complaint,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s rectal prolapse.</note> – &#38; altogether in fine condition.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The regular course of my days at present is this, – a walk to the Crag before breakfast, – when if it be not too cold for holding the hands up, I take a book with me. After breakfast – a lesson in Ovid<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Publius Ovidius Naso (43 BC–AD 17/18), Latin poet and author of <title>Metamorphoses</title> (AD 8).</note> with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref>, in Phaedrus &#38; the Grammar<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Phaedrus (fl. 1st century), <title>Fabulae Aesopiae</title>, a Latin collection of fables, read together with a Latin Grammar.</note> with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bel</ref>, – in Tacitus<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Publius Cornelius Tacitus (AD 56–117), Latin historian and author of <title>Historiae</title> and <title>Annales</title>.</note> with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">E. May</ref>, &#38; in the Orlando Innamorato<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Matteo Boiardo (1441–1494), <title>Orlando Innamorato</title> (1495).</note> with her, or in a Spanish Chronicle with her &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, – these latter lessons alternating. Then I settle to my own work, be that what it may, till it is time for a second walk. – After dinner, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">E May</ref> comes up &#38; I sit down with grammar &#38; dictionary, like a schoolboy, doggedly to a lesson in Danish, for about three quarters of an hour – then take a nap on the sofa till tea. After tea comes letter writing (far too often) &#38; steady work till supper; – &#38; then with my punch, – or black-currant rum I take a portion of Dutch tragedy to conclude all. – Other reading comes in the odds &#38; ends of time, – which are worth a great deal, when they are regularly carried to account. And thus the days pass on, – <hi rend="ital">nulla dies sine lineâ</hi>,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">‘No day without a line’, a common saying, derived from Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79), <title>Naturalis Historia</title> (AD 77–79), Book 35, paragraph 84, where he reported it as the practice of the painter Apelles of Cos (4th century BC).</note> – &#38; none without some addition, or reparation of knowledge.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your eldest niece</ref> is quite as industrious in her way as I am.
