Whigs and radicals in Britain urged to government to pressurise France not to intervene in Spain</note> I am not apprehensive of any evil consequences to this country, &#8211; &amp; should have thought any surmise of our being involved in war altogether groundless, if <ref type="m" target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Littleton</ref> had not made himself conspicuous at the dinner given to the Ambassadors.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A public dinner was held at the City of London Tavern on 7 March 1823 to support the Spanish liberal regime. The guests of honour were Juan Jabat Aztal (1772&#8211;1825), the Spanish Ambassador 1822&#8211;1823, Jo&#227;o Francisco de Oliveira (dates unknown), the Portuguese charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires 1821&#8211;1822, and Lorenzo Fernandez de Villavicencio y Canas, 3rd Duke of San Lorenzo and Valhermoso (1778&#8211;1859), formerly Spanish Ambassador to France. Littleton was one of a number of eminent speakers and proposed a toast to &#8216;Civil and Religious Liberty all over the World&#8217;. Littleton was a supporter of Canning, but might be expected to know Wellington&#8217;s thoughts on Spain as he was married to Wellington&#8217;s niece, Hyacinthe Mary (d. 1849).</note> He I think must know what <ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">the Duke of W.s</ref> opinion is, &amp; would not act in opposition to it. But notwithstanding this I have little doubt that we shall remain at peace. &#8211; Whether the French act wisely in their interference is another question. <del>X</del> It is not so certain that they can interfere with effect, as it is that they might have looked on safely. The difficulty is not in establishing a better Government, but in supporting one when it is established, in a country whose resources are ruined.</p>
