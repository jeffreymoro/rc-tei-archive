He died on 24 February 1822. Boswell completed Edmond Malone (1741&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare, with the Corrections and Illustrations of Various Commentators: Comprehending a Life of the Poet, and an Enlarged History of the Stage</title> (1821), no. 2539 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> is now to be had cheaper than it will ever be again, except when a chance copy occurs at a sale, &#8211; for about seven guineas I think. I suspect it will be &lt;the&gt; last of those editions in which the Editor heaps Pelion upon Ossa. Buy it therefore for me (for I have no better Shakespere than Stockdales,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Stockdale (1750&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), published <title>Stockdale&#8217;s Edition of Shakespeare: Including, in One Volume, the Whole of the Dramatic Works, with Explanatory Notes Compiled from Various Commentators</title> (1784).</note> &amp; it is not decorous that I should be thus ill provided) &#8211; if it be <del>sold</del> charged 8 guineas that will be two thirds the original cost, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> will refund you. You will see it marked in some of those shop windows which lay their baits for ready money. Let them send it to me <hi rend="ital">by waggon</hi>, &amp; say that as you cannot collate the copy, they will of course supply any defects if any should be found when it arrives here; &#8211; - the first thing I do with a new book is to see that it be perfect.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I have been looking every day to hear of <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">J May</ref>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son, John May (1802&#8211;1879), visited Southey at Keswick 5 August&#8211;2 September 1822.</note> My old friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref> is with me, &amp; by his help I have got rid of my cold, leaving it somewhere among the mountains. He urges me very strongly to remove to the neighbourhood of London, &amp; by way of removing all difficulties in the way, offers at any time to lend me money for purchasing a house &amp; removing to it. But I am much more inclined to remain where I am, unless the ground should be sold piecemeal, which there is some danger of, in consequence of Clarkes death,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Clark (d. 1822) had rented some land that was next to, and part of the same estate as, Greta Hall. He was a nurseryman, but had been declared bankrupt on 11 March 1817.</note> the nursery ground being to be given up.</p>

The volume has cost me much labour, &amp; I think you will not be disappointed either in the matter or manner. The second will not require half the time. I may very well get thro it in eight or nine months, without any unusual exertion.</p>

          <p rend="indent1">I am not surprized at what you say of the effect produced upon you now by <ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">Wm Ts</ref> conversation. It is well calculated to astonish &amp; dazzle young &amp; uninformed minds, but they who grow wiser as they grow older require something more substantial. In that want of fixed opinions, &#8211; in that love of sporting with all subjects, &#8211; in that desire of surprizing &amp; startling others, &#8211; there is a hollowness &#8211; &amp; heartlessness, which he himself must feel. But the vicious habit has now become part of his nature; &amp; he is hardly sensible how much his education has injured him, &amp; how much he has injured himself. With all the regard that I bear him, &amp; with all the real admiration which I feel for his extraordinary talents, still the prevailing sentiments with me, when I think of <del>him</del> &lt;W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. T.&gt; are regret at the thoughts of what he might have been, &amp; compassion for what he will be</p>
