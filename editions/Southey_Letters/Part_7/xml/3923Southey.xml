           <p rend="indent1"> I do not recollect whether I have given you joy of your son<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey, Jnr (1822–1829) was born on 6 November 1822.</note> or not; – for without talking extravagantly or madly upon the subject, where there is a fair prospect that a child will be fairly set forward in the world, its birth is a subject for congratulation. Besides it is a joyful change in a house when all is “as well as can be expected.”</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The letter for <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnightonSirWilliam">Sir William</ref> comes herewith.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to William Knighton, 25 November 1822, Letter 3922. This asked Knighton to present a copy of the first volume of the <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832) to George IV, to whom it was dedicated.</note> Will you tell <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> where a copy can be directed to Haygarth,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Haygarth (1784–1825), a poet and travel writer, son of the physician John Haygarth (1740–1827; <title>DNB</title>). Haygarth was a friend of Henry Herbert Southey and had provided Southey with a letter describing the campaign in northern Portugal in 1809; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 31 January 1816, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 2705.</note> to whom one is due for some materials which he communicated.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">If <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> would make me a present of the publications of the Record Committee<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Commissioners on the Public Records of the Kingdom had been periodically appointed since 1800. They had supported plans to publish series such as <title>Statutes of the Realm</title> (1810–1825).</note> they would be well bestowed. <del>&#38;</del> I want too many costly books for my historical pursuits, &#38; these are among them. Wherever original documents are within my reach I go to them; &#38; it is surprizing how much I find there which has been overlooked. My gleanings are often worth more than the harvest of those who have been before me. Something of this you will see in the B of the Church,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> at which I have been chiefly employed since your departure.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> You must know &#60;more&#62; concerning the QR.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">William Gifford, the editor of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, was ill and there was much speculation over who would succeed him; John Taylor Coleridge did so briefly.</note> at this time than I do.

If he understood his own interest, there could not be a moments hesitation. What with <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> indifference in all matters of taste – (where if he had any leaning it was to the wrong side) with his admission of mischievous articles, such as those relating to America, &#38; of the sermons of the Dean of Westminster<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Ireland (1761–1842; <title>DNB</title>), Dean of Westminster 1816–1842. He was a close friend of William Gifford and had been a regular contributor to the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> (to whom I ascribe the <hi rend="ital">discourse</hi> on <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> in the last number)<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The review of Byron’s <title>Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice.

The Two Foscari, A Tragedy, Cain, A Mystery</title> (1821), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 27 (July 1822), 476–524, published 23 October 1822, was by Reginald Heber, not John Ireland. It was not the swingeing condemnation that Southey would have liked.</note> &#38; what with the disgraceful temper in which some of his own papers were written, <del>&#38; som</del> the Review might easily decline as rapidly as it had risen.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">There is a passage from my tender epistle quoted in the last number.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Palgrave’s review of the first volume of Lewis Cottingham (1787–1847), <title>Plans, Elevations, Sections, Details and Views of the Magnificent Chapel of King Henry VII at Westminster Abbey Church, with a History of its Foundation &#38;c</title> (1822–1829), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 27 (July 1822), 308–336 (esp. 310–311), published 23 October 1822, quoting Southey’s <title>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M. P.</title> (London, 1817), pp. 37–41. Southey suggests that this passage had originated in one censored by Gifford from Southey’s article, ‘Parliamentary Reform’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 225–278, published 11 February 1817.</note> It is curious that that very passage should have been originally written for the review, &#38; struck out of it by <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">the Editor</ref>.</p>
