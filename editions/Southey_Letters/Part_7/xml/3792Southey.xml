        <p rend="indent1">I am carrying on an active peninsular correspondence with <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Freres brother</ref>, who was with <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">him</ref> in Spain, &amp; at one time supplied his place there.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">This correspondence was in connection with Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> It is of more use to me than whole packets of official papers. By asking questions concerning men &amp; things, &amp; setting his recollection to work, I get at those master facts by which difficulties are unlocked.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The new system in the public offices of promoting men by merit &amp; not according to seniority, seems to me just so much patronage given to the heads of those departments, &#8211; a measure sure always to produce a feeling of injustice, &amp; in most cases no doubt with good reason. The principle of regular succession is one which satisfies every body, &#8211; they know what they have to expect when they enter the office, &amp; go on contentedly.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am glad for his own sake that <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> is in office, but I do not anticipate any accession of strength or popularity to the Government, from its alliance with the Grenvilles<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">After a lengthy period of negotiation, which had begun in June 1821, the followers of Lord Grenville, including Wynn, had finally agreed to support the government in January 1822. Several Grenvillites achieved office. Wynn joined the Cabinet and became President of the Board of Control.</note> &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord G.</ref> is in my judgement a bad statesman, who has been wrong upon every question of importance, except concerning the Radicals.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">A Jacquerie in Ireland, &#8211; or a <hi rend="ital">Pa</hi>terie as it may be called, will be near enough to have some effect as a warning.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Severe disturbances in the west of rural Ireland had begun in October 1821 and continued for the next two years. The Cabinet called on troops from England and the Empire to try and enforce order, with little immediate effect.</note> You see even Lord Donoughmore cried out for strong measures.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Hely-Hutchinson, 1st Earl of Donoughmore (1756&#8211;1825), Irish politician and landowner. The <title>Morning Post</title>, 8 December 1821, had published a letter from Donoughmore, dated 28 November 1821, detailing his efforts to preserve order in Tipperary, including arming local men at his own expense to guard Ardfinnan bridge. He concluded the letter: &#8216;In the present entire absence of military protection, we can only do our best for the protection of others; for, thank God! we are able and willing to protect ourselves.&#8217; Donoughmore was a Whig and a supporter of Catholic Emancipation.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This cry against the resumption of cash payments is a good <del>proof</del> specimen of our speechifyers honesty.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Following extensive argument, the convertibility of Bank of England notes into gold had been resumed in May 1821. This procedure was widely criticised for restricting credit and administering a deflationary shock to the economy.</note> Some few months ago <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">my neighbour Calvert</ref> was talking upon this subject with James Brougham<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">James Brougham (1780&#8211;1833), leading Whig politician in the Lake District.</note> (<ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">B.s</ref> brother) &amp; that fellow had the impudence to say the Whigs knew it to be a mischievous measure, &amp; forced it upon the ministers for that reason. I believe him as to their rascality, but not as to their foresight.</p>
