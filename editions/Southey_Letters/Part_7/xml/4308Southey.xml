        <p rend="indent1"> You will not suppose because my letters follow each other so fast at this time, that I am about to become a habitual nuisance, &amp; that a correspondence with me is to be one of the disagreables attached to your Editorship.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Taylor Coleridge had just taken over as editor of the <title>Quarterly Review</title> 1824&#8211;1825.</note> &#8211; But both my own concerns &amp; yours require that I should write just now.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will see <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 17 December 1824, published a letter entitled &#8216;Southey versus Lord Byron&#8217;, which contained a sustained attack on Southey. The latter consulted Turner about possible legal action against the newspaper, but eventually decided not to proceed.</note> &#8211; tho he recommends a course which I shall not follow, that of proceeding by information,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">To proceed by information was to bring a formal criminal charge against someone, in this case the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>&#8217;s editor and printer, for libel. This would provoke a trial in which Southey could counter the paper&#8217;s attack on him under oath in court. However, as this would be a private prosecution, Southey faced the possibility of incurring heavy costs.</note> &amp; involving myself in expence &amp; trouble, for the purpose of giving a solemn denial to charges which most certainly are not believed by the very miscreant himself who has made them. He wishes to avoid any appearance of an attack on my part upon the Press, &amp; the Morning Chronicle, whereas it appears to me that if I have an opportunity of <del>bringing that paper to justice</del> punishing that newspaper for its abuse of the press, I ought just as much to do it in this case, as I would bring a fellow to justice for assaulting me on the highway. Allowing them as large a latitude as they desire for political abuse, I would rest solely upon the charge of impious &amp; blasphemous obscenities.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Has Mr. Southey, or has he not, in one of his publications, raked up and collected together (note upon note, and line upon line) the most salacious, prurient, and filthy witticisms upon the most awful and sacred subjects, upon the Vessel of Incarnation chosen for the redemption of mankind, upon the Salutation of the Angel, upon the formation of our Holy Redeemer in the uterus, and upon the practicability of clergymen baptizing children in the vagina of their mothers&#8217; wombs before they were brought into the world?&#8217; (<title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 17 December 1824).</note> That charge must be founded upon the Extracts in the Omniana. Vol I. p. 123.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Omniana or Horae Otiosiores</title>, 2 vols (London, 1812), I, pp. 123&#8211;128, quoting a prayer to the Virgin Mary from Arthur Crowder (1588/1589&#8211;1666; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Jesus, Maria, Joseph, or the Devout Pilgrim of the Ever-Blessed Virgin Mary, in His Holy Exercises, Affections, and Elevations, upon the sacred Mysteries of Jesus, Maria, Joseph</title> (Amsterdam, 1657), unpaginated, no. 1515 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> with regard to the baptism of children before they are born, I cannot remember that I have ever mentioned it (tho very likely I may, as one of the abominations to which Catholic superstition leads) &#8211; except in a very curious passage from Feyjoo, which is given in the Annual Review. Vol I. p. 562.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Benito Jer&#243;nimo Feijoo (1674&#8211;1764), <title>Cartas Eruditas, y Curiosas</title>, 5 vols (Madrid, 1781), I, pp. 94&#8211;120, no. 3297 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Southey had cited, and provided a brief summary of, Feijoo&#8217;s opinion on the following theological problem: &#8216;In 1736, a child was born at Medina Sidonia, with two heads, two trunks, but single below the middle. As the birth was dangerous, one of the feet which made its appearance first was baptised. Upon this two questions arose, and were referred to Feyjoo for solution. Was the child one or two individuals? if two, did the baptism of the foot regenerate both?&#8217; This puzzling issue was dealt with in Southey&#8217;s review of Augustin Louis Josse (1763&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), <title>El Tesoro Espanol o Biblioteca Portatil Espanola</title> (1802), <title>Annual Review for 1802</title>, 1 (1803), 557&#8211;566 (562). (Josse&#8217;s book was no. 3657 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.)</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">My brother</ref> has both that &amp; the Omniana. So many things are possible in law, that it must be only a lawyer who can determine whether there be any thing in those two passages, upon which a justification for this devilish libel can be set up. Should it appear as clear in law as it is in equity that <del>this</del> &lt;it&gt; is a foul &amp; infamous libel, which any Judge &amp; any Jury must pronounce such, then certainly I would bring an action for damages against the Morning Chronicle, without caring who the author may be: that paper having not only inserted it, but called attention to it in its leading paragraph.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;We refer our Readers to a Letter in another column on the subject of Mr. SOUTHEY&#8217;s late extraordinary attack on Lord BYRON&#8217; (<title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 17 December 1824).</note> The rest may be thrown overboard. Let them revile me as an author &amp; a politician till their hearts ache.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was, among many other things, described as &#8216;a republican and a revolutionist&#8217; at the time of the French Revolution and &#8216;a pensioned bookseller&#8217;s hack&#8217; (<title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 17 December 1824).</note> Their obloquy serves only to show that my opinions have an influence in society, which they know &amp; feel. And if it gives me any feeling, it is that of satisfaction at seeing to what base &amp; unmanly practises they are obliged to descend. But this goes beyond all bounds of political or even personal animosity. There can be no villainy of which a man would not be capable, who is capable of bringing forward such charges upon such grounds. True it is that my character needs no vindication, &amp; I would not lift a finger to vindicate it. But if I have a villain by the throat, I would deliver him over to justice. Nevertheless if you &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> agree in opinion that I had better let the matter alone, I shall without hesitation follow the advice. And it is well to bear in mind that there has more than once been manifested a <del>xxxx</del> &lt;most&gt; reprehensible disposition in the Judges to favour the wrong side, lest they should be suspected of leaning toward the right.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  Now to the business of the Review. I have laid aside Bayard according to your wish, &amp; begun with the Ch. Miss. Society.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Sara Coleridge&#8217;s translation, <title>The Right Joyous and Pleasant History of the Feats, Gests, and Prowesses of the Chevalier Bayard, the Good Knight without Fear and without Reproach</title> (1825). Unsurprisingly, Southey gave this a glowing recommendation in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 32 (October 1825), 355&#8211;397. However, Southey had laid work on this aside in favour of a second article that appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 32 (June 1825), 1&#8211;42. This was (ostensibly) a review of <title>An Abstract of the Annual Reports and Correspondence of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, from the Commencement of its Connexion with the East India Missions, A. D. 1709, to the Present Day</title> (1814); and of the Church Missionary Society&#8217;s <title>Missionary Register</title> (1813&#8211;1824), no. 1962 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. The latter organisation was founded in 1799 by evangelical Anglicans. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (founded 1698) is also an Anglican missionary organisation.</note> The change may occasion a weeks delay, but you shall have the paper in time. In this paper my purpose is to treat the subject of missions in general, &amp; give a general view of what the Ch: of England in particular has done &amp; is doing in this way. Therefore I shall be glad of some Reports of the Soc. for propagating the Gospel; &#8211; &amp; also of those of the Home Missionary Society, &#8211; upon which I am inclined to lay a heavy hand.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts (founded 1701) is an Anglican society that concentrated on missions to British colonies. The Baptist Home Missionary Society was founded in 1797 to encourage itinerant preaching in Britain, and was heavily criticised by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 32 (June 1825), 1&#8211;42.</note> &#8211; I care not what Travels you send me, &#8211; having abundant notes &amp; references for any part of the habitable earth. Mexico might tempt me into too wide a field, &#8211; for if <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> had sent me Bullocks book<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">William Bullock (c. 1773&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Six Months&#8217; Residence and Travels in Mexico; Containing Remarks on the Present State of New-Spain, its Natural Productions, State of Society, Manufactures, Trade, Agriculture, and Antiquities, &amp;c.</title> (1824). The book was published by Murray.</note> I had thought of preparing an important paper upon the former civilization of that country. Perhaps the account of Portugal which he just now advertises<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Marianne Baillie (1788&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Lisbon in the Years 1821, 1822 and 1823</title> (1824), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 378&#8211;390, published 11 March 1825.</note> will be a subject <del>that</del> I can treat with more expedition than any other &#8211; I would not think of Lord J Russells book,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Lord John Russell (1792&#8211;1878; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Affairs of Europe from the Peace of Utrecht</title> (1824&#8211;1829), no. 2579 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> or the Annuaire,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Literally a &#8216;yearbook&#8217;. Possibly <title>Annuaire Historique Universel pour 1823</title> (1824).</note> because there are large subjects enough before me &#8211; to wit Bayard (which I shall dress up well) &#8211; Baxter,<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">The Puritan clergyman Richard Baxter (1615&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>). It is not clear which of his works Southey was here suggesting he review. He may have heard of the forthcoming <title>The Practical Works of the Rev. Richard Baxter with a Life of the Author and a Critical Examination of his Writings</title> (1830), edited by William Orme (1787&#8211;1830; <title>DNB</title>). Southey did not write on the subject for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> &amp; (which I forgot to mention in my last) the forthcoming edition of Sir T.

        <p rend="indent1">  Concerning the Catholic Question<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">The question of whether Catholics should be allowed to hold public office in the United Kingdom.</note> you doubt whether conceding it will really weaken or strengthen us for the struggle which is sure to follow the concession; &#8211; &amp; whether there is any hope of ultimately resisting the present demand. It is this latter &lt;view&gt; which leads many good men at this time to take the wrong side, &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">Wilberforce</ref> for example &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#AclandThomasSir">Sir T Acland</ref>. They both think that because too much has been granted, more must be given. I differ from them most decidedly &#8211; in the belief that if the cession be prevented a few years longer, the Catholic Religion will show itself so plainly in its true colours every where, that the broad distinction between Protestants &amp; Papists will place us in perfect safety. But to the first question I answer without any hesitation that the concession would most materially endanger the Church of England. An object which all the enemies of that Church are united in seeking, must be injurious to it. The Dissenters &#8211; the Whigs &#8211; the Liberals &#8211; what care they for the Catholics? they have their own views to serve by aiding them in this question. The immediate consequence of the concession would be &#8211; the repeal of the Test Act,<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">The Test Act (1673) ensured that only members of the Church of England could hold public office in the United Kingdom,</note> &#8211; in go the Dissenters into the Corporations, &#8211; &amp; in come their members into Parliament. The Tithes &amp; the Church property &lt;then&gt; become the objects of attack, &#8211; &amp; I know not to what extent the evil may not be carried. &#8211; By the by you will see ere long a collection of all that has been said against the Church in Parliament during the last session, &#8211; put together by a clergyman &#8211; a friend of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wordsworth&#8217;s</ref>; &#8211; that it may clearly be seen what the enemies of the Church are aiming at.<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">It is unclear which publication Southey is referring to here.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The number of Catholic members who would immediately be returned to Parliament would not be inconsiderable. They would not dream at once of bringing about the reestablishment of their Church; &#8211; but they fully expect it sooner or later; their numbers in England have increased seven fold within the last thirty years (so it is stated) &#8211; &amp; they know<del>n</del> that whatever weakens the Establishment tends surely to strengthen them. For the spirit of Popery is a stronger spirit than that either of Puritanism or of Infidelity, another consequence is that the King must be allowed the same liberty of conscience as his subjects, &amp; the same liberty of marrying a Roman Catholic if he chuses, &#8211; tho we know what that liberty has cost us.<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">George IV had already married a Catholic, Maria Fitzherbert (1756&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>), in 1785, though the marriage was invalid under the Royal Marriages Act (1772). However, Southey may be referring to the marriage of Charles I (1600&#8211;1649; King of Great Britain 1625&#8211;1649; <title>DNB</title>) to the Catholic Henrietta Maria of France (1609&#8211;1669; <title>DNB</title>), which some critics felt had contributed to the civil wars of 1642&#8211;1651.</note>

        <p rend="indent1">  My principle is the plain one, that no persons ought to be trusted with political power who think it their duty to alter the constitution of the Church. The argument which <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> used in a letter to me some months ago is wholly fallacious &#8211; that we ought to do as is done in Russia &amp; Austria with other modes of faith.<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">In Austria (since 1781) and Russia (increasingly from 1801 onwards) members of minority faiths could practise their religion in private.</note> There is no similarity in the cases.
