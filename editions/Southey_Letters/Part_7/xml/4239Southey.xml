          <salute>  My dear friend</salute></opener>
          <p rend="indent1">  Your letter would not have remained a single post unanswered – if it had been in my power to have replied to it. But I found it yesterday on returning from the first mornings exercise I have ventured to take, – when I had only twenty minutes for dressing to receive <ref type="m" target="people.html#JebbJohn">the Bishops of Limerick</ref> &#38; New York<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Henry Hobart (1775–1830), Episcopal Bishop of New York 1816–1830. He undertook a prolonged visit to Europe in 1823–1825, in an attempt to improve his health.</note> at dinner, – &#38; was moreover in a state of great bodily uneasiness. – My first business this morning is thus to do – what I was in this manner compelled yesterday to leave undone.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Your excellent mother<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary May, née Coppendale (1745–1824), May’s mother, had died on 21 August 1824.</note> appears to have been favoured with something like that <hi rend="ital">&#949;&#965;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#945;</hi><note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘euthanasia’, literally a ‘good death’.</note> which in patriarchal <del>xxx</del> times<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The age of the biblical patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, related in <title>Genesis</title> 12–50, when men lived to a great age and died peacefully.</note> seems to have been the natural &#38; ordinary termination of life, but with which not one in ten thousand, – even of those who attain to a good old age, is now blest. You have been fortunate in possessing her so long, – &#38; fortunate even in seeing her depart before the infirmities of age became what they too frequently are, humiliating as well as painful to humanity. This affliction – deep as it is, – has occurred in the due course of nature it was neither unforeseen, nor untimely; – no human care, – no circumstances could have averted, or delayed it. It is a grief which the heart can endure to remember, – which has every thing to hallow it &#38; which time will soon ripen so that it <del>will</del> shall lose all its bitterness.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The generation before us is rapidly passing away, &#38; we are already among the elders of this age. – Neither of my parents compleated their fiftieth year.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">Robert Southey, Senior</ref> had died at the age of 47 and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">Margaret Southey</ref> at 49.</note> I have been very much shaken at the completion of mine. This is the third year in which my annual catarrh has ended in a cough, &#38; this year the cough came on early, lay deep, &#38; keeps still a lingering hold, – as if laying claim to its inheritance tho not perhaps taking livery &#38; seizin of it as yet. The relaxation which this summer visitation always brings on brought with it this year a most unpleasant symptom, – that of a hæmorrhage from the rectum upon walking even a mile, – &#38; once indeed in merely walking the room. I was at one time apprehensive that this would entirely have confined me to the house, but a few cautious trials have given me hope. If I can bring myself into a condition that will allow me to leave home, it is my full purpose next spring to try whether I can avert the yearly attack by running away from it, <del>xxx</del> frequent change of air &#38; much exercise – in a word travelling is the best chance – &#38; I have almost promised the Bp of Limerick[Jebb] (who came here in the hope of taking me to Ireland with him) – that I will visit him next May.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not visit Ireland in 1825, but instead made a journey to the Low Countries.</note></p>
          <p rend="indent1">  I thought to have finished this in the evening – but interruptions usual at this time of year leave me only time to say God bless you, my dear friend</p>
