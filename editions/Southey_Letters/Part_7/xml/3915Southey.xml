Southey had met him in Portugal in 1800–1801. He was the brother of Henry Herbert Southey’s first wife.</note> Liverpool, &#38; ship it for that place, – letting me know by what vessel it is sent, he will look after it there, &#38; forward it to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, &#38; then we will all drink your health in the juice of the apple. It will need a case to protect it on the way from a gimlet.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">There is little chance of any circumstance drawing me from this country to reside in the vicinity of London – at least I can forsee none. The question whether or not the Quarterly Review should do so has been fairly considered &#38; decided in consequence of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> dangerous illness. He had written to me soon after you left us, saying that he could not long continue to conduct the Review &#38; that he knew not where to look for a successor. He was not ill at the time; &#38; therefore my consideration of the matter was not hastily but deliberately made. If I had chosen to propose myself, the office must have been mine, of course. The objections to it were, that the increased expenditure which I must incur near London, would fully consume any <del>advantage</del> increase of income which I should have obtained; &#38; therefore the time consumed in the mere management of the journal, would have been a dead loss. This time would be unpleasantly as well as unprofitably spent, in corresponding upon the mere business of the review, examining communications, &#38; either correcting them myself when there was any thing erroneous, imprudent, or inconsistent with those coherent opinions which the journal should have maintained under my care, – in persuading the respective writers to amend &#38; alter according to that standard. Lastly it seemed that there was nothing <del>in</del> <del>the</del> <del>change of</del> which could recompense me for the sacrifice which it needs would be to quit a country in which I take so much delight, &#38; of which all my family are as fond as myself: &#38; there was this weightier consideration that if I gave up the quantity of time which the management of such a journal requires, it would take away all reasonable hope of my compleating the various great works<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In particular, Southey’s ‘History of Portugal’, which was never finished.</note> for which I have been so long making preparations</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I talked this matter over with <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref>, who entered entirely into my feelings. The next point having fully made up my mind concerning myself, was to secure the succession (as far as my influences extended) for some person with whom I could freely &#38; heartily cooperate. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> is just such a person: &#38; having ascertained that he would like the <del>xxxx</del> situation, I mentioned him to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> &#38; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> illness has occurred since, he is better at present, – &#38; I have good reason to believe it is all but settled that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> is to become the Editor of the Q.R. Without taking him from his profession, it will render him independent of it, &#38; place him at once in a high &#38; important station</p>

This possibly refers to Matthew Gregson (1749–1824; <title>DNB</title>), a wealthy Liverpool antiquarian and compiler of <title>Portfolio of Fragments Relative to the History and Antiquities of the County Palatine and Duchy of Lancaster</title> (1817). He was a regular contributor to the <title>Gentleman’s Magazine</title> and to charities in Liverpool, where Canning was one of the local MPs.</note> who is a friend of <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Cannings</ref> &#38; an able man: but they were not <hi rend="ital">thought</hi> of. Both <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> were compleatly at a loss where to look, for it is a situation of great confidence, &#38; requiring great discretion, as well as the necessary talents &#38; attainments. It would be very difficult to find a person so qualified as <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">J.C.</ref> &#38; I trust that I have done good service to the public as well as to the publisher &#38; to him, in putting the matter in its present train</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> This is a long explanation, &#38; yet I think you will like to know the <hi rend="ital">how</hi> &#38; the <hi rend="ital">why</hi> of my proceedings. In consequence I may possibly take more part in the review &#38; certainly more interest in it: because knowing the tenour of his <del>mind</del> &#60;opinions&#62;, &#38; his way of thinking, I am sure he will admit nothing that either in matter or manner could offend a well-regulated mind. He will hold a manly &#38; straight-forward course, &#38; censure will always come with weight &#38; effect, because it will never be unduly, or insolently applied.</p>

It is usually caused by a virus and affects many young children. It was known at this time as ‘false croup’, to distinguish it from laryngeal diphtheria, formerly known as ‘true croup’, a much more serious bacterial infection that also produced a barking cough.</note> – but it is always a frightful &#38; most alarming sound. – Young Henry is perfectly recovered from his horrible accident,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Edward Henry (1807–1833), the younger of Peachy’s two stepsons. The accident occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming him): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their departure, fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded, and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (<title>Glasgow Herald</title>, 12 August 1822). The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part of the annual Keswick Regatta.</note> &#38; no otherwise the worse for it, that than he has a hole nearly three inches long in his forehead. This is truly a marvellous recovery – I keep up the course of exercise which I began with you, walking about six miles every day when the weather is not absolutely too bad as it has been this day. While you were here I always walked in pain;<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey suffered from a rectal prolapse and haemorrhoids.</note> but it brought my system into tone; &#38; this change was just effected, when we parted. The good effect has continued ever since, &#38; I shall not relax throughout the winter in my efforts to maintain it. – Tell me now how you are going on &#38; my unseen friends of your household, whom I certainly intend to see in the spring. Remember me to them all at present, – take yourself the kindest remembrances from all here, &#38; believe me</p>
