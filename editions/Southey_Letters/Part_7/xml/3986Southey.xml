        <p rend="indent1">Suppose you were <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">a young Lady</ref> in the nineteenth year of your age, very busy in preparing certain remembrances to be transmitted by a safe opportunity to her distant friends, &#8211; &amp; that some of these remembrances could not be finished for want of ultra-marine;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A pigment for use in watercolour painting. Ultramarine is a deep blue colour.</note> &amp; that one of your fathers oldest &amp; dearest friends, holding a high situation in his Majestys Exchequer, had promised to send you a cake of this indispensable colour, under cover of an official frank, &#8211; should not you think that the whole business of the Exchequer &amp; all things connected therewith might be suspended, while the said ultra-<del>marine</del> &lt;marine&gt; was procured?</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Will you send me some Vegetable marrow seeds under the same cover, &#8211; &amp; I will promise you that their produce shall be excellently cooked, when you come &amp; help me to drink <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref> cyder which is now upon the road.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The Royal Irish Academy sent me, the other day, another tail to my name,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy (founded 1785), a body that existed to promote Irish scientific and cultural activities and studies.</note> for the benefit of my next title-page. &#8211; I am glad this was done after my Irish Ode was written, &amp; before it has appeared in the world.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Ireland&#8217;, <title>Sir Thomas More: or. Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>, 2 vols (London, 1829), I, pp. [295]&#8211;302. The poem, Southey&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s ode for 1822, was inspired by George IV&#8217;s State visit to Ireland, 12 August&#8211;3 September 1821. Southey used his new honour on the title page of his next publication, <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, p. [iii].</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">I have to day received the proofs of my paper upon the Theophilanthropists in France &amp; the Rise &amp; Progress of Infidelity,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Henri Gr&#233;goire (1750&#8211;1831), &#8216;Histoire de la Th&#233;ophilantropie, depuis sa Naissance jusqu&#8217;&#224; son Extinction&#8217;, part of Gr&#233;goire&#8217;s <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu&#8217;a l&#8217;Epoque Actuelle, sont N&#233;es, se sont Modifi&#233;es, se sont &#201;teintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title>, 2 vols (Paris, 1814), II, pp. 55&#8211;171, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 493&#8211;536, published 8 July 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; &amp; of course seen it for the first time as a whole. What opinion may be formed of it I cannot foresee; &#8211; but that with regard to individuals it will do some of the good which was intended, I do not doubt. And upon this first consecutive perusal, I am glad that I have written it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> has not written to me since his recovery. It is <hi rend="ital">possible</hi> that he may not be in good humour with me for endeavouring to procure a successor for him, tho it was in consequence of his expressing to me the necessity of looking out for one. I certainly wish the Journal were in <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridges</ref> hands, both for personal &amp; public considerations. The good which it might do is grievously counteracted by the gross inconsistencies which are now to be found in it, &#8211; its cruel &amp; unmanly injustices on some occasions, &#8211; &amp; its wretched cowardice on others. &#8211; I shall ask him if he will have an article upon Spain &amp; Portugal,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write an article on this subject for the <title>Quarterly Review</title> in 1823.</note> &#8211; a question upon which I am quite willing to take the field against all the Whigs in the world. Oh how I could trample upon them!</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I mean to ask <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> to print a selection of <del>xxx</del> my papers with restorations &amp; revisions, in some such arrangement &#8211; as Essays &#8211; moral &amp; political, which would fill two volumes,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">This project became Southey&#8217;s <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title> (1832).</note> &#8211; then as many more of Essays, historical &amp; ecclesiastical, &#8211; &amp; lastly critical &amp; miscellaneous,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">These two further collections were not published.</note> keeping each collection distinct, not to alarm the public with too much at once. In this manner he might put some money in my pocket &amp; in his own. I should include some papers from the Annual Review &amp; make up some from the Ed: An: Register<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had reviewed extensively for the <title>Annual Review for 1802</title>, 1 (1803) until the <title>Annual Review for 1808</title>, 7 (1809) and written the historical sections of the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810) until the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813). Essays I-III in <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), I, pp. [3]&#8211;72, and Essays XI&#8211;XII in <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), II, pp. [277]&#8211;328, were mainly drawn from the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>. None of Southey&#8217;s pieces in the <title>Annual Review</title> formed the basis of an essay, but parts of Southey&#8217;s review of Thomas Malthus (1766&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Essay on the Principle of Population</title> (1803), <title>Annual Review for 1803</title>, 2 (1804), 292&#8211;301, were grafted onto Essay IV of <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), I, pp. [73]&#8211;155, which was mainly from Southey&#8217;s review of Patrick Colquhoun (1745&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Propositions for Ameliorating the Condition of the Poor: and for Improving the Moral Habits, and Increasing the Comforts of the Labouring People</title> (1812), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319&#8211;356.</note>
