           <p rend="indent1"> When I have told you that we are all well (thank God) – that Rumpelstilschen<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">One of the feline inhabitants of Greta Hall.</note> is grown very corpulent, – &#38; that we see nobody, &#38; hear nothing <del>xxx</del> except the wind, &#38; now &#38; then Jeffrey at nights,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey, <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, p. 442.

She used a horn to try and drive the rats out of the house.</note> – what more shall I say?</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Why, I have recollected this: that “the royal patent self-illuminating pocket lamp”<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">A small tin box, out of which a wick, soaked in oil, protruded. When the string hanging from the other end of the box was pulled, a match struck against the wick, thus (hopefully) igniting it. The wick was said to burn for 18 hours. The invention was widely advertised, for example, in <title>The Atheneum; or, Spirit of the English Magazines</title>, 1 (July 1824), 282.</note> is sold where the Seidlitz powders<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Seidlitz powers were a mixture of tartaric acid, potassium sodium tartrate and sodium bicarbonate, used as a laxative.</note> are, 136 Bond Street,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Savory and Co., 136 New Bond Street – a chemist’s shop.</note> – &#38; also, which is nearer you, in Oxford Street at Sangers 150, &#38; Barkers 125.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Sangers, 150 Oxford Street and Mathew Barker, 125 Oxford Street were also chemists.</note> You had better send one in the box, the price is not mentioned in the advertisement.
