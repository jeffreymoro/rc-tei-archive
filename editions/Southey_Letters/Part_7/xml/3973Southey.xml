His own letter had it been unbacked, I suspect would have brought him nothing but a dry denial. &lt;- official situations there being none to bestow&gt; But to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref> application &#8220;every facility&#8221; was promised, &amp; Wilmot<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1821&#8211;1828.</note> personally said he should be glad to render him any service when he came to town. Whether he will think it needful to go to town I know not, &#8211; convenient I am sure it will not be. But as the next business is to ascertain what will be granted him, &amp; what steps are to be taken, I have asked <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> whether the better way would not be for you to consult with Wilmot; &#8211; if he thinks so, he will let you know. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Sarah</ref>, it seems, approves the intention, &#8211; &amp; has friends at Quebec and at Montreal,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Especially Matthew Bell (1769&#8211;1849), a wealthy merchant, iron manufacturer and land speculator in Quebec, originally from Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Murray had offered Southey one thousand guineas for this work; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 18 July 1813, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 2283. However, when the <title>History</title> grew from the two volumes proposed in 1813 to three, Murray raised this to &#163;1,500.</note> in two bills of long date, &#8211; adding, as he ought, a third to the sum for which we agreed, &#8211; because the bargain was for two volumes. I remit the bills by this post to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">J May</ref>,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 3 March [1823], Letter 3971.</note> &#8211; about 150&#163; I shall have occasion for in the course of the month.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Westall (1765&#8211;1836; <title>DNB</title>) produced a set of six illustrations, <title>Illustrations of Roderick, the Last of the Goths.

Longman published them and purchasers could arrange for the engravings to be bound into their copy of <title>Roderick</title> (1814).
