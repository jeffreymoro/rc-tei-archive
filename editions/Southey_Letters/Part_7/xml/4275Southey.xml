        <p rend="indent1">I see by the papers that <ref type="m" target="people.html#TelfordThomas">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Telford</ref> recommends paving roads where there is much heavy carriage.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Telford, <title>First Report of the Commissioners Appointed under the Act of 4 Geo. IV c. 74 for Vesting in them certain Bridges now Building; &amp;c. and for the Further Improvement of the Road from London to Holyhead</title> (London, 1824), p. 7.</note> In some of the Italian cities the streets are paved in stripes, the wheels run upon two lines of smooth pavement, as over a bowling green, with little sound &amp; no jolting, &amp; the space between where the horses go is common pitching. This is the case at Milan &amp; at Como, &#8211; &amp; probably in most other places.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The convenience of this arrangement had struck Southey as soon as he entered Milan on 14 June 1817, on his continental tour of that year.</note> &#8211; Macadamizing the streets of London is likely I think to prove Quackadamizing.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Loudon McAdam (1756&#8211;1836; <title>DNB</title>) had invented the process of &#8216;macadamising&#8217; roads by constructing them from a layer of small stones on a base of larger stones, with a camber to ensure rainwater ran off the surface. McAdam&#8217;s ideas were supported by a Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Highways of the Kingdom (1823).</note> But the failure will lead to something better.</p>

            <title>New Times</title>, 25&#8211;27 October 1824, where Stoddart used the newspaper he edited to comment extensively on Byron and Medwin&#8217;s <title>Conversations</title>. In the final article of 27 October 1824, Stoddart paid particular attention to attacking Byron&#8217;s <title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), which had parodied Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), and defending Southey against Byron&#8217;s &#8216;vindictive hatred&#8217;. The <title>Morning Herald</title> had published extracts of Medwin&#8217;s book, for example on 25 October 1824.</note> I see too that <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has been obliged to come forward &amp; prove <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">his Lordship</ref> a lyer.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Medwin&#8217;s <title>Conservations</title> recorded a good many criticisms of Murray by Byron. Most importantly, Medwin suggested that Murray had broken a contract between the publisher and Byron. Murray responded with a pamphlet, &#8216;Notes on Captain Medwin&#8217;s Conversations of Lord Byron&#8217; (1824), which was widely distributed to, and reproduced by, the press, for example, in the <title>Morning Post</title> and <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 6 November 1824.</note> I am vindictive enough to wish he had known how compleatly he failed of annoying me by any of his attacks. &#8211; This Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Medwin should be called <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord B&#8217;s</ref> Blunderbuss. There is something viler in regrating slander as he has done, than in originally uttering it. In <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">his Lordship</ref> there were the motives of envy, hatred &amp; malice at work. Evil passions possessed him.
