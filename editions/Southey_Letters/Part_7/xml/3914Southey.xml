          <salute>My dear R</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1">My mornings for the last three weeks have been pretty closely employed upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Frere&#8217;s</ref> papers which will occupy a fortnight yet before I shall have got thro them.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was studying these papers for his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> They gave me all the information of which I was in want for that stage of the war in which my materials were most defective.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> life is so precarious at this time, &amp; the probability of his being unable to conduct the QR. even if he recovers, so great, that the question of <hi rend="ital">succession</hi> becomes <del>one</del> of some interest to me. I wish <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> to be the Editor, being a man who unites in himself all the requisites, &amp; with whom I could act cordially. Unless I am very much mistaken, the character of the Journal would be raised, &amp; its influence greatly increased, by the firm &amp; consistent language which it would hold under his management, &amp; the utter exclusion of such splenetic effusions as often disgrace it now.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">&#8220;The Liberal,&#8221; is quite what it ought to be.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron&#8217;s <title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), a parody of Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), was published by John Hunt (1775&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>), brother of Leigh Hunt, in <title>The Liberal</title>, 1 (October 1822), 3&#8211;39. There were only four issues of <title>The Liberal</title>.</note> If I hated <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> as deeply as he does me, I could not wish it to be worse. It cannot, I think, reach a <hi rend="ital">third</hi> number, even if it proceeds to a second, &amp; escapes prosecution. They must be thorough-paced Whigs indeed for whom it is not too bad, &#8211; &amp; moreover <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">his Lordship</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HuntLeigh">Leigh Hunt</ref> will quarrel ere long &amp; break up the infernal firm.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">We are going on well thank God. Since <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</ref> left me I have settled regularly to my winter occupations, &amp; as regularly taken the daily exercise which he prescribed. A summers mountaineering has been of the greatest benefit to me, &amp; I hope to keep in the same good condition, till you see me early in the spring.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Remember us most kindly to <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">Mrs R.</ref>
