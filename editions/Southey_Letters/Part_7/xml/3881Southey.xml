            <salute>My dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">You would have suffered no disappointment on the present occasion, if your friends had known – I will not say as much of what is called the World as I do (for they may easily know more) but as much of natural causes &#38; probable effects.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton, <title>Napoleon, and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), p. [v], was dedicated to George IV. Barton may have been offended not to receive any acknowledgement of his dedication.</note> My advice to you had I been on the spot to have given it, would have been, after writing as you have written, to dedicate as you intended &#38; have done – to <del>sen</del> present the book tho the regular channel of the Librarian,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Sumner (1790–1874; <title>DNB</title>) was domestic chaplain and librarian to George IV 1821–1826, Bishop of Llandaff 1826–1827, Bishop of Winchester 1827–1869. Barton wished to place a copy of his book in the Royal Library at Windsor.</note> &#38; then to leave it to its fate, hoping nothing &#38; expecting nothing. Nothing was to be gained by showing any solicitude concerning the event, – but something might be lost.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  I am not acquainted with the Librarian, &#38; could be of no use to you in that quarter. – Your views should be directed to this Literary Academy,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royal Society of Literature, founded in 1820.</note> – of which I know nothing more than what the newspapers tell me, – but which proposes (if I understand its meaning) to grant honorary annuities, as well as to offer premiums.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The first opportunity which I shall have of noticing your writings, will be in an account of <del>the Xxxx</del> Gregoires Histoire des Sectes Religieuses, which will be my next article in the QR.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), 1–46, published 15 February 1823. (The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.) On pp. 4–5 of his review, Southey included a lengthy recommendation of Barton’s poetry for its ‘pure and religious spirit’ and quoted Barton’s poem ‘The Pool of Bethesda’, from <title>Napoleon, and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), pp. [182]–185 in its entirety.</note> – Be assured that I shall not omit any opportunity which I can find</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> When you sent a copy to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, for himself, – you did not call to mind the old proverb about sending coals to Newcastle. In all likelihood he looked <del>at</del> upon it as intended for the QR.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. that Murray supposed Barton wished his poem to be reviewed in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> &#38; did not suppose that it required an acknowledgement.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have been very unwell, but am now thank God recovered. At this season I am more occupied by friends, &#38; chance visitors, than even by my own arduous pursuits during the rest of the year. And the busiest man in England cannot have less time to himself.</p>
