<opener><salute>My dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Your letter enters upon many interesting topics. – At Ottery, no doubt all will be as it should be.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s sister-in-law Sara Coleridge was on an extended visit to friends and relations with her daughter, Sara. They reached Ottery St Mary in Devon, the home of many of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s family, in May 1823.</note> I can very well understand <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeGeorge">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> G. Coleridges</ref> feelings, &#38; <del>xxxx</del> doubt not that when he has once seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">his niece</ref> he will be pleased to find there is one branch from that stock which he may regard without any disapprobation. – The most remarkable thing about her is that she has not been spoilt by <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">her mother</ref> &#38; her brothers, who<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent Coleridge</ref>.</note> have done all that could possibly be done for spoiling her.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">With regard to a reunion I do not think it would be desirable on any other account than that of affording a sort of home &#38; rallying place for <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</ref>, while they stand in need of one. In the separation <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> was wholly passive; she had in no manner or degree provoked or deserved it. All that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">her husband</ref> could allege against her would be that she did not conceal her unhappiness at seeing him habitually neglect the fulfillment of every engagement which he undertook, &#38; of every duty which he was bound to perform. She importuned him to make those exertions which were absolutely &#60;necessary&#62; for their subsistence (unless they were to live by borrowed means) – &#38; this he could not bear. If she had broken her heart in silence he might perhaps have been satisfied with her.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I believe that there is no wish for a reunion on either side. He considers nothing but his own ease; &#38; well knowing how little he can rely upon himself, will prefer the mode of life which he has followed so many years, – that is of living with any person who will house him, &#38; collecting auditors about him. On her part, it would be an entire sacrifice of what comforts are left her; – his habits (which would be uncontrolled of course, if he had an establishment of his own) are destructive of all comfort &#38; domestic order. She has anxieties enough now for her sons, – but then she would have a perpetual anxiety concerning her own means of subsistence. And <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Saras</ref> happiness would be compleatly destroyed; – she would then know what <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">her father</ref> is, which she is very far from understanding at present.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">With regard to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartleys</ref> money,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Hartley Coleridge’s Fellowship at Oriel College, Oxford had been terminated in 1820, at the end of his probationary year. The College offered Hartley a gift of £300 in compensation, which had initially been refused. However, John Taylor Coleridge had maintained contact with Oriel and, without informing Hartley, collected the money on his cousin’s behalf. Faced with this situation, Hartley agreed to accept the money. He paid off some debts and gave the remainder to his mother.</note> that matter must be left wholly to <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">his Mother</ref>, who I dare say will consider that he is likely to want it himself. As far I hear he goes on contentedly &#38; regularly at Ambleside.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Hartley Coleridge had taken up a position as an assistant master at his old school in Ambleside.</note> He spent a week here in December, &#38; appeared to be as happy as if his prospects had been the best in the world – &#38; his conduct irreproachable. There is no relying on him, &#38; yet I believe his feelings are good.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">If <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeaumontLadyMargaret">Lady Beaumont</ref> has formed any indiscreet scheme of showing off <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref>,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Sara Coleridge and her daughter, Sara, had visited Sir George and Lady Beaumont at Coleorton Hall, Leicestershire in 1822 on their way to London.</note> I am afraid <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> would enter into it too readily, &#38; set down any caution which might come from me, to a wrong <del>xxxx</del> motive. Most probably her warm manner of speaking has been interpreted more literally than it was meant. But I believe the Wordsworths<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">William</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthMary">Mary Wordsworth</ref>. They visited Coleorton in March 1823 on their way to Oxford.</note> are going to Coleorton, &#38; they will prevent this kind of mischief</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has not written a line to me since the publication of my book,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> – nor <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> since his illness. I despair of any amendment in the Review while it is in <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> hands; but it must drop from them ere long.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Gifford was considering resigning as editor of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>. When he did so, he was briefly succeeded by John Taylor Coleridge.</note> A concern of that kind will not bear continued procrastination – &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> will feel this in that part which is the Booksellers sensorium, – his pocket.

	   I am glad you find benefit from the leathern jerkin, which is certainly an excellent defence. We have been blocked up here by the snow, &#38; it is now only slowly retreating. Your letter was detained three days on the road, – that <del>xx</del> is, it was five days in reaching me. We are thank God, well at present, but not without anxiety, for the croup is more prevalent here, &#38; more fatal, than it is ever remembered to have been in these parts. Of course we are exceedingly careful, but my best hope of escaping it is that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> had an attack of the spurious kind about Xmas, &#38; therefore I would fain persuade myself is more liable to it in <hi rend="ital">that</hi>, than in its Malignant &#38; less frequent form.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Croup is a respiratory infection, whose main symptom is a barking cough. It is usually caused by a virus and affects many young children.
