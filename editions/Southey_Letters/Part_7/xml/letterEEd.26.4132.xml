        <p rend="indent1">I am coming home very soon. There are three things which keep their appointed course, Time, Tide, &amp; your father. My place is taken in the mail coach for Friday next. At a quarter after seven that evening I am to be at the Inn called the <ref type="m" target="places.html#BullandMouth">Bull &amp; Mouth</ref>. That is a very foolish name. The sign of that Inn almost three hundred years ago was a picture of the mouth, that is the entrance of Boulogne harbour: this was called Boulogne Mouth; &amp; foolish people when the sign was worn out, not knowing what it had been painted a great Bull, &amp; a great Mouth. What silly people!</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  There is a plan of London in your great book, &amp; you may find out in it where this Inn is: it is behind Newgate Street about two miles from your <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Uncles</ref> House</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  You may look in the maps too, &amp; see which way I am coming, thro S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Albans S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Neots. Stilton. Grantham, Newark, Worksop, Doncaster; Wetherby, Bowes Brough &amp; Appleby to Penrith. And on Sunday morning, if it please God, I shall reach home; &amp; very happy I shall be if I find you all well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you are a good boy &amp; go on well with your lessons, as I dare say you will, I shall soon begin to teach you Greek; that you may be a good scholar, &amp; so become a wise man. The wiser people are the better they ought to be; &amp; the better they are, the happier they must be.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall bring you each a book. On Wednesday I shall begin to pack up, about the time you receive this letter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Give <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">your dear Mamma</ref> a kiss to keep for me. And tell Betty<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Thompson (c. 1777&#8211;1862), the Southey family&#8217;s longstanding servant. She was buried in the Southey family grave.</note> I shall be glad to see her again. My love to your Aunts<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Sara Coleridge</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerMary">Mary Lovell</ref>.</note> &amp; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref>. I hope the Cats are well. The finest cats which I saw in my travels were at <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clarksons</ref>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Clarkson&#8217;s house at Playford Hall, Suffolk.</note> Their names are M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Burrell, Blucher, &amp; Fanny, all beautiful dark tabbies, of the very best kind. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Burrell is the mother of the other two, &amp; Blucher is such a good cat that he slew a weasel lately in single combat.</p>
