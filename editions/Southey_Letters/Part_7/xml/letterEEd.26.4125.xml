               Dating note: Dating from content. <title>The Book of the Church</title> was published on 2 February 1824. Southey left London for Norwich on 23 January. This letter was probably written very shortly before his departure. He returned to London on 5 February; see Robert Southey to Nicholas Lightfoot, 18 February 1824 (Letter 4136).</p>
