            <p rend="indent1"> A letter from you comes always like a cordial; for I live in a land where I never see the face of a friend unless he comes from afar: &#38; a heavy proportion of the letters which reach me are from persons whom I have never seen, on business or no business, &#38; from <del>per</del> others for whom I care nothing, but who pester me with correspondence. – The half bills are quite sufficient. As soon as I knew the trick which had been played me<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of John Johnson (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263–311. Southey had expected it to appear in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (January 1824), published 28 August 1824.</note> I drew upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn"><hi rend="ital">Megistonos</hi></ref> for 50 £, – on account of the Church,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> – upon which Church I have been living since I left town, so that with this &#38; with your supply I have just the sum on which I had calculated at this time. – </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> My opinion of trade &#38; tradesmen is not more favourable than yours. What the motive may be for <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Megistonos’s</ref> uncivil mood, I neither know nor care. How it can be his interest to treat me with intentional incivility is not apparent; – but he may perhaps think it <del>no</del> &#60;his interest&#62;, – &#38; so <del>thxx</del> let him for I shall neither ask nor enter into explanations. The course which I am now taking will enable me (unless I am sorely disappointed) to throw the QR overboard. Less time than an article for that Journal would take will finish the Paraguay Poem,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> which will do much toward squaring my accounts in <ref type="m" target="places.html#PaternosterRow">the Row</ref>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. Southey’s accounts with his publisher Longman.</note> And an equal portion of time will compleat two vol. of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D.D.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">This became <title>The Doctor</title> (1834–1847).</note> – And till <del>xx</del> both are compleated not a line will I pen for the QR – even if I ever pen another. Moreover I am bound now almost by honour, as well as by inclination &#38; interest to speed forward with Oliver Newman,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s unfinished epic, ‘Oliver Newman’, set in New England. A fragment was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale (Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1–90.</note> <ref type="m" target="people.html#TicknorGeorge">one of my Boston friends</ref> having taking great pains to collect for me all the books which could be useful in supplying materials for it, – some of these books being exceedingly rare in America – where they were printed. About a third part of this poem is written, &#38; the plan of the remainder is now so mature that I can almost rely upon myself to finish it before next May.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> It is not unlikely that your arm suffered from <hi rend="ital">insolation</hi>, – no matter – while the head escaped. I am getting into good condition apace, have left off tonics, eat valiantly, walk every day &#38; rub myself down when I return – </p>

               <p rend="indent1"> You tell me that <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> had left Dover for some illegible place which I should decypher Stutgard<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn had indeed gone to Stuttgart, the capital of the Kingdom of Wurttemburg, where his brother, Henry Wynn (1783–1856; <title>DNB</title>) had been appointed Envoy Extraordinary 1823–1824.</note> if M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Company Lord &#38; Husband<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">As President of the Board of Control, Wynn had ultimate authority over the East India Company, known as ‘John Company’.</note> could have any business there. Wherever he may be I hope you have received a letter which I sent under cover to him yesterday – inclosing one to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">my unfortunate brother Edward</ref>, – in which I have requested you to insert a 10 £ bill.</p></postscript>
