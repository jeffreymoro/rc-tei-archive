        <p rend="indent1"> I have discovered to my vexation, that in returning Strypes Life of Cranmer<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Strype (1643&#8211;1737; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memorials of the Most Reverend Father in God Thomas Cranmer, Sometime Lord Archbishop of Canterbury: Wherein the History of the Church, and the Reformation of it during the Primacy of the said Archbishop are Greatly Illustrated; and Many Singular Matters Relating Thereunto, now first Published</title> (1694). The book was reprinted by Oxford University Press in 1812 and was no. 2754 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. It focused on Thomas Cranmer (1489&#8211;1556; <title>DNB</title>), Archbishop of Canterbury 1533&#8211;1555.</note> to you some time ago I was mistaken in supposing the extracts which I had made would be sufficient for my purpose; &#8211; for upon looking to them I find references to several parts of importance which were too long for transcription. May I request you therefore to send me the book again, &#8211; that what will be perhaps the most impressive chapter in the Book of the Church may not be weakened by this oversight.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">One of chapters 12&#8211;14 of Southey&#8217;s <title>Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 1&#8211;242.</note> &#8211; I feel in some degree ashamed at troubling you thus in consequence of a mistake; but if you saw my notes I am sure you would at once forgive me, &amp; wonder at the cost of labour expended upon them, &#8211; not at the economy of time which these references were designed to effect.</p>
