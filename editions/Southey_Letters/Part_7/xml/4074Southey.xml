   <salute >Dear Sir</salute></opener>
   <p rend="indent1">The three sheets H. J. K. require a great deal of pruning.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">This refers to: Dialogue VI of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 93–113, between Pericles (c. 495–429 BC), Athenian statesman and Sophocles (c. 497/6 BC–c. 406/5 BC), Athenian playwright; Dialogue VII of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 115–129, between Louis XIV (1638–1715; King of France 1643–1715) and Francoise de la Chaise (1624–1709), the king’s confessor; and Dialogue VIII of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 131–151, between ‘Cavaliere Puntomichino’ and ‘Denis Eusebius Talcranagh’.</note> It is a safe principle to say that every thing should be cut out in which the author, writing under the influence of personal feelings has expressed himself in a manner which may very possibly be injurious to others &#38; hurtful in its consequences to himself. Upon this principle I would strike out <del>the passage</del> part of the speech of Sophocles pp. 109–10. from “Chlorus grew rich – to – the less for Sophocles.”<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">This passage was removed. ‘Chlorus’ was a thinly disguised portrait of Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1769–1822; <title>DNB</title>), Foreign Secretary 1812–1822. Landor criticised him here for his rejection of Landor’s appeal to him to reprimand Edward Dawkins (1792–1865), a British diplomat, whom Landor believed had insulted his wife, Julia Landor, née Thuillier (1794–1879).</note> Personal as what precedes it is, it may I think stand, because its application will not be understood even by the parties themselves.</p>
   <p rend="indent1">I would strike <del>also</del> out also the first paragraph in the speech of Pericles p111.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This passage was removed; it remarked on the insanity of all royal families.</note> The second sentence of that paragraph is true, but the first is not, &#38; would be deservedly deemed mischievous.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">I hardly know what to say respecting the seventh Conversation,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue VII of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 115–129, between Louis XIV (1638–1715; King of France 1643–1715) and Francoise de la Chaise (1624–1709), the king’s confessor.</note> which is altogether such as Voltaire<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Francois-Marie Arouet (1694–1778), the French philosopher and writer and religious sceptic.</note> would have written, – &#38; yet the difference between Voltaire &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> is as great in every thing as between French &#38; Englishman. Had the characters of the Dialogue been imaginary, the satire would not be exaggerated; I know enough of Catholic casuistry to say this: but &#60;it&#62; is so as applied to Louis 14. &#38; appears even more so than it is. <del>Xxx</del> I should rather not lose the whole, &#38; yet know not how to preserve it. Might it pass with the following corrections?</p>
<lb/>
         <p rend="indent1">P 121 <hi rend="ital">dele</hi> – on much slighter we read in the Old Testament.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">This passage was retained in <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, p. 119.</note></p>
         <p rend="indent1">122 line 7 – for God Almighty, read <hi rend="ital">their Deity</hi>, – or omit the sentence.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">This passage was retained in <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, p. 120.</note></p>
         <p rend="indent1">125. for a clyster, read <hi rend="ital">an enema</hi> – &#38; omit the note, for the Latin hymn contains nothing in its meaning to justify the ridicule.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">These changes were made in <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, p. 123.</note></p>
<lb/>
         <p rend="indent0">If you think these alterations insufficient – as I fear they are, to remove <del>xx</del> serious objections against the whole Conversation, – let the whole be omitted: as the safest, &#38; I believe the best course. What is really just in it, the author may introduce in an unobjectionable form.</p>
<lb/>
         <p rend="indent1">p. 140 insert asterisks or lines – in place of the words Edinburgh, Valpy, &#38; Classical.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue VIII of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 131–151, was between ‘Cavaliere Puntomichino’ and ‘Denis Eusebius Talcranagh’. The passage indicated here on p. 138 was replaced in the published version.</note></p>
         <p rend="indent1">142. We must begin to expunge from One of these worthies – where to end I know not, whether at <del>x xx</del> “the same patriot? p. 144, or if what may follow in the ensuing sheet will require farther pruning.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">This passage was omitted on p. 140. It again referred to Edward Dawkins (1792–1865), a British diplomat in Italy, whom Landor believed had insulted his wife, Julia Landor, née Thuillier (1794–1879).</note></p>
