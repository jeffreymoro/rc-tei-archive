        <p rend="indent1">Your letter arrived this day, &amp; yesterday I received &amp; answered one from <ref type="m" target="people.html#HareJulius ">Julius Hare</ref> concerning your Dialogues.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Savage Landor, <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title> (1824).</note> The purport of his was to say that <ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorJohn">Taylor</ref> (a man I believe very superior to most of his trade) demurred upon grounds of principle to certain passages, &amp; had, after some previous correspondence with him proposed that either I or <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> should see the proofs, &amp; if we approved of what he condemnd he would be bound by our decision. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> is gone to the Netherlands, &amp; I replied without hesitation that I would most willingly take upon myself this responsibility, &amp; <del>expunge whatever</del> act for you in this matter as you would act by me, &#8211; taking care that wherever there was an omission the place should be marked.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> was desired in December to send you my own<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821); <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832); <title>The Expedition of Orsua; and the Crimes of Aguirre</title> (1821), originally intended to be part of the <title>History of Brazil</title> and first printed in <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title>, 3.2 (1812), i&#8211;l; and a combined second edition of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814) and <title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, and His Majesty the King of Prussia</title> (1814), published as <title>Carmen Triumphale, for the Commencement of the Year 1814: Carmen Aulica, Written in 1814, on the Arrival of the Allied Sovereigns in England</title> (1821).</note> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</ref> books,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Wordsworth, <title>Ecclesiastical Sketches</title> (1822) and <title>Memorials of a Tour on the Continent, 1820</title> (1822).</note> &amp; Humboldts Travels,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#8211;1859), <title>Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent During the Years 1799&#8211;1804</title> (1814&#8211;1826), no. 1463 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library; and <title>Researches Concerning the Institutions and Monuments of the Ancient Inhabitants of America, with Descriptions and Views of Some of the Most Striking Scenes in the Cordilleras</title> (1814).</note> &#8211; he has never told me by what vessel they are sent, which he ought to have done, &#8211; but they should have reached you long ere this.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I long to see these Dialogues. Upon the question of Catholicism we shall entirely agree. There is a chapter upon the subject in my forth coming view of our Ecclesiastical History,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 10 of <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. 292&#8211;330.</note> &#8211; &amp; whatever effect we may produce upon those who are more than moderately inclined to this base &amp; grovelling superstition (as you say <ref type="m" target="people.html#HareJulius ">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hare</ref> is) I think we shall produce some upon those who at present are less than moderately acquainted with its real character. Yet I regret some of its parts.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Your specimen is delightful. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HareJulius ">Julius Hare</ref> indeed speaks of the whole just in such terms as I should expect it to deserve. Upon one great question, that of the improvement of nations thro their governments, I <del>believe</del> think that were I in Italy I should approach nearer to you, &amp; were you in England, or in America you would draw nearer to me. The struggle at present <del>if</del> is between two extremes, both so bad, that if a wish of mine could incline the beam, I should not know in which scale to <del>x</del> cast it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My first volume is wormwood to the Foxites, &amp; not more palatable to the worshippers of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pitt.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832). It contained much criticism of the Whigs, whose leader had been Charles James Fox (1749&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>), for opposing British intervention to help repel the Spanish invaders; but it also did not support every decision made by the government, whose supporters had been led by William Pitt (1759&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1783&#8211;1801, 1804&#8211;1806.</note> I think there is not one feeling expressed in it with which you will not concur. The <del>op</del> single opinion in which you are likely to dissent from me is one which is derived from observation, &#8211; in opposition to my wishes, &#8211; that old despotisms can better be modified by a single will than by a popular assembly; &amp; that in such countries as Spain &amp; Portugal, a despotic minister (like Pombal)<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Sebasti&#227;o Jos&#233; de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal (1699&#8211;1782), Prime Minister of Portugal 1750&#8211;1777.</note> acting in conformity to the spirit of the age, is the reformer to be wished for. I would have governments reformed, as Cranmer<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Cranmer (1489&#8211;1556; <title>DNB</title>), Archbishop of Canterbury 1533&#8211;1555 and architect of the English Reformation.</note> would in all points, &amp; did in most, reform the Church of England. But let individuals &amp; communities err as they may, it is apparent that upon the great scale mankind are improving. But this too may appear differently in Italy from what it does in England.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I am glad to hear of your <del>England</del> children.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Arnold Savage Landor (1818&#8211;1871); Julia Elisabeth Savage Landor (1820&#8211;1884); and Walter Savage Landor (1822&#8211;1899). They were followed by Charles Savage Landor (1825&#8211;1917).</note> Till we become parents we know not the treasures of our own nature, &#8211; &amp; what we then discover may make us believe that there yet latent affections &amp; faculties which another state of existence may develope. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">My boy</ref> is now beginning his fifth year, &amp; is thank God, flourishing &amp; promising as I could wish. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">My eldest daughter</ref> is a young woman, taller than <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">her mother</ref>. Time has set his mark upon me, but lays his hand gently, &#8211; as yet he has taken nothing from me but the inclination for writing poetry, &amp; threatens nothing at present but my grinders, which he is attacking by regular [MS torn]proaches, sapping &amp; mining. Last summer I was severely shaken by an annual catarrh which for many years has taken up its quarters with me for the whole summer, &amp; last year effected a lodgement in my chest. Since it departed I have used more exercise &amp; a more generous diet, &amp; have kept in better condition during the winter than for the last seven years.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My Colloquies<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> have long been stationary. Yours will give them a fillip, &#8211; as far as they have proceeded I am well pleased with them. My Book of the Church will be published in about ten weeks, &#8211; perhaps in time to be forwarded to you with your own book.</p>
