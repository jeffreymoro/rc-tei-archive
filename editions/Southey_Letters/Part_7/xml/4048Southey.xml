The conclusion seems to sit very easy upon both of them: but what they think, – or dream of doing, or what they can do, is more than I can tell. The journey certainly has not discovered to him any one impediment, or difficulty of which he was not perfectly aware before he set out. – This would fret me, if I allowed myself to think about it.</p>
