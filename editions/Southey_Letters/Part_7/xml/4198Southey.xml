            <p rend="indent1">I am under the visitation of my annual cold, which condemns me for a great part of every day to idleness. In the morning I do not rise before breakfast, because this visitor rises with me, &#38; very soon afterwards I am fain to lie back on the sopha, &#38; close my eyes, which have no complaint of their own, but are incapable of bearing the light while the membrane which lines the nose &#38; the throat are in a state of such extreme excitability. First I tried repose, – &#38; that almost long enough to disable me from exertion, by putting me what is called out of condition; – then I tried exercise, – &#38; am now again resigned to inaction &#38; a darkened room, with an upper lip which no razor dare approach, &#38; a proboscis half excoriated by the frequent visits of the pockethandkerchief. In 1799 when I had the first of these inveterate cararrhs (which I never failed to have every year since, except when I was in Portugal) – I write an Ode, upon it being at that time Poet Laureate to the Morning Post<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey quotes here the third stanza of his unpublished ‘Ode’; see Southey to Daniel Stuart, 19 December 1799, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Two</title>, Letter 464. Southey wrote this when he was employed to provide poetry for the <title>Morning Post</title>, but it was not published in the newspaper.</note> – &#38; it is worthy of being transferred from the rough copy in my desk to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</ref> magnifico Album. Behold a specimen of it – </p>

               <l rend="indent4">The pocket handkerchief for me; – </l>
               <l rend="indent3">Give ample room &#38; verse enough</l>
               <l rend="indent4">To hold the flowing sea.</l>
               <l rend="indent3">Heard ye the din of trumpets bray – </l>
               <l rend="indent4">Nose to napkin, – nostril-force – </l>
               <l rend="indent3">Hot currents urge their way</l>
               <l rend="indent3">And thro the double fountain take their course.</l>

           <p rend="indent0"> Just half my life has elapsed since that Ode was written, &#38; among those parts of my character which remain unaffected by time, the love of nonsense – as you may perceive is one.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  Since you heard from me I have scarcely been able to write any thing except a review of Hayleys Memoirs<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of John Johnson (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263–311, published 11 March 1825.</note> which I went thro doggedly making what I could of materials not very good in themselves, &#38; miserably put together by their author. Having however some gratitude for Hayley for introducing me by his notes to the Spanish poets,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Hayley, <title>An Essay on Epic Poetry; in Five Epistles to the Revd Mr. Mason. With Notes</title> (London, 1782), pp. 202–273, included accounts of the life and work of Lope Félix de Vega y Carpio (1562–1635) and Alonso de Ercilla y Zuñiga (1533–1594), with quotations and translations.</note> – a good deal of respect for his love of literature &#38; the arts &#38; the country, – for his total exemption from all envious feelings, his attachment to his friends, – &#38; above all for his devotion to that poor son,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Alphonso Hayley (1780–1800; <title>DNB</title>), a sculptor.</note> – I have spoken of him in a style very different from the prevailing tone of magazines &#38; reviews.</p>
