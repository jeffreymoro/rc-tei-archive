He died on 24 February 1822. Boswell completed Edmond Malone (1741–1812; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare, with the Corrections and Illustrations of Various Commentators: Comprehending a Life of the Poet, and an Enlarged History of the Stage</title> (1821), no. 2539 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> is now to be had cheaper than it will ever be again, except when a chance copy occurs at a sale, – for about seven guineas I think. I suspect it will be &#60;the&#62; last of those editions in which the Editor heaps Pelion upon Ossa. Buy it therefore for me (for I have no better Shakespere than Stockdales,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Stockdale (1750–1814; <title>DNB</title>), published <title>Stockdale’s Edition of Shakespeare: Including, in One Volume, the Whole of the Dramatic Works, with Explanatory Notes Compiled from Various Commentators</title> (1784).</note> &#38; it is not decorous that I should be thus ill provided) – if it be <del>sold</del> charged 8 guineas that will be two thirds the original cost, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> will refund you. You will see it marked in some of those shop windows which lay their baits for ready money. Let them send it to me <hi rend="ital">by waggon</hi>, &#38; say that as you cannot collate the copy, they will of course supply any defects if any should be found when it arrives here; – - the first thing I do with a new book is to see that it be perfect.</p>

He urges me very strongly to remove to the neighbourhood of London, &#38; by way of removing all difficulties in the way, offers at any time to lend me money for purchasing a house &#38; removing to it. But I am much more inclined to remain where I am, unless the ground should be sold piecemeal, which there is some danger of, in consequence of Clarkes death,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Clark (d. 1822) had rented some land that was next to, and part of the same estate as, Greta Hall. He was a nurseryman, but had been declared bankrupt on 11 March 1817.</note> the nursery ground being to be given up.</p>

The ‘Preface’ was dated ‘Keswick, July 22, 1822’.</note> the table of contents has been drawn out as the proof sheets arrived; &#38; in a very few weeks I shall have the satisfaction of being abused by all the Whig Journals to my hearts content. The volume has cost me much labour, &#38; I think you will not be disappointed either in the matter or manner. The second will not require half the time. I may very well get thro it in eight or nine months, without any unusual exertion.</p>
