        <p rend="indent1">Your letter <hi rend="ital">vi&#226; Tookii</hi> made its appearance in a parcel from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref>, with a note saying that Tooke was called in a different direction &#8211; <del>xx</del> a republication by him of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Watts&#8217;s Essays very prettily bound<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Tooke (1777&#8211;1863; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Reliquae Juveniles: Miscellaneous Thoughts in Prose and Verse, on Natural, Moral, and Divine Subjects; Written Chiefly in Younger Years By I. Watts, D. D. New Edition, Carefully Revised and Corrected</title> (1823). Tooke was a well-connected London lawyer who was also active in literary circles; Isaac Watts (1674&#8211;1748; <title>DNB</title>) was a Congregationalist Minister, theologian and hymn writer.</note> &#8211; &amp; some papers about Nova Scotia, &#8211; for all which I have to thank him when opportunity offers: for whether I wrote to do so at the time I really am quite uncertain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I am sorry to hear of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">Louisa&#8217;s</ref> accident, tho it is one of those I trust which leave no ill consequences behind it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Our plans are to start on Monday Nov 3. &amp; to look at so many things on the way (Beelzebubs posteriors<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Peak Cavern in Derbyshire, popularly known as the Devil&#8217;s Arse.</note> among the rest) that if the weather be favourable we shall be a week before we reach Derby.

They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna Malet, n&#233;e Wales (1779&#8211;1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), the maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir Charles Malet&#8217;s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793&#8211;1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied Malet to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785&#8211;1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810&#8211;1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833&#8211;1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843&#8211;1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> there, &amp; go for two or three days to Cole Orton. In that case we should probably arrive in town on the Friday or Saturday. But if he should not be at home to receive us, then we shall proceed all together, &amp; arrive on the Wednesday. I shall come in such plight as to require the promptest aid of the tailor &amp; shoemaker. As for seasons, the oyster season<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">September&#8211;April: Southey was very fond of oysters.</note> is that which concerns me most, because I then always know how to lay in a compendious dinner at a time when Archeus<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">In some forms of alchemy, Archeus is the principle that directs and maintains living beings.</note> calls for it. The less I get among strangers, the better I shall be pleased, &amp; indeed I shall have no time for them, for I must move speedily to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>, where I can finish my book,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> &amp; when that is done it will be time for me to set out on my flying visit to the West. There will be little rest for the sole of my foot after I leave home, &#8211; or to speak more accurately, considering that the greater part of the motion will be in stage coaches, &#8211; for the seat of my pantaloons.</p>

Hughes had married, in April 1823, Anna Maria Forster (d. 1890), daughter of John Forster (c. 1751&#8211;1837), Vicar of Tunstead 1782&#8211;1837.</note> has invited <del>them</del> &lt;her&gt;, then to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarksons</ref> near Ipswich, &amp; lastly to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville Whites</ref>.

        <p rend="indent1">You will think all these movements enough for me in all conscience. They will probably help me to brace me, which I stand in need of, not having recovered the relaxation which the last summers cold brought on.</p>
