<opener><salute>My dear R.</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Thank you your letter, – &#38; for <ref type="m" target="people.html#AbbotCharles">Lord C.s</ref>, which is as complimentary as the vainest author could desire.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Rickman and Colchester had congratulated Southey on the appearance of the first volume of his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> It does not appear to me that I have incorporated more of the State papers than is necessary for carrying on the narration, &#38; laying the whole iniquity fairly before the world; – but I am aware that a love of detail is my besetting sin, &#38; that I should have been suited to the age had I lived when men wrote folios.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The second volume will not be long in passing thro the press when I can get it in.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of the <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> was not published until 1827.</note> But the first chapter waits for some Spanish books relating to the war in Catalonia which <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has been more than twelvemonths getting for me.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.</note> – I am very rich in materials for it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You told me that the Caledonian Canal<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Rickman was Secretary to the Commissioners for the Caledonian Canal. He and Southey had inspected progress on it on their visit to Scotland in August–September 1819. The canal finally opened in October 1822, twelve years later than planned, even though it was only two-thirds finished. In a letter of 30 April 1822, though, Rickman told Southey that the canal was a ‘tender subject’, because he feared it would never be opened throughout its whole length. By 1822 many steam-powered, iron-hulled ships were too large to use the canal and the Royal Navy had no use for it after the final defeat of France in 1815. Though a magnificent feat of engineering, the canal was, therefore, perceived by many to be obsolete by the time it formally opened.</note> was a sore subject, – &#38; something to that purport I heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lowther</ref>. This has prevented me from sending some communications thro you to <ref type="m" target="people.html#TelfordThomas">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Telford</ref><note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Telford oversaw the construction of the Caledonian Canal and had accompanied Rickman and Southey for much of their tour of Scotland in 1819.</note> lest they should be ill-timed. There are two Inscriptions for the Canal,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey wrote three ‘Inscriptions for the Caledonian Canal’: ‘Inscription for a Tablet at Banavie, on the Caledonian Canal’, <title>Friendship’s Offering. A Literary Album</title> (London, 1826), pp. [167]–168; and ‘At Clachnacharry’ and ‘At Fort Augustus’, <title>The Anniversary; or, Poetry and Prose for MDCCCXXIX</title> (London, 1829), pp. 194–197. Southey had at this time only written the first two of these poems.</note> – &#38; my annual ode,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Scotland, an Ode, Written after the King’s Visit to that Country. By Robert Southey, Esq. Poet Laureat’, <title>The Bijou: Or Annual of Literature and the Arts</title> (London, 1828), pp. 81–88. The poem was Southey’s annual New Year’s ode for 1823, fulfilling his obligations as Poet Laureate. </note> which being to the praise &#38; glory of Scotland, contains becoming mention of him &#38; Rennie.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Rennie (1761–1821; <title>DNB</title>), the Scottish civil engineer and architect. He and Telford were praised in ‘Scotland, an Ode’, lines 48–77.</note> – I have several of these odes now, which will do me no discredit when they see the light.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">As Poet Laureate, Southey had written an annual New Year’s ode since 1814. By early 1823 only <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814) had been published, though ‘Ode, Written in December, 1814’, which Southey had intended to be his New Year’s ode for 1815 until Croker objected to its contents, had appeared in <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. [215]–224.
