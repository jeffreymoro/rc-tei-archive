It is very possible that we may arrive in London at night, this being a matter in which we shall have no choice, but must take the chance of the road. As the time is thus uncertain, so is the day, depending upon the weather. Rain may prevent us from seeing some of the objects which we hope to visit. If all things prove favourable we may sleep at Matlock on Saturday the 8<del>xx</del>

They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna Malet, n&#233;e Wales (1779&#8211;1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir Charles Malet&#8217;s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793&#8211;1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied Malet to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785&#8211;1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810&#8211;1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833&#8211;1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843&#8211;1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> make some calls, &amp; reach Cole Orton to dinner on the Monday. There I think of staying either two or three days, as we may feel disposed. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George</ref> will send us to Loughborough, &amp; then we must trust to fortune. The most likely thing is that we shall have to travel from thence by night. But whether we shall reach London on Saturday the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &#8211; or one two or three days sooner depends (setting other chances aside) upon so uncertain a thing as the weather.
