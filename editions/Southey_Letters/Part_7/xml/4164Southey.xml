Southey planned to, but did not, write an account of his life.</note> is this: the correspondence of William Penn with his wife &amp; with James Logan<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Penn (1644&#8211;1718; DNB), the leading Quaker and founder of Pennsylvania; Hannah Callowhill Penn (1671&#8211;1726), Penn&#8217;s second wife and effective administrator of Pennsylvania 1712&#8211;1726; and James Logan (1674&#8211;1751), an Irish Quaker who sailed to Pennsylvania with Penn in 1699 as his secretary and remained in the colony as a key representative of the Penn family&#8217;s interests, holding a variety of offices. The publication of their letters was announced in <title>Transactions of the Historical &amp; Literary Committee of the American Philosophical Society</title>, I (1819), pp. xiii&#8211;xiv, no. 63 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. This was to be based on the family archives of Dr George Logan of Stenton (1753&#8211;1821), James Logan&#8217;s grandson, and undertaken by &#8216;A Lady of the Doctor&#8217;s family&#8217; [Deborah Norris Logan (1761&#8211;1839), wife of George Logan], who had already delivered &#8216;the first MS. Volume of the collection, which she has enriched with notes and with introductory matter of much interest.&#8217; However, Logan&#8217;s edition was not published until 1870&#8211;1872.</note> his confidential friend &amp; secretary has been announced for publication by the American Philosophical Society &#8211; of Philadelphia, &#8211; not absolutely indeed, but in such a manner as to leave little doubt that it will appear, &amp; from what is said of this correspondence, it must contain information of great importance to any person who is investigating the rise &amp; progress of Quakerism. Meantime I go on collecting materials, &amp; arranging them as opportunity occurs. The time &amp; labour will not be misemployed; for the subject is curious, &amp; in many points of view important. Nor do I think that the Quakers will have any reason to complain of the spirit in which it is written, tho assuredly their &#8220;<hi rend="ital">sandy foundations</hi>&#8221;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to William Penn&#8217;s <title>The Sandy Foundation Shaken, or, Those so Generally Approved and Applauded Doctrines, of One God, Subsisting in Three Distinct and Separate Persons, the Impossibility of God&#8217;s Pardoning Sinners, without a Plenary Satisfaction, the Justification of Impure Persons by an Imputative Righteousness, Refuted from the Authority of Scripture Testimonies, and Right Reason</title> (1668).</note> will be shaken.</p>
