        <p rend="indent1"> I can tell you now thank God that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">your godson</ref> appears to be perfectly recovered, &#8211; which till to day I could not have said. He had a bilious remittent fever upon him for about ten days; &amp; tho at no time in what is called danger, you very well know, how soon such a disease might have taken an alarming form, &#8211; especially when typhus is prevalent, as it is in these parts. I am not the better for this anxiety. This corporal tenement of mine is not in the best condition; it has begun to feel the effect of time in more ways than one. &#8211; I am going to Rydal for two or three days, for the sake of change. I should be glad now if I kept a carriage, but that I shall never do. A long walk I dare not venture on, &#8211; not for want of strength, or inclination, but because of an infirmity which makes a short one inconvenient, &amp; must end in disabling me from <del>xxx</del> exercise.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was suffering from a rectal prolapse.</note> Happily there are not many persons better able both in mind &amp; body to bear with such a privation. &#8211; When you come here (for come you must,) I must ride with you.</p>

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">His Right Honour</ref> was, very often, his Wrong Honour when he was in opposition, but his <del>xxxx</del> opposition was always fair &amp; honourable, &#8211; there was none of that low, dirty malice about it, which is now displayed towards him, by Grey Bennet,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Grey Bennet (1777&#8211;1836), Whig MP for Shrewsbury 1806&#8211;1807 and 1811&#8211;1826. He had become involved in a long-running dispute with Wynn over the conditions of imprisonment of the radical Henry Hunt (1773&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>) in Ilchester Gaol 1820&#8211;1822.</note> a man of whom I have heard him speak <del>much more favourably</del> with ill-requited liberality. I have a great dislike to that man, who seems to <del>xx</del> me to have no sense of charity or humanity for any but those who either suffer or deserve punishment. Your regular professor of philanthropy is the most hard-<del>hearted</del> hearted of all hypocrites. This is one of your precious reformers who would consult the comforts of thieves in prison, &amp; cut down the salaries of Clerks in office, or turn them upon the world. I am very proud of being an Englishman when I think what this country has done, what hearts &amp; intellects it has produced, &amp; still contains, &#8211; but indeed Grosvenor, sometimes I am almost as much ashamed of it when I see a nation gulled by such fellows as Hume,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Hume (1777&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish radical MP, much disliked by Southey for his campaigns against government expenditure.</note> Bennett &amp;c, &amp; a government truckling to them, &amp; discarding its servants, or curtailing them of their pay in deference to a cry for retrenchment which they know to be as absurd as it is rascally.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry you have not read the clean sheets<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Proofs of the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> I should have liked to have known how you liked them. &#8211; Pray tell you friend Hawker<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Major-General Samuel Hawker (1763&#8211;1838), who had served in the Peninsular War between 1808 and 1811 as commander of the 14th Light Dragoons and made a number of sketches in Spain.</note> how much I am obliged to him. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref>
          <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall wished to use Hawker&#8217;s sketches for <title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey&#8217;s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W.

These pictures could be inserted into the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> is a man for whom I have a great regard. He has got some sketches from Heaphy,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Heaphy (1775&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>), a watercolour artist who had gone out to Spain in 1812 and produced portraits of many leading British officers.</note> but they relate only to the last campaign. &#8211; I have had some very interesting communications from Gen. Whittingham,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieutenant General Sir Samuel Ford Whittingham (1772&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), a British soldier who served with Spanish forces in the Peninsular War 1808&#8211;1813.</note> &amp; from <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Bart. Frere</ref>. And, the most important which have yet come into my hands, from <ref type="m" target="people.html#DalrympleHew">Sir Hew Dalrymple</ref>, &#8211; which will compel me to rewrite part of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 382&#8211;286, had dealt with the Battle of Bail&#233;n, 16&#8211;19 July 1808, the first major defeat for French forces in Spain. Dalyrymple&#8217;s information (pp. 389&#8211;390) concerned the attempts by Spanish commanders to overturn aspects of the agreement by which French forces had surrendered.</note> But you know I never grudge at labour of this kind.</p>
