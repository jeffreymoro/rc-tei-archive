        <p rend="indent1">The Courier which arrived this day announced your appointment in due form, saving that it left out your second name, &#8211; an error which I suppose will be corrected in the next gazette.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey had been elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1823; the <title>London Gazette</title>, 1 July 1823, announced he had been appointed a Physician in Ordinary to George IV. The <title>Courier</title>, 3 July 1823, reprinted the news of &#8216;Doctor Henry Southey&#8217;s&#8217; appointment.</note> Your taking the College by storm is very amusing. And now you have only to get a good fortune, &amp; then the bloody hand;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A baronetcy. The heraldic badge of all baronets of the United Kingdom is the Red Hand of Ulster. Prominent physicians, especially those with royal appointments, could hope to become baronets, though Henry Herbert Southey did not.</note> &#8211; you will probably have them both by the time you are as old as I am now.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I have tried your prescription against my annual visitor.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s hay fever.</note> The dose suspended the complaint for the next day, on the third it returned; &amp; after repeating the remedy four or five times, it ceased even to relieve it for the day. I tried bark<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Willow bark, a cure used for common colds, but it was also used for pain relief.</note> during the intervals, but I have been afraid of taking the prescription every other night, partly because the calomel<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A mercury chloride mineral, prescribed in compounds for virtually any disease in the early nineteenth century. </note> does not prevent the action of the laudanum<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Opium dissolved in alcohol. It was widely used for pain relief, but also to suppress persistent coughs. It had a constipatory effect, which the laxative effect of the calomel was not effectively counteracting.</note> upon the biliary secretions, still more because the frequent use of cathartics would certainly bring on the old complaint,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Cathartic medicines act as laxatives; calomel had this effect. Southey suffered from a rectal prolapse and from haemorrhoids.</note> from which I have been compleatly free, till the relaxation which this cold &amp; the physic have produced between them, brought on a slight recurrence of it. &#8211; I went up Skiddaw yesterday &#8211; by way of an alternative, &amp; will take every opportunity of exercise that any charitable person will afford me. I will also try the warm bath, having got possession of an <hi rend="ital">old shoe</hi>, which will answer the purpose.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey had probably recommended that Southey should inhale the steam from warm water (possibly with a remedy dissolved in the water) to counteract his hay fever.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">There has been no news as yet from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey had sailed from Whitehaven on 20 April 1823 on the brig <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> and reached Quebec on 27 May. He was considering emigrating to Canada.</note> His itch of letter-writing I think will never annoy you as much as it has done me: indeed I will not fail to prevent any such indulgence of it, <del>xx</del> as far as my power may extend. It is a cursed propensity. &#8211; There will be many difficulties in the way of his removal; &#8211; &amp; I am not without apprehensions that he may be more disposed to find some pretext for thinking them insuperable, than to set himself in earnest about overcoming them. &#8211; One obstacle there is which never entered into my calculations. &#8211; It appears by Gourlay&#8217;s book,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Fleming Gourlay (1778&#8211;1863), <title>A General Introduction to a Statistical Account of Upper Canada, Compiled with a View to a Grand System of Emigration, in Connexion with a Reform of the Poor Laws</title> (London, 1822), p. cclxxxviii. Gourlay was an eccentric farmer, statistician, reformer and writer whose life was dominated by his attempt to vindicate himself over his expulsion from Upper Canada in 1819.</note> that the fees upon a grant of lands in Canada, amount to as much as the price of such lands would do in the U. States. &#8211; But it is quite plain that we must get him there if we can. Once fairly settled there, the provision for himself &amp; his family<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Margaret Hill Southey (b. 1811); Mary Hill Southey (b. 1812); Robert Castle Southey (1813&#8211;1828); Herbert Castle Southey (1815&#8211;1864); Eleanor Thomasina Southey (1816&#8211;1835); Sarah Louise Southey (1818&#8211;1850); Nelson Castle Southey (1820&#8211;1834); and Sophia Jane Southey (1822&#8211;1859). Thomas Castle Southey (1824&#8211;1896) completed the family.</note> becomes certain, &amp; I do not see any other course.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My long delayed journey, as it makes me too late for the spring oyster may peradventure not take place till the <hi rend="ital">r</hi> in the latter months makes it appearance.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The oyster season is September&#8211;April. Southey did not leave home until 3 November 1823.</note> Oystrification at two o clock is a matter of more importance to me when in London, than what is called the fullness or emptiness of the town. At any season, the friends whom I wish to see will be there.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The Printer<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Roworth (c. 1765&#8211;1851), a printer based at Bell-yard, Temple Bar, London.</note> is once more gone to sleep over my book, having printed about half the second volume. In a day or two I shall begin the chapter concerning the overthrow of the Church by the Puritans,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 347&#8211;467, on the Civil War and English Republic 1642&#8211;1660.</note> &#8211; one of the most important in the book &amp; then it will soon be finished. I trust to bring out both my Colloquies, &amp; the Tale of Paraguay<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829) and <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> during the next season: the latter certainly, for my ways &amp; means require an effort.</p>
