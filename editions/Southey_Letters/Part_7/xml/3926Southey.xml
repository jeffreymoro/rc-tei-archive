        <p rend="indent1">  I should not be satisfied with myself if I allowed a day to elapse without advising you not to publish these verses. They can do you no good &amp; they may do you a great deal of harm.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When a book is dedicated to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref>
          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton, <title>Napoleon, and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), p. [v] was dedicated to George IV. Barton may have been offended not to receive any acknowledgement of his dedication and had written some verses expressing his disappointment.</note> it is a rare thing for the author to hear any thing of its acceptance. If he presents it himself at a levee, he is thanked at the time, &#8211; &amp; there the matter ends: &#8211; or if it is presented by any friend for him the acknowledgment is made in the same manner. After my Vision<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> had been presented some weeks, it was thought a mark of great graciousness in <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> that <del>he</del> at a levee he told <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</ref> he was obliged to me for it &amp; had read it with pleasure.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to John Rickman, 18 May 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3687.</note> &#8211; To write a letter of thanks would be as much out of the course of things, as for him to pay me a visit.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">It is very likely that <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> may never have seen your book. It is &lt;also&gt; possible that you may be brought to his notice if <del>you</del> he has not, or to his recollection, if he has, &#8211; in some favourable way; &#8211; &amp; thereby be led to make some enquiry concerning it. But if these verses get abroad they will effectually mar any such possibility: &#8211; &amp; you will be set down for a person who formed rash expectations, &amp; had not discretion enough to conceal your mortification at finding yourself disappointed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I advise you also not to offend your own society.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Society of Friends, or Quakers.</note> They will be proud of you in time, &#8211; &amp; in time too for you to profit by their good opinion What I have said <del>you</del> of you in the QR.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Henri Gr&#233;goire (1750&#8211;1831), <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu&#8217;a l&#8217;Epoque Actuelle, sont N&#233;es, se sont Modifi&#233;es, se sont &#201;teintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), 1&#8211;46, published 15 February 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Southey included (pp. 4&#8211;5) a lengthy recommendation of Barton&#8217;s poetry for its &#8216;pure and religious spirit&#8217; and quoted Barton&#8217;s poem &#8216;The Pool of Bethesda&#8217;, from <title>Napoleon, and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), pp. [182]&#8211;185 in its entirety.</note> (if <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">the Editor</ref> does not strike it out &#8211; which I shall be sorely displeased if he does) &#8211; may accelerate this. But in writing what is there written, I have not shown a more sincere desire for your good than in giving you the present advice</p>
