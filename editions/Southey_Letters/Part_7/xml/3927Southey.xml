            <salute>My dear friend</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1"> The postmark upon your letter excited, as you supposed it would, an apprehension in me which I was truly glad to have removed by its contents. If the weather which we have had here has extended to the Lands end, you may very possibly be detained there still, for of all the seasons which we remember, this has been the worst, for continual rain &#38; tempest. Since <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> left us,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey had left Keswick on 2 October 1822.</note> I believe we have never had two dry days in succession.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs C.</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">her daugher</ref> are gone upon a round of visits, the extent of which they hardly know themselves. They went first to Derby<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sara Coleridge took her daughter to visit Elizabeth Evans (1758–1836), of Darley, near Derby. Sara and Samuel Taylor Coleridge had stayed with Mrs Evans in 1796, when there was a possibility that Coleridge would tutor her children.</note> meaning to remain there a week, – &#38; they have staid a month. Their next move is to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson’s</ref> who is living near Ipswich, – there I suppose they will be in a day or two, &#38; may probably pass their Christmas. From thence they go to Highgate,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">To see Samuel Taylor Coleridge.</note> – lastly to Somersetshire to visit <ref type="m" target="people.html#PooleThomas">Poole</ref>, – &#38; to Ottery<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Chanter’s House, Ottery St Mary, Devon, was the home of James Coleridge (1759–1836), one of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s older brothers, and the father of John Taylor Coleridge, a close friend of John May.</note> if they are invited. It may be prudent for you to manage that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Saras</ref> visit to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> does not take place during a vacation; – they<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">During a visit to Keswick in August–September 1822, John May’s son, John May (1802–1879), had become infatuated with Southey’s niece Sara Coleridge; however, she seems to have taken the matter lightly. Sara and her mother did not reach Ottery St Mary until May 1823. On this visit Sara became secretly engaged to her first cousin, Henry Nelson Coleridge.</note> can have no other opportunity of meeting; – &#38; as matters now are, on this side at least, you may then be perfectly &#60;at&#62; ease. She is heartwhole, – the affair never gave her half the uneasiness it did you.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> John, I dare say, will fall in at Exeter<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">John May (1802–1879) entered Exeter College, Oxford, in 1823.</note> with <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootJohnP">the son</ref> of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">my good friend Lightfoot</ref>. – My name will naturally draw them together. I have never &#60;seen&#62; <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootJohnP">young Lightfoot</ref>, but from all which I have heard of him, his sterling qualities would render him a valuable acquaintance for John, – if they should take to each other.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#ClarkeAdam">Adam Clark</ref> has written me a very friendly letter, which I have not answered, because I have been expecting to receive the manuscript. I shall not however delay answering it much longer in that expectation.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s letter to Clarke does not survive (if it was written). Clarke had probably written to Southey concerning his forthcoming <title>Memoirs of the Wesley Family</title> (1823), no. 598 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Clarke’s book was a reply to Southey’s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">And now to that pleasant paragraph in your letter relating to the strong beer. Direct it to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cookson, Kendal,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Cookson (1771–1833), Kendal wool merchant and friend of Wordsworth. Cookson had also stored the barrel of strong beer that May sent to Southey in 1820.</note> &#38; put an S upon the direction, that he may know it is for me. The day that &#60;this&#62; your <del>xxx</del> intimation arrived, I drew a cork upon the strength of it, &#38; indulged in your health.

            <p rend="indent1">Since I wrote to you, – or rather since <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> departed, I have been sedulously employed, tho not always productively; – about half my time having been bestowed upon a collection of papers from <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Frere</ref>, – which is of course preparatory work.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey intended to use these papers for the second volume of his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> I finished the QR. paper upon Gregoires book,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title> (1814), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (October 1822), published 15 February 1823.

            <p rend="indent1">Your intelligence of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> is the last that I have received.

I do not think that so proper an editor could have been found in any other person. And I believe that instead of injuring him in his profession, it will advance him in it, &#38; save him from the necessity of drudging at it, &#38; sacrificing himself to it, – for a miserable sacrifice it is when a man who is capable of being something better, becomes a mere lawyer. – Few things will give me more pleasure than to direct my communications to him.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">We are going on well, thank God, – tho we had a frightful alarm about <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> a few weeks ago. He had an attack of the spurious croup,<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Croup is a respiratory infection, whose main symptom is a barking cough. It is usually caused by a virus and affects many young children. It was known at this time as ‘false croup’, to distinguish it from laryngeal diphtheria, formerly known as ‘true croup’, a much more serious bacterial infection that also produced a barking cough.</note> from which he recovered much sooner than <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">his mother</ref> did from the effects of her anxiety.
