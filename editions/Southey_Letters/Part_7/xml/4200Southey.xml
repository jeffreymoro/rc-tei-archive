            <salute>My dear Harry</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">Thank you for your arrangement concerning the Herald.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had received a free copy of the daily evening newspaper, the <title>Courier</title>, because of Daniel Stuart’s association with the paper. Once Stuart sold his remaining shares in 1824 this arrangement ceased. Southey switched to the <title>Morning Herald</title> (1780–1869), a daily newspaper which at this time was non-aligned between Whigs and Tories. Its editorials were famously short – half a column.</note> The paper pleases me better than any other Morning Paper, <del>whxx</del> tho it scarcely ever manifests an opinion which I do not disapprove. But it keeps within decent bounds, &#38; the leading paragraph as it is the worst part, has generally the merit of being the most insignificant</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> My cold made its appearance as usual with the first fine weather, &#38; I <del>x</del> soon felt the effect of the relaxation which it produced. <del>Last week I went</del> &#60;About&#62; a fortnight ago I went up Skiddaw with <ref type="m" target="people.html#HughesThomas">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> </ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HughesMaryAnne">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hughes</ref> &#38; was the better for it, but two days after we went with them by way of Watenlath into Borrodale, &#38; tho I carted it for nine miles out of the fourteen, the walk brought on a considerable haemorrhage;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey suffered from a rectal prolapse and haemorrhoids.</note> – &#38; the next day the cold became so violent that for a whole week I spent the greater part of the day upon the sofa in a darkened room, unable to bear the light. It has got into my chest, at first with great violence; – now it is quiet there, &#38; I hope that as it has made a quicker passage than usual, it will depart the sooner. To day I am so much better that I have had no occasion to intermit my employments: something I attribute to change of weather, yesterday when the amendment began the first rain falling which we have had for eight or ten weeks.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> It appears now beyond all doubt that the books for which I have so long waited &#38; made so many enquiries are not in existence, &#38; that the account of them &#38; their author in Colburnes Magazine must consequently be a mere fiction.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877 and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Southey had then sought the assistance of George Canning. Finally, Southey had written to John Mitford, 12 April 1824, Letter 4171.</note> It was signed John Mitford. I know something of one <ref type="m" target="people.html#MitfordJohn">John Mitford</ref> &#38; supposing him to be the author, never doubted the authenticity of the account: – as indeed who would have suspected a fiction of this kind? – I have now sent the volume to press,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> &#38; am at this time as busy in arranging its materials as a General is in planning the operations of a campaign. My materials are very good; – but your Portugueze friends ought to get me a series of P. Gazettes for the honour of Portugal.
