            <p rend="indent1">Till now I have not had five minutes during which I could quietly put pen to paper since we parted. I breakfasted in the Close at Winchester<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey breakfasted with Elizabeth Heathcote (1773–1855) and Alethea Bigg (1777–1847), two sisters of Catherine Hill who shared a house at 12 Cathedral Close, Winchester.</note> on the morning after, saw the Cathedral &#38; the College, – found room in the Coach at noon &#38; reached London at night. The next day I secured places in the <ref type="m" target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref> mail for Friday evening, – &#38; dined among “strange women”<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Women who flattered Southey: <title>Proverbs</title> 5: 3, ‘For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil’.</note> at Lady Malet’s,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>). Her house was at 100 Gloucester Place, London.</note> – a situation something worse than that of Daniel in the Lion’s den.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Daniel</title> 6, where Daniel is thrown into a lions’ den, but survives through divine intervention.</note> – Your note in the travelling frank reached me before I left town, &#38; after a parcel had been sent off which I hope reached you without mishap, tho with no better packing than <del>xxx</del> my hands, (awkward at such work) could give it. You have there all my poems which have as yet been printed in that form.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had sent Caroline Bowles a specially bound copy of his <title>Minor Poems</title> (1823).</note> How many more such volumes may be added to them depends as much upon you as on myself.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had proposed that he and Caroline Bowles should write a poem on the legendary figure Robin Hood. The completed sections were published as ‘Robin Hood’ in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [1]–36.</note> Many I hope &#38; trust, – very many, – to your benefit &#38; mine, – to our mutual delight, – to our lasting remembrance.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">We arrived here safely on Saturday morning, Sunday I heard <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville</ref> officiate in a little village Church of which he is curate.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Neville White had been Perpetual Curate of Great Plumstead, five miles east of Norwich, since 1822.</note> – One of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">his brothers</ref> hymns was sung there, &#38; I dined at his mothers<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary White, née Neville (1755–1833).</note> where her whole family were assembled, with the father &#38; mother of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Nevilles</ref> <del>sweet</del> wife.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Neville White had married Charlotte White, née Sewell (1799–1873) in 1820. Her parents were Joseph Sewell (1772–1844), a wealthy Norwich solicitor, and Ann Sewell, née Cubitt (1780–1849).</note> Ten years ago when he had no prospect of marriage I volunteered to be godfather to his first son: &#38; very obligingly this son made his entrance a month ago, &#38; is this day to be christened Henry Kirke.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Family histories, including <title>The Homes and Haunts of Henry Kirke White; with some account of the family of White, of Nottingham and Norfolk</title> (London and Nottingham, 1908), p. 260, suggest that Neville White’s first son, christened Henry Kirke White (d. 1849), was born in 1821, but this information may be inaccurate, as Southey stood as godfather to him in January 1824.</note> </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I do not believe that any act of kindness was ever so largely overpaid, as that has been which I rendered to the Whites.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had edited and arranged the publication of <title>The Remains of Henry Kirke White</title> (1807). This had sold extremely well, reaching ten editions by 1823.</note> It has been of far greater consequence to them than I could possibly have dreamt of, – but their gratitude has more than kept pace with the benefit which they have received. And when I think that to the publication of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henrys</ref> Remains I am indebted for my knowledge of you,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s kindness to Kirke White’s family had encouraged Caroline Bowles to write to him in 1818, seeking his opinion of her then unpublished <title>Ellen Fitzarthur; a Metrical Tale, in Five Cantos</title> (1820). </note> I certainly look upon it as one of the most fortunate events of my life, &#38; perhaps one of the most influential. If as a poet I am to have a second spring (there is still sap enough in the trunk – &#38; enough life in the root) <del>xxx xxxxx</del> – to this it must be owing.</p>
