            <p rend="indent1">Who should succeed <ref type="m" target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord Liverpool</ref>, if he were about to retire, would be to me a matter of less interest than who shall succeed poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> as the Editor of the Q. R. in case of his death, or of his inability to continue in that office. The latter probability he mentioned to me some weeks ago, &#38; likewise how totally at a loss he was where to look for one who might supply his place. I mentioned <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> to him, – &#38; have mentioned him to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> also.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to [John Murray], 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.</note> – I have some reason to think that <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> inclines to my opinion, for he has had a conversation with him upon the difficulties of an Editors task &#38;c, &#38; tho he said nothing which in any way committed himself, yet he would not have entered <hi rend="ital">upon</hi> that subject, &#38; <hi rend="ital">into it</hi> as he did, <del>unless he</del> if my suggestion had been totally dismissed. One thing which he said was that his successor must be a man in whom the Government could feel confidence, because of the assistance which they afforded in the way of documents from the public offices. And this leads me to mention the subject to you.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> There is no question about his abilities, acquirements habits &#38; principles. But he possesses in an eminent degree discretion, a sound judgement, &#38; a right feeling. I am sure he would never admit any thing which should lower the review, – nothing of that mere insolence which has so often disgraced it, &#38; brought it down to the level of the Edinburgh.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Edinburgh Review</title> (1802–1929), the main Whig quarterly journal.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">The choice is a matter of more consequence than <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> is aware of. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> is very much disliked by the <hi rend="ital">trade</hi>. They would delight in injuring him, &#38; (this is between ourselves) the project of starting a New Quarterly upon the same principles, has been thought of.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This proposal came from Joseph Mawman (1759–1827), bookseller and author from York, who became a well-known London publisher. His firm was based in the City of London. Mawman had proposed to set up a rival journal to the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, edited by Southey, though this project did not materialise.</note> I do not wish to see this <del>xxx</del> because it would weaken the effect which the Q. now produces, &#38; it is better to have one efficient journal of this kind, than to divide its power. But if it were made unexceptionable in its tone &#38; temper &#38; consistent in its views, I am sure its influence would be greatly increased.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  For myself it would be a great satisfaction to have an Editor who would not mutilate my papers without consulting me.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">But I must conclude. I have said this to you, that you may know what my wishes are upon the subject, – which tho not a matter of state, is one which no doubt you will hear talked of, &#38; in which very possibly your opinion may have some weight</p>
