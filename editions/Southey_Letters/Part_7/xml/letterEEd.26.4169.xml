        <p rend="indent1">The answer from Penrith<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">From a Miss Walmesley of Penrith, who was intending to travel to London and might have accompanied Bertha Southey.</note> did not arrive yesterday: &amp; now that it is come, we are still in the same quandary, or as it is called in the Lingoa Grande<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The language Southey had made up to mimic the speech of Sara Coleridge.</note> twittarumpiter. For nothing can be done in that quarter. The result therefore is, that unless a letter from you should come to say that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> can be received somewhere, &#8211; if she were &lt;to&gt; arrive on Thursday the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &#8211; she must wait for another chance. If <del>she</del> you should have made any arrangement she will set out with Miss Tolson<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Tolson (dates unknown). She had set up business in High Holborn, London, as a &#8216;linen-draper, dealer and chapwoman&#8217;. Declared bankrupt on 8 July 1826, she started a new business in Regent Street as a &#8216;milliner and dress maker&#8217; only to go bankrupt again on 16 May 1828.</note> on Monday. I shall write to the Rickmans<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</ref> and his family.</note> by this post. You will observe that in all this the only evil is a little consumption of pen, ink, paper &amp; time, falling mostly upon my poor Pilgarlicship.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A &#8216;pilgarlic&#8217; was a foolish person, looked on with humorous contempt.</note> And moreover that there has been some good in it, for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> would really not have been in a proper state to have commenced such a journey this day. She has had the prevailing cold very severely, &amp; is by no means thoroughly recovered. And as some compensation for her disappointment, there will be the visit to Rydale.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My cold has done me no good; but it is better to day.
