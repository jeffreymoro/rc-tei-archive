        <p rend="indent1">  Here then I am, nothing the worse for having been wheeled over fifteen hundred miles in the course of fifteen weeks. I no longer feel the effect of motion in my head, nor of jolting in my tail. I have taken again to my old coat &amp; old shoes: <del>xxxxga &lt;enjoy&gt; as I used to do the wholesome indulgence of xxxxxxx xxx after dinner</del> &#8211; dine at the reasonable hour of four, &lt;enjoy as I used to do, the wholesome indulgence of a nap after dinner,&gt; drink tea at six, sup at half-past nine, &#8211; <del>xx</del> spend half an hour over a sober folio &amp; a glass of black-currant rum with warm water &amp; sugar, &amp; then to bed. Days seemed like weeks while I was away, so many &amp; so various were my engagements: &amp; now that I am settling to my wonted round of occupations the week <del>seems</del> &lt;passes&gt; like a day. If my life is not like that of the <hi rend="ital">prisca gens mortalium</hi>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;the ancient race of man&#8217;: Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65&#8211;27 BC), <title>Epode</title> 2, line 2.</note> it is quite as happy <del>xxx</del>, &#8211; &amp; when you hear <hi rend="ital">Qui fit Mecaenas</hi>
          <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;How does it happen Maecenas&#8217;: Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65&#8211;27 BC), <title>Satire</title> 1.1 is titled, &#8216;Qui fit, Maecenas&#8217;. Its subject is the nature of human contentment.</note> quoted you may reply that you know one man at least, &lt;who is&gt; perfectly contented with his lot.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I was charged by <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> particularly to describe to her how <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs Coleridge</ref> looked when the fatal horn should first be exhibited to her astonished eyes.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A kind of bugle that Southey had bought as a joke, as his sister-in-law Sara Coleridge had a horror of loud noises.</note> The task which <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</ref> imposed upon me, my powers of language are not sufficient to discharge. The horn, I must tell you was made useful, as a case for <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref> lithographic print of Warwick Castle.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">William Westall, &#8216;A View of Warwick Castle&#8217; (1823).</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">The Dogstar</ref> packed <del>up</del> it carefully up with my umbrella in brown paper, so that no person could possibly discover what the mysterious package contained; &amp; great curiosity was excited when it was first observed at home. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> stood by (I sent for her) while the unpacking was deliberately performed. The string was untied, &#8211; not cut: I unbound it round after round; &#8211; &amp; then methodically took off the paper. The first emotion was an expression of contemptuous disappointment at sight of &#8211; the umbrella, which I was careful should be first discovered. But when the horn appeared, the fatal horn,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A well-used phrase in British poetry; for example, William Somervile (1675&#8211;1742; <title>DNB</title>), Fable 14, &#8216;The Fortune Hunter&#8217;, Canto 5, line 295.</note> then oh then &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Grosvenor it was an expression of dolorous dismay which Richter or Wilkie<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Richter (1772&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>) and David Wilkie (1785&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), painters who were well known for portraying domestic scenes.</note> could hardly represent unless they had witnessed it, &#8211; it was at once so piteous &amp; so comical. Up went the brows, down went the chin, &amp; yet the face appeared to widen as much as it was elongated, by an undefinable drawing of the lips which seemed to flatten all the features I know not whether sorrow or resentment predominated in the eyes, &#8211; sorrow, as, in the Dutch manner, she pitied herself; &#8211; or anger when she thought of me, &amp; of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">your brother</ref> from whom I received the precious gift &#8211; &amp; whose benevolence I loudly lauded. She wished him at MO-KO, &#8211; (where that <del>x</del> is I know not) &#8211; &amp; me she wished to a worse place, if any worse there be. In the midst of her emotion, I called upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> to observe her well, saying that I was strictly charged by <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</ref> to <del>xxxxx the effect</del> &lt;make a faithful &amp; full report&gt; <del>xhxx</del> The comical wrath which this excited added in no slight degree to the rich effect. Then I blew a blast which tho not worthy of King Ramiro<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s poem, &#8216;King Ramiro&#8217;, lines 146&#8211;151, <title>Morning Post</title>, 9 September 1803.</note> was nevertheless a good blast, but she ran &#8211; &amp; yet finally, which I hold to be the greatest triumph of my act, I reconciled her to the horn, &#8211; yes, reconciled her to it, &#8211; by reminding her that rats might be driven away by it, according as it is written in the story of Jeffery.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey, <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, p. 442. John Wesley&#8217;s (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) sister, Emelia (1693&#8211;1779), recounted how the Wesley family&#8217;s home was haunted by a ghost, &#8216;Jeffrey&#8217;, but her mother, Susanna Wesley (1669&#8211;1742), was convinced the noises in the house were caused by rats. She used a horn to try and drive the rats out of the house.</note>
