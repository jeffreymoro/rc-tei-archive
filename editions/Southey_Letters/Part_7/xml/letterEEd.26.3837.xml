Perhaps you may know something of the intended husband,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Harrison Fryer (1777&#8211;1855) of Whitley House, Northumberland. A surveyor, geologist and mining engineer, Fryer spent part of each year at Keswick. At this time he was renting Ormathwaite, a large house about a mile and a quarter from Keswick.</note> in many respect a much better one than she had reason to expect. He is a Land Surveyor by profession, a Newcastle-man by birth, Frier by name, &amp; now inhabits Ormathwaite: &#8211; a very handsome man, of gentlemanly manners &amp; appearance, &amp; scientific acquirements, forty years of age. He has lived in this neighbourhood several years. &#8211; What can be his inducement you will ask. I suspect her money, &amp; her connections. The rest, as a man of liberal opinions, he takes easily. All things considered however, her father<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Randle Wilbraham (1773&#8211;1861), landowner, of Rode Hall, Cheshire.</note> may look upon it as a very eligible match, this son in law being a person who is producible any where. I hope her poor wits will hold together till the time appointed which is not till after &#8211; Carlisle Assizes.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Assizes were courts that periodically heard more serious cases (including capital offences) in each county. The Carlisle Assizes began on 13 August 1822.</note> Marriage &amp; hanging you know, go together in an old proverb.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Marriage and hanging go by destiny;/ &#8217;Tis the old proverb; now they come together&#8217;, John Fletcher (1579&#8211;1625; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Wife for a Month</title> (1624), Act II, scene 1, lines 2&#8211;3.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry to hear from <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> that you have not been well. A run among the mountains will do wonders for you. I was in the river on the last day of April. We have had winter again since; &amp; now summer is returned. We were on the Lake this morning for the first time.</p>

These pictures could be inserted into the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> They are some of the finest things I ever saw.
