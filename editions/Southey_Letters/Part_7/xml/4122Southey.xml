            <p rend="indent1">Here I am after a wide circuit in which among other rememberable occurrences we overturned two men &#38; a woman in a market cart, – &#38; dropt a passenger from the outside, without any other harm done than leaving a law suit between the Cart &#38; the Stage Coach. I sleep at Winchester tomorrow night &#38; proceed to town by the day coach on Wednesday – to leave it for Norwich on Friday evening.

You perhaps can tell me whether I have there given him his proper titles.

I put the last hand to it at Crediton, &#38; found the last proofs here. It is I think the best chance I have yet had in the Lottery, &#38; will go far toward my ways &#38; means for a year or two to come. My bargain is for half the profits of the first edition, two thirds of all succeeding ones. And should it obtain a regular demand like certain histories, the eventual profit may by possibility amount to something considerable, &#38; I may get a larger sum for the copyright some years hence than would be given me now.</p>
