            <p rend="indent1"> I meant to have written to you concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> when the effect of the medicine had been observed. The first trial is not yet over: – but I was vexed to learn that after the fourth dose, the lids fell as before. It was perhaps occasioned by a stronger light than usual. – It did not occur to me to tell <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref>, in corroboration of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Farres<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Richard Farre (1775–1862; <title>DNB</title>), distinguished physician at the London Dispensary for Curing Diseases of the Eye and Ear (1806–1856) and author of works on diseases of the eye.</note> opinion, that she has always been subject to bleeding at the nose, rather in greater quantity than is usual with children; &#38; that for some months past there has been no discharge of this kind. Her eyes are large &#38; globular, – much the largest of all my children; &#38; her general health much the best, – that is the least liable to head ache, or derangements of any kind.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The pictures must be packed by the framer &#38; sent by wagon.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Portraits of the Southey family made by Edward Nash. Southey had sent them to London for framing by William Haines (1778–1848, <title>DNB</title>), painter and engraver, whose studio was at 3 Boyle Street, Savile Row.</note> I conclude that you have obtained the miniature from Bowyer.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The artist and publisher Robert Bowyer (1758–1834) was working on a painting, ‘View of the Interior of the House of Lords, during the important investigation of 1820’, and wished to include Southey in the crowd in the Strangers Gallery in the House of Lords. Southey had loaned him a miniature painted by Edward Nash in 1820 (it is now in the National Portrait Gallery); see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 4 May 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3681.</note> – If you have received a book for me (probably in pamphlett size) from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Holmes’s in Manchester Street,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Holmes, later Hunter (1751–1827), a wealthy East India merchant of Beoley Hall, Worcestershire, had his London home in Manchester Street, Marylebone. He was the father of Southey’s correspondent Ann Attersoll. She had presumably arranged that her father should convey a book to Southey on her behalf, since she lived in France.</note> consign it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murraylemagnes</ref> care, for his next parcel, which will probably be sent off when the Review comes out.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Quarterly Review</title>, 26 (January 1822) was published on 30 March 1822.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am sorry that you are among the sufferers by this financial operation.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The resumption of the link between bullion and the currency in 1819–1821 had caused a general deflation in prices.</note> I am of that class of <del>pers</del> travellers in this world whom the poet describes as singing in sight of the robber.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Decimus Iunius Iuvenal (late 1st century AD – early 2nd century AD), <title>Satires</title>, Book 4, Satire 10, line 21: ‘The empty-handed traveller will cheerfully sing when confronted by a robber.’</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">We are not in the best condition just now. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> has a feverish attack upon him, &#38; I have a recurrence of an ugly flatulent affection of the lower intestines which plagued me some weeks ago. I sent rhubarb<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Rhubarb was commonly used as a laxative.</note> upon a mission there last night, &#38; rhubarb performed its part, – but I fear has not performed a cure, for I still feel a distention &#38; hear sounds which a highlander might mistake for the music of his native land. – I want a shaking up &#38; shall go to <ref type="m" target="places.html#RydalMount">Rydal</ref> shortly for that purpose, – early next week if <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> be recovered. If I could afford it I would take a long journey every year, but travelling is doubly expensive to me, as incurring loss <del>at the same</del> &#38; cost at the same time.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Some unknown person sent me the New Times with a letter from an equally unknown hand about the Editor of Wat Tyler.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been sent copies of two newspapers which contained anonymous letters about the unauthorised publication of Southey’s early radical play, <title>Wat Tyler</title>, in 1817. The first letter appeared in <title>The Times</title>, 25 January 1822, and was signed ‘THE EDITOR OF WAT TYLER’ and dated 23 January 1822. It claimed to be from one of the people instrumental in arranging for the publication of Southey’s play in 1817; see Daniel E. White, ‘The Case of the Nocturnal Amanuenses: New Evidence in the <title>Wat Tyler</title> Affair’, <title>Modern Philology</title>, 118/2 (2020), 277–303. The second letter appeared in the <title>New Times</title>, 12 February 1822, unsigned and dated 6 February 1822. It contained a detailed defence of Southey and, in particular, the change in his political opinions from early radicalism to his own, later, idiosyncratic brand of conservatism.</note> – Of course I did not for a moment think of noticing the subject, &#38; thereby letting a scoundrel that he could put me to the trouble of <del>writing x xx</del> replying to him</p>
            <p rend="indent1">  They are I believe about to print some of my poems in France, – &#38; to translate more of them.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Ann Holmes, 6 February 1822, Letter 3795.</note> I believe there is a third translation of Roderic.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">The two translations were: Antoine André Brugière, Baron de Sorsum, <title>Roderick, le Dernier des Goths</title> (1820), no. 2697 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library; and Pierre Hippolite Amillet de Sagrie (1785–1830), <title>Roderic, Dernier Roi de Goths</title> (1821), no. 2700 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Amédée Pichot (1795–1877), French novelist, historian and prolific translator, began a translation of <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), but abandoned the project once the two other versions in French appeared.</note> But if I have any favour in that country, it will not be of long continuance, inasmuch as the Buonapartists will find my Hist. of the War<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), which was relentlessly hostile to the invasion of Spain ordered in 1808 by Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821; Emperor of the French 1804–1814, 1815).</note> rather unpalatable – 536 pages are printed. I am now working upon some very interesting papers of <ref type="m" target="people.html#DalrympleHew">Sir Hew Dalrymples</ref> – which have given me more insight into the affairs of Andalusia than all my other documents.
