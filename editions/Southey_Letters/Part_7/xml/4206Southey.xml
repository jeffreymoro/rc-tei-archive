They approved revisions to canon law and agreed to taxes on the clergy, but their meetings had been formalities since 1717. Their proceedings can be gleaned from medieval archbishops’ registers and Southey could have consulted David Wilkins (1685–1745; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Concilia Magnae Britanniae et Hiberniae a Synodo Verolamiensi A.D. 446 ad Londinensam A.D. 1717</title> (1737).</note> having been destroyed. &#38; it has moreover all the inimitable charm of Fullers manner. – Collier is coarse &#38; clumsy – - a bigot – on the right side. – It was necessary that I should have both at hand, but you would find upon investigation that I have drawn my materials from other sources, Collier’s never lay open before me, – &#38; Fuller’s I believe only in the reign of James I.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">James VI and I (1567–1625; King of Great Britain 1603–1625; <title>DNB</title>).</note></p>
