The daughter of his host hearing that the lieutenant would have milk for supper, brought him cream, and in consequence he never left Bamborough as long as he lived.’ The Lieutenant was probably the ‘Mr Moneypenny’ (c. 1714–1788), possibly tenant of the Manor House, who died at Bamburgh in February 1788.</note> I <del>xxx</del> remind you of it as a caution, you are in a land of cream, &#38; wives peradventure may be won by it as well as husbands: but if it should be so, I shall not object to the county. – Nay I should prefer it to most others, for I have still an inkling for the West. <del>Sxxxx xxxll xxx xxgpxxxl xxgpxxl Eliz xppxx xxxxx</del> Moreover is a good country for geese, &#38; if for geese it must be good for swans also, &#38; therefore a good country for a Cygnet to settle in.</p>
