            <p rend="indent1">Both your Dedications are very good, – the second very beautiful, tho a little hurt by the alteration, – the alteration however is advisable, – not that it would give offence, but that it is right to avoid any thing which might maliciously be pointed out as offensive.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton, <title>Napoleon and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), p.

            <p rend="indent1"> I was much pleased with the Poets Lot, – no, – not with his lot, – but with the verses in which he describes it.

To be writing “long after midnight”, &#38; “with a miserable headache” <del>xxx</del> is what no man can do with impunity; &#38; what no pressure of business, no ardour of composition, has ever made me do.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">‘The Poet’s Lot’ was not published until <title>Poetic Vigils</title> (London, 1824), pp. 111–117; it did not include the lines to which Southey objected.</note> I beseech you remember the fate of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke White</ref>; – &#38; remember that if you sacrifice your health (not to say your life) in the same manner, you will be held up in your own community as a Warning, – not as an example for imitation.

           <p rend="indent1"> You will take this as it is meant, I am sure.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">My friend, go early to bed: – &#38; if you eat suppers, read afterwards but never compose, that you may lie down <del>xx</del> with a quiet intellect.
