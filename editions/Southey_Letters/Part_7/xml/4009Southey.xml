          <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> is well pleased with the success of <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">his son</ref> at Westminster.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Hill had passed the examination known as &#8216;The Challenge&#8217; and become one of the 40 King&#8217;s Scholars at Westminster School. They had their own house, known as &#8216;College&#8217;, and a range of special privileges, from taking part in coronations to proceeding to Closed Scholarships at Christ Church, Oxford, or Trinity College, Cambridge.</note> It is a tremendous examination, &#8211; &amp; yet so mere a matter of cramming, that it affords not the slightest test of a boys abilities or real proficiency. The object gained is of considerable importance, &#8211; for we must act as if the institutions of this country were secure, &#8211; whatever we may think of their danger.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I am sorry for your sake that this Irish squabble is to be heard in the H. of Commons.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">On 21 April 1823 the House of Commons had voted to set up a committee of the whole house to examine the convoluted legal proceedings against some members of the Orange Order, who had led a riot in the New Theatre Royal in Dublin on 14 December 1822. Local officials were accused of colluding to prevent prosecution of the rioters, while William Plunket (1764&#8211;1864; <title>DNB</title>), the Irish attorney-general 1822&#8211;1827, was alleged to have abused due legal process to bring charges against the rioters. The matter was debated on ten separate days in the House of Commons in May 1823.</note> For the parties I care nothing, but heartily wish you a good deliverance. How much of the session will be consumed in this manner, for the mere purpose of vexation, &amp; to no other possible effect than that of increasing the ferment in Ireland! &#8211; a country which can be brought into order by no other possible process than half a century of military government.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I wonder the French do not proceed at once upon Madrid.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">French forces had invaded Spain on 7 April 1823 in order to overthrow the liberal government.</note> They seem to be acting very injudiciously, &amp; will soon that they have got themselves into a scrape. There is nothing tangible for them to overthrow or to overcome.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My Book of the Church<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> is growing into a second volume, &amp; this keeps me at my desk when I would fain be in town. I am however well satisfied with it, as it proceeds &#8211;</p>
