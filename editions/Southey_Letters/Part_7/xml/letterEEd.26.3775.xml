          <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> has told me of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fishers death,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">James Fisher (c. 1758&#8211;1821), Chief Clerk in the Auditor&#8217;s Office, had died on 15 December 1821. Bedford duly succeeded Fisher as Chief Clerk 1822&#8211;1834, relinquishing his post of Clerk of Registers and Issues, which he had held since 1806.</note> &amp; I am anxious to know whether you are to ascend in the old &amp; proper course of things or to suffer in consequence of any new order, upon the present system of rascally retrenchment. This is a point which interests me much more than any possible change of ministry could do</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I suppose you have seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</ref> note concerning me.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In the &#8216;Appendix&#8217; to &#8216;The Two Foscari&#8217;, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: &#8216;I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey&#8217;s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.&#8217; Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May&#8211;August 1817. The &#8216;calumnies&#8217; Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a &#8216;League of Incest&#8217; during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</note> I heard of it a week ago from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>, &amp; began a newspaper reply, that I might be sure of the advantage of writing while I was cool. Today I have seen the passage in a newspaper:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle</title>, 29 December 1821.</note> a little of my reply must be struck out as irrelevant (that is to say not called for) &#8211; &amp; a concluding paragraph must be added. When that is done, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> has seen it, I shall send it to you, on its way to the Courier.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. The letter appeared in the <title>Courier</title> on 11 January 1822.</note> &#8211; If I had been in danger of lowering &amp; exposing myself by losing my temper, <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">his Lordships</ref> example would have saved me: but I am too sensible of my strength to fall into his error. His affectation of contempt comes to my hands curiously, just after I have received from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> an account of the manner in which he extolled Roderick upon its first appearance.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron greatly admired Southey&#8217;s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814); see Southey to John Murray, 4 December 1814, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2510.</note> But this inconsistency, which must be known to all his friends, is beneath my notice. I have nothing to do but to repel the charge of calumny &amp; lay on the scourge a second time upon the author of Don Juan.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), &#8216;Preface&#8217;, pp. xvii&#8211;xxii, where Southey denounced &#8216;the Satanic School&#8217; of modern poetry without naming any one poet. However, this was clearly a riposte to Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819), whose suppressed &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, mocking Southey, had circulated widely.</note>
