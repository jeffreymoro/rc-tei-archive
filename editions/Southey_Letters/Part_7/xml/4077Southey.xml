        <p rend="indent1">In dealing with a work like this of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landors</ref>, it is as safe a rule to expunge the passage when in doubt, as it is to win the trick at whist in a similar predicament. I know not who the persons are that are aimed at in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Conversation; but be they who they may, it cannot be proper to publish such things of them, &amp; may be dangerous. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> is so incapable of fear, that in his estimate of the character of such men he never recollects how easily they may employ some one to revenge them with a stiletto.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The Dialogue may be made harmless by curtailing it thus.</p>

        </p>
        <lb />
        <p rend="indent1">You may well wonder at the manner in which <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> resents real or imaginary wrongs. But it is a constitutional malady which he has inherited; nor did I ever see any other case in which a mans errors were so certainly thus to be accounted for. His attachments however are as strong &amp; as permanent as his resentment. And deeply as his insanity of temper is to be regretted, I do not believe that there exists a man of more generous feelings, of a brighter genius or of a nobler heart.</p>
