          <p rend="indent1">  If you can render any assistance in furthering this subscription, I need not say that <del>xx</del> it will be rendering me a service. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> will print 750 copies provided we can procure 200 subscribers to begin with. That we shall be able to do this I am by no means confident; but it must not fall to the ground for want of exertion on my part.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  The plan was of my suggestion. The subject cannot be treated in any other way so well, for it includes the whole of the islands, &#38; therefore has neither national or territorial unity. At proper intervals I shall assist him with general views, – &#38; throughout with such materials &#38; remarks as my multifarious pursuits have brought within my reach. – It will be a very respectable book, bringing together a great deal of matter from scattered sources, &#38; filling up a portion of history which disgraceful as it is in every point of view to every nation whom it concerns, ought nevertheless to be known</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Can you put me in the way of getting a daily paper without paying the full price for one? I have just lost the Courier<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Courier</title> (1792–1842) was a pro-government daily London evening paper. Stuart bought it in 1796. However, he had taken little active part in the <title>Courier</title> since 1811 and had finally sold his share in its ownership.</note> – for which I have been obliged to <ref type="m" target="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</ref> ever since I have resided in this place. In the years 98 &#38; 99 I was his Poet Laureate &#38; wrote verses at a guinea a week for the Morning Post.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Morning Post</title> (1772–1937), a London daily paper. When Southey wrote for the <title>Morning Post</title> it was an opposition paper. Stuart was its owner 1795–1803.</note> That pay was then a great object to me; &#38; I must say of him that of all persons with whom I have ever been connected in the way of <hi rend="ital">trade</hi> he <del>has been the</del> is the one whom I have served least, &#38; who has shewn himself most sensible of the service. But he has now parted with his last share in the Courier &#38; consequently I no longer receive it. I could very well be content with my weekly Westmorland Gazette,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Westmorland Gazette</title> is a weekly newspaper, based in Kendal, founded in 1818. At this time it was pro-government.</note> but it is not proper that I should so content myself. It is quite necessary that I should <del>be</del> not be ignorant of what is going on at home &#38; abroad – but if you can help me to get a morning paper at half price, – it will answer as well as an evening one at the first cost.</p>
