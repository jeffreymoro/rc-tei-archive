Only let it be your ordinary custom. You will one day understand feelingly how beneficially the time has been employed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The way which I recommend is, I verily believe, the surest way of profiting by the scriptures. In the course of this easy &amp; regular perusal, the system of religion appears more &amp; more clear &amp; coherent; its truths are felt more intimately, &amp; its precepts &amp; doctrines reach the heart, &#8211; as slow showers penetrate the ground. In passages which have repeatedly been heard &amp; read, some new force, some peculiar meaning, some home-application which had before been overlooked will frequently come out; &amp; you will find in thus recurring daily to the Bible, as you have done among the Lakes &amp; Mountains which you love so well, &#8211; in the word of God as in his works, &#8211; beauties &amp; effects &amp; influences as fresh as they are inexhaustible. &#8211; I say this from experience.</p>
