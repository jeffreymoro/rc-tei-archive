            <p rend="indent1">I very much approve your laudable curiosity to know the precise meaning of that noble word horsemangandering.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 30 September 1822, Letter 3899.</note> Before I tell you its application, you must be informed of its origin &#38; history. Be it therefore known unto you, that <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs Coleridge</ref>, the whole &#38; sole inventor of the never-to-be-forgotten Lingo-grande (in which by the bye I purpose erelong to compose a second epistle)<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The first ‘epistle’ was Southey to ‘Stumparumper’ [Grosvenor Charles Bedford], 14 September 1821, <title>Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3730.</note> thought proper one day to call <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</ref> a great horsemangander, thinking I suppose that that appellation contained <del>xx</del> as much unfeminine meaning as could be put into any decent compound. From this substantive the verb has been formed to denote an operation performed by <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">the said daughter</ref> upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">the said Aunt</ref>, – of which I was an astonished spectator. The horsemangander, that is to say <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, being tall &#38; strong, &#60;came behind&#62; <del>took</del> the person to be horsemangandered (to wit <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs C</ref>) &#60;&#38; took her&#62; round the waist, under the arms, then jumped with her all the way from the kitchen into the middle of the parlour, the motion of the horsemangandered person at every jump being some thing like that of a paviours rammer,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A ‘paviour’ is an obsolete word for someone who lays paving stones; a ‘rammer’ was a tool used to pound the stones flat and into place.</note> &#38; all resistance impossible</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Thank you for the half notes. I believe the only demand against me is the Taylors (Hydes<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Hyde (d. 1820) had been Southey’s tailor in London. His successor was J. McCallan &#38; Co., tailors of Leicester Square, London.</note> successor) for my last years clothes. I will beg you to discharge this when you receive the next pension. And when I come to London you shall introduce me to your cheaper knight of the thimble.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Since <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harrys</ref> departure I have settled to my work steadily, of which <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> will see some proof in a day or two. I have also followed <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harrys</ref> prescription thus far faithfully, &#38; walked enough every day to require a good rubbing down on my return. Exercise has brought me into better condition than I ever expected to recover. The fine weather seems to have departed as soon as I had no longer a companion with whom to enjoy it; it was glorious while <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Dog-Star</ref> was here &#38; gloriously did we profit by it</p>
