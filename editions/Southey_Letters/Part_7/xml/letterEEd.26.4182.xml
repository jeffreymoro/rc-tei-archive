        <p rend="indent1"> I have a letter for you upon the stocks, &#8211; &amp; merely write now that you may not think you are forgotten &amp; to communicate two things, both which you will be glad to hear.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> First that M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Keenan<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Frances Keenan (d. 1838), an artist and widow of the Irish portrait painter, John Keenan (d. 1819). Southey first met the Keenans in Exeter in 1799.</note> has written to say that she will come to us in July or August. The thought has past across me that it might be <hi rend="ital">possible</hi> for you to travel with her from Devonshire. But I shall not hint at any such <del>axxx</del> possibility to her, because I know not how it may suit with your schemes, &amp; with your inclinations by which those schemes are to be regulated.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My second piece of news relates to the Ebenezers,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Ebenezer Elliott and his wife Frances Gartside (b. 1781).

Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island in 1823 and they and Lady Malet had travelled south with Southey from Keswick to London in November 1823. Southey had met Ebenezer Elliott when the party stayed overnight in Sheffield during their journey.</note> will be heartily glad to hear. I have got from <ref type="m" target="people.html#Tilbrook">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tilbrooke</ref> a promise for the young Ebenezer<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Ebenezer Elliott (1807&#8211;1871), the eldest son of Ebenezer Elliott. He matriculated at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, in 1825 as a sizar (i.e. a student receiving some form of financial assistance) and obtained his BA in 1829. He became a clergyman and was Perpetual Curate of New Mill, Huddersfield 1841&#8211;1843, and Lothersdale, near Skipton 1844&#8211;1848, later going to St Kitts in the West Indies and serving as Rector of Christ Church, Nichola Town, and St Mary&#8217;s, Cayou.</note> of a situation which will be worth about 60 &#163; a year, &#8211; in October 1825 &#8211; which will be just when he is fit to take it. And <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElliottEbenezer">the father</ref> writes me word that his business is increasing, so that in another year he thinks he may remove his family out of Sheffield, without imprudence</p>
