        <p rend="indent1"> A man of letters may ask a favour of you in aid of his pursuits, without danger of being thought impertinent &amp; obtrusive. For two years I have vainly been endeavouring to obtain two Spanish works, which I am led to believe contain very interesting particulars relating to the <del>Spanish</del> &lt;Peninsular&gt; War. The one is a history of the war in Catalonia, the other anecdotes of the chief Catalan officers, &#8211; supplementary to it, both by Francisco da Oliveira.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford&#8217;s &#8216;On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez&#8217;, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221&#8211;223. It mentioned Olivarez&#8217;s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help.</note> I have sought for them every where, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has been equally unsuccesful in his endeavours, &#8211; owing in great part to the late troubled state of Spain, the books having been published at Seville, &amp; therefore for some time not obtainable at Madrid. &#8211; May I request that you would procure them for me thro the Foreign Office, &#8211; the channel thro which I used to obtain documents from Spain, before <ref type="m" target="people.html#AbellaManuel">my poor correspondent in that country</ref>, fell into disgrace with that miserable Ferdinand,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833). He had restored royal absolutism in 1814, banishing or imprisoning many Spanish liberals.</note> was banished from the court, &amp; died.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should have waited on you, <del>&amp;</del> asked this request in person, if I had not understood that you were confined by indisposition since the day on which I was disappointed in the hope of meeting you at <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn&#8217;s</ref>.</p>
