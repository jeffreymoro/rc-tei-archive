          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>

        <p rend="indent1">Thank you for sending to Madrid,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford&#8217;s &#8216;On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez&#8217;, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221&#8211;223. It mentioned Olivarez&#8217;s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had now written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &#8211; if <ref type="m" target="people.html#AbellaManuel">my poor Spanish friend</ref> had been living, I should regularly have received the books which would be useful to me, thro the Ambassador.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William &#224; Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury (1779&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>), Ambassador to Spain 1822&#8211;1824, Portugal 1824&#8211;1827, Russia 1828&#8211;1832.</note> They used to come in the dispatches, &#8211; I have lately obtained some valuable documents from Sir Nicholas Trant.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Nicholas Trant (1769&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>), an Irish soldier and commander of Portuguese troops 1809&#8211;1813.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">If you can get the old edition of Strypes Annals,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Strype (1643&#8211;1737; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Annals of the Reformation and Establishment of Religion</title> (1709). Oxford University Press published a new edition in 1824, no. 2753 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Southey wanted this for his <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824). </note> pray let me have them, &#8211; They may be returned in a week, &#8211; for by the time they can arrive, I shall be ready to make immediate use of them. And it would be mortifying if there should appear any deficiency of information in any part of a book for which I have been so long preparing, &amp; with which I have taken so much pains. &#8211; We are now getting on rapidly, &#8211; &amp; if I do not deceive myself, the book <del>will</del> bids fair to attract readers, &amp; to impress them. More interesting materials no subject could afford.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">With regard to Lingard my intention is to review his history &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</ref> together in a series of papers,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Lingard (1771&#8211;1851; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of England, from the First Invasion of the Romans</title>, 5 vols (1819&#8211;1823). Southey only possessed the first three volumes of this, published in 1819, no. 1634 in the sale catalogue of his library; and Sharon Turner, <title>History of England</title> (1814&#8211;1823), no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Neither book was reviewed in the <title>Quarterly Review</title> at this time.</note> &#8211; adding as they occur other titles in the headings, &#8211; &amp; perhaps this series of essays on English history &#8211; with proper alterations may form <del>other</del> such another work as this Book of the Church.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this projected work.</note>
