           <p rend="indent1"> <hi rend="ital">I am to give notice</hi>,</p>
            <p rend="indent1">that the packages arrived on Tuesday last, &#38; that the tunic &#38; trowsers produced a most extraordinary metamorphosis in <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>. He declared that he must now leave off all his childish ways, he kept his hands in his pockets, as if that were the main purpose for which hands were <del>xx</del> intended: &#38; having unawares given me a kiss after tea, he recollected himself, reddened to think of the impropriety into which he had been betrayed, &#38; exclaimed in a quick tone, half anger, half mortification, – Oh, but I’ve left off kissing! For your comfort however I may assure you that the tunic &#38; trowsers are quietly put away for high days &#38; holydays, &#38; that he no longer insists upon the decorums belonging to the degree which he has taken in apparel.</p>

I would have you call there soon.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomerys</ref> two volumes of <title>Prose; by a Poet</title>,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">James Montgomery, <title>Prose, by a Poet</title> (1824).</note> were left behind. They had been lent to somebody I suppose. When they turn up, let them be sent to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> to come in one of his parcels. I have succeeded in stowing away the whole of this recent cargo, &#38; of the books from Italy, without having any new shelves; – by converting four duodecimo shelves in the Organ room,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A room at Greta Hall that had contained an organ when it was used by William Jackson and had once served as Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s study.</note> into three octavo ones; &#38; removing the duodecimo books into the passage, where some of the shelves have been pieced to make them hold a double row, – octavos behind, <hi rend="ital">shorticums</hi> in front. Another change has been to fill the bookcase on the lower landing place with bound books, – which has very greatly improved its appearance</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I wrote an account of the effect produced upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> by the unpacking of the horn, – in a letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>, which you ought to see.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Grosvenor Bedford, 22 February 1824, Letter 4141. The horn was a kind of bugle that Southey had bought as a joke, as his sister-in-law Sara Coleridge had a horror of loud noises.</note> You will let us know when you are low in purse, &#38; I will desire him to supply you. I will supply you also with another pack of autographs. By the by if you were &#60;to&#62; get yourself a little book, &#38; transcribe into it these brief extracts from time to time as they pass thro your hands; – you would find yourself possessed <del>of xxxx</del> one of these days of a choice collection of sentences &#38; maxims, – &#38; I should have an additional reason for supplying you.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Edith May Southey bought the notebook but made little progress in filling it up.</note></p>
          <p rend="indent1">  Your drawing books are likely to prove as useful as you wished them to be.

One third of the bottle was puddle; but the clear part was as good as any Champagne I ever tasted; the main difference – almost the only distinction – being, that it left no unpleasant tang behind it</p>
