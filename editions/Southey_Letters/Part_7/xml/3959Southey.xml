          <opener>  <salute>My dear G.</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I am very glad to see <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries’s</ref> appointment. By all that I have heard for many years past, a more unfit person than Arbuthnot<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Arbuthnot (1767–1850; <title>DNB</title>), Joint Secretary to the Treasury 1809–1823.</note> could not possibly have been in that situation: to get him out, &#38; have so efficient a man in his stead is indeed a great point. It is the very place in which I have wished to see <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref>. – I hope &#38; trust now that such means as the existing laws afford will be steadily employed for checking the license of the press. The radical country papers continually lay themselves open to prosecution; &#38; I am certain that repeated prosecutions would go far toward stopping the mischief which they are doing at present, &#38; have so long been doing with impunity. A strict watch over these, &#38; over <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref> would soon <del>surprize</del> &#60;suppress&#62;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The crossing out and the word ‘suppress’ inserted above are written in a different hand. ‘Suppress’ is also written in pencil, in the same unidentified hand, below the line.</note> them.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I know nothing of the sale of my book.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has not written to me since it appeared. Only two opinions of it have reached me, except those of my friends, one in a complimentary letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Littleton</ref> the member for Staffordshire, the other in a letter of <ref type="m" target="people.html#AbbotCharles">the ci-devant Grand Parleur</ref>,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">‘the former Great Speaker’.</note> which <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> sent me &#38; certainly nothing could be more flattering than what he said of it, that it was a Thucydidean history<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Thucydides (c. 460–c. 400 BC), <title>History of the Pelopennesian War</title> (c. 431 BC).</note> which would last as long as our country &#38; our language! – I must confess however that I am not aware of any other resemblance than what the title suggests. Tho I have always flattered myself that my other historical work<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810–1819).</note> might in more points than one <del>bear</del> &#60;be&#62; compared with Herodotus<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Herodotus (c. 484–c. 425 BC), <title>Histories</title> (c. 440 BC), usually seen as the first work of history.</note> &#38; will hereafter stand in the same relation to the history of that large portion of the new world, <del>xxx xx</del> as his work does to that of the old.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">We had an adventure this morning, which if poor Snivel<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The dog owned by Grosvenor Charles Bedford when he and Southey were boys.</note> had been living would have set up her bristles in great style. A foumart was caught in the back kitchen, – you may perhaps know it better by the name of polecat. It <del>was</del> &#60;is&#62; the first I ever saw or smelt, &#38; certainly it was in high odour. Poor Snivel! I &#60;still&#62; have <del>xx</del> the hairs which we cut from her tail thirty years ago; – &#38; if it were the fashion for men to wear lockets, in a locket they should be worn, for I never had a greater respect for any creature upon four legs than for poor Sni. – See how naturally men fall into relic-worship; – when I have preserved the memorials of that momentary whim so many years, – &#38; thro so many removals!</p>
