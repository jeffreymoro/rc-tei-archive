        <p rend="indent1"> Since I heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> that the hooping cough had appeared at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>, I have neither heard of, nor from you. Hoping however that all may be going on well, I write now concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edwards</ref> journey, that you may determine upon his plan of operations.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The surest, shortest &amp; easiest mode of conveyance, is to take the mail, which will bring him in six &amp; thirty hours from <ref type="m" target="places.html#BullandMouth">the Bull &amp; Mouth</ref> to Penrith; where he will find another mail ready to start for <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> when he has breakfasted. In that case it is at <ref type="m" target="places.html#BullandMouth">the Bull &amp; Mouth</ref> that the place must be taken, &amp; in the Carlisle Mail. There is another Carlisle mail at some other Inn which would carry him round by Manchester &amp; Kendal &amp; delay him two or three hours at the former place.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">If the fatigue of travelling two nights successively is thought too much, there day coaches from London to Birmingham thence to Manchester, &amp; thence again to Kendal, &#8211; from whence there is a morning coach to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> every day except Sunday. In this he would arrive here at 11 o clock on the fourth morning, after travelling three whole days. The former plan brings him to his journeys end on the second morning at 12, after travelling two nights &amp; a day: &#8211; &amp; it must be remembered that the three whole days begin early, &#8211; &amp; are indeed days &amp; quarters. &#8211; If he can sleep, or even doze in a coach, it will save as much fatigue as time to come by the mail.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref> are looking for him with some impatience, &amp; I can assure him that he will not despise them as companions upon the mountains.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My cold I hope has nearly run its career. There are very little remains of the cough, &amp; I am about to begin upon a tonic course this day. The attack this year has been so serious, that if it be possible, I will endeavour to escape it by flying next season before the time of its usual return.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  We have heard of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</ref> arrival on the Devonshire coast, &#8211; where <del>xx</del> it is to be hoped she will wear out more shoes upon the shore than in ball-rooms.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should like you to see <ref type="m" target="people.html#JebbJohn">the Bp of Limericks</ref> speech upon the state of the Irish Church, &#8211; which he sent me last week. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CadellThomas">Cadell</ref> is the publisher.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Speech Delivered in the House of Peers, Thursday, June 10 1824: on the Occasion of the Third Reading of the Irish Tithe Composition Amendment Bill. By John, Lord Bishop of Limerick</title> (1824). This was a prolonged defence of the Anglican Church of Ireland.</note> A more temperate &amp; convincing refutation of misrepresentations &amp; calumnies could not be desired. It is quite worthy of the man. I am told he is to have the first Irish Archbishoprick, I heartily wish it were Canterbury instead.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Jebb did not become an archbishop, in Ireland or England.</note> But the Ministry however well they may wish to act in the disposal of church preferment, are not yet ashamed of making undeserved promotions. That to Chichester has been such: <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Carr (1774&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), a close friend of George IV, whom Carr came to know when he was Vicar of Brighton 1804&#8211;1824. The King ensured that Carr was showered with ecclesiastical preferments, including the posts of Bishop of Chichester 1824&#8211;1831 and Bishop of Worcester 1831&#8211;1841.</note> &#8211; that of the D of Ch. Ch to Durham absolutely a scandalous one.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Henry Hall (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>), Dean of Christ Church, Oxford 1809&#8211;1824, was installed as Dean of Durham on 26 February 1824.</note>

Just at that point he fell into a long &amp; profound sleep, awoke refreshed, &amp; continued from that time to amend. The last news I heard of him was that he was going that day to dine with his physician, <ref type="m" target="people.html#KiddJohn">Kidd</ref> however takes no credit for the cure, which seems to have been wholly Natures.
