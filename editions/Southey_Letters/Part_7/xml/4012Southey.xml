<salute>My dear Harry</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I have just received the Portugueze MSS. for which I beg you will make my acknowledgements in due form to the Ambassador when you see him.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Cristóvão Pedro de Morais Sarmento, 1st Viscount of Torre de Moncorvo (1788–1851), a Portuguese diplomat. He served in the Portuguese Embassy in London for nearly forty years and was briefly chargé d’affaires in 1822. His brother, Alexandre Tomás de Morais Sarmento, 1st Viscount of Banho (1786–1840), was also a diplomat. Both men had served as volunteers in a Portuguese force raised in Coimbra which had defended the Vouga river against a French army in 1809. Alexandre Sarmento had written an account of this campaign which had been forwarded to Southey. Southey needed this material for his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> And if you say that I will carefully return the mss. you may find out whether it is intended that I should keep it, in which case I shall gladly bestow a binding upon it, &#38; add it to my collection. I have looked into it enough to see that it is well written, – &#38; beyond all doubt it will be of great use to me. I wish I were at work upon it. But I am staked down to the book upon which not my ways &#38; means alone, but <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</ref> also for his expedition, are dependent.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824). Tom Southey was considering emigrating to Canada and Southey feared he would have to contribute to the costs of this venture.</note></p>
               <p rend="indent1">The printer<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Roworth (c. 1765–1851), a printer based at Bell-yard, Temple Bar, London.</note> is getting on rapidly, &#38; so am I, being 9 or 10 sheets ahead of him. His next sheet compleats the first volume. If the latter part should please me as well as what is done, the book I think must prove an interesting one, &#38; I hope to wind up well with a chapter enquiring into what has been <hi rend="ital">lost</hi> by the Reformation, &#38; the present state of the Church.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this conclusion.</note></p>
                  <p rend="indent1">I am in fear about my cyder, – it ought long ago to have made its appearance.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Nicholas Lightfoot had arranged to send Southey some barrels of cider as a gift.</note> –</p>
            <p rend="indent1">What is become of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> &#38; the Review?<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), ‘Histoire de la Théophilantropie, depuis sa Naissance jusqu’à son Extinction’, part of Grégoire’s <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title>, 2 vols (Paris, 1814), II, pp. 55–171, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 493–536, published 8 July 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> A matter this of some consequence to me who look for an hundred pounds upon its publication, &#38; have masons at work: – upon my landlords account indeed, but to be paid by me out of my rent. We are building outhouses, &#38; repairing the house within &#38; without.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Undoubtedly you are right about <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, for she has complained of rheumatism all the winter. We are going on well thank God. I am heartily glad that your wheels seem to answer. For myself I have kept in condition thro the winter, which is attributable perhaps to a freer diet in some degree, coming in aid of exercise &#38; assisting the digestive processes. And I am in good working condition, &#38; in good humour with my work – - A little more solicitous about ways &#38; means perhaps than I used to be, – when younger, – not however over anxious.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Mary Calvert<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Calvert (1804–1890), daughter of William Calvert.

She is visiting Miss Stanger,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Hannah Stanger (1799–1867), daughter of James Stanger. She did not marry John Mitchinson Calvert.</note> upon whom I suspect <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertJohnM">her brother John</ref> has fixed his intentions. He had no sinecure in attending her on Saddleback.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I wish I could fix the time of my departure – Alas I am but in bloody Q Marys reign!<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary I (1516–1558; Queen of England 1553–1558; <title>DNB</title>). Her reign was covered in <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 141–251. It took a further 277 pages for Southey to cover the Church settlement of 1559, the Civil War and the English Republic (1642–1660), the Revolution of 1688 and the refusal of the nonjurors within the Church to accept that Revolution. He did not leave home until 3 November 1823.</note> after which comes the settlement of the Ch – its overthrow, – a chapter from thence to the Revolution; – a few pages concerning the Nonjurors &#38; the last century – &#38; then the conclusion.</p>
