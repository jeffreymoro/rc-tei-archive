        <p rend="indent1">I have just received the Portugueze MSS. for which I beg you will make my acknowledgements in due form to the Ambassador when you see him.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Crist&#243;v&#227;o Pedro de Morais Sarmento, 1st Viscount of Torre de Moncorvo (1788&#8211;1851), a Portuguese diplomat. He served in the Portuguese Embassy in London for nearly forty years and was briefly charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires in 1822. His brother, Alexandre Tom&#225;s de Morais Sarmento, 1st Viscount of Banho (1786&#8211;1840), was also a diplomat. Both men had served as volunteers in a Portuguese force raised in Coimbra which had defended the Vouga river against a French army in 1809. Alexandre Sarmento had written an account of this campaign which had been forwarded to Southey. Southey needed this material for his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> And if you say that I will carefully return the mss. you may find out whether it is intended that I should keep it, in which case I shall gladly bestow a binding upon it, &amp; add it to my collection. I have looked into it enough to see that it is well written, &#8211; &amp; beyond all doubt it will be of great use to me. I wish I were at work upon it. But I am staked down to the book upon which not my ways &amp; means alone, but <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</ref> also for his expedition, are dependent.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824). Tom Southey was considering emigrating to Canada and Southey feared he would have to contribute to the costs of this venture.</note>

His next sheet compleats the first volume. If the latter part should please me as well as what is done, the book I think must prove an interesting one, &amp; I hope to wind up well with a chapter enquiring into what has been <hi rend="ital">lost</hi> by the Reformation, &amp; the present state of the Church.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this conclusion.</note>

The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> A matter this of some consequence to me who look for an hundred pounds upon its publication, &amp; have masons at work: &#8211; upon my landlords account indeed, but to be paid by me out of my rent. We are building outhouses, &amp; repairing the house within &amp; without.</p>

We are going on well thank God. I am heartily glad that your wheels seem to answer. For myself I have kept in condition thro the winter, which is attributable perhaps to a freer diet in some degree, coming in aid of exercise &amp; assisting the digestive processes. And I am in good working condition, &amp; in good humour with my work &#8211; - A little more solicitous about ways &amp; means perhaps than I used to be, &#8211; when younger, &#8211; not however over anxious.</p>

It took a further 277 pages for Southey to cover the Church settlement of 1559, the Civil War and the English Republic (1642&#8211;1660), the Revolution of 1688 and the refusal of the nonjurors within the Church to accept that Revolution.
