           <p rend="indent1"> I have been applied to by Lady Malet,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), an artist and the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>). Southey had travelled south from Keswick to London with her in November 1823, and Edith May Southey was staying at Lady Malet’s London house.</note> whom I should most gladly serve if I could, – to ask if you can assist an arrangement which she has in view</p>

He rose to be Lieutenant-Colonel of this regiment and was killed in action in the Anglo-Persian War 1856–1857.</note> went to Bombay in January last as an Infantry Cadet.

Morris was also a poet, whose ‘The Griffin’ (1821) achieved some fame in India.</note> has assured her that if she can prevail on any one to give him a Cavalry appointment, that person will get his present Infantry Cadetcy. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morris will return to him the first Cavalry appointment which falls to his lot after his re election in April, in exchange for an Infantry one. – If I understand the case, what is requested is the loan of a Cavalry appointment – subject to the chances of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morris’s life &#38; re election. What those chances may be you must know better than I can do, &#38; whether you can render this service to a very estimable family.</p>
