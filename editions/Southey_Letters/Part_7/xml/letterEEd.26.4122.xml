        <p rend="indent1">Here I am after a wide circuit in which among other rememberable occurrences we overturned two men &amp; a woman in a market cart, &#8211; &amp; dropt a passenger from the outside, without any other harm done than leaving a law suit between the Cart &amp; the Stage Coach. I sleep at Winchester tomorrow night &amp; proceed to town by the day coach on Wednesday &#8211; to leave it for Norwich on Friday evening. I shall look for you on Thursday, if the day be fair &amp; probably bring in my pocket the Dedication to the Czar<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824) was not dedicated to Alexander I (1777&#8211;1825; Emperor of Russia 1801&#8211;1825), but to Southey&#8217;s old friend Peter Elmsley.</note>
          <del>xxx</del> in the proof sheet. You perhaps can tell me whether I have there given him his proper titles. The Book<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> (Laus Deo)<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Praise be to God&#8217;.</note> is finished. I put the last hand to it at Crediton, &amp; found the last proofs here. It is I think the best chance I have yet had in the Lottery, &amp; will go far toward my ways &amp; means for a year or two to come. My bargain is for half the profits of the first edition, two thirds of all succeeding ones. And should it obtain a regular demand like certain histories, the eventual profit may by possibility amount to something considerable, &amp; I may get a larger sum for the copyright some years hence than would be given me now.</p>
