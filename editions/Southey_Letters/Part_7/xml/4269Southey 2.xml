        <p rend="indent1">A frightful circumstance has happened at the Island.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Derwent Island, home of William Peachy.</note> One of the servant was taken ill on Saturday &amp; died the next morning. &#8211; A very fine young woman, Stoddard by name,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified beyond the information given here.</note> who once lived with the Townshends.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly the family of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TownshendChauncyHare">Chauncey Hare Townshend</ref>.</note> I do not remember her.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A great shock to <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">the poor General</ref>. &#8211; He has shown great feeling for us at this time; &#8211; &amp; if I had had no regard for him before, I should now love him as long as I live. &#8211; But I already knew his real worth. &#8211; You are likely to see him in the course of the winter.</p>
        <p rend="center">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Have they told you that Haec is no longer <hi rend="ital">declined</hi>, but actually <hi rend="ital">conjugated</hi>?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Hic&#8217; is a Latin word meaning &#8216;this&#8217;, which declines (i.e. has its endings altered depending on its place in a sentence) as &#8216;Hic, Haec, Hoc&#8217;. Conjugation refers to the differing forms taken by Latin verbs. Southey&#8217;s joke here is obscure but may refer to the fact that a person known to him and Edith May Southey had ceased to &#8216;decline&#8217; an offer of marriage, and decided to &#8216;conjugate&#8217;, i.e. to marry.</note>
