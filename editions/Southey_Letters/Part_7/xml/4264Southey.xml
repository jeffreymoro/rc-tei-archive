        <p rend="indent1">  My employments, thank Heaven, are such that they allow me to be always at leisure; &amp; this is a blessing which would compensate for more untoward circumstances than have fallen to my lot: &#8211; so great a one indeed, that if I had sold my time for any official situation, I verily believe I should have been as uncomfortable as poor Peter Schlemil when he had parted with his shadow.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Schlemihl, the main character in Adelbert von Chamisso (1781&#8211;1838), <title>Peter Schlemihls Wundersame Geschichte</title> (1814). He sold his shadow to the Devil for a bottomless wallet, only to find himself shunned by society.</note> But if I were busier than I am, or ever shall be, it would always give me pleasure to receive a letter from you. I believe we can all of us find time for what we like.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">

The book will not be the less welcome for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert&#8217;s</ref> sake, who having some three years ago when <ref type="m" target="people.html#BellAndrew">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell</ref> asked him whether he would chuse to be an Archbishop or a Carpenter, preferred the Archbishoprick, verily looked upon Canterbury afterwards as his allotted portion in this world, &amp; used to talk with great complacency of what he should do when he came to live at Lambeth, where he was to have more books than his father. &#8211; He was ill enough to make us very anxious about a fortnight ago, &#8211; with a bilious fever, &#8211; but thank God he has perfectly recovered from it; &#8211; &amp; at present we are all well. I have been somewhat seriously an invalid during the summer: the cough however has fairly departed, &amp; being once more in tolerable condition, I am taking all dutiful pains to keep myself so.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had neither seen nor heard of the foolish apology for <ref type="m" target="people.html#OpieAmelia">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Opie</ref>, which is enough to shame her out of Quakerism.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified. At this time, rumours were beginning to circulate that Amelia Opie had become a Quaker, for example, in the <title>York Herald</title>, 19 June 1824. In fact, she had only begun to investigate this possibility and did not join the Quakers until August 1825.</note> Without the aid of Cupid<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Roman god of love. Mary Anne Watts Hughes had suggested that Amelia Opie&#8217;s conversion to Quakerism was inspired by her love for a Quaker.</note> (who however has worked many conversions in both sexes) I can account very satisfactorily for her becoming a Quaker. She was bred <del>up</del> nominally in Unitarianism, &amp; that too of the laxest kind; &#8211; &amp; it was but nominally, &#8211; for her father<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">James Alderson (1742&#8211;1825), a Norwich surgeon and physician.</note> belonged to that sect only because it was necessary <del>for</del> &lt;that&gt; a man in his profession should remain to be of some religion. She grew up when revolutionary opinions were taking their freest course, &amp; in a city where I believe they prevailed more than in any other part of England. Some of her warmest admirers (<del>few</del> &lt;&amp;&gt; no woman had more) were far gone in unbelief, they were men of splendid talents &amp; in other respects of great real worth.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Amelia Opie&#8217;s early admirers included the radical writers William Godwin and Thomas Holcroft (1745&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>).</note> In fact she has always lived among persons whose speculations were under no restraint, &amp; who however much they differed among themselves, agreed in that rooted dislike to the Establishment, which is a bond of union between the darkest bigots of Popery, the wildest fanatics, &amp; the most thorough infidels. In the state of mind which such circumstances could hardly fail of producing upon a woman who had always been flattered for her talents, &lt;but with a lively fancy &amp; a good heart&gt; <ref type="m" target="people.html#OpieAmelia">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Opie</ref> from <del>her</del> a life of gayety in London, went at the age of about forty five to nurse her father,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Amelia Opie devoted herself to nursing her father from the time of his illness in December 1820. She was then fifty-one years old.</note> whom in his old age, severe bodily infirmity had awakened to some sense of the <hi rend="ital">profligacy</hi> of his past life. The only persons in her circle at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref> who had any warmth of religious feeling were Quakers; &#8211; &amp; were you to <del>see</del> &lt;know&gt; her Quaker Abelard you would see that <del>Elo</del> few Eloisa&#8217;s<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Abelard (1079&#8211;1142), a celebrated scholar and monk who conducted a clandestine affair with Heloise (d. 1164). The &#8216;Quaker Abelard&#8217; was probably <ref type="m" target="people.html#GurneyJosephJohn">Joseph John Gurney</ref>, the Norwich banker and leading Quaker, who was a close friend of Amelia Opie and instrumental in her conversion.</note> were to be trusted with him. But whatever her feelings toward him may be, she wanted something more for her imagination &amp; her heart than the cold forms &amp; colder creed of Unitarianism can supply, &#8211; &amp; Quakerism has a great deal for both. &#8211; I believe she is sincere, &#8211; &amp; I like her well enough even to excuse the verses which she has written in <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Ediths</ref> &#8211; Album.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Amelia Opie had written a verse in Edith May&#8217;s album, when she and her father had left Norwich on 30 January 1824, which had likened Southey to a swan and Edith May to a cygnet: &#8216;and see thee, fam&#8217;d Swan of the Derwent&#8217;s fair tide/ With that elegant cygnet that floats by thy side&#8217; (John Wood Warter, <title>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</title>, 4 vols (London, 1856), III, p. 435).</note>

        <p rend="indent1">  Your friendly message to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Edith</ref> shall not be forgotten.
