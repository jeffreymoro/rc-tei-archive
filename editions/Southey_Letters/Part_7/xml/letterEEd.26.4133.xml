        <p rend="indent1"> A few hurried lines in the midst of all the joy, &lt;dirt&gt;, &amp; discomfort of packing, hammering, cording &amp;c &#8211; . Thank you for the purse, &#8211; tho it was a dangerous inclosure, &amp; might have been (perhaps <hi rend="ital">ought</hi> to have been) stabbed at the Post Office, as coming from a part of the coast noted for smuggling. Remember that <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> frank will not cover more than two ounces.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you also for both your little poems; &#8211; the sea one I think will suit <ref type="m" target="people.html#PettetAlfred">the poor petitioners</ref> purpose well.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles had offered to contribute &#8216;The Mariner&#8217;s Hymn&#8217; from <title>Solitary Hours</title> (London, 1826), pp. 22&#8211;24, to Alfred Pettet&#8217;s <title>Original Sacred Music</title> (London, n.d., c. 1825&#8211;1827), though it was eventually rejected and replaced by &#8216;I weep, but not rebellious tears&#8217;, later published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment.

But I will examine the whole &amp; see whether in any word it can be improved, &#8211; for be assured that little piece will take its place with Grays Elegy &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert Knowles&#8217;s</ref>

        <p rend="indent1"> So little rest have I had since I left you that my portfolio goes home full of unanswered letters. I will write with my first leisure to you about the irregular blank verse.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The metre to be used in Bowles and Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Robin Hood&#8217; and based on that in Southey&#8217;s <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).

You shall see one of these days what I say of that tempestuous age, &#8211; few persons but those who have lived in it can conceive or comprehend what the morning of the French Revolution was, nor <del>xxx</del> what a visionary world seemed to open upon those who were just entering it. Old things seemed passing away, &amp; nothing was dreamt of but the regeneration of the human race. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You asked about my bust. Smith in Upper Norton Street has the mould, &amp; casts may always be had there.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">A bust of Southey had been sculpted in 1813 by James Smith (1775&#8211;1815). Smith&#8217;s business was carried on by his sons, Charles Raymond Smith (c. 1798&#8211;1888) and Thomas Smith (b. 1800) at 57 Upper Norton Street.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have no time for more. Sunday, thank God, I shall be at home, &#8211; &amp; if I find all well, shall be truly happy. Yet I depart with a heavier feeling than I ever took from London before, for it is not likely that I shall ever seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> again. He is very infirm, &#8211; more so than might even be expected at 74. Last night I went to assist him into his carriage, &amp; before he had driven off, or I had re entered the door, some men past between us, bearing a coffin. Mere accident as it was I wish it had not occurred for it must have effected him as it did me.</p>
