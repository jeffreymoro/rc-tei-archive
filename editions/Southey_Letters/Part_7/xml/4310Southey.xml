               Dating note: This letter was written in 1824 at an unknown point after Southey returned to Keswick on 15 February. It possibly belongs to later in the year, after the departure of the annual crop of visitors provided Southey with more time to devote to his writing for money and for pleasure. We have therefore placed it at the end of the year. </note></head>

            <p rend="indent1"> <del>When</del> It <del>consider</del> &#60;has often occurred to me&#62; of how much present interest &#38; future advantage it would be <del>to every respectable family</del> if a domestic chronicle <del>of every thing which concerns it</del> were duly kept in every respectable family, comprizing not only such events as are usually registered in a blank leaf of the family bible, but every thing which concerns the interests of any of its members, &#38; also all &#60;those&#62; great little <del>event</del> affairs which are in private life, what wars &#38; changes of ministry <del>xxxxx xxxxx</del> are to a nation. In the course of a few generations such a record would be invaluable, &#38; would justly be considered as the most precious of all heir–looms. Now tho it is far too late in life for <del>th</del> me to commence a register of this kind, <del>I am disposed for</del> there is one portion of it which may be supplied by recollection, imperfectly indeed, but sufficiently to preserve from entire forgetfulness things in themselves as worthy of remembrance as nine tenths of the battles, intrigues &#60;broils &#38;&#62; mutations <del>of which</del> whereof history is composed. And therefore I sit down to compose as faithfully as my memory enables me a chronicle of the great little events which have occurred at <ref type="m" target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref> since the birth of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">that daughter</ref> who was declared to be as ugly as a Dodo.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. since 1804. Southey took up residence in Greta Hall the previous year. For Southey’s description of his newborn daughter as ‘ugly as a young dodo’, see Southey to John Rickman, [1] May 1804, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Three</title>, Letter 933.</note> </p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The top of the house at that time was flat, &#38; covered with pitched cloths &#38; a slight sprinkling of fine gravel. One morning about half an hour before our usual time of rising, <del>my</del> &#60;our&#62; bed room door was opened &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> said dont be frightened but get up as fast as you can, the house is on fire! – For the purpose of stopping a flaw in the roof a pitch kettle had been put on the fire in the back kitchen, – &#38; had boiled over. Luckily help was at hand, there was nothing very combustible near, &#38; the flames were presently extinguished. </p>

Part Three</title>, Letter 979.</note> It was discovered by his telling his mother that he had eaten her two yellow shillings. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs C.</ref> came in great <del>xxxx</del> alarm to communicate it to me &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother Henry</ref> then a student of medicine &#38; Doctor–in–rus.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Doctor in the countryside’.</note> I remarked that this was <del>xxxx</del> work for a gold finder, – &#38; the Student in medicine offered to farm the patient at half a crown a day, or sixpence a time, till the money should be recovered, – &#38; moreover to be at all the expence of recovering it. Her fears were considerably relieved by this <del>xxxx</del> proposal, which however was not accepted. The money after making the grand tour of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwents</ref> interior came into the world again next day </p>
           <p rend="indent1"> All the maids eloped <del>xxx</del> because I had turned a man out of the kitchen at eleven o clock on the preceding night. One of them was readmitted on the petition of her brother &#38; her own acknowledgment of her fault. The wages of the other two up to that day were calculated, &#38; distributed to the poor as forfeited by their misconduct<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">This incident probably occurred in 1808: see the reference to the engagement of three new maids in Southey to Thomas Southey, 11 July 1808, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

Part Three</title>, Letter 980.</note> The garden had not then been made, &#38; when John was called he would come galloping from the end of the field, braying for joy, &#38; put his head in at the parlour window for a piece of bread at breakfast. Sometimes he walked into the room for it. As it was not possible to prevent the boys of this disorderly little town from abusing this poor Donkey we were obliged to part with it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SpeddingJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Spedding</ref> bought it; – &#38; a few years afterward it died a natural death in the church yard; – but I apprehend of disease, &#38; not of old age. </p>

           <p rend="indent1"> Another misfortune among the Maids. </p>
           <p rend="indent1"> A frost of four days accompanied with fog &#38; a dead calm, produced the most beautiful rime I ever beheld. Every branch, bough &#38; twig of every tree was fringed with it, &#38; it stood upon the boughs inch-long. No orchard in full blossom <del>was ever</del> could be more beautiful, – but it was like a scene of enchantment, – like a grove of silver trees in a subterranean world, which had a light of its own, – for neither sun nor sky were visible. On the fifth day the sun prevailed, the fog brightened &#38; drew up, &#38; in the course of two or three minutes the whole magical beauty of the scene had melted away. But the sight while it lasted, &#38; the sudden transformation (more sudden than any natural change I ever before witnessed, being indeed as compleat as any scenic change in a pantomime), were things never to be forgotten. </p>

           <p rend="indent1"> In the dead of the night we were awakened by hearing the kitchen window which is under our bedroom smashed in, – &#38; this was followed by a similar crash in <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilsons</ref> bedroom. This was the greatest little event that ever befel us. In one minute all the household were in the long passage, – each running to the other to know what was the matter. I fired out of the window, – but in time only to let the culprits know that fire arms were kept ready. The next morning it was ascertained that a salted leg of mutton had been used as the instrument of mischief, – a piece of the fat adhering to the broken glass – the frames as well as windows were broken. We ascertained from which public house the drunken rioters had sallied, but nothing more. The Magistrates however met, &#38; the Public houses were threatened unless they kept better hours. I sent the cryer round to give notice that if any persons were found late at night about these premises they must <hi rend="ital">take the consequences</hi>.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">An autograph version of the note Southey gave to the town crier is preserved in Victoria University Library, Toronto, Coleridge Collection. It reads as follows: ‘Whereas a gate on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey’s premises has been repeatedly broken down, &#38; was broken on Sunday last at noon day; &#38; whereas his larder was robbed on &#60;Saturday or Sunday night, of a piece of salted beef, &#38; other provisions&#62;; this is to give notice that twenty shillings reward will be given to any person giving information upon which the offenders may be apprehended. And all persons are warned from trespassing upon those premises. If found there by day they will be prosecuted; &#38; if by night, they must take the consequences.’</note> Upon this it was debated at the Public Houses whether or not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> S. had a right to shoot any body for coming about his house in the dark. I heard of this notable discussion &#38; desired it might be made known, that if any body chose under such circumstances to stand fire, I would stand the law.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">This incident probably occurred in 1811–1812; see Southey to [John Spedding], 27 March 1811, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.
