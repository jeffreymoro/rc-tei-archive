        <p rend="indent1"> These are combustible sheets, &amp; yet I do not see any thing which it is necessary to strike out.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was helping to censor Walter Savage Landor&#8217;s <title>Imaginary Conversations</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824) for publication. This section dealt with Dialogue V, I, pp. 55&#8211;65, between Oliver Cromwell (1599&#8211;1658; Lord Protector 1653&#8211;1658; <title>DNB</title>) and &#8216;Walter Noble&#8217;, Landor&#8217;s misnaming of his own ancestor, Michael Noble (1591&#8211;1649), MP for Lichfield 1640&#8211;1649. Their debate centred on whether Charles I (1600&#8211;1649; King of Great Britain 1625&#8211;1649; <title>DNB</title>) should be executed.</note> It does not strike me that any stroke is intended against the Old Testament:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Cromwell&#8217;s arguments made use of Old Testament allusions, including &#8216;if Moses and his prophets commanded me to this villainy, I would draw back and mount my horse&#8217; (Landor, <title>Imaginary Conversations</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. 59&#8211;60).</note> allusions in the same spirit might be made by very religious men, &amp; are in fact often found in such writers as Fuller, South &amp; Warburton.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Fuller (1608&#8211;1661; <title>DNB</title>), Robert South (1634&#8211;1716; <title>DNB</title>) and William Warburton (1698&#8211;1779; <title>DNB</title>), Anglican controversialists, historians and theologians.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The argument in favour of tyrannicide may pass without danger. It is a question which in former times was regularly mooted in schools &amp; Colleges; &#8211; &amp; were I to declaim upon it, I should take <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landors</ref> side of the question, &#8211; tho altogether opposed to his &lt;intended&gt; application of it. &#8211; But as he speaks only in generalities I would not expunge so fine a passage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> That speech of Cromwells he instanced in a letter to me, as a specimen of the manner in which (where it was possible) he endeavoured to make his characters think &amp; express themselves, as they would have thought &amp; spoken. &#8211; Will it not be sufficient to print it thus &#8211; In the name of the Lord, I will &#8212;&#8212; upon these firebrands.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">This line was printed as: &#8216;In the name of the Lord, I must piss upon these firebrands before I can make them tractable&#8217; (Landor, <title>Imaginary Conversations</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, p. 60).</note> &amp; then no one will be surprized into reading the word aloud. I do not object to the manner in which the sentence begins because it is thoroughly characteristic, &amp; every reader will perceive that it is so.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> From Wednesday till Monday next I shall be at the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> N. Lightfoot&#8217;s</ref>, Crediton, Devonshire. <del>Thex</del> After that day not stationary any where till the 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> when I hope to return to London for 48 hours.</p>
