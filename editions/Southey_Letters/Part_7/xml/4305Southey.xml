I have a great liking for him, &amp; great hopes of him. &#8211; There was an article in the Courier<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;To the Editor of the Courier&#8217;, <title>Courier</title>, 18 December 1824, and signed &#8216;H.T.&#8217;</note> by him (which I have not seen) in reply to that atrocious &amp; beastly libel in the M Chronicle.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey versus Lord Byron&#8217;, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 17 December 1824. Southey considered taking action against the newspaper but did not do so.</note> That libel I have referred to <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, to deal with, or leave alone as he may deem expedient; but if our laws are good for anything, I think he will notice it, in the only way which it ought to be noticed by prosecuting a paper villainous enough to publish it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My letter has been inserted in Blackwoods Magazine with an introduction in the true Blackwood style, bepraising both <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Byron</ref> &amp; me, talking nonsense about both, &amp; praising the composition of the letter as a masterpiece in its kind.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Southey and Byron&#8217;, <title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title>, 16 (December 1824), 711&#8211;715.</note> The remarkable thing in this, is the forwardness with which that Magazine is got ready, &amp; the promptude with which it is carried. My letter was published on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
          <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 8 December 1824, Letter 4289, published 13 December 1824.</note> it could not reach Edinburgh till the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &#8211; it is not the last article in the Magazine which is not to be published till New Years day, yet the Magazine is printed, sent to London for <ref type="m" target="people.html#FreelingFrancis">Francis Freelings</ref> frank, &amp; reaches me by that account on the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. The Scotch manage these things better than their neighbours.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  The transfer of the QR to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> is to me a matter of great satisfaction on all accounts.
