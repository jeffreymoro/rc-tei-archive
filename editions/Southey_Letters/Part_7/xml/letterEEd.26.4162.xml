        <p rend="indent1"> You remember <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">your Uncle Henrys</ref> report that the Ventriloquist was coming with a letter of introduction from <ref type="m" target="people.html#BilderdijkWillem">a Dutchman</ref>, whose wife was translating Roderick into Dutch.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexandre Vattemare (1796&#8211;1864), a celebrated French ventriloquist, who used the stage name &#8216;Monsieur Alexandre&#8217;. The introduction was from Willem Bilderdijk, whose wife, Katherina Bilderdijk, n&#233;e Schweickhardt (1776&#8211;1830) had translated Southey&#8217;s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814) into Dutch as <title>Rodrigo de Goth, Konig van Spanje</title> (1823&#8211;1824), no. 2701 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, where it was described as &#8216;<hi rend="ital">red morocco, gilt leaves</hi>&#8217;; see Southey to William Peachy, 23 August 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

He is a very old man, having been known as a poet he tells me sixty years; &#8211; the wife is probably much younger as he <del>xxx</del> says they have been married a quarter of a century &amp; more.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Bilderdijk was only 63 years old at this time, but he was a chronic hypochondriac. His first poem was published in 1776 and his first major publication was the anonymous verse collection <title>Mijn Verlustiging</title> (1781), so his fame as a poet dated back 43 years, rather than the 60 years that Southey assumed to be the case. Bilderdijk and Schweickhardt married in 1802, but had lived together since 1797.</note> Her name is Katharina Wilhelmina Bilderdijk, &amp; she dedicates the translation to me, in a very good ode.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
