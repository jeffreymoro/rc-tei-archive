        <p rend="indent1">Fortune, I think, has fitted you with a physician<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Jacques (d. 1832), a doctor based in Harrogate.</note> to your taste. He has <hi rend="ital">tabooed</hi> ham, vinegar, red&#8211;herrings, and all fruits. But if the melancholy Jaques<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Melancholy Jaques&#8217;, a character in <title>As You Like It</title> (1599).</note> were not a heretic, he would never have put you to a trial so far beyond the strength of women. If Eve, when she had the choice of the whole garden besides (a garden, too, as rich in fruits as William Herbert&#8217;s,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Herbert (1778&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>). He abandoned a career in politics and the law for the Church of England, serving as Rector of Spofforth, near Wetherby, 1814&#8211;1840, and Dean of Manchester 1840&#8211;1847. Herbert was also a poet and a noted writer on botany. His garden at the Old Rectory, Spofforth, was well known and the site of Herbert&#8217;s development of the Spofforth crocus.</note> which you have been visiting, is in flowers), could not refrain from the forbidden apple,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In <title>Genesis</title> 3, Eve, the first woman, was tempted to eat the forbidden fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The fruit was usually identified as an apple.</note> how does he suppose that a daughter of Eve can resist strawberries, cherries, and currants, to say nothing of green gooseberries and hard pears?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your second letter arrived to&#8211;day, and <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> has it at Mrs. Calvert&#8217;s,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Calvert (c. 1775&#8211;1834), n&#233;e Mitchinson, the wife of William Calvert.</note> whither she is gone for the remainder of the week. I have not much to tell you. The boat is in the water, and looks very well; the pew<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The Southey family&#8217;s pew at St Kentigern&#8217;s church, Crosthwaite.</note> was painted yesterday; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">your uncle Tom</ref> has lost a cow, in calf&#8211;bed; sundry rats have been taken; I expect a parcel by the next carrier, and your plant is as well as can be expected; whereby you will understand that there is an addition to its leaves. But this new leaf has been produced in a curious manner, the stem proceeding from the base of the youngest and largest of its three ancestors, and all the folded part from the mother, or middle one; so that its genealogy is more puzzling than the relationship between Dick and John.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Dick and John&#8217; were commonly used for fictional characters, including by Southey himself in his Botany Bay Eclogue, &#8216;John, Samuel, &amp; Richard&#8217;, <title>Poems</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp. 92&#8211;98.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I am glad you take so kindly to the waters, and that they seem to agree with you so well. What a happy quarter of an hour you must pass between the two draughts!
