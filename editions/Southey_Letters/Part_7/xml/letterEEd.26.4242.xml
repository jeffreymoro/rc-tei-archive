        <p rend="indent1">  I have got about again, after an ailment which threatened to lay me on the sofa, &amp; keep me there. Thank God I am able again to take exercise &amp; to a considerable extent, with little inconvenience, &amp; sometimes without any. This I shall endeavor to keep up thro the winter, &amp; when the spring advances, if it be possible for me to leave home, I will take a journey, as the only chance of avoiding a yearly attack that becomes every year more serious. Most probably it will be to visit <ref type="m" target="people.html#JebbJohn">the Bp of Limerick</ref> who would fain have taken me with him to Ireland about ten days ago.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My Ways &amp; Means are sorely deranged by <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, who has not inserted an article of mine upon Hayleys life in this number.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of John Johnson (1769&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263&#8211;311. Southey had hoped that it might appear in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (January 1824), published 28 August 1824.</note> I have had no intimation why it has been delayed, &#8211; certainly not as being too late for insertion, for I corrected the proofs more than two months ago. I am even half inclined to suspect an intention of rejecting it, because without eulogizing Hayley in the slightest degree beyond his deserts, it touches lightly on his faults, &amp; treats him as a scholar &amp; a gentleman ought to be treated. This remains to be seen, &#8211; meantime I pray you assist me with a supply.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">   Almost &#8211; I begin to despair of seeing you, &#8211; &amp; yet to see you would do me good at this time, &amp; you would be the better for the visit. I have some rich veins of nonsense which you might assist me in working.</p>

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward Hill</ref> is passing his holydays with me. The blow on the nose which he received from <ref type="m" target="people.html#PhillimoreJoseph">Phillimores</ref> son<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John George Phillimore (1808&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>), eldest surviving son of Joseph Phillimore. Like his father, he was educated at Westminster School (1817&#8211;1824) and Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1828, MA 1831). In later life he was variously a Clerk at the Board of Control 1827&#8211;1832, a barrister and a Liberal MP for Leominster 1852&#8211;1857. In 1820 Phillimore had passed &#8216;The Challenge&#8217; examination and became one of 40 King&#8217;s Scholars at Westminster. They had their own house known as &#8216;College&#8217; and considerable privileges, including the right to proceed to closed scholarships at Trinity College, Cambridge, or Christ Church, Oxford. Edward Hill was also a member of &#8216;College&#8217;.</note> in one of his fits of passion, has destroyed <del>xxxx</del> his sense of smell, &amp; affected his breathing &amp; his speech. And this was a second act of brutal tyranny, after a first which had endangered his life.</p>

Is it possible to conceive any thing more injudicious than this? If men are born rhymers let them be so, but I am sure there is no necessity of training them to it</p>
