        <p rend="indent1">that the packages arrived on Tuesday last, &amp; that the tunic &amp; trowsers produced a most extraordinary metamorphosis in <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>. He declared that he must now leave off all his childish ways, he kept his hands in his pockets, as if that were the main purpose for which hands were <del>xx</del> intended: &amp; having unawares given me a kiss after tea, he recollected himself, reddened to think of the impropriety into which he had been betrayed, &amp; exclaimed in a quick tone, half anger, half mortification, &#8211; Oh, but I&#8217;ve left off kissing! For your comfort however I may assure you that the tunic &amp; trowsers are quietly put away for high days &amp; holydays, &amp; that he no longer insists upon the decorums belonging to the degree which he has taken in apparel.</p>

Another change has been to fill the bookcase on the lower landing place with bound books, &#8211; which has very greatly improved its appearance</p>
