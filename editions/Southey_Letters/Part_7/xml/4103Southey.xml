I shall be with Kennaway<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet (1758&#8211;1836), made a fortune in the East India Company and became a landowner in Devonshire. Southey knew him through his son, Charles Edward Kennaway, who had visited Southey in the Lake District in 1819&#8211;1820. His home was Escot House, near Ottery St Mary, Devon.</note> on Saturday the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of Jan<hi rend="sup">y</hi>: with the Coleridges<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey stayed at Chanter&#8217;s House, Ottery St Mary, with James Coleridge (1759&#8211;1836), the father of Henry Nelson Coleridge, and Lieutenant-Colonel in the East Devon Militia. During this visit he also met many members of the Coleridge family.</note> on Sunday.

My next <del>xxx</del> &lt;point&gt; is Exeter. <del>&amp; as</del> I do not know how your respective abodes are situated with regard to that city, &amp; it would be most convenient for me to take that house last, which should bring me nearest it.

                  I was sorry not to see Lady Inglis<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Inglis, n&#233;e Biscoe (1787&#8211;1872), the wife of Sir Robert Inglis.</note> during my customary visit at Battersea Rise.
