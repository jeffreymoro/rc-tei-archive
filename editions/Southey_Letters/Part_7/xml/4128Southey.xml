        <p rend="indent1"> A fortnight has this day elapsed since I shook hands with you on my departure from Devonshire; &amp; not five minutes have I had from that hour till this in which I could sit quietly down to thank you &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lightfoot for all your kindness, to send my love to Fanny Jane, &amp; Kate, &amp; Bridget &amp; Nico,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Nicholas Lightfoot married Bridget Prideaux (1768&#8211;1856) on 13 July 1801. Their children were: John Prideaux Lightfoot; Frances Jane Lightfoot (1806&#8211;1882), Southey&#8217;s god-daughter; Catherine Anne Lightfoot (1808&#8211;1898); Bridget Mary Lightfoot (1810&#8211;1889); and Nicholas Francis Lightfoot (1811&#8211;1881), Vicar of Cadbury 1846&#8211;1855, Rector of Islip 1855&#8211;1881.</note> &#8211; &amp; to tell you with what pleasure I look back upon my visit to Crediton, &amp; think of you &amp; your happy family.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My movements since have been as punctual as they were designed to be, &amp; as prosperous as could be desired. Where I had to wait the chance of room in a stage coach, the chance always proved favourable. I made my visits at Taunton, at Earnshill, <ref type="m" target="places.html#Buckland">Buckland</ref>, &amp; Winchester,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had visited: his aunt, Mary Southey; his Westminster schoolfriend, Edward Combe; Caroline Bowles; and Elizabeth Heathcote (1773&#8211;1855) and Alethea Bigg (1777&#8211;1847), two sisters of Catherine Hill who shared a house at 12 Cathedral Close, Winchester.</note> reached London about ten o clock on the Wednesday night, took places the next morning in the Norwich mail for Friday, &amp; am now this day about to fulfil a promise made some years ago of standing Godfather to my friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Neville White&#8217;s</ref> eldest son;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Family histories, including <title>The Homes and Haunts of Henry Kirke White; with some account of the family of White, of Nottingham and Norfolk</title> (London and Nottingham, 1908), p. 260, suggest that Neville White&#8217;s first son, christened Henry Kirke White (d. 1849), was born in 1821, but this information may be inaccurate, as Southey stood as godfather to him in January 1824.</note> the said son having most conveniently made his entrance into this world about four weeks ago.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I <del>have</del> will trouble you with an easy commission respecting my forthcoming book: it is to forward the copies<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Copies of Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> intended for M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Keenan,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Frances Keenan (d. 1838), an artist and widow of the Irish portrait painter John Keenan (d. 1819). Southey had first met her in Exeter in 1799.</note> &amp; for <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrowneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wade Browne</ref>, whose direction is with the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> F. Belfield, Primly Hill near Newton.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Finney Belfield (1758&#8211;1845), a landowner and clergyman, lived at Primley Hill, Paignton, Devon.</note> They will come with yours, an arrangement whereby without increasing your <del>carr</del> cost of carriage, theirs will be lessened. &#8211; You will see that the book is dated from Crediton<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;<hi rend="ital">Crediton, Jan. 10, 1824</hi>&#8217;, <title>The Book of the Church,</title> 2 vols (London, 1824), I, p. [vii].</note> &#8211; a memorial of my visit which I was glad to have an opportunity of making. &#8211; The concluding proofs I found at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Buckland">Buckland</ref>; &#8211; the title-page &amp;c on my arrival in town. I suppose you will receive it in the course of a few days.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our places are taken for Ipswich &#8211; for Saturday afternoon next. We shall reach <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarksons</ref> that night, go to Cambridge on Tuesday the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. to London on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &#8211; to Richmond on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

        <p rend="indent1"> I am charged to present <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughters</ref> best thanks to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lightfoot for her beautiful ring. It is not impossible that you may see her in the summer, for she seems more than half inclined to accompany her friend Lady Malet<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, n&#233;e Wales (1779&#8211;1868), the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>).</note> to the Devonshire Coast about the end of May, &#8211; a scheme which I am willing to encourage, in the hope that sea air &amp; sea bathing may give her some of that bracing which she wants.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My best &amp; kindest regards to all. Tell M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lightfoot that I should be afraid of being killed with kindness where I now am, if I had not gained confidence by escaping from that fate at Crediton: &#8211; after which I may venture to believe no kindness ever will kill me.</p>
