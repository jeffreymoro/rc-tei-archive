            <p rend="indent1"> I am charged to present <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughters</ref> best thanks to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lightfoot for her beautiful ring. It is not impossible that you may see her in the summer, for she seems more than half inclined to accompany her friend Lady Malet<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>).</note> to the Devonshire Coast about the end of May, – a scheme which I am willing to encourage, in the hope that sea air &#38; sea bathing may give her some of that bracing which she wants.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> My best &#38; kindest regards to all. Tell M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lightfoot that I should be afraid of being killed with kindness where I now am, if I had not gained confidence by escaping from that fate at Crediton: – after which I may venture to believe no kindness ever will kill me.</p>
