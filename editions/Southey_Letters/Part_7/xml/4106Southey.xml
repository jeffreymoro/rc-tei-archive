   <salute>My dear Edith</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">To-day I thought would have brought me a letter from home, with an acknowledgement of the half bill: probably I shall find it tomorrow on my return to town. And as I have now after six days close work packed up my papers (having finished &#38; sent off the review,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Dwight (1752–1817), <title>Travels in New-England and New-York</title> (1821–1822), no. 881 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. It was reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (October 1823), 1–40, published 17 April 1824.</note> &#38; advanced so near the end of the B. Church<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> that three mornings in <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Q Anne Street</ref> will finish that also) – I may with a quiet conscience indulge in writing home.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am afraid I expressed myself more peevishly than <del>xxx</del> I ought concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.s</ref> account with Tolson.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Tolson, Jnr (1756–1842), a commission agent and tea dealer in Liverpool and the owner of Greta Hall since 1815.</note> You would excuse <del>me</del> it if you knew how many needless &#38; senseless demands are made upon my time in town, where every minute is precious.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I came here on Thursday last. <ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorHenrySir">Henry Taylor</ref> walked half the way with me, – the letter of introduction which I gave him at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> has proved so efficacious, (which of course it would not have been if his own talents had not accredited it) that he is now Editor of the London Magazine.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Taylor contributed to the <title>London Magazine</title> at this time, but he did not become its editor.</note> – The boys are all at home, <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillErrol ">Errol</ref> <del>xxx</del> brought with him a cold &#38; affection of the chest, in consequence of which <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> came over yesterday to prescribe for him. He appears better to day; but it has altered him a good deal, &#38; kept him in so quiet or rather languid a state that I have scarcely heard his voice, nor seen what kind of boy he is. I believe however that I should like him rather less than <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> &#38; rather more than <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertJnr">his second brother</ref>, tho they are all fine, promising, well disposed lads.

            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> appears to be much the same as when I was last in town. Nothing has failed him but his limbs, &#38; those rather from &#60;the effect&#62; of rheumatism than of age. He goes to London in the stage &#38; returns the same morning, without difficulty or apparent fatigue. His hearing is as good as ever it was; his sight very little impaired, &#38; were it not that the loss of his teeth affects his articulation, his conversation <del>xxx</del> would betray no symptoms of age, for he has the same quiet, chearful, &#38; even playful manner than he had at Lisbon, three &#38; twenty years ago. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillCatherine">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> H.</ref> is much the graver of the two.

My mornings &#38; evenings have been past up stairs in solitude, steadily at work, <del>xx</del> I have had my afternoon &#60;nap&#62; also, &#38; enjoy dining at four o clock, &#38; a glass of arrack punch<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">A distilled alcoholic drink, made from the fermented sap of the coconut tree, mixed with fruit or fruit juice.</note> after supper</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Tomorrow I mean to receive the sacrament here, &#38; then put myself on the way to London &#38; take my chance for a stage.

            <p rend="indent1">The inn at Cambridge at which I was quartered is so perfectly clean &#38; commodious that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> will find no inconvenience in being lodged there for two or three <del>days</del> nights, beyond which our stay would not under any circumstances have been prolonged.</p>
