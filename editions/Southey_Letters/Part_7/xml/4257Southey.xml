            <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the draft. The Pepys Memoirs<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Memoirs of Samuel Pepys, Esq. F.R.S.: Secretary to the Admiralty in the Reigns of Charles II and James II. Comprising his Diary from 1659 to 1669, Deciphered by the Rev. John Smith, From the Original Short-Hand MS. in the Pepysian Library, and a Selection from his Private Correspondence</title>, (1825), edited by Richard Griffin, 3rd Baron Braybrooke (1783–1858). This was the first edition of the diary of Samuel Pepys (1633–1703; <title>DNB</title>). A later edition from 1828 was no. 2208 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Southey did not write on this subject for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> will afford a good subject, – so will Sir T. Browne,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Thomas Browne (1605–1682; <title>DNB</title>) was a doctor and writer on a huge range of subjects. ‘The Whole Works and Correspondence of Sir Thomas Browne, Knt. M. D. of Norwich’ was being advertised at this time as forthcoming with Longmans, for example, in the <title>London Courier and Evening Gazette</title>, 2 October 1824. This was an early indication of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilkinSimon">Simon Wilkin’s</ref> edition, which did not appear until 1835–1836. Southey acquired a copy and it became no. 376 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> which I shall the more willingly undertake, as the edition partly originated in an enquiry of mine concerning his papers. – You shall have an article upon Bayard<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sara Coleridge’s translation, <title>The Right Joyous and Pleasant History of the Feats, Gests, and Prowesses of the Chevalier Bayard, the Good Knight without Fear and without Reproach</title> (1825). Unsurprisingly, Southey gave this a glowing recommendation in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 32 (October 1825), 355–397.</note> as soon as the book is ready. And a life of Baxter<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Puritan clergyman, Richard Baxter (1615–1691; <title>DNB</title>). It is not clear which of his works Southey was suggesting he review. He may have heard of the forthcoming <title>The Practical Works of the Rev. Richard Baxter with a Life of the Author and a Critical Examination of his Writings</title> (1830), edited by William Orme (1787–1830; <title>DNB</title>). Southey did not write on this subject for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> for which you will not forget to send me the new edition of his works, – which must now be nearly compleated.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The Monastic Orders<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s ‘History of the Monastic Orders’ was never completed or published.</note> must be treated as Gibbon<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Gibbon (1737–1794; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</title> (1776–1789), no. 1099 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> has managed his subject – <del>&#38; require</del> the spirit of their history must be seized, – what is important &#38; interesting brought forward, what is unimportant passed over; &#38; if I were to say that it is hardly inferior to Gibbons subject in variety it would not be saying too much. It <del>embraces</del> includes no slight part of the history of the corruptions of Xtianity, of the conversion &#38; civilization of the Northern Nations, – of the decline &#38; revival of letters, – of the Reformation, – &#38; of the attempts made by the Romish Church to recover what it lost by the Reformation in Europe, – &#38; to extend its authority in other parts of the world. – So rich &#38; so various are the materials that if they were properly worked up, I know not whether the statesman, the philosopher, the antiquarian, the poet or the painter would be most interested by the display. And with the truth of history it would unite the wildness of romance.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> It would require, as far as I can estimate, six octavo volumes of from 4 to 500 pages.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">   My health has been much shaken this summer, – but I am now, thank God, well recovered, &#38; in full activity</p>
