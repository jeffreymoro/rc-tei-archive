            <p>Address: To William Westall, Esqre; A.R.A./ 18 Mornington Place,/ Hampstead Road<br/> MS: New South Wales State Library, Australia, B 1548. TS; 2p.<br/> Unpublished.<br/> Dating note: This letter belongs to early January 1822 and predates Southey to the
               Editor of the <em>Courier</em>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. The latter was sent as an enclosure to Bedford on 6
               January 1822, Letter 3778, and forwarded by him to the newspaper, where it appeared
               on 11 January 1822.<br/> Note on MS: Letter text, including the address, survives as a typescript copy, kept
               with a transcript of ‘M.S. Sketch of the Life of the Late William Westall, A.R.A.
               by Robert Westall, Feb 1850’. The transcript of the <em>Life</em> was made by Rex Rienits and dated ‘14.2.58’; Rienits was probably the transcriber
               of the letter also.</p>

               (<em>Letters Written during a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em> (Bristol, 1797), p. 54). In the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>, 1.1 (1808), 452, Southey lamented that the failure to destroy the bridge had ruined
               the best chance the British forces, led by Sir John Moore (1761–1809; <em>DNB</em>), had to impede their pursuit by the French in the retreat to Corunna in 1808–1809.
               He also referred in a note to ‘a sketch, taken upon the spot’ that he had seen – probably
               Herbert Hill’s drawing. The second sketch was of a bridge over the River Esla at Castro
               Gonzalo, with the town of Benavente in the distance. It was the scene of a defeat
               of French cavalry by British forces on 29 December 1808.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>

               calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad
               on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland
               in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey
               to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League
               of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. Southey responded to this
               charge in his letter to the Editor of the <em>Courier</em>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776, published in the newspaper on 11 January 1822. He sent
               a draft of his letter to Wordsworth for his comments before dispatching it to London
