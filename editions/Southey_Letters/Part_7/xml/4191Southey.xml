        <p rend="indent1"> Nearly four years have elapsed since I began this series of reminiscences, &amp; I have only written twelve letters, which bring me only into the twelfth year of my age. Alas this is not the only case in which I feel that the remaining portion of my life, were it even to be protracted longer than there is reason to expect upon the most favourable calculation of chances, must be too short for the undertakings which I have dreamt of compleating. It is however the case in which I can with least inconvenience quicken my speed, &amp; frail as by humiliating experience I know my own resolutions to be I will nevertheless endeavour to send off a letter from this <del>time</del> time forth at the <del>beginning</del> &lt;end&gt; of every month. Matter for one more will be afforded before I take leave of poor old William Williams;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Williams (d. 1811), Southey&#8217;s schoolmaster at Merchants&#8217; Hall School, Bristol, 1782&#8211;1786.</note> &amp; that part of it which has no relation to myself will not be the least worth relation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">It was a good feature in his character that he had a number of poor retainers, who used to drop in at school hours, &amp; seldom went away empty-handed. There was one poor fellow familiarly called D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jones<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified beyond the information provided here.</note> who always set the school in a roar of laughter. What his real history was I know not; the story was that some mischievous boys had played upon him the dreadfully dangerous prank of giving him a dose of cantharides,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A preparation made from the dried bodies of blister beetles. It had many medical uses, including treating smallpox and as an aphrodisiac, but it could be poisonous in larger doses.</note> &amp; that he had lost his wits in consequence. I am not aware that it could have produced this effect, tho it might easily have cost him his life. Crazy however he was, or rather half crazed: &amp; it was such a merry craziness, that it would have been wishing him ill to wish him otherwise. The bliss of ignorance is merely negative; there was a positive happiness in his insanity; it was like a perpetual drunkenness, <del>kept a</del> sustained just at that degree of pleasurable excitement, which in the sense of present enjoyment is equally regardless of the future &amp; of the past. He fancied himself a poet, because he could produce upon demand a rhyme in the sorriest doggerel, &amp; the most celebrated improvisatore<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A performer of improvised poetry. This tradition was especially popular in Italy, where it had developed in the fourteenth century.</note> was never half so vain of his talent as this queer creature whose little figure of some five feet two I can perfectly call to mind, with his suit of rusty black, his more rusty wig, &amp; his old cocked hat. Whenever he entered the school room he was greeted with a shout of welcome, all business was suspended, <del>&amp; if</del> he was called upon from all sides to give us a rhyme, &amp; when the masters countenance offered any encouragement, he was intreated also to ask for half a holyday, which at the price of some <del>rhymes</del> &lt;doggerel&gt; was sometimes obtained. You will readily believe <del>that</del> he was a popular poet.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <del>It is now become</del> The talent of composing imitative verses has become so common in our days, that it will require some evidence to make the next generation believe <del>that any</del> (what&gt; sort of verses were received as poetry fifty years ago &lt;when any thing in rhyme past current.&gt;. The magazines however contain proof of this; the very best of them <del>containing</del> &lt;abounding in&gt; such trash as would be rejected now by the provincial newspapers Whether the progress of society which <del>has</del> so greatly favours the growth &amp; developement of imitative talent, is equally favourable to the true poetical spirit, is a question which I may be led to consider hereafter. But as I had the good fortune to grow up in an age when poets, according to the old opinion, were born &amp; not made <del>so</del> &#8211; &amp; as at the time to which this part of my reminiscences relates, the bent of my nature had decidedly shown itself, I may here make some observations upon the grounds &amp; consequences of that opinion.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In <del>former</del> the earliest ages certain it is that they who possessed that gift of <del>tongues</del> &lt;speech&gt; which enabled them to clothe ready thoughts in measured or elevated diction, were held to be inspired. False oracles were uttered in verse; &amp; true prophecies delivered in poetry. &lt;There was therefore some reason for the opinion.&gt; A belief akin to this prevails even now among the ignorant, &amp; was much more prevalent in my childhood, when very few of the lower classes could write or read &amp; when in the classes above these those who really were ignorant, knew that they were so. In dark ages slight of hand past for magic, slight of tongue for inspiration; &amp; the ignorant, &lt;when they were&gt; <del>tho</del> no longer <del>so ignorant as</del> to be thus deluded, still looked upon both as <del>something</del> extraordinary &amp; wonderful. The power <del>of</del> especially of arranging words in a manner altogether different from the common manner of speech, ( &#8211; a power which has now become as easy &amp; therefore is every day becoming more &amp; more a common acquirement,) appeared to them what it originally was in all poets &amp; always will be in those who are truly such: &amp; &lt;even now&gt; tho there are none who <del>now look upon</del> &lt;regard&gt; its possessor with superstitious reverence, there are still many who regard look upon him as <del>something</del> &lt;one who in the constitution of his mind is&gt; different from themselves. As no madman ever pretended to <del>inspiration</del> &lt;a religious call&gt; without finding some open-eared listeners ready to believe in him, so perhaps no one ever composed verses with facility, who had not in his own little circle some to admire &amp; applaud him. This was even the case with so poor a creature as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jones. And to the intoxication of conceit which the honest admiration of the ignorant has produced in half crazed rhymers, like him, it is owing that some marvellous productions have found their way to the press.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jones was a doggrelist of the lowest kind. One other such I once met with, when I was young enough to be <del>infinitely</del> &lt;heartily&gt; amused<del>ent</del> with an exhibition which farcical as it was, would now make me mournful. He was a poor engraver by name Coyte,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph William Coyte (fl. 1780s&#8211;1810s).</note> very <del>harmless</del> &lt;simple&gt;, very industrious, very poor &amp; completely crazed with vanity because he could compose off-hand upon any subject such rhymes as the Bellmans<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Bellmen were minor parish officials; traditionally, they presented doggerel verses at Christmas, conveying seasonal good wishes to parishioners, in return for donations.</note> used to be. <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Bedford&#8217;s father</ref> used to relieve him sometimes; I saw him on one of his visits to Brixton, when he was between 40 &amp; 50 years of age; &amp; his countenance &amp; manner <del>would</del> &lt;might&gt; have supplied Wilkie with a subject.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">David Wilkie (1785&#8211;1841; <title>DNB</title>), genre painter, especially of humorous and rustic characters. </note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedford</ref> (- there never lived a kinder-hearted man,) loved merriment, &amp; played him off, &#8211; in which <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> joined &amp; I was not backward. We gave him subjects upon which he presently wrote three or four miserable couplets: <del>&amp;</del> no creature was ever more elated with <del>glory</del> &lt;triumph&gt; than he was at the hyperbolical commendations which he received, &amp; this mingled with the genuine humility which the sense of his condition occasioned, produced a truly comic mixture in his feelings &amp; gesticulations. What with pleasure inspiration &amp; exertion, &lt;&amp; warm weather, for it was in the dog days&gt;, he perspired, <del>like</del> &lt;as profusely, tho I dare say not as fragrantly, as&gt; an Elephant in love; &amp; literally overflowed at eyes &amp; mouth, frothing &amp; weeping <del>with delight</del> &lt;in <del>his</del> a salivation of happiness&gt;. I think this poor fellow published A Cockneys Rambles in the Country, some 12 or 14 years ago,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Cockney&#8217;s Adventures During a Ramble into the Country. A True Tale</title> (1811). See Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 20 October 1812, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2160.</note> for such a book I saw advertised by Joseph William Coyte, &amp; I sent for it at the time, &#8211; but it was too obscure to be found.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">These are examples of the very <del>lowest</del> &lt;humblest &amp; meanest) rhymesters, who nevertheless felt themselves raised above their companions, because they could rhyme. I have been acquainted with poets <del>of</del> &lt;in&gt; every intermediate degree between D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jones &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>, &amp; their conceit has almost uniformly been precisely in an inverse proportion to their capacity. When this conceit acts upon low &amp; vulgar ignorance it produces direct craziness as in the instances &lt;of&gt; which I have been speaking. In the lower ranks of middle life I have seen it, without amounting to insanity, assume a form of such extravagant vanity, that the examples which have occurred within my own <del>kno</del> observation would be deemed incredible if brought forward in a farce. Of these in due time. <del>I will</del> There is another more curious manifestation of the same folly which I do not remember ever to have seen noticed but which is well worthy of critical observation, because it shows in its full extent &amp; &lt;therefore <hi rend="ital">in puris naturalibus</hi>&gt;<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;in a purely natural state&#8217;.</note> a fault which is found in by much the greater part of modern poetry, &#8211; the use of words which have no signification when they are used, &#8211; &lt;or which if they mean any thing, mean nonsense, &#8211; &gt; the substitution of sound for sense. <del>The writers to whom I refer</del> I could show you passage after passage in contemporary writers, &#8211; the most popular which when critically, that is to say <del>fairly &amp;</del> &lt;strictly but&gt; justly examined, are as absolutely nonsensical as the description of a moonlight night in Popes Homer<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Pope (1688&#8211;1744; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Iliad of Homer</title> (London, 1715&#8211;1720), Book 8, lines 687&#8211;697.</note> &#8211; Pope himself thought &lt;intended&gt; that &lt;for&gt; a fine description, &amp; did not perceive that it was as absurd as his own song by a Person of Quality.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Pope, &#8216;Song. By a Person of Quality&#8217; (1733), a burlesque.</note> Now there have been writers who have possessed the talent<del>xx</del> of stringing together couplet after couplet in sonorous verse, without any connection, &amp; without any meaning &#8211; or any <del>like</del> thing like a meaning, &#8211; &amp; yet they have had all the enjoyment of writing poetry, supposed that this was poetry &amp; published it as such. I know a man who has done this, &amp; who made me a present of his poem: &amp; yet he is very far from a fool, &#8211; on the contrary a lively pleasant companion, &amp; of talents which in conversation are considerably above par.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> The most perfect specimen I ever saw of such verses was a poem called the Shepherds Farewell,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">This poem is difficult to identify with certainty.

        <p rend="indent1">  D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jones has led me into a long digression, upon which I should not have entered if I had foreseen that it would have extended so far.

If I could paint a portrait from memory you should have his likeness.

He appeared always in buckskins of his own making, &amp; in boots; he would laugh at his own jests with a voice like Stentor supposing Stentor<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">A Greek herald in Homer&#8217;s <title>Iliad</title>, who possessed a voice more powerful than that of 50 men. </note> to have been hoarse, &#8211; &amp; then he would clap old Williams on the back with a hand like a shoulder of mutton &lt;you may imagine how great a man we thought him.&gt; They had probably been boon companions in their youth, &amp; his visits seldom failed to make the old man lay aside the schoolmaster. He was an excellent hand at demanding half-a-holyday, &amp; when he had succeeded always required three cheers for his success, in which he joined with all his might &amp; main. If I were a believer in the Romish Purgatory I should make no doubt that every visit which he made to that school room, was carried to the account of his good works.

        <p rend="indent1"> These are comic recollections, the next <del>is</del> &lt;are&gt; of a different kind.

That poor man <del>for</del> was for three years the plague of my life, &#8211; &amp; I was the plague of his. In some unhappy mood he had prevailed on <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref> to let me learn to dance, persuading himself as well as her that I should do credit to his teaching. It must have been for my sins that he formed this opinion: in evil hour for himself &amp; for me was it formed; he would have had less trouble in teaching a bear, &amp; far better success. I do not remember that I set out with any dislike, or contempt of dancing; but <del>in</del> the unconquerable incapacity which <del>I</del> it was soon evident that I possessed, produced both; &amp; the more he laboured to <del>make me</del> correct an incorrigible awkwardness, the more awkwardly of course I performed. I verily believe the fiddle stick was applied as much to my head as to the fiddle strings &lt;when I was called out&gt;; &#8211; but the rascal had a <del>xxx</del> &lt;worse&gt; way than that of punishing me, he would take my hands in his &amp; lead me down a dance, &amp; then the villain would apply his thumb nail against the flat surface of mine, in the middle, &amp; press it till he left the mark there, this species of torture I suppose to have been his own invention, &amp; so intolerable it was, that at last whenever he had recourse to it, I kicked his shins. Luckily for me he got into a scrape by beating a boy unmercifully at another school, so that he was afraid <del>of</del> &lt;to&gt; carry<del>ing</del> on this sort of contest, &amp; giving up at last all hope of ever making me a votary of the graces, or of the dancing Muse,<note n="38" place="foot" resp="editors">Terpsichore, the Greek Muse who was the goddess of dance and chorus.</note> he contented himself with shaking his head &amp; turning up his eyes in hopelessness whenever he noticed my performance.

        <p rend="indent1">  Williams who read well himself, &amp; prided himself upon it was one day very much offended with my reading, &amp; asked me scornfully who taught me to read.

Then said he, give my compliments to <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">your Aunt</ref>, &amp; tell her that my old horse who has been dead these twenty years could have taught you as well.

King&#8217;s Scholars could proceed to a Closed Scholarship at either Christ Church, Oxford, or Trinity College, Cambridge. There was no certainty that a King&#8217;s Scholar would receive a Fellowship, once he graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge. However, at Christ Church, a King&#8217;s Scholar immediately became one of the body of Students, with a modest stipend that was guaranteed for life, if the recipient wished and he obeyed the rules of the College. If they took university degrees in a timely fashion then their stipend would increase. The rules governing Studentships were strict and anyone who married, did not take Holy Orders or accepted a paid occupation had to resign.</note> But as I was in poor health, &amp; moreover had been very ill taught, it was thought advisable that I should be placed for twelvemonths under a clergyman competent to prepare me for a public school.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">A time was remembered when there were wars of school against school, &amp; a great battle which had taken place in the adjoining park, between Williams&#8217;s boys, &amp; Foot&#8217;s my first Masters.<note n="41" place="foot" resp="editors">William Foot (d. 1781), a Bristol Baptist Minister, who ran a school at the top of St Michael&#8217;s Hill.</note> At both schools I heard of this, &amp; the victory was claimed by both, &#8211; for it was an old affair, a matter of tradition (not having been noticed <del>by</del> &lt;in&gt; history) long before my generation, or any who were then in the school, &#8211; but remembered as an event second only in importance, if second, to the war of Troy.<note n="42" place="foot" resp="editors">As described in Homer&#8217;s <title>Iliad</title>.</note>
