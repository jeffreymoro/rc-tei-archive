           <p rend="indent1"> Here are two pretty birds here in two cages, children of a canary bird &#38; a goldfinch. They sing very sweetly. And here is a very comical small frisking whisking Cupn dog, whose name is Tippoo Saib. That was the name of a terrible Sultan in the East Indies,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Tipu Sultan (1750–1799; Sultan of Mysore 1782–1799) killed while defending the fort of Seringapatam against the East India Company.</note> who used to throw men to his tygers <del>&#38; xxxxxxxx</del> He was a very cruel tyrant, but at last the English beat him &#38; killed him in battle.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I received the comical verses signed by Rumpel &#38; Hurlyburlybuss,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The most likely author of these verses signed by two of Southey’s cats at Greta Hall was John Marriott (1780–1825; <title>DNB</title>), a clergyman, poet and friend of Walter Scott. He was Curate of St James, Exeter, St Lawrence, Exeter, and St John, Broadclyst. The patron of the latter church was Sir Thomas Acland, who was also a friend of Marriott. Southey had stayed with Marriott on 6 January 1824 on his visit to the West Country. While he was on this trip, Southey received the poem ‘The Poetic Epistle to Southey from his Cats’, which he liked and kept; it was later printed in <title>The Doctor</title>, 7 vols (London, 1834–1847), VII, pp. 580–582. </note> at <ref type="m" target="people.html#AclandThomasSir">Sir Thomas Aclands</ref>.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Acland’s house at Killerton Park, Devon.</note> Every body there was much amused by them.

Herries, and in later life a financier; see Southey to Cuthbert Southey, [18 December 1823], Letter 4102.</note> behaved when he had that sad fall, which knocked his teeth out. It is a great grief to <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">your Mamma</ref> &#38; to me when any thing is the matter with you: but it would be a greater not to have you a good boy. You know we are both very fond of you, tho <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">your Mamma</ref> does not tell you quite so often as I do. The greatest pleasure I have while I am away is to think of getting home again, that I may see <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">your dear mother</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bel</ref> &#38; you, &#38; have my books about me, &#38; live in my own study, &#38; sleep in my own bed, &#38; see the lake &#38; the mountains, &#38; be very happy, &#38; make a noise sometimes, &#38; be a very nonsensical Pappa, as all good Pappas ought to be.</p>

            <p rend="indent1"> So many persons called in upon me yesterday that I could not finish this letter. If I were to go to all the houses whither I am invited, I should never get to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>; so I say no to every body. There came a letter last night from my old tutor at College, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sweet,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Sweet (c. 1754–1833), Rector of Kentisbury, Devon 1776–1833. Sweet received his BA from Wadham College, Oxford, in 1775. He married Jane Sweet, née Barter (dates unknown) in Exeter in 1777.</note> asking me to visit him &#38; his wife &#38; his twelve children, &#38; offering to send his coach for me. But I cannot go. On Saturday I hope to see <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesCaroline">Miss Bowles</ref>, &#38; Rover her dog, &#38; Donna her cat. &#38; there I shall have a little quiet, &#38; be able to answer some of the letters which follow me wherever I go.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  O Cuthbert I have seen such beautiful cats in Devonshire that it was a pleasure to look at them. There was a Lady<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> at Sir John Kenneways<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Kennaway, 1st Baronet (1758–1836), made a fortune in the East India Company and became a landowner in Devonshire. Southey knew him through his son, Charles Edward Kennaway, who had visited Southey in the Lake District in 1819–1820. His home was Escot House, near Ottery St Mary, Devon.</note> who loves cats; &#38; I wrote in her Album this Triad. “The Three sweet sounds of the Fireside: the chirping of a Cricket: the singing of a Tea-kettle, &#38; the purring of a Cat.” – This is a Triad. The ancient Britons used to put most of their wise sayings in Triads,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">A rhetorical form in medieval Welsh that grouped objects in threes.</note> &#38; I will make some wise sayings for you in the same manner one of these days, &#38; some comical ones. In the time of the Britons there was no printing &#38; no books, &#38; indeed no paper, so they recorded things in Triads because they could easily be remembered in that form.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  I shall hope to receive a letter from home, in London, &#38; if I hear that you are fond of your books it will please me much. I shall bring down some very nice ones for you &#38; your sisters to read. Give my love to all at home, &#38; <del>xxx</del> offer it to Rumpelstilzchen in the shape of a piece of meat, or a little milk. The same also to Hurlyburlybuss.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  Good by my dear Cuthbert. Say your prayers regularly, do your lessons well, always do as you are bid, &#38; never be in a passion; &#38; then you will always be good &#38; happy. God bless you.</p>
