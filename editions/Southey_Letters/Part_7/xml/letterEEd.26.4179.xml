Of the party on board some had been taught to think him a Jacobin, some an Ultra-Tory, some a Methodist, some an enemy to all religions, &amp; some a Madman. None had read a line of his works, but all were inclined to criticise him. And yet all, when they really tried the formidable volumes, were delighted both with the man &amp; his poetry.&#8221;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Reginald Heber to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 23 October 1823, published in <title>Narrative of a Journey through the Upper Provinces of India, from Calcutta to Bombay, 1824&#8211;1825.
