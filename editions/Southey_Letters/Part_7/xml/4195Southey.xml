        <p rend="indent1"> The cast with its accompaniments is safely arrived.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford had commissioned a plaster copy of a glass cup he possessed, to present to Southey. Bedford believed the cup to be the work of Benvenuto Cellini (1500&#8211;1571), Italian goldsmith and sculptor.</note> Nothing could have been more carefully packed. I observed your directions how to handle the glass, &amp; it now ornaments my workshop, which I dare say is furnished with more curious things than any other wherein the manufactory of verse &amp; prose is so diligently carried on.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Have you seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor&#8217;s</ref> Imaginary Conversations?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Savage Landor, <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title> (1824), no. 1600 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> My copy arrived yesterday, &amp; such sheets only having been sent me during its passage thro the press as were <hi rend="ital">thought</hi> by the publisher<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The firm of John Taylor (1781&#8211;1864; <title>DNB</title>) and James Augustus Hessey (1785&#8211;1870), of 93 Fleet Street, London.</note> to require castration about a third part of it was new to me. Some things have passed in that part which I should have struck out, especially where <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge ">Canning</ref> is aimed at, &amp; grossly slandered.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue XIV of Landor&#8217;s <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824) I, pp. [229]&#8211;248, between the Greek orator Demosthenes (384&#8211;322 BC), and the philosopher Eubulides (4th century BC). On pp. 245&#8211;248, Canning was portrayed as &#8216;Anaedestatus&#8217;.</note> If you have not read the book, you have a rich treat to come: so much error, so much intemperance you will rarely meet with, where there is any thing to compensate for such faults, but such manliness of thought &amp; expression, such life &amp; vigour, such thunder &amp; lightening &#8211; are I verily believe nowhere else to be found. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> would have winced had he lived to read it, &#8211; &amp; yet what is said of him<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue XII of Landor&#8217;s <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824) I, pp. [154]&#8211;165, between Gilbert Burnet (1643&#8211;1715; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Salisbury 1689&#8211;1715 and &#8216;Humphrey Hardcastle&#8217;. On pp. 160&#8211;164, Byron was satirised as &#8216;Mr. George Nelly&#8217;, whose recent death was noted.</note> is now the more impressive because it speaks of him as dead.</p>
