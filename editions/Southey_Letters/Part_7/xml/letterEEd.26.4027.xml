        <p rend="indent0">My movements would be as regular as the habits of my life, if I had a regular income, &amp; not a contingent one. My ways &amp; means for the next six months depend upon this Book,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> &amp; tho it is by no means likely that doubling its size will increase its profits in the same proportion, it was nevertheless quite necessary to extend it. You will not think my time ill employed when you see it. Ten sheets of the second volume are printed, &amp; the printer has about five more in his hands. I am now in Elizabeths reign,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 252&#8211;312, covering the reign of Elizabeth I (1533&#8211;1603; Queen of England 1558&#8211;1603; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &amp; nearly at the end of it, &#8211; there is about the third part of a volume to write, &#8211; but I will not pretend to say when I shall have compleated it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">This work has lead me thro the whole of Strypes voluminous collections,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Anglican clergyman and historian, John Strype (1643&#8211;1737; <title>DNB</title>), whose lives of sixteenth-century divines were important sources for Church history. Southey acquired the twenty-three volume Clarendon Press edition of Strype&#8217;s <title>Works</title> (1816&#8211;1824), no. 2753 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> &amp; there, of course, I have noted many things which bear upon other subjects. I find there that Osorius, when he replied to Haddon&#8217;s answer to his attack upon the English Church, inserted in his book some caricatures of Haddon: &#8211; the earliest mention of such things which has fallen in my way, &#8211; &amp; therefore I should like to see the book.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Jer&#243;nimo Os&#243;rio da Fonseca (1506&#8211;1580) in <title>Epistola Hieronymi Osorii ad Serenissimam Elisabetem Angliae Reginam</title> (1562) had urged Elizabeth I (1533&#8211;1603; Queen of England, 1558&#8211;1603; <title>DNB</title>) to return England to Catholicism. Walter Haddon (1515&#8211;1572; <title>DNB</title>) had replied with <title>Against Ierome Osorius Bishopp of Siluane in Portugall and against his Slaunderous Inuectiues: An Aunswere Apoligeticall: for the Necessary Defence of the Euangelicall Doctine and Veritie</title> (1563) and Os&#243;rio responded with <title>Amplissimi atque Doctissimi Viri D. Hieronymi Osorii, Espiscopi Sylvensis, in Gualterum Haddonum Magistrum Libellorum Supplicum apud Clarissimam Principem Helisabetham Angliae, Franciae, &amp; Hiberniae Reginam</title> (1567). However, Strype, <title>Works</title>, 23 vols (Oxford, 1816&#8211;1824), XV, Part I, p. 96 (<title>Annals of the Reformation</title>, Vol. III, Part I), asserted it was one Emanuel d&#8217;Almada who wrote a book attacking Haddon, which included &#8216;certain ugly pictures&#8217; of Haddon.</note> Very possibly it may be found at Lambeth,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Library of the Archbishops of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace, London.</note> &amp; there I will look for it.</p>
