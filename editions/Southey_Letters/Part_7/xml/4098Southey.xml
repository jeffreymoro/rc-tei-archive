Dating note: This letter was written on a &#8216;Wednesday evening&#8217; in December 1823; as Southey had procured a frank for Caroline Bowles, he must have been in London, rather than Streatham, making 3 December the most likely date.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I have procured a frank for you, but alas it is not so easy to find time for filling it, in this abominable city. Would I that were out of it, &#8211; I had almost said never to return to it again.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">My present plans are to start for Exeter on the third of January, &amp; in about a fortnight afterwards set out from Taunton to Salisbury as the nearest way to you, consistent with my movements. If I find no ready conveyance from Salisbury, I will take chaise rather than lose time. How glad I shall be to set out upon that journey!</p>
        <p rend="indent1">I asked your question of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteJosephBlanco">Blanco</ref>, but he is not acquainted with Naylor Burrard<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Naylor Burrard (d. 1834), Lieutenant in the 1st Madras European Regiment, and first cousin of Caroline Bowles.</note> &amp; did not know the name.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">It was <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> into whose hands I put your two volumes that he might take care of them in the QR.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles&#8217;s <title>Ellen Fitzarthur; a Metrical Tale, in Five Cantos</title> (1820) and <title>The Widow&#8217;s Tale: and Other Poems</title> (1822) were not reviewed in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> This he will do, &amp; meantime he has done them a good office in the Christian Remembrancer,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles&#8217;s <title>Ellen Fitzarthur; a Metrical Tale, in Five Cantos</title> (1820) was reviewed in the <title>Christian Remembrancer</title>, 5 (December 1823), 747&#8211;749, and <title>The Widow&#8217;s Tale: and Other Poems</title> (1822) in <title>Christian Remembrancer</title>, 6 (February 1824), 110&#8211;112.</note> &amp; will do the like in the British Critic,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles&#8217;s <title>Ellen Fitzarthur; a Metrical Tale, in Five Cantos</title> (1820) and <title>The Widow&#8217;s Tale: and Other Poems</title> (1822) were reviewed in the <title>British Critic</title>, 20 (December 1823), 623&#8211;635.</note> &#8211; for he is as much taken with them, as I expected &amp; wished him to be.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">The resemblance to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> Ivanhoe<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had sent Bowles an outline for a poem on the legendary figure of Robin Hood; see Southey to Caroline Bowles, 19 November 1823, Letter 4087. This was never completed and was published as &#8216;Robin Hood&#8217; in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [1]&#8211;36. Walter Scott, <title>Ivanhoe</title> (1819) also dealt with Robin Hood, but Southey&#8217;s outline was based on his notes, now catalogued as &#8216;Robin Hood&#8217;, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. These are dated &#8216;Oct 28. 1808&#8217;, &#8216;July 19. 1814&#8217; and there is an undated, earlier, &#8216;Original Sketch&#8217;. These all predate Scott&#8217;s first novel, <title>Waverley</title> (1814).</note> &#8211; or rather the resemblance there to a plan which was dreamt of ten years at least before <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> wrote any of his tales, may easily be avoided &amp; we may make the restoration of his estates depend upon the Barons war against King John.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">John (1166&#8211;1216; King of England 1199&#8211;1216; <title>DNB</title>). The last part of his reign in 1215&#8211;1216 was spent in conflict with his leading nobles.</note> I could also as the poem begins with the infancy of its chief personage &#8211; carry it on to his death. You will feel at once what may be done by describing the autumn &amp; winter of an irregular life, &#8211; even in its most favourable form. But I have no time to say more &#8211; lest the postman with his bell should surprize me before I can fold up &amp; seal</p>
