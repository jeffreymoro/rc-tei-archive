Southey had written to Catcott to obtain information for his and Joseph Cottle&#8217;s edition <title>The Works of Thomas Chatterton</title> (1803); see Southey to Joseph Cottle, [c. 21 August 1802], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey, Part Two</title>, Letter 708.</note> but I remember that I used to compare the attempting at eliciting any thing like common sense from poor Catcott to that of trying to strike fire with a wooden mallet from a lump of lead. &#8211; Townsend of Pewsey has written a book of <del>some</del> good repute with the view as thus concerning which you enquire, &#8211; its title I believe is &#8216;the character of Moses as an historian vindicated.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Townsend (1739&#8211;1816; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Character of Moses as an Historian, Recording Events from the Creation to the Deluge</title> (1813), a robust defence of the accuracy of the biblical account of history. It is possible that Peachy&#8217;s enquiries were motivated by the appearance of William Buckland (1784&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Reliqui&#230; Diluvian&#230;, or, Observations on the Organic Remains attesting the Action of a Universal Deluge</title> (1823), which argued that the Earth was much older than a literal interpretation of the account in <title>Genesis</title> suggested.</note>
