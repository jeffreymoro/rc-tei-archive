Although Lightfoot’s stipend had at first been only £20 p.a., his admission of boarding pupils, and improvements in the schools endowments, gave him a respectable, if not secure, income. In 1818 he received a stipend of £50 as headmaster, plus a house and an allowance for taxes. He was also paid £5 p.a. for each day pupil and charged 30 guineas p.a. for boarding pupils (of whom he had 37 in 1811). In addition, the Governors of the school had presented him to the nearby Rectory of Kennerleigh in 1807, with a stipend of £100 p.a.; Nicholas Carlisle, <title>A Concise Description of the Endowed Grammar Schools in England and Wales</title>, 2 vols (London, 1818), I, pp. 254–265.</note> &#38; during one &#38; twenty years, that he has been married,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Nicholas Lightfoot married Bridget Prideaux (1768–1856) on 13 July 1801.
