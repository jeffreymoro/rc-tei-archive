He wrote three &#8216;Inscriptions for the Caledonian Canal&#8217;: &#8216;Inscription for a Tablet at Banavie, on the Caledonian Canal&#8217;, <title>Friendship&#8217;s Offering. A Literary Album</title> (London, 1826), pp. [167]&#8211;168; and &#8216;At Clachnacharry&#8217; and &#8216;At Fort Augustus&#8217;, <title>The Anniversary; or, Poetry and Prose for MDCCCXXIX</title> (London, 1829), pp. 194&#8211;197. At this time, Southey had only written the first two of these poems.</note> It is a form of composition which I am fond of attempting, tho it is a very difficult one; &amp; it is almost the only youthful predilection for any kind of composition which continues with me till this day.</p>
