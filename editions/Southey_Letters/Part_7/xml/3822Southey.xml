            <p rend="indent1"> It is long since I have heard from you, &#38; I am afraid one cause of this silence may have been that you have had no favourable intelligence to communicate. I look at the news from Brazil always with apprehension because of the manner in which it may affect you.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Porto in August 1820 led to the election of a Cortes in Portugal in December 1820 and demands that the monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807–1808 following the French invasion. John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826) arrived back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and eventually agreed to a new liberal Constitution in October 1822. John VI appointed his son Pedro (1798–1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831) as Regent in Brazil, and Pedro summoned an elected advisory council to represent the different Brazilian provinces. These events eventually led to the separation of Portugal and Brazil on 7 September 1822. John May’s business affairs in Brazil had long been in financial difficulties and finally collapsed in early 1822.</note> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref> writes to me but seldom, &#38; his letters when they come are not longer than so many prescriptions; so that I learn nothing from him. On Saturday however I heard something concerning you which gave me sincere pleasure. Dining at a neighbours with a M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thompson<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> he gave an excellent report of your son, from Arnold,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John May (1802–1879), after his expulsion from Eton in 1818, was being educated at a school in Laleham, near Staines, run by Thomas Arnold (1795–1842; <title>DNB</title>).</note> who spoke of him in the highest terms, &#38; said how glad he was to have had him under his care. This must be a great satisfaction to you, &#38; one motive for my writing is to repeat it to you because coming in this circuitous manner more weight may be given to a commendation of this kind, than if it had been said directly by Arnold to yourself.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  Another motive is to remind you <del>that</del> of something like an engagement to visit <del>xxx</del> me this year, &#38; to say that the <del>xxxx after the leaves xxx not the better</del> nearer Midsummer you can come the better, <hi rend="ital">before</hi> rather than after. You should come at the end of May, &#38; be here when the days are at the longest, &#38; the country in its best dress. I cannot express how much I wish to see you under this roof.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son visited Southey for four weeks in August–September 1822.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your goddaughter</ref> has not been in good health, we have counted &#38; still count<del>xx</del> upon an opportunity of sending her to Harrogate with <ref type="m" target="people.html#HutchinsonSara">Miss Hutchinson</ref> (<ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthMary">Mrs Wordsworths</ref> sister) – such waters &#38; such baths being plainly what she stands in need of.

You will be pleased with her manners which are thoroughly unaffected, – diffident &#38; at the same time frank; – None of the others have you ever seen; thank God they are all in tolerable health &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> in particular thriving as we could wish.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I sent you the reprinted volume of Brazil, thinking that you were interested enough in that work to like to have it in its amended <del>form</del> state.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The second (1822) edition of the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810–1819).</note> The additions amount to nearly 100 pages; &#38; the expence of time &#38; labour was much greater than this sum might seem to imply, good part having been gathered from Dutch materials &#38; from manuscripts which were not easily perused. If at any time you feel disposed to look at the additional matter, the paging will direct you to it, that of the former edition being <del>xxx</del> retained in the margin.</p>
