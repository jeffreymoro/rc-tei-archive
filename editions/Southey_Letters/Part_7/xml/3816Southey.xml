            <p rend="indent1">I have been endeavouring to recollect what books may be useful in affording hints &#38; materials for the poem on which you are engaged.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Atherstone was intending to write a poem set in Anglo-Saxon England, centring on Alfred the Great (849–899; King of England 871–899). This was not written, but Atherstone published a novel on the same theme, <title>The Sea-Kings in England: An Historical Romance of the Time of Alfred</title> (1830).</note> You have the most important in <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>, but I hope you have the last edition of his work, (which is the third, in three volumes octavo,) – for each edition differs very materially from the other.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sharon Turner, <title>The History of the Anglo-Saxons: Comprising the History of England from the Earliest Period to the Norman Conquest</title>, 3rd edn (1820), no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Earlier editions had appeared in 1799–1805 and 1807.</note> There is also an earlier Edda than that which you have in Mallet.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The medieval Icelandic <title>Prose Edda</title> was translated by Paul Henri Mallet (1730–1807), <title>Monuments de la Mythologie et de la Poesie des Celtes, et Particulierement des Anciens Scandinaves</title> (1756) and was known to most English readers through the English edition by Thomas Percy (1729–1811; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Northern Antiquities: or, a Description of the Manners, Customs, Religion and Laws of the Ancient Danes and other Northern Nations</title>, 2 vols<title> </title>(London, 1770), II, pp. 1–223, no. 2046 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> One volume was translated about five &#38; twenty years ago by my poor friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#CottleAmos">Amos Cottle</ref>,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Amos Cottle, <title>Icelandic Poetry, or the Edda of Saemund Translated into English Verse</title> (1797), no. 983 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. This was a translation of the <title>Poetic Edda</title>, believed at this time to be earlier than the <title>Prose Edda</title>.</note> &#38; you may find there &#60;some&#62; wild<del>er</del> parts of Runic mythology which will be new to you, if you have never seen this book. I understand that more of these ancient poems have since that time been printed at Copenhagen, &#38; indeed am in expectation of procuring them from thence.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edda Saemundar hinns Froda. Edda Rhythmica seu Antiquor, Vulgo Saemundina Dicta</title> (1787–1818), no. 918 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. He never acquired the third volume, published in 1828.</note> Some, I believe, have been translated by the Honourable William Herbert, (our best Northern scholar) – in whose poems you might probably find much that would be useful.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">William Herbert (1778–1847; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Select Icelandic Poetry, Translated from the Originals with Notes</title> (1804–1806).</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">You should read Lingards History of the Anglo Saxon Church, – an octavo volume published in 1810.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Lingard (1771–1851; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</title>, 2nd edn (1810), no. 1728 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> Whitakers “Life of St Neot, the oldest of all the Brothers of <del>xx</del> Alfred”,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Whitaker (1735–1808; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Life of Saint Neot, the Oldest of All the Brothers to King Alfred</title> (1809), no. 3002 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> tho it is, like all Whitakers works almost merely hypothetical, might give you some hints, – certainly that of a most interesting character if you thought proper to adopt his opinion concerning the Saint.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">St Neot (d. 870) was a Cornish saint; some legends attested he was a relative of King Alfred.</note> Sharpes translation of William of Malmesbury (4to. 1815)<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">William of Malmesbury (c. 1095–c. 1143; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Gesta Regum Anglorum</title>, translated by John Sharpe (1769–1859) as <title>The History of the Kings of England and the Modern History of William of Malmesbury</title> (1815), no. 1664 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> would give you an excellent view of the Saxon times, with many characteristic traits of manners: &#38; you should look at the works of Strutt (the engraver)<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Strutt (1749–1802; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England </title>(1773), <title>Manners, Customs, Arms, Habits etc of the People of England</title> (1774–1776) and <title>Chronicle of England</title> (1777–1778).</note> who took a great deal of pains with our antiquities, &#38; has collected much curious matter concerning the times upon which you are employed. If you wish to see the whole mass of monkish fables concerning the British &#38; Anglo Saxon Church, it has been brought together with perfect credulity in a large folio volume by F.
