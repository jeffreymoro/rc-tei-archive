I take them to be the <hi rend="ital">posse comitatus</hi><note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The name since the ninth century in England for a group of citizens assembled by the sheriff to deal with lawlessness. The theoretical right of sheriffs to assemble such a body was not repealed until 1967.</note> called out for the defence of the country; &#38; have some notion (a vague one) that their name is derived from the Bell which is rung to summons them, – as if <hi rend="ital">Somaten</hi> were equivalent to <hi rend="ital">tocsin</hi>, – but I cannot where I have read this. The derivation of Miquelet<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The name used in Catalonia since the early modern period for many different kinds of irregular troops; it was sometimes used as an equivalent to Somatenes. The word is often said to derive from Miquelot de Prats, a fifteenth-century Catalan mercenary.</note> I have found in D Francisco Manuel,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Francisco Manuel de Mello (1608–1666), <title>Historia de los Movimientos, Separacion y Geurra de Cataluna en tiempo de Felipe IV</title> (Madrid, 1808), pp. 242–243, no 3427 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Southey also owned an edition from 1696, printed at Lisbon (no. 3502 in the sale catalogue of his library).</note> – but I think he never mentions the Somatenes; – &#38; if that be the case, it must be a <del>word</del> &#60;name&#62; of later growth, &#38; therefore not to be met with in the old laws: – &#60;but the <hi rend="ital">unde derivatur</hi><note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">‘whence derived’.</note> perhaps may.&#62; I bought at Turin<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey bought this book on 11 June 1817, when he visited Turin as part of his continental journey of that year.</note> a French account of the struggle made by the Catalans after they were so basely sacrificed at the peace of Utrecht.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">It is not clear which book Southey is referring to here. One possibility is Jean-Baptiste Targe (1733–1806), <title>Histoire de l’Avenement de la Maison de Bourbon au Trone de l’Espagne</title>, 6 vols (Paris, 1772), no. 2770 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1713) was ended by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). Catalonia had supported the losing candidate, Charles VI (1685–1740; Holy Roman Emperor 1711–1740), and lost its feudal privileges after Spanish forces regained control of Catalonia in 1714.</note> It is a vile book. The word is there explained twice &#38; in two different ways, which just serve to show that the Frenchman chose to explain what he did not understand. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ButlerCharles">Mr Butler</ref> the Catholic (Alban Butler’s<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Alban Butler (1711–1773; <title>DNB</title>), priest and hagiographer, author of <title>The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and other Principal Saints; compiled from Original Monuments and Other Authentick Records; Illustrated with the Remarks of Judicious Modern Criticks and Historians</title> (1756–1769).</note> nephew) tells a good story of such another Frenchman, who <del>upon</del> &#60;being&#62; asked the difference between the Dryades &#38; the Hamadryades replied with great complacency that it was exactly the same as the difference between les Eveques &#38; les Archeveques.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Dryads were Greek tree spirits; hamadryads were spirits associated with one particular tree and died when that tree died. This was a rather different distinction to that between bishops and archbishops.</note></p>

I shall get the first volume off my hands in the course of this month, having only to refit two chapters which are nearly written to my hands in the Ed. Ann. Register,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Much of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832) was based on his earlier work for the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title> (1808–1811).</note> &#38; to insert some corrections from <ref type="m" target="people.html#DalrympleHew">Sir H Dalrymples</ref> papers concerning the post-communications with the Spaniards in Andalusia.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey dealt with the Battle of Bailén, 16–19 July1808, the first great success of Spanish forces in the Peninsular War, in his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 382–386. At pp. 389–390, Southey inserted material concerning Dalrymple’s role in the attempts of Spanish commanders to change the terms of surrender of the French army, but it did not have to appear as ‘Corrections’.</note> This is an awkward job which I am afraid cannot be done in any better way than by appending the new matter as ‘Corrections’.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I think you had better not send the D. of B.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford (1766–1839; <title>DNB</title>), Whig politician and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland 1806–1807.

I have done nothing more in the first volume than simply to characterize them in the introductory chapter;<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 3–61 (esp. pp. 55–58), criticised the Whigs for opposing war with France.</note> but that sample shows what they have to expect when their conduct during the succeeding years of the war is to be recorded. – They tell me that in the late duel when the D. fired into the air, he said, it would be a shame to shoot at so-much-too-good-a-mark as the D of Buckingham.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">The Duke of Bedford had fought a duel in Kensington Gardens with Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos (1776–1839; <title>DNB</title>) on 2 May 1822. The cause was remarks made by the Duke of Bedford about the terms on which the Grenville grouping, of which Buckingham was the leader, had joined the government earlier in 1822. One of Buckingham’s seconds was his cousin, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, elder brother of Wynn; Buckingham’s enormous girth made him a ‘so-much-too-good-a-mark’.</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> It has long been apparent to me that we are rapidly approaching a much more perilous crisis in society than that of the Reformation. The house of Russell seems to be stricken with a judicial blindness, or they would see how impossible it is that they should keep in a second convulsion, what they gained in the first.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">The fortunes of the Russells, later Dukes of Bedford, were made during the Reformation, when John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford (1485–1555; <title>DNB</title>) acquired the Abbeys of Tavistock and Woburn and the site of Covent Garden in London.</note> A government which on all occasions is compelled to be directed by popular opinion will soon find itself no government at all. I do not dream of preserving <del>the</del> &#60;our&#62; liberties; – the question is how much <del>shall</del> will it be possible to save from the wreck, &#38; how long before we arrive at that strong &#38; armed government in which all changes of this nature must end, &#38; with which the gradual but sure decay of the nation will begin. The Catholic question<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">The question of whether Catholics should be allowed to hold public office in the United Kingdom. This measure did not pass until 1829.</note> may be staved off for a few sessions, but it will be carried at last; away goes the Test then<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">The Test Act (1673), which confined public office to communicants of the Church of England.</note>: the Dissenters get into the Corporations, &#38; the first hungry &#38; unprincipled Minister<del>s</del> sells the Tithes, – as Pitt thought of doing.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Local clergymen had the right to receive a proportion of agricultural produce in their parish. This system was much–disputed and William Pitt (1759–1806; Prime Minister 1783–1801, 1804–1806; <title>DNB</title>) had ordered a survey of tithes in 1791–1792, but had not proceeded with any reforms.</note> Parliamentary Reform is become little more than a dispute concerning forms, – the real mischief is already effected; &#38; popular clamour carries every thing in Parliament under a Ministry who cringe to their enemies &#38; destroy their friends: a miserable crew, who divide their voices upon the greatest questions which can possibly come before them, &#38; who for the sake of putting off a difficulty, or even of escaping from a debate, are ready to say or unsay, to do or to undo anything.</p>
