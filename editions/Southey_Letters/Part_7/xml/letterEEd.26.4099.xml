But as our present engagements stand &#8211; it will I think be more convenient (if we can so arrange it) to go there from Richmond while we are <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">J Mays</ref> guests.

        <p rend="indent1">I will remember the Professorship, tho with more will I fear than ability to be of any service.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Taylor Coleridge had asked for Southey&#8217;s help to secure the Professorship of Common Law on the Vinerian Foundation at the University of Oxford. Coleridge&#8217;s campaign was unsuccessful and in January 1824 it was announced that Philip Williams (1780&#8211;1843), a Fellow of New College, Oxford, and a barrister at Winchester had been appointed. </note>
