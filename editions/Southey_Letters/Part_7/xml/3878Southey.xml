Without knowing that I had any immediate interest in the question, he took some pains to show me that for a boy of talents it would be more advantageous to be elected off to Trinity Col. than to Ch. Ch.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Herbert Hill’s eldest son, Edward Hill, was about to attempt to become a King’s Scholar at Westminster School, which would allow him to proceed to a Closed Scholarship at either Christ Church, Oxford, or Trinity College, Cambridge. Wordsworth as Master of Trinity College may have given partial advice that Cambridge was a better option for a young man seeking a life at university; there was no certainty that a King’s Scholar would receive a Fellowship once he graduated. But at Christ Church, a King’s Scholar immediately became one of the body of Students, with a modest stipend that was guaranteed for life, if the recipient wished and he obeyed the rules of the College. If the Students took university degrees in a timely fashion then their stipend would increase. However, the rules governing Studentships were strict and anyone who married, did not take Holy Orders or accepted a paid occupation had to resign. Edward Hill chose Christ Church, Oxford.</note> The scholarship while it lasts (which is till the Masters degree is taken) is worth 40£ a year, – <del>not xxxx</del> not much less therefore, according to his account than a studentship, – the fellowships are 4 – or 500£. For these indeed a Westminster scholar has only the same chance as other scholars, but caeteris paribus<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">‘All other things being equal’.</note> there would be a wish to prefer him. For one who chuses a college life, the Ch. Ch. destination would be obviously the best, because <del>tho of inferior value in its</del> the Studentship there is every thing; but in any other case <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">Dr W.</ref> is perhaps right in representing the Cambridge chance as worth more than the Oxford certainty.</p>
