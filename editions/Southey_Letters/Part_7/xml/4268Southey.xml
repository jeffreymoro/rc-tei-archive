        <p rend="indent1"> I have thus patiently set before you all that is said of his literary character. Where is the praise? No person who reads the paper can possibly suppose &lt;that&gt; the writer of it considers the <hi rend="ital">success</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="ital">popularity</hi> of an <del>writer</del> &lt;author&gt; <hi rend="ital">in his own age</hi> to be any proof of merit. &#8211; The truth is that I <del>had</del> &lt;thought&gt; as little <del>thought</del> of <del>attempting to</del> reviving the dead, as of slaying the slain. But Hayley was so decidedly the most popular Poet of his day, that &lt;as such&gt; the Laureateship was offered to him, as it was when it last fell vacant to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref>
          <note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">William Hayley was offered the role of Poet Laureate in 1790 and Walter Scott was offered the same position in 1813; both declined.</note> &#8211; upon the principle of <hi rend="ital">detur digniori</hi>:<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;let it be given to the most worthy&#8217;.</note> &amp; as such he must hold a place in the history of English literature: And by taking out of his volumes what was worth repeating, <del>&amp;</del> telling it in a better manner than his own, &amp; intermingling it with remarks upon English poetry, &#8211; I considered myself as contributing something like a chapter to that history.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  As a man, I have praised him, deservedly &amp; honestly. Hayley is no more to me than Hecuba,<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;What&#8217;s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba&#8217; (<title>Hamlet</title>, Act 2, scene 2, line 530). Hecuba was the Queen of Troy in Homer&#8217;s <title>Iliad</title>.</note> I had never the slightest intercourse with him, or with any one belonging to him. His faults I have not dissembled, but I have praised the general tenor of a life devoted to better pursuits than those of gain, &#8211; or of the turf or the field; &#8211; &amp; treated him as a gentleman &amp; a scholar ought always to be treated.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">   With regard to the article in your fourth number,<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">The review by John Hoppner (1758&#8211;1810) and William Gifford of William Hayley&#8217;s <title>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</title> (1809) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 2 (November 1809), 433&#8211;444, published 30 December 1809.</note> if my paper were more in opposition to it than it is (for I join with it in condemning his life of Romney<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 309: &#8216;The Life of Romney could not be rated lower than its demerits deserve&#8217;, referring to William Hayley&#8217;s <title>The Life of George Romney, Esq.</title> (1809), no. 1177 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note>) I should think it of no consequence, &#8211; that article being as compleatly dead &amp; buried as Hayley himself. Beyond all doubt consistency is most desirable in a Review; but that &lt;can&gt; only be maintained when the Journal is conducted upon settled principles of faith, politics, philosophy &amp; taste. The Q R. is orthodox &amp; loyal; farther than this it has no pretension to consistency. I believe that I have never advanced a single <hi rend="ital">principle</hi> in it, which has not at some time or other (sometimes in the same number) &amp; sometimes certainly with marked design, received a point blank contradiction in its pages.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I send you herewith a few passages of censure which may be inserted in perfect consistency with the intent &amp; tenour of the paper. As for <hi rend="ital">sobering down</hi> the praise, I am a loss to discover where the praise is, &amp; so will you when you <del>xxxx</del> reconsider it. For I take it for granted there can be no wish that the approbation bestowed upon him for his love of literature &amp; the fine arts, &amp; the generous terms upon which he lived with <del>the most eminent</del> &lt;some&gt; of his contemporaries should be either withdrawn or abated.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You are afraid that the paper might do a great disservice to literature &amp; morals. I should think my character a sufficient guarantee &lt;against&gt; any such danger. But I pray you put it into <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</ref> hands, &#8211; &amp; if he <del>points out</del> &lt;finds&gt; any thing in it which could in his judgement possibly be injurious to morals, &#8211; let him strike &lt;it&gt; out.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You ask as a favour to yourself that I would make alterations. I shall make all the alteration of which the paper will admit; &lt;That is, against the scruples of commendation in one scale, I will throw a few grains of censure into the other.&gt; But if <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gifford</ref> is no longer capable of conducting the Review (which I hear from <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter Scott</ref> is his own account) I think you should acquaint me who those friends are by whose advice it is conducted. No future Editor, be he who he may, must expect to exercise the same discretion over my papers which <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gifford</ref> has done. I will at any time curtail what may be deemed too long, &amp; consider any objections that may be made with a disposition <del>always</del> to defer to them where it can be done without sacrificing my own judgement upon <del>a</del> points which may seem to me important. But my age, &amp; (I may add without <del>xxxxx</del> arrogance) the rank which I hold in literature entitle me to say, that I will never again write under the correction of any one.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  I have never spared time, research or pains of any kind, in any thing that I have written for you. This I am sure you know. And nothing of mine has ever brought disgrace upon the Review, or involved you in any difficulty as the Publisher. On the contrary the &lt;QR&gt; would sometimes have been saved from merited obloquy, if it had taken the bias which I would have given it. The events of life are uncertain, &#8211; life itself still more so. How much or how little I may contribute to that Journal in future depends upon circumstances which no one can foresee. But whenever such of my papers as are worthy of preservation shall be collected (&#8211; whether you permit <del>to xxx</del> it to be done while am able to do it, &lt;to restore them where they have been mutilated,&gt; &amp; to incorporate other matter with them, &#8211; or whether it be done after my decease) I shall be well content that posterity should judge of my &lt;opinions&gt; by what will there be found.<note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title> (1832).</note> And I am quite certain that such a republication would be creditable &amp; advantageous both to you &amp; to myself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Before I conclude I will say a few words concerning the Q R. without any apprehension of offending you by a freedom which proceeds from good will, &amp; has your interest in view. Nothing could be so injurious to that Journal as an opinion that you were endeavouring to get it conducted upon cheap terms, &amp; that you wished to keep it virtually under your own management. Such an opinion is getting abroad, &amp; you must be aware that your enemies &amp; the enemies of the Review will be very desirous of spreading it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">  I <del>am at a loss to</del> &lt;cannot&gt; conjecture what the objections can be which have prevented you from closing with <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref>; &#8211; for objections in some quarter or other it is plain there are. He is a person in character, habits &amp; attainments <hi rend="ital">omni exceptione major</hi>,<note n="27" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;beyond all exception&#8217;, a phrase often used to describe witnesses in legal cases who were of good character.</note> a thorough scholar, thoroughly bred, with a high University character, &amp; good connections; a man of business, punctual, honourable well-principled &amp; high-principled, independent &amp; discreet, &amp; in addition to the security arising from his temper, judgement &amp; discretion, there is that of his professional knowledge. It is absolutely impossible to find a man better qualified for such a responsibility as the editorship of the Q R requires.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">   What I have said upon this subject is not more serious than friendly, if it be taken as it is meant, &amp; so I am persuaded you will take it. The only difference which any arrangement concerning it can make to myself is, that for an Editor who had confidence in me, &amp; whose way of thinking coincided with my own, I should sometimes put my shoulders to the wheel, when otherwise I might rather be disposed to employ them in a different manner. But it is of consequence to you that the Review should go on regularly, that there should not prevail an opinion of its being loosely &amp; uncertainly conducted, &amp; that it should be in <del>com</del> sufficient hands. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My Dialogues<note n="28" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Sir Thomas More: or Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> are so far advanced that I shall soon send them to press.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you will send me a set of the Missionary Register, beginning with the second volume (the first you sent me long ago) I will prepare for you a paper upon what has been done by the Church Missionary Society.<note n="29" place="foot" resp="editors">
