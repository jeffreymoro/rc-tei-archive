        <p rend="indent1">It is quite necessary that the Editor of the QR. should be a person in whom Government can confide; but I have no notion that any member of the Government would be consulted in the choice, or that any pledge can be required. The truth is that Government &lt;interferes&gt; in such things less than for its own interest, &amp; the interests of the country it ought to do. Upon the course to be pursued by such a Journal, you &amp; I are perfectly agreed. &#8211; The only member of Government with whom I have any direct communication (except by accident) is <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Charles Wynn</ref>, &#8211; &amp; I will without delay let him know my wishes upon the subject.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 2 November 1822, Letter 3913. Gifford was considering whether to retire as editor of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>; Southey wished John Taylor Coleridge to succeed Gifford (as he briefly did in 1824&#8211;1825).</note> I have written to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to [John Murray], 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.</note> with whom the choice must rest.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What you said concerning the payment of a printers bill may perhaps rather imply need in the printer than in the bookseller. There is much competition for a great publisher&#8217;s employ; &amp; the booksellers (who as far as I know them, have the true trading spirit, in the worst meaning of the words) &#8211; take advantage of it, so as to pay the lowest possible price, &amp; take eighteen months credit, while they collect their own debts half-yearly. &#8211; The QR is the foundation of <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> fortune. When he moved from Fleet Street, it was an adventure hazarded in consequence of the success of the review, &amp; without the capital required.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Murray had launched the <title>Quarterly Review</title> in 1809; he moved his publishing firm from 32 Fleet Street to grander premises at 50 Albermarle Street in 1812, when he bought the business belonging to William Miller (1769&#8211;1844; <title>DNB</title>).</note> And I know that a year or two afterwards he was so much in arrears with the Courier<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Courier</title> (1792&#8211;1842) was a London evening newspaper. Southey received a free copy through his long friendship with Daniel Stuart, its co-owner 1796&#8211;1822.</note> for advertising, that they would advertise for him no longer without prompt payment. At present I rather doubt his judgement as a publisher, than his prosperity. He must have lost a great deal by large prices given for bad books: &amp; latterly the bookselling trade has suffered more by the pressure upon the gentry,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Corn prices had been falling since 1819 and reached their lowest point in 1822; this situation produced political controversy and calls from some landowners for action to help agriculture.</note> than any other. But the Quarterly is not affected by this in any material degree; &#8211; it is likely to gain quite as many purchasers as it may lose; &amp; it alone, is a fortune.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Had there been any Gods in Albermarle Street, an earthquake must surely have been felt &lt;there&gt; or some other portentous signal &#8211; at what passed with Mawman.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Mawman (1759&#8211;1827), bookseller and author from York, who became a well-known London publisher. His firm was based in the City of London. Mawman had proposed to set up a rival journal to the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, edited by Southey, though this project did not materialise. Southey was, instead, campaigning for John Taylor Coleridge to take over the <title>Quarterly Review</title> after Gifford&#8217;s retirement.</note> But tho I am arrived at that age when the necessity of laying by money is felt, &amp; tends strongly to create the love of it, I do not think any offers however advantageous, ought to withdraw me from a course of life so congenial to me in all respects, as that which I now enjoy: nor that I ought to give up more time to temporary subjects, than is necessary for supplying my ways &amp; means. The offer may be for your consideration, if our present object fails; &#8211; but I hope it will not fail.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You ask me respecting Lingard I had sent for <del>it</del> &lt;his history&gt; with an intention of reviewing <del>x xxx x</del> it &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</ref>

Neither book was reviewed in the <title>Quarterly Review</title> at this time.</note> &#8211; a task which may very well be transferred to you, without any inconvenience <del>xx</del> on my part. The book arrived only two or three days ago. I read the reign of William Rufus, which is not nearly so good as <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</ref>, &#8211; &amp; the Roman period, which is very well done, infinitely better than I have ever seen it done before.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Lingard, <title>A History of England: from the First Invasion by the Romans to the Accession of Henry VIII</title>, 3 vols (London, 1819), I, pp. 457&#8211;487, 1&#8211;63, on the reign of William II (c. 1056&#8211;1100; King of England 1087&#8211;1100; <title>DNB</title>) and the Roman involvement in Britain from 55 BC to the fifth century. Southey compares the first of these treatments with that in Sharon Turner, <title>History of England</title>, 3 vols (London, 1814&#8211;1823), I, pp. 108&#8211;130.</note> Farther I have not &lt;yet&gt; seen. But I have read his former publication &#8211; a history of the A-Saxon Church,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">John Lingard, <title>The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church</title> (1806). An edition from 1810 was no. 1728 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> which is full of sophistry, &amp; that worst kind of falsehood which is produced by the suppression of truths. &#8211; The question of suppression in Beckets history is the subject of an Appendix to Beringtons Hist. of Henry 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> a book of great ability,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Berington (1743&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of the Reign of Henry the Second, and of Richard and John, his Sons; With the Events of the Period, from 1154 to 1216.

Appendix II defended the conduct of St Thomas Becket (c. 1119&#8211;1170; <title>DNB</title>), Archbishop of Canterbury 1162&#8211;1170.</note> which you should peruse when you set about Lingard &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>.
