Turner speculated about the possible descent of the Welsh from another group of people called the Cimmerians, who had invaded Assyria from north of the Caucasus in the eighth century BC. These Cimmerians were often ascribed the subterranean habits of their legendary namesakes &#8211; an error repeated by Turner. Southey possessed a second edition of this work from 1807, no. 2876 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note>
