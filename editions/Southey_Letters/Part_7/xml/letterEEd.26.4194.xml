        <p rend="indent1">The inclosed biographical letter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to John May, 27 May&#8211;26 June 1824, Letter 4191.</note> may serve to remind you that I am in the land of the living, which I am sorry to say, some of my correspondents seem to have forgotten. That you are so, I happen to know from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">your god-daughter</ref>. &#8211; I know very little of what is going on in London; three lines from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> telling me about three weeks ago that he had sent a second edition of the B. of the Church<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824). It went into three editions in 1824.</note> to press are all that I have heard from him since my return. There is I suspect a little intentional slight in this to make me understand that booksellers are greater personages than authors. &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1">I have been busy upon a review of Hayleys Memoirs which I expect to finish tomorrow.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of John Johnson (1769&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263&#8211;311.</note> that done my second volume<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> goes forthwith to press, all hope of obtaining the book from Spain<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford&#8217;s &#8216;On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez&#8217;, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221&#8211;223. It mentioned Olivarez&#8217;s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877 and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Southey had then sought the assistance of George Canning. Finally, Southey had written to John Mitford, 12 April 1824, Letter 4171. </note> being at an end.</p>
