            <p rend="indent1"> I am so compleatly removed from what is called literary society (which is at this time about the worst society in the world) that not a breath of opinion concerning your book<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Savage Landor, <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title> (1824).</note> has reached me, nor have I seen any thing which has been written concerning it, except <ref type="m" target="people.html#HareJulius ">Julius Hare’s</ref> paper in the London Magazine.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘On Walter Savage Landor’s Imaginary Conversations’, <title>London Magazine</title>, 9 (May 1824), 523–541.</note> A more striking book never issued from the press in these Kingdoms, nor one more certain of surviving the wreck of its generation; &#38; this not from the adventitious <del>xxx xxxxx</del> importance of the subject, but from the excellence of the workmanship; – – for your prose is always, what the most felicitous passages of your poetry are, as excellent in the expression as in the conception.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  My own Colloquies<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> are now so far advanced, that it will soon become my primary object to compleat them. They will contain a connected &#38; extensive view of our existing state of society, <del>&#38;</del> with all its enormous evils, – &#38; I hope the statement will be startling enough to make some of our political men (I will not call them statesmen) rub their eyes. You will feel in the perusal, as I do, that where there is most difference in our views, it is to be explained by the difference of latitude between Tuscany &#38; Cumberland. I should agree more nearly with you in Florence, &#38; at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> you would find yourself more in sympathy with me.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> By way of relieving the Dialogues I introduce some of them <del>x</del> with descriptions of the scenery which lies within the circuit of my usual walks; half a dozen views of it, admirably drawn by <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">William Westall</ref>, are now in the engravers hands.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall produced six illustrations: ‘Druidical Stones near Keswick’; ‘Derwentwater, Bassenthwaite-water and Skiddaw, from Walla Crag’; ‘Derwentwater from Strandshagg’; ‘Crosthwaite Church and Skiddaw’; ‘Greta Hall, Derwentwater and Newlands’; and ‘Tarn of Blencathra’.</note> The book will command notice, &#38; provoke hostility. One edition will sell, some of the rising generation will be leavened by it, &#38; in the third &#38; fourth generations its foresight will be proved, &#38; perhaps some of its effects may be seen.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The books you sent me were lucky enough to escape all injury. I have been reading Casaubons letters.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614), <title>Epistolae</title> (1656), no. 453 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> If my Book of the Church<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> has reached you (as I trust it has, with its companions) you will see that I ought to have read these letters before: you will perceive also that the view which <del>you</del> they have led you to take of James’s character,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue VIII in Walter Savage Landor, <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. [93]–112, where Casaubon converses with James I and VI (1567–1625; King of Scotland 1567–1603, King of Great Britain 1603–1625; <title>DNB</title>). Southey had expressed his views on the King in <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 303–335; especially pp. 328–330. Southey was generally favourable to James, emphasising his tolerant and moderate views on religious controversies.</note> very much accords with the opinion that I have expressed concerning him.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">   My family, thank God, is going on well. The two eldest girls<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha Southey</ref>.</note> are in the south, &#38; greatly do I miss them. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">My little boy</ref> is old enough to have begun upon the Latin grammar; – &#38; a happier creature does not at this hour exist upon the wide earth. It is in our power to make <del>cxxx</del> children happy while they are children; – &#38; yet how generally is their happiness curtailed; &#38; as far as nature will per[MS torn]stroyed, by unwise restrictions, &#38; the miserable discipline of our great schools in which the boys are bred up <del>to be x</del> &#60;to&#62; the abuse of power. If <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> lives, &#38; I live to instruct him, he will escape these evils; but how uncertain this must needs be I am fully sensible.
