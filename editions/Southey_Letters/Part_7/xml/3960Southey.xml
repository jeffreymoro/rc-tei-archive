He was one of the organisers of the relief operation for Portuguese civilians funded by the British government in 1811 and received due praise at <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), III, pp. 189–193, which noted his ‘unwearied exertion’ (p. 193).</note> communications have reached me this day, &#38; as they come without any note from himself, &#38; I know not where to address, I must request you to let him know they are received, &#38; to thank him for them, when you have an opportunity. – Sir J. called here once, but it was at a time when I was absent. – I shall have great pleasure in giving him the high credit which he deserves, &#38; would apply to him for details of which he must have an abundant store, but he writes such an abominably fine style, that it is hopeless to look for any thing like specific information from him, beyond what from the nature of his employment he could not help giving. If he had kept a simple journal, or could give me his unvarnished recollections they would be worth a great deal both for his own name &#38; my history</p>

He served in the Portuguese Embassy in London for nearly forty years and was briefly chargé d’affaires in 1822. His brother, Alexandre Tomás de Morais Sarmento, 1st Viscount of Banho (1786–1840), was also a diplomat. </note> has written a journal of a campaign in which he was engaged on the Vouga in 1809,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Trant had raised a group of volunteers in Coimbra, including many from among the students at the university, to defend northern Portugal; they held the line of the Vouga river against French forces, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), II, pp. 197–202.</note> while Soult<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean-de-Dieu Soult (1769–1851), the French Marshal who commanded the invasion of northern Portugal in 1809.</note> was at Porto. Can you not let Sarmiento know that I am very desirous of seeing this journal, &#38; that it would be for the honour &#38; glory of Portugal, &#38; of the parties concerned – (he himself is one) – that it should be communicated to me.

It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784–1841; <title>DNB</title>), Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1821–1828 was eager to extend this idea and produced ‘An Outline of a Plan of Emigration to Upper Canada’ in January 1823.

Each family would receive 100 acres of land.</note> The scheme is from the Colonial Office, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has sent me the papers.</p>
