        <p rend="indent1">The blockade having been broken up, three mails have arrived to day, &#8211; that of the day being still due. They bring me your letter by which I am glad to perceive that this hard winter has not frozen up all the ink at the Exchequer, as I began to apprehend.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">

France was preparing to invade Spain to restore royal absolutism and the Whigs were urging the government to pressurise France not to intervene.</note> I hope some person will remind them of their sympathy for the Spaniards during the last contest. Oh that my second volume<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> were ready at this time, for their sake.

She unwittingly killed Hercules by giving him a shirt smeared with the toxic blood of the centaur Nessus.</note>
