          <salute>Dear Caroline</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1">Thank you for your verses,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles had offered to contribute &#8216;The Mariner&#8217;s Hymn&#8217;, later published in <title>Solitary Hours</title> (London, 1826), pp. 22&#8211;24, to Alfred Pettet&#8217;s <title>Original Sacred Music</title> (London, n.d., c. 1825&#8211;1827); when it was rejected it was replaced by &#8216;I weep, but not rebellious tears&#8217;, later published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [227]&#8211;228.</note> &#8211; which I transcribed rather than part with the original, &amp; sent to <ref type="m" target="people.html#PettetAlfred">the poor musician</ref>. &#8211; I send you his Prospectus &#8211; &amp; take it for granted that he will send you the Work.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am fairly rid of my annual disease,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s annual attack of hay fever.</note> &amp; in other respects materially better than when my last was written, so much so that I was on the summit of Helvellin last week. Send me as good an account of your own amendment, &amp; we will look on to many meetings, &#8211; some of them I hope here &#8211; in this lovely land.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Soon I shall have more verses to send you.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and Bowles were beginning work on &#8216;Robin Hood&#8217;. The resulting incomplete poem was published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [1]&#8211;36.</note> You have <hi rend="ital">not</hi> proved yourself a defaulter yet. And I have more schemes for you. I have plans for three or four plays which you could execute, &#8211; for you will not pretend to deny or doubt that you can write dramatically.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Today we heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, &amp; of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref>. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> is still near Portsmouth, in high health &amp; spirits. Of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> I heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref> under whose roof she is at this time. If she is not contented there, it will not be for want of kindness on the part of the family; &#8211; for if a dog was to scratch at <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoots</ref> door with my name on his collar, he would be taken into the parlour, &amp; made as much of as your poor old Ranger, &#8211; whom I remember <del>with xx</del> in a manner that proves the truth of the old saying.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This is a hasty letter &#8211; but I shall soon write again when I transmit a few more stanzas, &#8211; &amp; two half letters are better than one whole one</p>
        <p>
          God bless you	<lb/>
