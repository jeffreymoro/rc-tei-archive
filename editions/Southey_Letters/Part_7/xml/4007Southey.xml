[MS missing]t it is much the same, &#38; varies according as the majority of the Seniors happen to be of good or bad dispositions. If you should have any temporary hardships to endure from this cause, make you a firm determination that you will never exercise upon others such injustice as you have suffered. The worst effect which school-tyranny produces, is when it disposes a boy to treat others ill in his turn because he has himself been treated so. – I am not afraid of its producing this effect upon you. But the advantage of having been at such a school, you will feel thro life.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">It will not be long before I see you.
