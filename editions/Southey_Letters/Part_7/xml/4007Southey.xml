        <p rend="indent1">I know not whether College has been altered from what it was three or four &amp; thirty years ago; or if there be still a <del>xxxxx</del> greater degree of tyranny going <del>the</del> on there, than can ever exist among the town boys. [MS missing]t it is much the same, &amp; varies according as the majority of the Seniors happen to be of good or bad dispositions. If you should have any temporary hardships to endure from this cause, make you a firm determination that you will never exercise upon others such injustice as you have suffered. The worst effect which school-tyranny produces, is when it disposes a boy to treat others ill in his turn because he has himself been treated so. &#8211; I am not afraid of its producing this effect upon you. But the advantage of having been at such a school, you will feel thro life.</p>
