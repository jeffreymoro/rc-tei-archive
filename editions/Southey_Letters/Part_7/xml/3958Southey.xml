The title was an ancient one, dating back to 1465, but Southey had to content himself by describing the Marquis as ‘a grandee of the highest class, and the representative of some of the proudest names in Spanish history’, (<title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (1823–1832), II, p. 33).</note> names, – that is what are the old families which centered in him, – for I believe he was the representative of a great many, – &#38; I should like what I have written concerning him a great deal better, it two or three of the noblest names were introduced in it. The want of a Spanish Nobiliario,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Juan Batista Lavana (1550–1624), <title>Nobiliario de D. Pedro Conde de Barcelos Hijo del Rey D.

I have contracted an uneasy habit of superfluous accuracy, which is an expensive one by the consumption of time that it occasions, but if the fruit is not worth the cost, it is nevertheless worth something.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am proceeding with the second volume,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> in high good humour with my work.

However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

            <p rend="indent1">Government has a plan before it for assisting parishes to relieve themselves of their able-bodied poor, by lending money to carry them to Canada.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Parliament had voted £30,000 in 1822 to finance the settlement of poor Irish families in Upper Canada. Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton (1784–1841; <title>DNB</title>), Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies 1821–1828, was eager to extend this idea and produced ‘An Outline of a Plan of Emigration to Upper Canada’ in January 1823. He proposed that parishes all over the United Kingdom should be able to mortgage their poor rates in order to repay loans from the government, which would finance sending the parishes’ paupers to Canada. Each family would receive 100 acres of land.</note> <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has sent me the plan as it comes from the colonial office. The money is to be repaid, with interest, from the poor rates, – which upon every head so removed will <del>xx sav</del> find an immediate saving of about four fifths, – while at the same time the breed of paupers is diminished, &#38; more work left for the hands that remain. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</ref> &#38; I talked of such a scheme last summer, &#38; he had been acting upon the same views in his own parish,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Playford, near Ipswich.</note> which he had persuaded to ship off two or three families.</p>
