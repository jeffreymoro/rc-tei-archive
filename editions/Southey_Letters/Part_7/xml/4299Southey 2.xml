        <p rend="indent1"> When I have told you that we are all well (thank God) &#8211; that Rumpelstilschen<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">One of the feline inhabitants of Greta Hall.</note> is grown very corpulent, &#8211; &amp; that we see nobody, &amp; hear nothing <del>xxx</del> except the wind, &amp; now &amp; then Jeffrey at nights,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey, <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), I, p. 442.

        <p rend="indent1"> Why, I have recollected this: that &#8220;the royal patent self-illuminating pocket lamp&#8221;<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">A small tin box, out of which a wick, soaked in oil, protruded.
