          <salute> My dear Sir</salute>

        <p rend="indent1">I was glad to hear of you from Bremhill,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The vicarage at Bremhill (now Bremhill Court) was the home of William Lisle Bowles.</note> &amp; to find that there is a fair prospect of seeing <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</ref> among the mountains, which his letter as well as yours leads me to expect. There is little likelihood of our meeting, till it be here, on the old ground. I have too much employment at this desk, to quit it for more than a day or two for a long while to come. I cannot say that this is any privation. Were it not for my Uncle &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">Mr Hill&#8217;s</ref> time of life, &amp; the thoughts which that consideration must needs bring with it, a journey to London is one of the last things I should ever think of. The sort of life that one leads there agrees very well with my health, but very little with my inclinations.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Dickson, the steward of the Hospital<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Greenwich Hospital owned much of the land around Keswick. One of the most important local administrators of this estate was the steward Thomas Dixon (dates unknown).</note> is very hard at work upon an alteration which will accommodate you more than any other person. He is making you a carriage road in the line of the present foot path thro the fields, &amp; has cut away for you three feet of the hill, before you reach the lake. A great number of men are employed, &amp; I believe the main object is to give them employment, which the Hospital for some time past, has very properly, been very liberal in doing. Lord William<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lord William Gordon (1744&#8211;1823), son of Cosmo George Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon (1720&#8211;1752). He owned the Waterend estate on the west side of Derwentwater.</note> has been here about four months &amp; is likely to remain till the summer. He is so afraid of the weather, that he has never once been to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>; but he is chearful as ever when you find him by his fireside. Sir Frederick Morshead has brought home a wife,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Frederick Treise Morshead, 2nd Baronet (1783&#8211;1828), lived at Derwent Lodge, Keswick. On 15 November 1821 he had married Jane Morshead, n&#233;e Warwick (d. 1832) of Warwick Hall, Cumberland. Allonby, where they met, was a popular sea-bathing resort on the Cumberland coast.</note> after a summary courtship at Allanbay, &#8211; it is said they mean to make this place their residence. From his refusing an invitation to <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calverts</ref>, upon the pretext of a cold, which the Ladies of his family smiled<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Calvert (c. 1775&#8211;1834), n&#233;e Mitchinson, wife of William Calvert; and Mary Calvert (1804&#8211;1890), daughter of William Calvert. She married Joshua Stanger (1801&#8211;1854), son of James Stanger, in 1824.</note> when they mentioned, it seems that he is as little disposed to mix in society as ever. I have not called upon him. The other news of the place is that the Vicarage &amp; the Royal Oak<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royal Oak is one of the two main inns at Keswick.</note> have been rebuilt, &#8211; that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brothers</ref> family have the hooping cough, &#8211; (at a most unpleasant time when an addition to their number is almost daily expected) &#8211; &amp; that <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Mr Edmondson</ref> is sadly altered in appearances by the frequent recurrence of a very dangerous disorder. He has been to Edinburgh to advice, &amp; thinks himself better, not for the consultation, but for the journey.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">There is at least this advantage in writing a letter for the newspapers,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, published 11 January 1822, Letter 3776.</note> that it is sure to reach all one&#8217;s friends. My temper is very happily suited to my condition; &#8211; it is just raised enough by such attacks to overcome the disinclination which I feel for any thing like controversy. Perhaps I should <del>not</del> have <del>returned</del> considered <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">his Satanic Lordships</ref> note<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In the &#8216;Appendix&#8217; to &#8216;The Two Foscari&#8217;, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: &#8216;I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey&#8217;s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.&#8217; Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May&#8211;August 1817. The &#8216;calumnies&#8217; Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a &#8216;League of Incest&#8217; during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</note> as too <hi rend="ital">blackguard</hi> for notice (there is really no other epithet which can characterise it so well) if it had <del>b</del> not been that so direct a charge of slander seemed to call for as direct a denial, &amp; that it gave me an opportunity of repeating a castigation which he felt so severely, &amp; deserved so well.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), &#8216;Preface&#8217;, pp. xvii&#8211;xxii, where Southey denounced &#8216;the Satanic School&#8217; of modern poetry without naming any one poet. However, this was clearly a riposte to Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819), whose suppressed &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, mocking Southey, had circulated widely.</note> On my part, I am willing that the matter should rest. What I have written has been written fairly &amp; openly, &#8211; public criticism had been silent in that quarter where it ought to have spoken loudest &amp; with most authority, &#8211; &amp; because of that silence, it became me more especially to speak, lest I should be implicated in the charge of either favouring or fearing the most atrocious writer of the age. In so doing I was sure of the approbation of all who had any regard for public decency or private moral, &#8211; &amp; the enmity of the cut-throat part of the press was what I have long been used to. If it be necessary I will lay on the lash again; &#8211; but not if I can help it, &#8211; because my time may &amp; ought to be more worthily employed; &amp; the course which he is taking must have the effect of excluding his works from sight at least, &amp; very much from general circulation. Now that he has unmasked himself, the tendency &amp; purpose of those writings in which the poison was covertly administered will be seen, &amp; resented accordingly [MS torn] all who look to the morals of their children.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am far advanced in the press with the first volume of the Peninsular War.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> My Book of the Church<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">

My way is to be a long while preparing for a subject &amp; maturing the plan, before I set seriously about executing it. I hope &amp; believe that this book will be useful</p>
