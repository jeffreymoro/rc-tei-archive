            <p rend="indent1">Fortune, I think, has fitted you with a physician<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Jacques (d. 1832), a doctor based in Harrogate.</note> to your taste. He has <hi rend="ital">tabooed</hi> ham, vinegar, red–herrings, and all fruits. But if the melancholy Jaques<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The ‘Melancholy Jaques’, a character in <title>As You Like It</title> (1599).</note> were not a heretic, he would never have put you to a trial so far beyond the strength of women. If Eve, when she had the choice of the whole garden besides (a garden, too, as rich in fruits as William Herbert’s,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Herbert (1778–1847; <title>DNB</title>). He abandoned a career in politics and the law for the Church of England, serving as Rector of Spofforth, near Wetherby, 1814–1840, and Dean of Manchester 1840–1847. Herbert was also a poet and a noted writer on botany. His garden at the Old Rectory, Spofforth, was well known and the site of Herbert’s development of the Spofforth crocus.</note> which you have been visiting, is in flowers), could not refrain from the forbidden apple,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In <title>Genesis</title> 3, Eve, the first woman, was tempted to eat the forbidden fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. The fruit was usually identified as an apple.</note> how does he suppose that a daughter of Eve can resist strawberries, cherries, and currants, to say nothing of green gooseberries and hard pears?</p>

I have not much to tell you.

But this new leaf has been produced in a curious manner, the stem proceeding from the base of the youngest and largest of its three ancestors, and all the folded part from the mother, or middle one; so that its genealogy is more puzzling than the relationship between Dick and John.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Dick and John’ were commonly used for fictional characters, including by Southey himself in his Botany Bay Eclogue, ‘John, Samuel, &#38; Richard’, <title>Poems</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp. 92–98.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I am glad you take so kindly to the waters, and that they seem to agree with you so well. What a happy quarter of an hour you must pass between the two draughts!

If <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Mr. Wordsworth</ref> goes with us, we shall travel in a jaunting–car, which will bring us all back. If I go alone, I shall follow your course to Skipton, and chaise it, solo, from thence, which will be better than taking the Penrith road, and sleeping the second night at Borough Bridge. I do not wish to be more than three days at Harrogate, at the most.</p>
