(The latter eventually decided not to take legal action.) Southey believed that the letter was a response to the one he had written to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 8 December 1824, Letter 4289 (published 13 December 1824) &#8211; which was, in turn, a reply to the material on Southey in Thomas Medwin (1788&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron: Noted During a Residence with his Lordship at Pisa, in the Years 1821 and 1822</title> (1824).</note> &#8211; Thanks you for marking &amp; knowing how heartily &#8211; in the Swedes english &#8211; I do contempt it &#8211; </p>
