<salute>My dear Edith</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">We have been this morning to hear Rowland Hill.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Rowland Hill (1744–1833; <title>DNB</title>), a popular evangelical preacher who was not formally attached to any denomination. He built Surrey Chapel in Blackfriars Road, Southwark, in 1782–1783 and preached there when he was in London.</note> <ref type="m" target="people.html#HughesMaryAnne">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hughes</ref> called at his house last week to know when he would preach, &#38; was answered by a demure looking woman, that the Lord willing her master would preach on Sunday morning at ½ past ten &#38; in the evening at six. So this morning I set off with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">EMay</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi></ref> &#38; Ann R.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Ann Rickman (b. 1808), Rickman’s daughter.</note> We were in good time, &#38; got into the free seats, where &#60;there were&#62; a few poor people, one of whom told to go round to another door &#38; we should be admitted. Another door we found with orders that the doorkeepers should take no money for admittance, &#38; a request that no person would enter in pattens.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A protective overshoe, with a wooden or metal sole, to prevent the shoe coming into contact with the ground.</note> Doorkeeper there was none, &#38; we therefore ventured in &#38; took our seats upon a bench beside some decent old women. One of these with the help of another &#38; busier old piece of femininity, desired us to remove to a bench behind us, close to the wall, the seats we had taken, they said, belonged to particular persons, but if we would sit where she directed till the service was over, we should then be invited into the pews, if there was room. I did not immediately understand this, nor what we were to do in the pews when the service was at an end, till I recollected that in most schism shops<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Nonconformist chapels.</note> the sermon is looked upon as the main thing &#60;for&#62; which the congregation assemble. This was so much the case here that people were continually coming in during all the previous part of the service,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">At Surrey Chapel the church service closely followed the Church of England service.</note> to which very little attention was paid: the people <del>coughing al</del> sitting or standing as they pleased, &#38; coughing almost incessantly.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I suppose what is properly called the Morning service had been performed at an early hour, for we had only the Communion Service. Rowland Hills pulpit is raised very high, &#38; before it at about half the height is the readers desk on his right, &#38; the Clerks on his left, the Clerk being a very grand personage, with a sonorous voice. The singing was so general &#38; so good that I joined in it, &#38; doubtless made it better by the addition of my voice. During the singing after Rowland had made his prayer before the sermon, we, as respectable strangers were beckoned from our humble places by a gentleman in one of the pews. <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> R</ref> &#38; her daughter were stationed in one pew between two gentlemen of Rowlands flock; &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">EMay</ref> &#38; I in another between a Lady &#38; a person corresponding very much in countenance to the character of a light boy<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A young man who was light-hearted and uninterested in serious matters such as religion.</note> in the old <del>xx</del> Methodistical magazines. He was very civil, &#38; by finding out the hymns for me, &#38; presenting me with the book, enabled me to sing, – which I did to admiration.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Rowland – a fine tall old man, with strong features, – very like his portrait, – began by reading three verses for his text, stooping to the book in a very peculiar manner. Having done this, he stood up erect &#38; said Why the text is a sermon! &#38; a very weighty one too. I could not always follow his delivery, the loss of his teeth rendering his words sometimes indistinct, &#38; the more so because his pronunciation is peculiar, generally giving <hi rend="ital">e</hi> the sound of <hi rend="ital">ai</hi> like the French. His manner was animated &#38; striking, sometimes impressive &#38; dignified, always remarkable: &#38; so powerful a voice I have rarely or never heard. Sometimes he took off his spectacles, frequently stoopd down to read a text, &#38; on these occasions he seemed to double his body, so high did he stand. He told one or two familiar stories, &#38; used some odd expressions, such as “A murrain on those who preach the doctrine that when we are sanctified we do not grow in grace!”<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The doctrine of perfectionism, associated with early Methodism, which taught that Christians could receive ‘entire sanctification’ from God as a second process after conversion. This removed original sin and allowed Christians to enter a state of perfect love.</note> – &#38; again – “I had almost said I had rather see the Devil in the pulpit than an Antinomian!”<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The doctrine that those who have been selected for salvation do not need to obey moral laws.</note> – The purport of his sermon was good, – nothing fanatical, nothing enthusiastic; – &#38; the Calvinism which it expressed was so qualified as to be harmless. The manner that of a performer as great in his line as Kean or Kemble.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Edmund Kean (1787–1833; <title>DNB</title>) and John Philip Kemble (1757–1823; <title>DNB</title>), the leading actors of their day.</note> <del>Tx</del> And this manner it is which has attracted so large a congregation <del>xx</del> about him, all apparently of the better order of persons in business. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">EMay</ref> was very much amused &#38; I am very glad I have heard him at last. It is very well that there should be such preachers for those who have no appetite for better drest food.
