She was from a Cumberland family and had set up business in High Holborn, London, as a &#8216;linen-draper, dealer and chapwoman&#8217;.

        <p rend="indent1">You will find her a timid, shy creature, just at the awkwardest age. It will, I doubt not be of use to her, to be a while from home, &amp; nowhere could she be sooner reconciled to this, her first absence, than with you</p>
