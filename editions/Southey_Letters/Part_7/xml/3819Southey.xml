            >Major-General Samuel Hawker (1763&#8211;1838), who had served in the Peninsular War
            between 1808 and 1811 as commander of the 14th Light Dragoons. His sketches were used in
              <title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey&#8217;s
              History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by
              General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &amp;c. Part I, containing Eight Views,
              illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These pictures could be inserted into the first
            volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
            (1823&#8211;1832). In return, Southey had promised Hawker &#8216;a fair piece of
            handwriting&#8217;; see Southey to Bedford, 23 March 1822, Letter 3815. It is not clear
            which &#8216;song&#8217; he had sent to Hawker.</note> pleases me so much that I could
          find in my heart to <hi rend="ital">sing</hi> him the song which I send him. You must
          inform him that it was written to be sung by myself, I am afraid he will have a very
          inadequate notion of its merit unless <del>x</del> you can explain to him how admirably it
          is adapted to my execution.</p>
