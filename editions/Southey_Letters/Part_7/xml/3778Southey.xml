The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: ‘I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey’s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</note> you will rather admire the temper in which I have answered it, than think any thing which I have said is too severe.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776.

Byron’s criticism of Southey in his ‘Appendix’ to ‘The Two Foscari’ had been widely published in opposition newspapers, including the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 19 December 1821, and the <title>Examiner</title>, 726 (23 December 1821), 810.</note> Before this reply of mine appears in the other Kendal paper; I shall desire them to insert the attack, &#38; the passage from my Preface.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey got his wish. On 12 January 1822 the <title>Westmorland Gazette</title> (‘the other Kendal paper’) printed both Southey’s denunciation of ‘the Satanic School’ of modern poetry from <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), ‘Preface’, pp. xvii–xxii; and an extract from Byron’s attack on Southey in the ‘Appendix’ to the ‘Two Foscari’. Southey’s response to the latter, his letter to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776, was then printed in the <title>Westmorland Gazette</title>, 19 January 1822.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Some good passages have been struck out from the first draught of this reply, for the sake of keeping close to the subject. They may serve for after use.

In one of his drafts of the letter to the <title>Courier</title>, now Huntington MS 6655, Southey had commented: ‘The egregious &#38; incomparable Jeremy,&#60;ever Jeremy the Merry-Bentham&#62; equipped in full motley, has shaken his bells at me, erected his ancient cockscomb, and crowed in <title><del>triumphant</del></title> &#60;exultant&#62; defiance.

On 30 June 1818, during his general election campaign, Brougham had criticised Southey from the hustings at Appleby. Southey debated at length whether to make a public riposte to him – but in the end did not. He also fantasised about what he would do should he receive a challenge to a duel from Brougham. His jokey response to this possibility is published in Appendix 2.</note></p>
