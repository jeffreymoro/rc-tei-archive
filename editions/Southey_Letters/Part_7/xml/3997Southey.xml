He was Secretary and Superintendent of the new Lanark settlement on the Clyde river in Eastern Ontario from its foundation in 1820 until 1830.</note> His purpose is to return in the autumn, &amp; remove his household thither this time next year. As you may well suppose this presses heavily upon my spirits, as any event must needs do which can only be reconciled to us by necessity, &#8211; &amp; absolutely necessary this is. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">His wife</ref> has a friend &amp; relation at Quebec<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Matthew Bell (1769&#8211;1849), a wealthy merchant, iron manufacturer and land speculator in Quebec, originally from Berwick-upon-Tweed.

However I am still able &amp; willing, &#8211; tho too evidently less alert than I was in former days.
