            <p rend="indent1">With regard to any labours in English history, the plan which I not long ago communicated to you of sketching it in a Book of the State down to the accession of the reigning family &#38; following that by the Age of George 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Neither Southey’s ‘The Book of the State’, on British history down to 1714, nor his history of the reign of George III (1738–1820; King of Great Britain 1760–1820; <title>DNB</title>) were written.</note> is all that I <hi rend="ital">dream</hi> of accomplishing. The works on which I ought to employ myself, Grosvenor, are those for which I have laid in stores, on which a large portion of my previous studies may be brought to bear, &#38; for which no other person is at present, or is likely to be hereafter, so well qualified, – because the materials, the disposition &#38; the ability are little likely to meet. Such a work was the Hist. of Brazil,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810–1819).</note> &#38; such will be, if I live to accomplish it, that of the Monastic Orders.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This book was never written.</note></p>
          <p rend="indent1">  The Peninsular War<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> is going on well. The 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> sheet is now on the table.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">   I cannot but smile at your grave admonitions concerning the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Dr Daniel Dove, the central character in Southey’s <title>The Doctor</title> (1834–1847).</note>&#38; would give something to have the satisfaction of reading to you the Chapters which were written last week. Such a variety of ingredients I think never before entered into any book which had a thread of continuity running thro it. I promise you there is as much sense as nonsense there <del>xxx</del>, – it is very much &#60;like&#62; a Trifle where you have whipt cream at the top, sweatmeats below, – &#38; a good solid foundation of <del>ratifia</del> cake well steepd in ratifia.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A sweet alcoholic beverage – either a fortified wine, or fruit-based.</note> You will find a liberal expenditure of long hoarded stores, – such as the reading of few men could supply; – satire &#38; speculation; – truths some of which might beseem the bench or the pulpit, – &#38; others that require the sanction of the Cap &#38; Bells for <del>xx xxx</del> their introduction – And withal a narrative interspersed with <del>all sorts</del> interludes of every kind, – yet still continuous upon a plan of its own, varying from grave to gay, – &#38; taking as wild, &#38; yet as natural a course as one of our mountain streams.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">   Dover I hope will do you all good. – I &#60;am&#62; vexed to think of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henrys</ref> slavery, – &#38; the thought of it made me apply to our friend what Scaliger says of Thuanus in one of his letters, – Optimus vir est, et nostri studiosissimus: sed utinam tantum auderet, quantum potest. Nam hoc unicum deesse illi videtur. – <note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540–1609), on Jacques Auguste de Thou (1553–1617) in <title>Epistolae</title> (Leiden, 1627), Epistle 61, p. 193: ‘He is the best man, the most studious of us, if only he was able, how much would he be able to achieve. This is the only thing that seems missing in him.’ The book was no. 2485 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> I am reading Scaligers Epistles at this time, treading in <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref> steps who gave me the book when I was in town. Not long ago I finished Isaac Casaubons.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614), <title>Epistolae</title> (1656), no. 453 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> Oh what men were these! &#38; thank God men will never be wanting, like them in one respect at least, that they <del>xxxx</del> will pursue the accumulation of knowledge with as much zeal as others follow the pursuit of wealth &#38; derive a thousand fold more pleasures in the acquirement.</p>
