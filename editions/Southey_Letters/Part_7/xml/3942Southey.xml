Wynn had played a central role in re-founding the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion in 1820 as a society of London-based Welshmen interested in the history of Wales. Southey was elected a member of the Society in 1821. The Secretary was James Evans (dates unknown).</note> It is a creditable volume, but by much the most important paper is that which you communicated from Peter Roberts’ papers.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Law Triads of the Ancient Britons. Translated by the Late Rev. Peter Roberts’, <title>Transactions of the Cymmrodorion, or Metropolitan Cambrian Institution</title> (London, 1822), I, pp. 97–149. Peter Roberts (1760–1819; <title>DNB</title>) was a Welsh clergyman and antiquarian.</note> This is indeed very curious, &#38; seems to have been committed to a very competent editor.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Humffreys Parry (1786–1825; <title>DNB</title>), Welsh barrister and antiquarian.</note> I am very anxious that the publication of the Welsh Remains should be fairly compleated, so that nothing which can be of any use to antiquaries, historians or philologists should be exposed to the danger of being lost. When the Cambo-Briton<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Cambro-Briton</title> (1819–1822), a journal on Welsh history, no. 527 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> reaches me I will put together a Saxons view of the subject for the QR.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write on this subject for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> You should send a qualified traveller to Bretagne to see what could be recovered there.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">By what I hear it seems no easy thing to find a successor for the Bp of Calcutta.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Fanshaw Middleton (1769–1822; <title>DNB</title>) had been appointed first Bishop of Calcutta in 1814, with jurisdiction over the whole territory of the East India Company. Peter Elmsley had declined the post. Middleton’s successor was Reginald Heber.</note> The constitution of our Church is such that very few of its ministers are willing to volunteer upon foreign service. I might have appointed a Chaplain to Pernambuco four or five years ago, if I had known where to find one, – the income was 400£ a year, with a house, &#38; 100£ for his expences out.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Koster had written to Southey, asking for his help in appointing a chaplain for the British community in Pernambuco; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 25 August 1817, <title>Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3017.</note> The person whom <ref type="m" target="people.html#HowleyWilliam">the Bp of London</ref> found at last was one of ruined fortunes – tho of fair character.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Sandby (c. 1761–1832), B.A. Christ Church, Oxford, 1783. He was Vicar of Swell, Gloucestershire 1795–1832 and Rector of Honeychurch, Devon 1816–1832. The bankruptcy of the merchant Samuel Palmer (1762–1851), of Bourton-on-the-Water, in 1816 had led to actions by Palmer’s creditors to recover the debts that Sandby owed to Palmer. As Sandby had already spent time in prison for debt, this may have encouraged him to consider the chaplaincy in Pernambuco.</note> – The question of providing religious instruction – that is of forming a Church establishment, – for our new colonies, is one which should be considered without delay; as ultimately of the greatest importance. <del>It is</del> The want of such establishments <del>which</del> has been one main cause why colonists in modern times have been so much depraved than the people from whom they spring. – e – g – the Dutch at Surinam &#38; in Cape. – With regard to India there are great difficulties no doubt, but it seems to me that the best method would be to educate <del>xxxx</del> some of the half-cast for the ministry there.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Fanshaw Middleton had founded Bishop’s College, Calcutta, in 1820 to train Indians for the Anglican ministry.</note></p>
