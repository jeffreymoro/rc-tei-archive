        <p rend="indent1">We shall be very glad to see your son with you, &amp; should be more so if we had a bed to offer him.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was visited by John May and his son, John May (1802&#8211;1879), for four weeks in August&#8211;September 1822.</note> But in all likelihood it will be easy to get him one at the bottom of the garden, &#8211; &amp; if not, one of the Inns is within five minutes walk.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Southeys sometimes put up visitors in a building at the end of the garden at Greta Hall. The two main inns in Keswick were the Royal Oak and the Queen&#8217;s Head.</note>

        <p rend="indent1">There are two Carlisle mails, &amp; he who takes the wrong one has to spend three hours at midnight in a Manchester Inn, the worst place on this side Purgatory. The right one is that from the <ref type="m" target="places.html#BullandMouth">Bull &amp; Mouth</ref>, which goes thro Doncaster. You must take your place to Penrith, which is 18 miles from hence: &amp; You will be here in 41 hours from London. &#8211; When I am once settled in the coach I think nothing of the journey. I should look forward to this meeting with unmingled pleasure if you could come without a load of cares, &amp; if you could make a longer tarriance. As it is I look to it with great delight, &amp; not without hope that things will have brightened by that time (as they are not darkening now) &amp; that you will find your spirits freshened by the visit.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">I hope I shall be near the end of my first volume by the time you come.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832). It ran to 806 pages.</note> indeed it is time I should, because of its length, &#8211; &amp; there is little but plain sailing before me. &#8211; Something it will enable me to place at your disposal &#8211; I heartily wish it were more.</p>
