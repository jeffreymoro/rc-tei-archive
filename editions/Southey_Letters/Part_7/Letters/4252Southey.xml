            <p rend="indent1">I am glad you are in the way of being settled in a house,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey settled at 4 Harley Street, one of a number of dwellings fashioned out of a larger building on the corner of Cavendish Square and Harley Street, London.</note> tho if bricklayers &#38; carpenters are to interfere you will have to pass thro what might have been one of Job’s trials<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In the Book of Job the central character is afflicted with misfortunes.</note> before you are fairly seated in it. – I have no money either in the funds or elsewhere, except the little that may be in <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John Mays</ref> hands, – but when my second volume<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> shall be thro the press, (say in six months from this time, if the printer<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Davison (1766–1831).</note> so pleases) I can put 525£ at your disposal. Since my return I have been living upon the Church,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> – <del>xx</del> <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> between them have contrived to disappoint me of what I had counted on for the last QR,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (January 1824), published 28 August 1824, did not contain Southey’s review of John Johnson (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Southey’s article appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263–311, published 11 March 1825.</note> which would have put me to some inconvenience if there had not been <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to have recourse to. This has put me out of humour with the said Q – (which is likely to be Q in the corner<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Q in the corner’ was a popular pseudonym for authors, especially of letters to newspapers and journals, and had been widely used since the anonymous <title>Junius Letters</title> (1769–1772). However, it was also used in chess as shorthand for ‘Queen in the corner’, i.e. a difficult and unwanted situation, and it is probably in this sense that Southey uses it here.</note> with me) &#38; into humour with other things which have sometimes been laid aside for it. A certain medical acquaintance of yours<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Dr Dove, the central figure in Southey’s novel, <title>The Doctor</title> (1834–1847).</note> is likely therefore to be introduced to the world, before I put pen to paper again for that Journal; &#38; the Tale of Paraguay<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> will be followed up by Oliver Newman.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s unfinished epic, ‘Oliver Newman’, set in New England. A fragment was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale (Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1–90.</note> I am advanced some way in the third canto of the Tale which will consist of four only.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> There has been no return of haemorrhage since I applied to you. The ointment I did not apply, – having found it useless in 1819, – the zinc &#38; sulph. acid<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a reference to zinc sulphate, long used in medicine to combat diarrhoea. Southey had been suffering from a rectal prolapse and bleeding.</note> I took, probably with good effect: &#38; have taken exercise, more or less, &#38; with more or less inconvenience, sometimes without any, pretty regularly. There were a few days when the weather invited me to bathe, &#38; I believe it was of great service; but the weather prevented me from continuing it.</p>
