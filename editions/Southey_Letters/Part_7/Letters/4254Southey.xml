            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> makes a bad report of my health, because during the first part of his visit, he saw that I was obliged to keep the house, &#38; did not know for what cause. It was from haemorrhoids, or a relaxation connected with them;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was suffering from a rectal prolapse.</note> at that time in such a state that I could not walk a mile without bleeding profusely. This lasted for about a week, but after keeping house about as much longer that the vessels might fairly close, I was enabled to resume <del>xx</del> my regular exercise, – for in truth my habits are not so sedentary as you suppose. I walk every day from one to two hours, unless the weather is too bad: &#38; not unfrequently take a longer stretch, &#38; the longest time I ever remain at my desk <del>xx</del> is from tea time till supper. My self-management has not been unsuccesful, – <del>aftx</del> I learnt by experience long ago not to pursue any one subject – or train of thought, so closely as to let it possess my mind &#38; disturb my rest: for whenever I have done this, I have suffered for it. No man can be freer from <del>xx</del> hypochondriacal fancies, or valetudinarian feelings. The evil to which I am subject is that periodical catarrh which I must <del>have</del> often have mentioned, occurring as surely &#38; as soon as the summer begins, &#38; continuing ten or twelve weeks, latterly affecting the chest, &#38; this year for the first time, <del>laying</del> fixing itself there somewhat obstinately. I escaped it the year when I went into Switzerland at that season;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s continental journey of May–August 1817.</note> &#38; I believe that my only chance of escaping it, is by travelling at the time of its usual return: enabling the system by change of air &#38; excitement to resist its attack. This I shall do if possible next year.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey visited the Low Countries in 1825.</note> But <del>xx</del> tho I am not like a professional man tied to place, nor confined to times &#38; seasons in my movements, – I cannot move without this great advantages, – that the very act of travelling diminishes my means even more than it increases my expences.
            If my works had proved as profitable to me as they ought to have been, &#38; as the world supposes, it is likely that I should ere this have wound up my accounts with the public. Montaigne liked better to forge his mind that to furnish it, he says:<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), <title>Essais</title> (1580), Book 3, chapter 3, ‘Des Trois Commerces’: ‘Meditation is a large and powerful study to such as vigorously can taste and employ themselves therein. I had rather forge than furnish my mind.’ Southey returned to this quotation from Montaigne in <title>The Doctor</title>, 7 vols (London, 1834–1847), IV, p. 225.</note> time has brought with it to me the opposite disposition, I had much rather read than write, – much rather learn that teach.</p>

For myself I would rather be hanged than live in it. If I ever have my portrait affixed to any of my books I will have these lines of Ovid under it -</p>
