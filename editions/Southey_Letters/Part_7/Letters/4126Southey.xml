          <p rend="indent1">  I called yesterday at the India House,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">East India House, on Leadenhall Street in the City of London, the headquarters of the East India Company.</note> – &#38; as I cannot reach Westminster to day, I write to say that the three last days of my abode in London will be the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 11 &#38; 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Feb<hi rend="sup">y</hi>, &#38; on either of those days I shall be very glad to dine with you.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> To night I go for Norwich: return to town on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> – leave it for Richmond the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; return again on Tuesday 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, &#38; finally depart on Friday the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. You will receive my Book<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> before you see me, – &#38; will not be sorry that I have dedicated it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref>.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">  I spent a day with the <ref type="m" target="people.html#CombeEdward">&#913;&#957;&#945;&#958; &#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#969;&#957;</ref>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘King of men’, i.e. Edward Combe.</note> – &#38; the visit would well deserve a chapter in the Sketch Book.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Washington Irving (1783–1859), <title>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.</title> (1820), which contained descriptions of English country life and traditions.</note> When we meet I will tell you the singular way of life which he leads. – I fell in also with young Levett,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Levett (1775–1845), Rector of Ingestre 1809–1829, Deene 1811–1825, Church Eaton 1825–1829, and an old friend of Southey from Westminster School, which he attended 1785–1792, becoming a King’s Scholar in 1788. Levett had also been a student at Christ Church, Oxford 1792–1796, at the same time as Wynn. Levett and Southey had met recently during the latter’s time in Hampshire.</note> – to our mutual satisfaction.</p>
