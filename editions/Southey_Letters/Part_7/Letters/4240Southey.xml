I had never been a mile from Bath in that direction before, – &#38; when my childish thoughts ever wandered into the terra incognita which I was one day to explore, this had been the road to it, – simply because all the other outlets from that city were familiar to me.

The source he gave was William Oldys (1696–1761; <title>DNB</title>), but it is not possible to locate this phrase in Oldys’ work; however, Oldys did refer to William Elderton (d. c. 1592; <title>DNB</title>) as ‘a facetious fuddling companion’.</note> kept a smaller boarding house next door, but at this time a treaty of union between the two houses was going on, – which &#60;like&#62; the union of <del>other larger communities</del> &#60;Castile &#38; Aragon&#62;<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">The marriage of Ferdinand II (1452–1516; King of Aragon 1479–1516) and Isabella I (1451–1504; Queen of Castile 1474–1504) in 1469 united the two countries and created the basis of modern Spain.</note> – was to be brought about by marriage between the respective heads of the <del>states separate</del> &#60;several&#62; states. This marriage took place during the ensuing Whitsun-holydays; &#38; the small flock was then removed to our boarding house, which then took the name of Hayes’s, but retained it only a few months. For Hayes in disgust at not being appointed Under Master withdrew from the school, – his wife of course followed his fortunes, &#38; was succeeded by M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Clough<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Mrs Clough (d. 1798).</note> who migrated thither with a few boarders from Abingdon Street.

            <p rend="indent1">He was a man who having some skill &#38; much facility in versifying, walked for many years over the Seatonian <del>course</del> race ground at Cambridge, &#38; enjoyed the produce of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Seatons Kislingbury estate without a competitor.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">The Seatonian Prize has been awarded annually by the University of Cambridge since 1750 for the best poem in English on a sacred subject.

Hayes won the prize in 1775–1778 and 1783–1785.</note> He was moreover what Oldys describes Nahum Tate to have been “a free, good-natured, fuddling companion, – to all which qualities his countenance bore witness. With better conduct &#38; better fortunes, Hayes &#60;would have&#62; had learning &#38; talents enough to have deserved &#38; obtained promotion. His want of conduct might in some degree be imputed to ill fortune, – for his first marriage had <del>pl</del> been an &#60;unhappy if not&#62; imprudent one, &#38; his wife<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> had served him as Michael Angelo did Moses in marble.<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">The sculpture of the Old Testament prophet Moses by Michelangelo (1475–1564) in the Church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome (1513–1515) depicts the prophet with horns on his head, following the description in <title>Exodus</title> 34: 29–30.

Perhaps he would not have taken offence at being overlooked if a person thoroughly qualified had been chosen, but he could not bear to have an inferior usher (<ref type="m" target="people.html#WingfieldJohn">Wingfield</ref>) who was a person of no talents whatever put over his head, &#38; therefore to the great injury of his worldly affairs – which could <del>not</del> &#60;ill&#62; bear such a sacrifice, he left the school altogether. – Hayes &#60;it&#62; was <del>the person</del> who <del>published</del> &#60;edited&#62; those sermons which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Johnson is supposed to have written for his friend D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Taylor.<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Sermons on Different Subjects, Left for Publication by John Taylor</title> (1788–1789).

He succeeded to the estates of his uncle, Sir Robert Bernard, 5th Baronet (c. 1739–1789), in January 1789 and this may have hastened his early departure from the school. He married Olivia (c. 1778–1863), daughter of the Irish peer Arthur Acheson, 1st Earl of Gosford (c. 1745–1807), on 14 March 1797. A religious woman, Lady Olivia was also interested in the education and welfare of the poor. In the 1830s she established schools and encouraged mission work on her estates.</note> afterwards the husband of that sweet creature Lady Olivia. Never was woman of a dove-like nature more unsuitably mated for Sparrow when either in anger or in drink was perfectly frantic. His face was as fine as a countenance could be which expressed so ungovernable &#38; dangerous a temper, – the finest red &#38; white, dark eyes &#38; brows, &#38; black curling hair; – but the expression was rather that of a savage than of a civilized being, &#38; no savage could be more violent. He had seasons of good nature, &#38; at the worst was rather to be dreaded than disliked, – for he was plainly not master of himself. But I had cause to dread him, for he once attempted to hold me by the leg out at the window – <del>of</del> it was the first floor – &#38; over a stone area. Had I not <del>struck back</del> struggled in time, &#38; clung to the frame with both hands, my life would probably have been lost. He used <del>at night</del> to pour water into my ear, when I was a bed &#38; asleep, &#38; in many ways exercised such a capricious tyranny – merely by right of the strongest, for he had no right to fag me, – that at last I desired M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hayes to remove me into another room. Thither he followed me, &#60;&#38;&#62; at a very late hour one night, <del>in a wild</del> &#60;came in&#62; wrapt in a sheet &#38; thinking to frighten me by personating a ghost, in which character he <del>came &#38; rolled upon my head bed</del>. &#60;threw himself upon the bed &#38; rolled upon me&#62;. Not knowing who it was, but certain that it was flesh &#38; blood, I seized him by the throat, &#38; we made noise enough to occasion an enquiry which ended in requiring Sparrows word that he would molest me no more. <del>&#38;</del> He kept that word faithfully, &#38; left school a few months afterwards, when he was about 17 or 18 &#38; apparently full grown, – a singularly fine &#38; striking youth – indeed one of those figures which you always remember vividly. I heard nothing of him till the Irish rebellion, he served in the army there, &#38; there was a story which got into the papers of his meeting a man upon the road &#38; putting him to death without judge or jury upon suspicion of his being a rebel. It was no doubt an act of madness, <del>but in those times every thing</del> was past over. I know not if any proceedings took place &#60;(indeed in those dreadful times every thing was past over) – but&#62; <del>&#38; indeed</del> he died soon afterwards happily for himself &#38; all who were connected with him.<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">Sparrow, by then a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Essex Fencibles, was appointed High Sheriff of Armagh on 22 February 1797, as some of the Bernard estates he had inherited included Tandragee Castle in Armagh. In August of the same year, while on patrol, Sparrow stopped Captain William Lucas (1760–1797) of the Monaghan militia. Lucas refused to accompany Sparrow as his prisoner, and after Sparrow’s troops refused to shoot, Sparrow attacked Lucas with his sabre, mortally wounding him. Sparrow was tried and convicted at the Armagh Assizes but received a pardon. He died of yellow fever in 1805 on the way home from Barbados.</note> – Some ten years ago as I was returning from <ref type="m" target="places.html#CrosthwaiteChurch">Keswick Church</ref> after the evening service, Lord Calthorpe<note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">George Gough-Calthorpe, 3rd Baron Calthorpe (1787–1851). </note> accosted me, introduced me to a Lady whose name owing to his low voice I did not catch, &#38; engaged me to dine with him at the Inn;<note n="27" place="foot" resp="editors">Either the Royal Oak hotel or the Queen’s Head hotel in Keswick.</note> an invitation which perhaps I accepted the more willingly, because there was something in the Ladys countenance &#38; manners particularly pleasing.

Thus to fall in with a son of the age at which you had last seen his father, – is one of those incidents in life that bring home to us the lapse of time with most effect.<note n="30" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 22–[23] October 1814, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

He was ordained as a deacon on 9 November 1788 and a priest on 25 April 1789, serving as Rector of Hawridge, Buckinghamshire 1789–1792, before resigning his living.</note> This story was then remembered of him at the Charter House, that he was equally remarkable <del>remarkabl</del> for his noisiness &#38; his love of music, – &#38; having one day skipt school to attend a concert, xxx there was such an unusual quietness in consequence of his absence that the master, &#60;looked round &#38; said&#62; – Where is Beresford? I am sure he cannot be <del>here</del> &#60;in school&#62;, – &#38; the detection thus brought about cost poor Beresford a flogging.&#62; Him too I never saw after that visit, &#38; with all his pleasantness &#38; good nature he left upon me an unpleasant impression from a trifling circumstance which I remember as indicative of my own moral temper at that time.

There was neither a decent line, nor a false quantity in the whole. The Ladies made me show it to Beresford, &#38; he instead of saying in ‘good natured sincerity – “‘you have never been taught to make verses but it is plain that you have taken great pains <del>x</del> in making these, – &#38; therefore I am sure the Usher will give you credit for what you have done,” – returned them to me <del>with the absurd</del> saying Sir – I see you’ll be another Virgil one of these days. – I knew that this was neither deserved as praise nor as mockery: &#38; I felt then as I have continued to do that <del>undeserved</del> &#60;unmerited&#62; censure <del>provides</del> &#60;brings with it&#62; its own <del>balm</del> &#60;antidote&#62; in the sense of injustice which it provokes, but that nothing is too mortifying as <del>the</del> praise &#60;to&#62; which you are conscious &#60;that&#62; you have <del>not deserved</del> no claim.</p>

The schoolboy Latin poem does not survive, but in March 1793, while a student at Oxford, Southey visited Rosamund’s reputed burial place at Godstow. This formed the subject for Southey’s ‘Rosamund to Henry. Written after Taking the Veil’, <title>Poems</title> (Bath, 1795), pp. 85–95; and an inscription ‘For a Tablet at Godstow Nunnery’, published in the second edition of his <title>Poems</title> (Bristol, 1797), p. 131. </note> which I put into his hands.
