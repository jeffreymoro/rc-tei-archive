            <p rend="indent1">I wish I had a good wager depending upon your inability to guess <del>thxx</del> what this letter contains. It is intended to inform you that I have composed – eight conundrums, upon the names of as many Greek authors.</p>
            
            <p rend="indent1">1.	A womans peculiarities.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> 2.	Lady Diana highly perfumed.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">3.	A wandering young gentleman.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">4.	Lay you hand upon that part of your unutterable garment where the flap of the pocket is, &#38; ask, what part is this?</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> 5.	Anna my wife.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">6.	What happens if when you are looking in the glass, I look in it too?</p>
            <p rend="indent1">7.	What a pair of turtle doves <del>if they</del> when offered for sale, would say to <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</ref>, if they could speak. It is not every woman to whom they would say it.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> 8.	A common play thing belonging to Henry &#38; his brother.</p>
            
            <p rend="indent0"> There Grosvenor, considering that I have three proof sheets of K.
