These pictures could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> I have sent him two of your sketches which apply to the first volume, – the Puente del Corgul,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">A bridge in Galicia that Southey had crossed in December 1795, ‘a scene of tranquil sublimity’ (<title>Letters Written during a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (Bristol, 1797), p. 54). In the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>, 1.1 (1808), 452, Southey lamented that failure to destroy the bridge had ruined the best chance that British forces had to halt the French forces that were pursuing them during their retreat to Corunna in 1808–1809. He also referred in a note to ‘a sketch, taken upon the spot’ (452) that he had seen – probably Herbert Hill’s drawing.</note> – &#38; the Bridge over the Ezla with Benevente between the chalk hills, – the very spot where Buonaparte was in danger of being made prisoner by Lord Castlereaghs brother, &#38; where Lefebvre Desnouettes was taken.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The bridge over the River Esla at Castro Gonzalo, with the town of Benavente in the distance. It was the scene of a defeat of French cavalry by British forces on 29 December 1808. A brigade of cavalry in this clash was commanded by Charles Stewart, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry (1778–1854; <title>DNB</title>) and brother of Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1769–1822; <title>DNB</title>), Foreign Secretary 1812–1822. The French commander, Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes (1773–1822), was captured; see Southey, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp, 782–783. Southey stated that ‘It was reported that Bonaparte was on the heights during this action’ (783), a rather less definite statement than that Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821; Emperor of the French 1804–1814, 1815) was in danger of capture.</note> He has got (thro <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>) some sketches from General Hawker,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Major-General Samuel Hawker (1763–1838), who had served in the Peninsular War between 1808 and 1811 as commander of the 14th Light Dragoons.</note> – of which Marraõ, Guarda &#38; Cintra will do for the first series.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The Serra do Marao is a mountain in Portugal; Guarda is the Portuguese town that was burnt and looted by French troops in July 1808; Cintra was the site of the Convention of Cintra, 30 August 1808 (<title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 496–497, 575–578).</note> – I wish we could <del>get</del> obtain views of Lisbon &#38; Madrid, the Escurial, Aranguez, Bayonne, Cordoba, Jaen, Zaragoza, V Viçosa, Evora, Beja, Nazareth, &#38; Leiria<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1808 these were all important sites during the Peninsular War. El Escorial is a royal palace, north of Madrid and site of a conspiracy against Charles IV (1748–1819; King of Spain 1788–1808) in 1807; Aranjuez is another royal residence near Madrid and scene of a mutiny on 17–19 March 1808, which deposed Charles IV; Bayonne is a town in south-west France, where Charles IV abdicated his rights to Napoleon on 5 May 1808; Cordoba was sacked by French forces on 7 June 1808 and Zaragoza was the site of two famous sieges by French troops in 1808–1809; Jaen is an alternative name for the French defeat at Bailen on 16–19 July 1808. The other sites are in Portugal: at Vila Vicosa on 22 June 1808 French forces relieved a besieged French army and plundered the town; the Battle of Evora on 29 July 1808 was a French victory over a Portuguese-Spanish force, followed by a massacre; at Beja on 26 June 1808 a French army defeated local forces and looted the town; Nazareth was a small coastal fort captured by Portuguese insurgents on 5 July 1808; the same day a French army defeated the Portuguese at Leiria and sacked the town.</note> &#60;for that volume&#62;. That which you sent me of Madrid, by Hawker, disappeared with many other things, while I was without a resting place. &#60;Have you a copy of it?&#62;</p>

The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.
