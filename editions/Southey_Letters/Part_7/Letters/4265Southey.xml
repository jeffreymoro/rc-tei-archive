          <p rend="indent1">  An unusual length of time has elapsed without my hearing from you, &#38; it has so happened that during that time I have not heard <hi rend="ital">of</hi> you from any other quarter. A heavy loss <del>xxx</del> such as that which you have sustained<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary May, née Coppendale (1745–1824), May’s mother, had died on 21 August 1824.</note> hardly appears at first like a reality when the loss is unexpected or untimely this is peculiarly felt &#38; peculiarly painful; – &#38; tho in your case what has occurred has been in the due &#38; gentle course of nature, still any thing that produces so great a change in the relations of life, &#38; in the daily &#38; hourly thoughts &#38; feelings affects the mind something in this manner. I am anxious to hear from you – to know how you are, – &#38; to know also whether you receive more satisfactory accounts from Brazil.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John May was deeply concerned about his foundering business interests in Brazil.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Your goddaughter</ref> has been interrupted in her plans, which were to have left Exeter this day for Taunton, &#38; to have proceeded from thence on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> for London with Lady Malet.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susannah Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>).</note> But Lady M. has been summoned to Winchester by the very dangerous illness of a son,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Octavius Warre Malet (1811–1891), eighth son of Lady Susanna Malet. Octavius Warre Malet served in the East India Company before retiring to Somerset in 1864, where he played a leading role in the restoration of Taunton Castle.</note> an inflammation of the lungs having come on just as he was to all appearances recovering from the measles. The last<del>xx</del> accounts of him were more favourable. This leaves <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Edith</ref> at Exeter, in some uncertainty when to get from thence. She is with <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrowneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wade Browne</ref>, the widow of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrowneWade">my poor Ludlow friend</ref>, – &#38; herself a person for whom I have a very high regard. I suppose she will take the first opportunity that may occur of finding a fit escort in the stage for London; &#38; I expect that she will return with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> in February – that is, as soon as the depth of the winter shall be past. You will perhaps have heard of her from Ottery,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Ottery St Mary, Devon, home of many of Coleridge’s relatives.</note> where she past three days. I begin to be impatient for the return of these girls, – &#38; to feel that at my age I cannot afford to part with them for so long an absence.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Having got rid of all remains of cough which my annual catarrh had left behind it, I have brought myself again into tolerable condition, &#38; am endeavouring to keep myself so by very dutiful exercise, which is rendered less irksome by the habit of reading while I walk, if the weather permits. My second volume of the P. War<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The second volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> is getting on well both in the press &#38; at the desk. Indeed I am at this time in the best disposition for getting on with the works which I have in hand: &#38; that disposition is increased by the desire of compleating them that I may lay down other foundations, &#38; work up the materials which I have so long been preparing. – My Colloquies<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> will very soon go to press, – indeed as soon as I hear from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">William Westall</ref> that the plates are in any state of forwardness.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall produced six sketches of Lake District scenes that were engraved for <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>, 2 vols (London, 1829): vol. I: ‘Druidical Stones near Keswick’, ‘Derwentwater, Bassenthwaite-water, and Skiddaw from Walla Crag’, and ‘Derwentwater from Strand Shagg’; and vol. II: ‘Crosthwaite Church and Skiddaw’, ‘Greta Hall, Derwentwater, and Newlands’, and ‘Tarn of Blencathra’.</note> They will afford matter for abuse to many persons, for wonder to more, – but for sober reflection to not a few, &#38; for approbation also I trust. I expect little profit from them, &#38; more credit in future ages than in this.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I believe one reason why neither <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> nor <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> write to me is a degree of shame concerning the QR. which <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">G.</ref> is plainly unwilling to <del>xxx</del> withdraw from, tho incapable of carrying it on, – &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">M.</ref> I suspect is desirous of driving a booksellers bargain about it, – perhaps even of trying the experiment of doing without an Editor. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> writes to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter Scott</ref> that he knows not where to look for an Editor: – there is some duplicity in this, after what has past with <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John C.</ref> – which I have made <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> acquainted with. I still think necessity will compel <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> at last to do – what for his own interest he ought to have done long ago.</p>
