            <p rend="indent1"> If your deafness depends upon the general state of your nervous system, I verily believe that a few weeks of mountain air would be the best remedy for it. Come you must &#38; will, but do not spoil your holyday by splitting it. Go to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</ref> next year, or at any other time.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Your account of Hawker<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Major-General Samuel Hawker (1763–1838), who had served in the Peninsular War between 1808 and 1811 as commander of the 14th Light Dragoons. His sketches were used in <title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey’s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &#38;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These pictures could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832). In return, Southey had promised Hawker ‘a fair piece of handwriting’; see Southey to Bedford, 23 March 1822, Letter 3815. It is not clear which ‘song’ he had sent to Hawker.</note> pleases me so much that I could find in my heart to <hi rend="ital">sing</hi> him the song which I send him. You must inform him that it was written to be sung by myself, I am afraid he will have a very inadequate notion of its merit unless <del>x</del> you can explain to him how admirably it is adapted to my execution.</p>
