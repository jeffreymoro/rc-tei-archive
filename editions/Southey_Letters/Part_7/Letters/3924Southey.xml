           <p rend="indent1"> I am glad to see some Cymmrodorion Transactions advertised, &#38; shall send for the volume.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Transactions of the Cymmrodorion, or Metropolitan Cambrian Institution</title> (1822), no. 2829 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Wynn had played a central role in re-founding the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion in 1820 as a society of London-based Welshmen interested in the history of Wales. Southey was elected a member of the Society in 1821.</note> – What a surprizing difference there is between the Welsh &#38; the Scandinavian poems! partly because the Welsh were divided toto ab orbe.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Totally from the world’.</note> While the Northern nations were more or less connected with it. I have felt this difference very strongly of late while reading the second volume of the Edda, published for the first time four years ago.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edda Saemundar hinns Froda. Edda Rhythmica seu Antiquior, Vulgo Saemundina Dicta</title> (1787–1828), no. 918 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. The second volume appeared in 1818.</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I am indeed gradually acquiring some insight into the northern languages, the better to qualify myself for writing a history of English literature &#38; manners, – subjects which according to my present view, may best be united, as relieving &#38; throwing light upon each other. My notes have been accumulating for many years.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">This project did not result in a book; the surviving notes that Southey put together were posthumously published as ‘Collections for the History of Manners and Literature in England’, <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849–1850), I, pp. 439–578.</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Has O Connor published his second volume?<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles O’Conor (1764–1828; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Rerum Hibernicarum Scriptores Veteres</title>, 4 vols (1814–1826), no. 2112 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. This was an edition of some of the manuscripts in the library at Stowe. The second volume did not appear until 1825.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">Foreign interference in the affairs of Spain would be desirable, if it could be effectual,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A French army was preparing to invade Spain to reimpose royal absolutism. It crossed the Spanish border on 7 April 1823 and defeated the liberal regime.</note> – which I think it could not be. Suppose a French army were to reach Madrid, rescue Ferdinand<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Ferdinand VII (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833). He was virtually a prisoner of the liberals 1820–1823.</note> head &#38; all, &#38; reestablish him as absolute king, or as a chartered one.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">A king who was compelled to observe a constitution, such as the Charter that the victorious powers had imposed on the French monarchy, as a condition of its restoration in 1814.</note> I neither see how he could support himself, nor who could support him; for the country would continue in a state of anarchy &#38; he would find himself without a revenue. Spain can never be reduced to order till it has a strong government, but such a government must be able to maintain a strong army, &#38; the resources by which this should be done are absolutely dry.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You I think are among those persons who will feel that <del>xx</del> it would have been unwise in me to have taken <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> place. It would have given me a certain instead of a precarious income; – but the discomfort of a removal, the necessary increase of expenditure, &#38; above all the great sacrifice which must have been made of worthier pursuits would heavily have overbalanced this advantage. This last consideration alone would be decisive. – <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> is also a much fitter man than I should have been, he knows better how to deal with men, &#38; he has more discretion.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was campaigning for John Taylor Coleridge to succeed William Gifford as editor of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note></p>
