               Dating note: The endorsement indicates that Southey’s letter had been received before 17 April 1824, when de Clercq replied to it. Allowing for the international mail service the letter probably dates from early April. We have therefore placed it at the start of the month. </note></head>

          <p rend="indent1">  Accept my thanks for your obliging letter, &#38; for your Essay upon the character of the Cid,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Willem de Clercq, ‘De Cid, Voorgesteld als Het Ideaal van den Held der Middeleeuwen’, originally published in <title>Magazijn voor Wetenschappen, Kunsten en Lettern</title>, 3 (1824), 192–244.</note> – a subject which cannot fail to interest me. Ruydiez de Bivar<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (c. 1043–1099), the Castilian nobleman and military leader known as ‘El Cid’.</note> was indeed what you describe him, – the model of knighthood in the ruder age of chivalry. A few generations later we have the character a little more refined (&#38; but little) in our Richard Coeur de Lion.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard I (1157–1199; King of England 1189–1199; <title>DNB</title>).</note> You find it in perfection in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century, in the Black Prince,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward ‘the Black Prince’ (1330–1376; <title>DNB</title>), Prince of Wales 1343–1376 and heir to the English throne.</note> &#38; in a still higher degree in the Portugueze hero Nuno Alvares Pereira,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">St Nuno Alvares Pereira (1360–1431), the Portuguese general who secured Portugal’s independence from Castile.

           <p rend="indent1"> Your literature Sir, is little known in England, not because it is despised, but because the language is difficult, &#38; books in it only rarely &#38; accidentally to be obtained. My knowledge of Dutch is merely such as <del>xx</del> enables me to understand the plain straight forward style of Aitzema,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieuwe van Aitzema (1600–1669), <title>Sakem van Staet en Oorlogh in emde Omtrent de Vereenigde Nederlanden</title> (1655–1671), with the continuation by Lambert van den Bos (1610–1698), <title>Historien onses Tyds</title> (1685–1699), no. 214 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> Valentyn<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">François Valentijn (1666–1727), <title>Oud en Niew Oost-Indien</title> (1724–1726), no. 2892 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> &#38; Pieter Bor.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Pieter Christiaensz Bor (1559–1635), <title>Histoire der Nederlandtsche Oorlogen</title> (1679), no. 463 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> A little I have read of Jacob Cats,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Jacob Cats (1577–1660), <title>Alle de Wercken</title> (1726), no. 687 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> a little of Vondel;<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679), 17 volumes of whose works were no. 3091 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> enough to show me that the former must in his own country be the most delightful of <hi rend="ital">household poets</hi>, &#38; that the latter was truly a master of his art. It appears to me more than likely that Milton was excited by the perusal of Vondel to undertake both his Samson Agonistes, &#38; his Paradise Lost.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey considered Vondel’s <title>Lucifer</title> (1654), <title>Adam in Ballingschap</title> (1664) and <title>Samson of Heilige Wraeck</title> (1660) to be influences on John Milton (1608–1674; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Paradise Lost</title> (1667) and <title>Samson Agonistes</title> (1671).</note></p>
