Henry Herbert Southey was possibly worried about consumption; his father-in-law William Gonne had died from this in 1815.</note> indeed he was not without uneasiness on that account when he was here in the autumn. I was not aware that any of the others manifested symptoms of this unhappy taint, but I have always felt an uncomfortable apprehension concerning it, &#38; that apprehension was expressed to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> as something which he would do well to consider before he made up his mind respecting the marriage. – I am truly grieved at it</p>

On 18 February 1823, Plunket had told the House of Commons that he had no intention of bringing forward a measure for Catholic relief before Easter. But he was also embroiled in the convoluted legal proceedings against some members of the Orange Order, who had led a riot in the New Theatre Royal in Dublin on 14 December 1822. Local officials were accused of colluding to prevent prosecution of the rioters, while Plunket was alleged to have abused due legal process to bring charges against the rioters. The matter was debated at length in the House of Commons in May 1823.</note></p>

In the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>, 1.1 (1808), 452, Southey lamented that the failure to destroy the bridge had ruined the best chance the British forces had, while retreating to Corunna in 1808–1809, to delay the pursuing French. He also referred in a note to ‘a sketch, taken upon the spot’ that he had seen – probably Herbert Hill’s drawing. The second sketch by Herbert Hill was of bridge over the River Esla at Castro Gonzalo, with the town of Benavente in the distance. It was the scene of a defeat of French cavalry by British forces on 29 December 1808, Southey, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 782–783. </note> was not a scene of which he could make enough from the materials which I sent him. for the subsequent volumes <del>the prints</del> there will be less difficulty in obtaining views more connected with important events. He is a delightful artist, &#38; a most estimable man: – but his head is affected at times, &#38; when that is the case he takes offence at his best friends. I have a great regard for <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref>, &#38; heartily wish he may succeed in this speculation which he has undertaken mainly out of regard for me.</p>

However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

But I live in daily expectation of them.
