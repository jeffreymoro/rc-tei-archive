<salute>My Dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">It gives us great pleasure to hear of your safe arrival in town, – after a journey, which was trying enough for your invalid<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Edward Henry (1807–1833), the younger of Peachy’s two stepsons. His accident occurred on 2 August 1822 and was widely reported in the newspapers (without naming Henry): ‘A young gentleman, by way of saluting some friends who were taking their departure, fired off a cannon, which unfortunately burst in consequence of being overloaded, and the fragments severely fractured his skull’ (<title>Glasgow Herald</title>, 12 August 1822). The cannon was kept outside Peachy’s house on Derwent Island and was fired as part of the annual Keswick Regatta.</note> to make us in some degree anxious for the result. There can now, I trust, be no reason to apprehend any farther inconvenience from the accident, tremendous as it was, than the trifling one of protecting the part. Regarding the case <del>it</del> in all its circumstances, it may truly be deemed a merciful preservation. – <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Peachy</ref> may now be quite at ease, – &#38; ease of mind I hope will soon remove any ill effects which so long &#38; severe a trial has produced.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">For the first time, we were glad at your departure. After all that had passed, it was like a deliverance from a place of durance. And during the stormy season, there was a great gulph between us, which allowed of little communication between the Isle &#38; Continent. But had it not been that change of place was so desirable for you at that time, I should certainly have regretted that you went away just as the bad weather ceased, – for finer than we have enjoyed from that time up to the present <hi rend="ital">hour</hi>, was never remembered in these parts. Up to this hour I have said, because the first snow has just begun to fall. We had mild open weather till Christmas, – then a week of fine frost, – a thaw without rain &#38; with a clear sky, for two or three days, then <del>gentle frost</del> slight frost &#38; sunshine till this day. One morning fog is all we have seen of fogs, – &#38; that gave me some magnificent sights in <hi rend="ital">antejentacular</hi><note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. walks before breakfast.</note> walks to the crag, where I witnessed its disappearance as the sun rose.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The news of <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> is that <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edmondsons</ref> brother<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> who was settled in America is dead, &#38; has left a considerable property among his relations here. <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edmondsons</ref> children,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Edmondson had at least two sons: John Edmondson (d. 1847), who took over his father’s practice in Keswick; and James Edmondson (1804–1873), also a surgeon, who moved to Tetbury, Gloucestershire, to practice.</note> it is said, have 500 £ each, besides what is left to the father. Every body rejoices at this. There is some talk of a new road to Penrith, which, if it is effected, will abolish the hill also on the Ambleside road. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lowther</ref> is the mover in this business, – he brought M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Adam<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Loudon McAdam (1756–1836; <title>DNB</title>), the pioneering road-builder and Surveyor-General of Metropolitan Roads from 1820. McAdam was employed to build a new road from Penrith through Keswick to Cockermouth (now the A66). His principal employer was Greenwich Hospital; he persuaded them to combine all the roads to their lead mines into a single turnpike trust, the Alston Trust.</note> here about six weeks ago, – &#38; is willing, I have heard, to contribute liberally toward the expence.</p>
