          <salute>  My dear Scott</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">The first part of your letter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See Walter Scott to Robert Southey, 26 September 1824, in John Gibson Lockhart, <title>Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott</title>, 7 vols (London, 1837–1838), V, pp. 358–360. </note> which I must notice is that which holds out a hope of seeing you here with <ref type="m" target="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</ref>. You will I trust give me a day at least, – Eleven years I think have past since last we met,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Scott had visited Keswick briefly in June 1813.</note> – a large <del>xx</del> portion of even the longest life, – &#38; we are both of an age which renders its lapse visible I am now half an hundred years old, &#38; what makes me in retrospect appear older than I am, have past, by some years, my silver wedding day.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had married Edith Fricker on 14 November 1795, making his silver wedding anniversary 14 November 1820.</note> One of your sons has chosen his path in the world &#38; taken it,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Scott (1801–1847) had joined the army, eventually becoming a Lieutenant Colonel in the 15th Hussars.</note> – another you tell me is going to Oxford.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Scott (1805–1841) attended Brasenose College, Oxford 1824–1827, before joining the Foreign Office.</note> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">My only one</ref> is but beginning his accidence, – in his sixth year! Before he enters the world (-if he live to enter it,) his fathers head will in all likelihood be laid low. But he is a sweet, docile, hopeful creature, – so exactly at this time the living image of what <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">his dear brother</ref> was when you were at Keswick in 1813, – that I regard him at times almost with as much apprehension as tenderness.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  You mention <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>. I left him in February last with the mournful impression that I had seen him for the last time. He will, I suspect, hold the reins of the Quarterly, till they drop from his hands. As long ago as when he first communicated to me his inability to continue the management, &#38; his difficulty in finding a successor, I named both to him &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> a person whom they both knew, &#38; who had every qualification for the office, – <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> – a nephew of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">S.T.C’s</ref>. Were they to search these kingdoms they could not find a man better qualified; he is an excellent scholar, thoroughly bred at Eton &#38; at Oxford; – his talents they have tried &#38; known; – a man of sound judgement, great discretion, excellent opinions, &#38; high principle, – &#38; what is of some importance, a lawyer by profession. The matter has been repeatedly all but settled with him, &#38; yet it is not settled, nor likely to be so. The reasons I take to be these; – a natural unwillingness in <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> formally to resign even in part a management which he can no longer direct; – a notion as natural in <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> that he may get the business done at a cheaper rate, &#38; be in great measure his own manager: – an apprehension on the part of both that the Journal in <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridges</ref> hands would take its bias in some degree from me, – for I am considered by <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> as too bigoted, &#38; by <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> as too liberal; the certainty, alike unwelcome to both, that no articles would be admitted which could have no other effect than to wound the feelings &#38; injure the fortunes of an obnoxious author: – that there would be none of that injustice &#38; cruelty &#60;(for example)&#62; which was shown towards Keats,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The notorious review of John Keats (1795–1821; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Endymion</title> (1818) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 204–208, by John Wilson Croker, published 26 September 1818.</note> – &#38; lastly an overruling influence at the Admiralty.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The influence of John Wilson Croker, Secretary to the Admiralty 1809–1830, and John Barrow (1764–1848; <title>DNB</title>), Second Secretary to the Admiralty, 1804–1806, 1807–1845. </note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I should like to see such a parallel as you suggest between the Great Rebellion &#38; the French Revolution,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The English Civil War and Republic 1642–1660 and the French Revolution of 1789.</note> – drawn by your own hand. Very interesting it would be, &#38; very important are the warnings which it would convey, if nations ever were warned by experience. – After I had written that sketch of Cromwells life some years ago in the QR.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s ‘Life of Cromwell’, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 25 (July 1821), 279–347, on Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658; Lord Protector 1653–1658; <title>DNB</title>).</note> I was disposed to have taken up the subject <del>xxx</del> at length: but <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> offered me so <del>shabby</del> shabby a price that it would have been degrading to have listened to such a proposal. At present I have some thoughts of undertaking a summary view of our civil history to the accession of the house of Hanover under the title of the Book of the State.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this book on British history up to 1714.</note> This would require three octavo’s, – &#38; following it with the Age of George 3 – upon a larger scale, &#38; with an introductory &#38; connecting view of the two intermediate reigns.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey also did not write a history of the reign of George III (1738–1820; King of Great Britain 1760–1820; <title>DNB</title>), or any connecting material on the reigns of George I (1660–1727; King of Great Britain 1714–1727; <title>DNB</title>) and George II (1683–1760; King of Great Britain 1727–1760; <title>DNB</title>).</note> If I have not determined upon this, it is because no such offer is made me as I am entitled to expect.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">   Meantime I have enough upon my hands both in prose &#38; verse, &#38; feel too that as the future becomes shorter, it is the part of prudence to finish what is begun, rather than to plan more edifices &#38; lay new foundations, <hi rend="ital">immemor sepulchri</hi>.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">A partial quotation from Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65–8 BC), <title>Odes</title> (23 BC) Book 2, Ode 18, lines 17–18, ‘sepulcri/ Immemori struis domos’: ‘forgetful of the tomb, we build houses’.</note></p>
