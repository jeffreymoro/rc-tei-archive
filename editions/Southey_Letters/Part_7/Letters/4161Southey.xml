This was a translation of Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> who is one of the most distinguished men of letters in that country. The translation appears to be very well done, as far as I am able to judge: that is, I can see in the trying passages she has fully understood the original; &#38; her command of her own language is warranted by her husbands approbation, who is a severe critic as well as a skilful poet himself. He must be near 80 years of age, for he tells me he has been now threescore years known as an author<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Bilderdijk was only 63 years old at this time, but he was a chronic hypochondriac. His first poem was published in 1776 and his first major publication was the anonymous verse collection <title>Mijn Verlustiging</title> (1781), so his fame as a poet dated back 43 years, rather than the 60 years that Southey assumed to be the case. Bilderdijk and Schweickhardt married in 1802 but had lived together since 1797.</note> His letter to me is in Latin. The book comes in a red morocco livery. <del>I shall send</del> it is dedicated to me in an ode,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Rodrigo de Goth, Koning van Spanje</title>, 2 vols (The Hague, 1823–1824), I, pp. i–xii.</note> – &#38; a very beautiful one describing the delight she had taken in the poem, &#38; the consolation she had derived from it, – when parts of it came home to her own feelings in a time of severe affliction.</p>
