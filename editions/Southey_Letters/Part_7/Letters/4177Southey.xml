            <p rend="indent1">  If <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref> should deposit at your house a set of the engravings for “Roderick,”<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). Richard Westall, <title>Illustrations of Roderick, the Last of the Goths. A Poem, by Robert Southey, Esq. from the Drawings of R. Westall, R.A.</title> (1824), nos 2627–2628 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Longman published the latter and purchasers could arrange for the six engravings to be bound into their copy of <title>Roderick</title>. Southey invested in this venture.</note> which I wish to send to my Dutch translatress,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Katherina Bilderdijk, née Schweickhardt (1776–1830), <title>Rodrigo de Goth, Koning van Spanje</title>, 2 vols (The Hague, 1823–1824), I, pp. i–xii, no. 2701 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, where it was described as ‘<hi rend="ital">red morocco, gilt leaves</hi>’. This was a translation of Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> will you have the goodness to transmit them to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, whom I have intrusted to pack them up with a copy of the “Book of the Church,”<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> and despatch the parcel. I had a note from him, the other day, saying he had put a second edition of that book to the press. Whether the engravings are published I do not know.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I am profiting by the communication with Holland. A very well–informed <ref type="m" target="people.html#ClercqWillem">Mr. Willem de Clercq</ref> shows a great disposition to correspond with me, and answer my enquiries de <hi rend="ital">omnibus rebus et quibusdam aliis</hi>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">‘of all things and some others’.</note> Oh, that I had such a correspondent at Lisbon, or at Madrid! I find him, however, very useful, and shall request <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> forthwith to procure for me some German works upon the Peninsular War, which he has pointed out.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The bibliography of his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), III, p. 936, suggests that Southey was probably seeking: Hermann von Staff (1790–1867), <title>Der Befreiungs–Krieg der Katalonier, in den Jahren 1808 bis 1814</title> (1821–1827); and Franz Xaver Rigel (1783–1852), <title>Die Siebenjahrige Kampf auf der Pyrenaischen Halbinsel vom Jahre 1807 bis 1814; besonders miene eigenen Erfahrungen in disem Kriege; nebst Bemerkungen uber das Spanische Volk und Land</title> (1819–1821), no. 2442 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> You would be amused at his letters, which are written in very odd English; but I wish I could read Dutch as well.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> is to return to Palace Yard this day; we have just heard from her. She has been so unwell in Sussex as to lie in bed one whole day and great part of the next, – the effect, I suppose, of too much travelling and excitement.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">   In reply to a question, how she liked the South Downs? her answer is, “To tell the truth, I quite despise them, they are just like little molehills.” What airs these young mountaineers give themselves! When she is a little older, she will understand that downs are not to be compared with mountains, and learn to enjoy any scenery that is really enjoyable, – and there is very little natural scenery which is not so.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  Having given up all hope of getting Olivares’s “History of the War in Catalonia,”<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, published in four volumes at Seville in 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877 and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911. Murray had then written to Spain to try and obtain these books for Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832), and Herbert Hill had also offered to help. Southey had then sought the assistance of George Canning. Finally, Southey had written to John Mitford, 12 April 1824, Letter 4171.</note> I have to–day set upon that part of my subject from such materials as I possess, and the second volume, accordingly, will go to press in a few days.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> What will become of Portugal with such a creature as D. Miguel<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Michael I (1802–1866; King of Portugal 1828–1834). He was the second surviving son of John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826), but was likely to succeed his father as his elder brother, Peter IV (1798–1834; King of Portugal March–May 1826), had become Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831. Michael was an extreme reactionary and was shortly to be exiled for plotting a coup against his father.</note> for heir–apparent! He seems very much to resemble Affonso VI.,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Afonso VI (1643–1683; King of Portugal 1656–1683). In 1668 he was declared incapable, and power passed to a regency.</note> if there be any truth in such accounts as get into the newspapers. And his brother in Brazil is of the same stamp. Did I tell you that one of this Emperor’s amusements is <hi rend="ital">to ride negroes with spurs</hi>? With regard both to the Braganzas and the Spanish Bourbons,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The Braganzas had been the ruling dynasty of Portugal since 1640, while the Bourbons had ruled Spain since 1700.</note> I fear Jupiter has determined to destroy them; for he has certainly taken away their senses!<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">As in the proverb, ‘Whom Jupiter would ruin, he first makes mad’. Jupiter was the King of the Roman gods and this is a neo-Latinised version from the seventeenth century of a Greek saying. </note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> A little encouragement would make me think seriously of a <title>Book of the State</title>,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this book.</note> – tracing the course of political events with the view of showing their effect upon the condition and progress of society.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> How is <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">Louisa</ref>? how are the children?<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey, Jnr (b. 1817), Charles Gonne Southey (1819–1861) and Henry Herbert Southey, Jnr (1822–1829).</note> My love to them. I wish you were all here to enjoy this delicious weather. God bless you.</p>
