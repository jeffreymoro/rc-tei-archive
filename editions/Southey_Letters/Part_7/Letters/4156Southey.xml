          <salute>  My dear Sir</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">You will do me a great kindness if you can procure some subscriptions for what will be a very respectable book, made with great care upon a plan which I suggested, &#38; with a good deal of my assistance. The subject includes the whole of the islands, Spanish, French &#38;c. &#38; therefore can only be treated in that chronological form which is common enough in the French language, but of which Andrewes,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">James Pettit Andrews (1737–1797; <title>DNB</title>), <title>History of Great Britain, Connected with the Chronology of Europe from Caesar’s Invasion to the Accession of Edward VI</title> (1794–1795), no. 166 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> I think, has given the only English specimen. A great body of facts will be brought together in the only practicable order, &#38; I shall intersperse general views</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> What you say of my Book,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> both from yourself, &#38; from the Bishop of Durham,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Shute Barrington (1734–1826; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Durham 1791–1826.</note> gratifies me as it ought to do. It would not be difficult for me to give references in some future edition; but I really felt that the scale of the work seemed neither to require nor justify it. A sketch of our Church History was all that the limits of the work (tho extended to thrice the original design) would allow: &#38; in that, I thought that while the inferences were my own the facts were too notorious to stand in need of any vouchers. This ground I have for trusting <del>that</del> it may be useful, that I am sure it would have been most essentially so to me, if such a work had been put into my hands in my youth.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I am persuaded that it might be of considerable use if there were a Professor of English History in each of our Universities &#38; if the divinity students were examined as to their knowledge of the ecclesiastical, – &#38; all other in the <del>civil</del> political part. Our institutions are depreciated because they are not understood.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I past <del>four &#38; twen</del> six &#38; thirty hours at Cambridge during my travels. It is to be hoped that what they are doing there will excite a spirit of emulation at Oxford; – the sight of such buildings rising in every direction<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The expansion of undergraduate numbers after 1815 led to new buildings being erected in Cambridge by, among others, King’s, Trinity, St John’s, Corpus and Peterhouse Colleges.</note> gave me, tho an Oxonian, a feeling of English delight, such as I have seldom experienced. Still the enlargement of the old Universities appears to me less desirable than the foundation of a new one in these northern parts, – at Durham, or at Hexham.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Durham University was founded in 1832, though Southey would have preferred it to be based at Hexham.</note> And if we had a Prime Minister with <ref type="m" target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Percevals</ref> principles &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Percevals</ref> warmth of heart, I should not despair of seeing such a measure effected However nothing is to be despaired of. Give peace in our time O Lord,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A quotation from the morning and evening service in the Church of England’s <title>Book of Common Prayer</title> (1662).</note> &#38; <del>xx</del> we may then obtain every thing which is desirable. The better spirit is prevailing, &#38; we must not relax in our endeavours to keep it up.</p>
