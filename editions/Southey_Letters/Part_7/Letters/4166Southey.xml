          <p rend="indent1">  Unluckily for me there prevails an opinion that I am a person of great interest, &#38; can assist any body in any line of life. And what is more to be regretted is, that among many troublesome <del>interxx</del> applications, &#38; not a few impertinent ones, others occasionally occur which make me really wish it were in my power to befriend the applicant.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Some years ago a youth for whom I was much interested (<ref type="m" target="people.html#DusautoyJames">Dusautoy</ref> was his name) was cut off by the fever at Cambridge. Both his genius &#38; his attainments were very great, &#38; beyond all doubt if he had lived he would have been a most distinguished person. He was one of a large family, the parents of which (the father is a half pay officer)<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">James Du Sautoy (1761–1859) had retired as a Lieutenant in the Royal Marines in 1798 and was barrack-master of the cavalry at Totnes 1803–1822; his wife was Mary Du Sautoy, née Hinton (d. 1851).</note> have endeavoured by the strictest economy to give their sons those advantages which would be well disposed upon such subjects. One of the sons<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Frederick Dusautoy (c. 1802–1891), younger brother of James Dusautoy. He was admitted as a sizar (i.e. a student receiving financial assistance in return for set duties) at Queen’s College, Cambridge, on 5 July 1824. He graduated BA 1828 and MA 1831, was a Fellow of his College 1830–1835 and became a clergyman. After a long series of curacies, he became Vicar of Mark, near Bridgwater, 1860–1891. Dusautoy also published on a wide range of subjects, including geology.</note> applied to me lately to get him entered as a sizer at Cambridge. I tried without success,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to [Samuel Tillbrook], [c.

The other tutor was probably William Augustus Pemberton (1773–1816), a clergyman and Registrar of Cambridge University 1809–1816, who is the only other Fellow of the College who died in the period 1813–1824 and has a monument in the College’s cloister.</note> was one) – are buried in the same cloysters with him. – He is nearly 26, &#38; of course cannot wait.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> Can you procure a Bible-Clerkship<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Bible Clerks were students at Oxford University who received benefits such as reduced fees or free meals in return for set duties, such as reading aloud chapters from the Bible at meals or in chapel.</note> for him, – or any thing which might contribute to his support? – Devonshire is his county.</p>

The term ‘Bible Clerk’ had come into use in preference to that of ‘servitor’, as the duties attached to this role had, in the past, included acting as a servant to other students, and wearing a distinctive plain black gown and round hat.</note> His arguments seem to me just – if the same state of feeling existed now upon that subject, as prevailed two or three centuries ago. In this respect the system at Cambridge is very much better</p>

Ch. as he said he intended to do? – My designs upon George Fox<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">George Fox (1624–1691; <title>DNB</title>), the founder of Quakerism.
