            <p rend="indent1">I would fain have let <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C’s</ref> hopes concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> die gradually, of a natural death, but the position in which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gillman<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">James Gillman (1782–1839) had taken Coleridge into his house in Highgate 1816; Coleridge continued to live there until his death. Hartley Coleridge had stayed with his father occasionally since his Fellowship at Oriel College, Oxford, was terminated in 1820. Gillman had suggested that Hartley Coleridge should come to live at Greta Hall.</note> has placed me, made this impossible. I therefore put both the letters into her hands.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">My sincere hope is that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">H.</ref> may not accept <ref type="m" target="people.html#Dawes">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dawes</ref> invitation.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Hartley, and his brother Derwent Coleridge, had attended the school at Ambleside run by John Dawes. Dawes had written to Hartley, asking him to visit Ambleside.</note> The scheme of sending him to be under his mothers eye is <del>so</del> preposterous, even if it were possible. What authority can a mother exercise over a man of six &#38; twenty,—the very disease of whose nature is an impatience of all ordinary observances, &#38; &#60;of&#62;, the restraints which he owes to himself as well as others! – I cannot understand how <del>xxxx</del> <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> can be kept in ignorance of his sons conduct, – nor indeed how he can be ignorant of it at this time, if it has been such as to render his abode at Highgate impossible, &#38; to eject him from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MontaguBasil">Montagues</ref>: knowing these irregularities, what is there in a fresh instance which is to prove fatal to him if revealed?</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gillmans drift is evident, &#38; I am surprized that he should have formed so senseless a scheme. By his own account the possibility of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">H’s</ref> obtaining testimonials is now postponed sine die:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘without day’, i.e. for an indefinite period.</note> I believe indeed for ever. He has no means of living but by his pen; this we all know to be a miserable thing, but he has brought himself to it, &#38; nothing remains but to make the best of it. But to live thus he must be in London, upon the spot, within reach of books &#38; booksellers, editors to set him to work, &#38; printers devils to goad him for copy. The same habits which disqualify him for orders, unfit him also for a tutor. Writing is his only resource; &#38; it is in London that he must follow it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">As to his living under my roof,—for to this the question comes—I certainly will not suffer any such disturbance of my peace &#38; comfort as such an arrangement would inevitably bring with it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C</ref> perfectly understands this, &#38; would have written yesterday to make M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> G understand it, if she had been sufficiently recovered from the shock. – She wishes G. had not exposed the matter to us, that is natural &#38; therefore excusable</p>
            <p rend="indent1">There has been no letter either from <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">H.</ref> or Jamieson.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Sympson Jameson (1796–1854), barrister and old school-friend of Hartley Coleridge from Ambleside. Jameson was later Chief Justice of Dominica 1829–1833 and Attorney-General of Upper Canada 1833–1837, settling in Canada until his death. Hartley had been living with Jameson in London since June 1821.</note> If you have not heard that they have already packed him off for Westmorland, I think you had better write to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gillman &#38; tell him our thorough disapprobation of the scheme; &#38; remind him, which he seems to have forgotten, that <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> has no establishment in which he can be received.—I have vexations &#38; burdens enough of my own, God knows, —&#38; of a hopeless kind, to which there will be no end as long as I live.	</p>
