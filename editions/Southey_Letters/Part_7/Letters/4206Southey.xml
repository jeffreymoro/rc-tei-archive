           <p rend="indent1"> I had nearly forgotten to answer your question concerning the books which elucidate our Eccl. History.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey goes on to list his sources for <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> The two works which profess <del>that</del> to embrace that subject exclusively are Fullers,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Fuller (1607/8–1661; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Church-History of Britain: from the Birth of Jesus Christ until the Year MDCXLVIII, with the History of the University of Cambridge and of Waltham-abby in Essex, Founded by King Harold</title> (1655), no. 1190 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Oxford University Press did publish a new edition, edited by John Sherren Brewer (1810–1879; <title>DNB</title>), but not until 1845.</note> &#38; Jeremy Collier’s.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Jeremy Collier (1650–1726; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain, Chiefly of England: from the First Planting of Christianity, to the End of the Reign of Charles the Second</title> (1708–1714). Collier was a High Churchman and refused to accept the Revolution of 1688, eventually becoming a non-juring bishop in 1713.</note> The first will I hope be reprinted at the Clarendon Press, for with all its manifold imperfections it contains much matter for which no other authority can now be found the record of the Convocation<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Convocations of Canterbury and York were the assemblies of bishops and clergy of the two Provinces of the Church of England. They approved revisions to canon law and agreed to taxes on the clergy, but their meetings had been formalities since 1717. Their proceedings can be gleaned from medieval archbishops’ registers and Southey could have consulted David Wilkins (1685–1745; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Concilia Magnae Britanniae et Hiberniae a Synodo Verolamiensi A.D. 446 ad Londinensam A.D. 1717</title> (1737).</note> having been destroyed. &#38; it has moreover all the inimitable charm of Fullers manner. – Collier is coarse &#38; clumsy – - a bigot – on the right side. – It was necessary that I should have both at hand, but you would find upon investigation that I have drawn my materials from other sources, Collier’s never lay open before me, – &#38; Fuller’s I believe only in the reign of James I.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">James VI and I (1567–1625; King of Great Britain 1603–1625; <title>DNB</title>).</note></p>

           <p rend="indent1"> To my sorrow I had no original authorities for the life of Becket,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">St Thomas Becket (1119/1120–1170; <title>DNB</title>), Archbishop of Canterbury 1162–1170.</note> except such as were in the App. to Ld Lyttletons history.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton (1709–1773; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of the Life of King Henry the Second, and of the Age in Which he Lived</title>, 5 vols (London, 1769–1771), IV, pp. 413–521, no. 1771 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> Berrington<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Berington (1743–1827; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of the Reign of Henry the Second, and of Richard and John, his Sons; With the Events of the Period, from 1154 to 1216.

            <p rend="indent1"> Then came the whole series of Strypes laborious compilations,<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">John Strype (1643–1737; <title>DNB</title>), whose lives of sixteenth-century divines were important sources for church history. Southey acquired the twenty-three-volume Clarendon Press edition of Strype’s <title>Works</title> (1816–1824), no. 2753 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – in which I believe nothing has escaped me, tho in this work I have not made use of the 50th part of my references to them. – Fox.

All the lives of Laud<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">William Laud (1573–1645; <title>DNB</title>), Archbishop of Canterbury 1633–1645.

This was a biography of John Williams (1582–1650; <title>DNB</title>), Archbishop of York 1641–1650.</note> – a much more important book (in spite of its odd, but very amusing stile) than it is generally known to be.

           <p rend="indent1"> Every body has cried out for references.
