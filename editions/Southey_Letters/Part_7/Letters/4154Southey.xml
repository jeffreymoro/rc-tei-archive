He will have some essential aid from me in carrying it thro the press, &#38; the book will be creditable to him, &#38; useful as comprizing what is nowhere else to be found. If he can obtain two hundred subscribers, <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> has undertaken to print 750 copies.
