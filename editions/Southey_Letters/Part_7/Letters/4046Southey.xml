In a few years he would have had nothing to do but to die, – &#38; if length of life is not desirable for the sake of others, certainly it is not for oneself. He was a worthy man, whom it would always have given me pleasure to have met.</p>

Like his father he was educated at Westminster School (1817–1824) and Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1828, MA 1831). In later life he was variously a Clerk at the Board of Control 1827–1832, a barrister and a Liberal MP for Leominster 1852–1857. In 1820 Phillimore had passed ‘The Challenge’ examination and become one of 40 King’s Scholars at Westminster. They had their own house known as ‘College’ and considerable privileges, including the right to proceed to closed scholarships at Trinity College, Cambridge, or Christ Church, Oxford.</note> has been playing the tyrant in College over <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">a cousin of mine</ref>, &#38; has got into a scrape about it. He did not get this despotism from <ref type="m" target="people.html#PhillimoreJoseph">his father</ref>, – &#38; for his fathers sake I am truly sorry that he has shown it. The masters of our public schools are very reprehensible for not effectually putting a stop to this evil. It was in great danger of being carried from school to Cambridge, since the Colleges has been full, &#38; the town crowded with undergraduates. Some who had proceeded <hi rend="ital">Beasts</hi> from school took advantage of the license which lodgings allowed them to annoy those whom they had been accustomed to ill treat, challenges were the consequence, – &#38; this has been one of the reasons for enlarging the Colleges there with the view of not permitting any person to lodge out of their walls. – I heard this last year from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthChristopher">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wordsworth</ref>. </p>
