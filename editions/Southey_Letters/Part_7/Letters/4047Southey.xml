Irving’s popularity had begun to wane by 1827, and in 1833 he was expelled from the Church of Scotland.</note> is to let him alone, – &#38; in a very short time he will sink as low as Col. Wardle<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle (c. 1761–1833), the MP for Okehampton 1807–1812, who had gained temporary fame when he publicised alleged corruption in army appointments in January 1809. However, his reputation plummeted later that year when it was revealed he had paid substantial sums to gain evidence of the events he condemned and was in collusion with some of the parties he had accused. </note> &#38; the Young Roscius.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Henry West Betty (1791–1874; <title>DNB</title>), child actor, known as the ‘Young Roscius’, after the famous Roman actor, Quintus Roscius Gallus (c. 126–62 BC).

                  <p rend="indent1">Hayleys book seems to me a good thread for the literature of that age in which he was <hi rend="ital">in flower</hi>, &#38; it contains anecdotes enough to make an interesting life, if well put together.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of John Johnson (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title> (1823), no. 1179 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 31 (March 1825), 263–311.</note> There is an admission on the editors part that his course of life had not been what it ought.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">John Johnson (1769–1833; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Hayley, Esq. the Friend and Biographer of Cowper, Written by Himself; with Extracts from his Private Correspondence, and Unpublished Poetry; and Memoirs of his Son Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the Young Sculptor</title>, 2 vols (London, 1823), II, p. 218. William Hayley (1745–1820; <title>DNB</title>) had a complex private life. He separated from his first wife, Eliza Ball (1750–1797), in 1789 and from his, much younger, second wife, Mary Welford (1781–1848), in 1812 after only three years of marriage. He also had at least one illegitimate child, Thomas Alphonso Hayley (1780–1800; <title>DNB</title>).</note> As you say he survived his works, &#38; yet he has the merit of having awakened that taste for Italian &#38; Spanish Literature from which we are deriving so much.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">William Hayley, <title>An Essay on Epic Poetry; in Five Epistles to the Revd Mr. Mason. With Notes</title> (London, 1782), pp. 202–273, included accounts of the life and work of Lope Félix de Vega y Carpio (1562–1635) and Alonso de Ercilla y Zuñiga (1533–1594), with quotations and translations. This provided Southey’s introduction to Spanish poetry.</note></p>

This was an early translation of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), <title>Faust, Part One</title> (1808).</note> The merits no doubt lie in the <hi rend="ital">manner</hi>, &#38; are therefore untranslatable, as is the case with Horace &#38; Virgil.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65–8 BC) and Publius Vergilius Maro (70–19 BC), Roman poets.</note> It is plainly an imitation of the Spanish drama, – &#38; our Elizabethan dramatists judged I think more rightly than Lord L Gower, when they preferred our dramatic blank verse to the manner of their Spanish prototypes. He has rhymed it with great skill &#38; freedom; – but in the drama this is doing a bad thing well.</p>

	<postscript><p rend="indent1">The French, you see, are announcing just such a collection of English Memoirs as I advised you to undertake.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to John Murray, 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693. However, Murray had not proceeded with this project. Possibly to try and stir Murray into action, Southey is here drawing Murray’s attention to the following report: ‘The success of the Collection of Memoirs, relative to the French Revolution, has induced the publication of a Collection of Memoirs relative to the English Revolution; two volumes are published, containing Memoirs of Warwick, in the reign of Charles I., and the first volume of Thomas May’s History of the Long Parliament. The following livraisons will contain the Memoirs of Fairfax, Ludlow, Price, Thomas Herbert, Sir William Temple, Major Huntington, Bishop Burnet, Lord Clarendon, &#38;c.’ (<title>London Magazine</title>, 7 (April 1823), ‘Sketch of Foreign Literature’, 471).</note></p></postscript>
