<salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">The time of my departure is now as well fixed as any thing beforehand can be in this uncertain world, for Monday the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of November. But how long I may be on the road depends upon circumstances. I take charge of four ladies,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#CharterLouisa">Louisa Charter</ref>, and Elizabeth Charter (1782–1860), friend of the poet George Crabbe (1754–1832; <title>DNB</title>). They were the sisters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyEmma">Emma Peachy</ref>, first wife of William Peachy, and nieces of Sir Charles Malet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), 1st Baronet, a prominent diplomat with the East India Company. Peachy had lent the Charter sisters his home on Derwent Island. They were accompanied by Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), the maternal uncle of the Charter sisters. Their other companion was one of Sir Charles Malet’s three children in India with Amber Kaur (b. 1772): Eliza (b. 1791); Henry Charles (1793–1844); and Louisa (b. 1795). They accompanied Malet to Britain in 1798 and were brought up with his children by Susanna Malet. Eliza Malet married, in 1812, Robert Ekins (1785–1874), Vicar of Godalming 1810–1833, Rector of Folke, Dorset 1833–1843, Perpetual Curate of North Wootton 1843–1854. Southey is probably referring here to Louisa Malet.</note> besides <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</ref>. We shall fill two chaises, &#38; if the weather permits we mean to see the Yorkshire caves, Gordale scar, &#38; Bolton Abbey,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A limestone ravine in North Yorkshire; and the ruins of a twelfth-century Augustinian monastery.</note> on the way, &#38; moreover the posteriors of Beelzebub in the Peak,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Peak Cavern, near Castleton, Derbyshire, also known as the Devil’s Arse.</note> – all which will occupy a whole week before we reach Derby. And there we are to separate if <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George Beaumont</ref> should by that time be at Cole Orton, in which case <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> &#38; I must visit him for a few days. Upon leaving him we shall get into some coach at Loughborough &#38; endeavor to reach London on the Saturday. Send me I pray you 40 £. I have to make arrangements with <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> about the B. of the Church,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> when I arrive, on which I depend for my ways and means. It is too good a chance in the lottery for me to part with it, if I can help it. He was to have given me 500 £ for it in one volume. By doubling its size I very well know that I have not doubled its marketable value; &#38; I think it will be better to recur to a former agreement whereby I am to have half the profits of the first edition, &#38; two thirds of every succeeding one. But I shall need 200 £ while I am in town, – &#38; must bargain accordingly, – for I am wofully on the wrong side of the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmens</ref> books.</p>
               <p rend="indent1">The truth is (&#38; it is not a comfortable one) that I neither write so much, nor compose so fast, as I was wont to do when younger. My health requires more exercise, – absolutely requires it. – And as I am more careful what I write, an over-scrupulous solicitude has been contracted, for looking into every accessible source of information upon the subject before me, at an injurious expence of time.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have proposed to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> to publish a selection of my papers from the QR. I do not expect any objection to the proposal, &#38; if he assents to it I shall begin with the Essays Moral &#38; Political, altering, restoring &#38; adding as may seem best, &#38; incorporating somethings from the Register, &#38; from the Annual Review.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">This project became <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title> (1832). Southey had reviewed extensively for the <title>Annual Review for 1802</title>, 1 (1803) until the <title>Annual Review for 1808</title>, 7 (1809) and written the historical sections of the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title> (1810) until the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813). Essays I–III in <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), I, pp. [3]–72, and Essays XI–XII in <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), II, pp. [277]–328, were mainly drawn from the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register</title>. None of Southey’s contributions to the <title>Annual Review</title> formed the basis of an essay, but parts of Southey’s review of Thomas Malthus (1766–1834; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Essay on the Principle of Population</title> (1803), <title>Annual Review for 1803</title>, 2 (1804), 292–301, were grafted onto Essay IV of <title>Essays, Moral and Political</title>, 2 vols (London, 1832), I, pp. [73]–155, which was mainly taken from Southey’s review of Patrick Colquhoun (1745–1820; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Propositions for Ameliorating the Condition of the Poor: and for Improving the Moral Habits, and Increasing the Comforts of the Labouring People</title> (1812), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (December 1812), 319–356.</note> They will very well bear to be thus brought forward. The Historical &#38; Ecclesiastical Essays might follow, – &#38; lastly the Critical &#38; Miscellaneous, – leaving the biographical for another use.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">These further volumes did not appear.</note> I hope you may have saved the copy or the proofs of some of my papers, which have undergone wicked mutilation. The last escaped pretty well.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Bishop Burnet’s History of his Own Time: with the Suppressed Passages of the First Volume and Notes by the Earls of Dartmouth and Hardwicke, and Speaker Onslow, Hitherto Unpublished; to Which are Added the Cursory Remarks of Swift, and Other Observations </title>(1823), no. 498 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. This was a new edition of Gilbert Burnet (1643–1715; <title>DNB</title>), <title>History of My Own Time</title> (1724–1734), edited by Martin Routh (1755–1854; <title>DNB</title>). Southey reviewed it in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 29 (April 1823), 165–214, published 27–28 September 1823.</note> But the article upon the Progress of Infidelity,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), ‘Histoire de la Théophilantropie, depuis sa Naissance jusqu’à son Extinction’, part of Grégoire’s <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title>, 2 vols (Paris, 1814), II, pp. 55–171, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 493–536, published 8 July 1823.

The book was a translation of Martin Dobrizhoffer (1717–1791), <title>Historia de Abiponibus Equestri, Bellicosaque Paraquariae Natione</title> (1784), no. 843 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> Camoens,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">John Adamson, <title>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Luis de Camoens</title> (1820), no. 10 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.

Minister of the Gospel, at Providence Chapel, Gray’s Inn Lane, Completed to the Close of the Year 1806</title> (1811), appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24 (January 1821), 462–510, published 6 April 1821.</note> suffered grievously. – If this scheme takes effect it may very materially lessen my cares for three or four years, should I live so long.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You will hardly recollect <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</ref> when you see her.

If the Rickmans<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">John Rickman</ref> and his family.</note> should be in town, my quarters will be a short time with them, &#38; how many recollections will that house bring with it! But I must be chiefly at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>. I bring up work with me to finish &#38; as soon as it is done, shall hurry down upon a series of flying visits to Devon &#38; Somersetshire, – &#38; on my way back must fly also into Suffolk &#38; Norfolk. It almost dismays me to think of all this, – but I hope that change of air, plenty of motion, &#38; a good allowance of claret will put me in better <del>xxx</del> tone than I have been since the relaxation brought on by my last annual attack. </p>

            <p rend="indent1">Bad as the season has been we have had some glorious caravan parties at which it would have done your heart good to have been present. Yesterday we were at Watenlath, &#38; dined on the fell side, looking down upon Borrodale, thirteen persons &#38; five horses, – &#38; this was the smallest force with which we have taken the field this year. It is a symptom of sound heart at least that my inclination for such things increases rather than diminishes.</p>
