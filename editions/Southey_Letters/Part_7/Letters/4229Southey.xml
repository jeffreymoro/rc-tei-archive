            <p rend="indent1">Dear friend what is become of you? Day after day I have lived in hope of hearing that you <del>xx</del> were laying in a new stock of health. There is a physical <hi rend="ital">regeneration</hi> which sometimes takes place, – I have known two instances of it where the liver was the seat of the disease,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">One was <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor Charles Bedford</ref>; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 8 July 1810, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 1791. The other was <ref type="m" target="people.html#DanversMrs">Mrs Danvers</ref>; see Southey to Caroline Bowles, 30 August 1825, Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 85–87. </note> – &#38; my hope – my earnest hope is that you may be the third. You have a great deal to do, – &#38; I have a great deal to do which will not be done without you.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and Bowles were beginning work on ‘Robin Hood’. The resulting incomplete poem was published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey.

I am now tolerably recovered tho there are yet some remains of the cough, – but I am regaining strength, &#38; have taken my first long walk this day.</p>

            <p rend="indent1"> I laid this aside, thinking to inclose what you will find inclosed, &#38; hoping to have added more. But interruptions have <del>xxx</del> intervened, &#38; ailments also. One of the flaws in this clay tenement of mine, which every now &#38; then is patched for a time, has <del>just now</del> widened since I began this letter, &#38; requires I am afraid a more skilful hand to repair it than can be found here. Meantime I have just had an epistle from <ref type="m" target="people.html#PettetAlfred">the poor Musician</ref> to whose collection you contributed at my request; – he says</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> “I feel infinitely obliged by your kindness in interesting Miss Bowles in favour of my projected publication; but I much regret to add that I am prevented using “The Mariner’s Hymn”,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles had offered to contribute ‘The Mariner’s Hymn’, later published in <title>Solitary Hours</title> (London, 1826), pp. 22–24, to Alfred Pettet’s <title>Original Sacred Music</title> (London, n.d., c. 1825–1827). When it was rejected it was replaced by ‘I weep, but not rebellious tears’, later published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [227]–228.</note> owing to the difficulty of setting it in an effective manner. I have submitted it to the perusal of several of my musical friends, who all admire the exact &#38; beautiful imagery of the poetry, but are diffident of their power to supply that peculiar &#38; descriptive style of music which it would require. The difficulty would be less if the piece were shorter; but I feel that to curtail it would be to destroy its symmetry; it would therefore be bad taste to entertain a wish to that effect – I trust I shall not be considered troublesome in expressing a strong desire to be honoured with Miss Bowles’s assistance in giving additional value to my collection; &#38; I make the request with less diffidence from the circumstance of my professional brethren Sir George Smart, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Attwood &#38; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bishop<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir George Thomas Smart (1776–1867; <title>DNB</title>), a music teacher, conductor and organiser of music festivals; Thomas Attwood (1765–1838; <title>DNB</title>), a composer and organist; and Sir Henry Rowley Bishop (1786–1855; <title>DNB</title>), a composer.</note> being anxious to employ themselves in setting Original Hymns of the first class of merit.”</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You have his words. – I do not like to send him my favourite poem<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles’s ‘It is not Death’, <title>Solitary Hours</title> (London, 1826), pp. 58–60.</note> – which you intended for him, – because it ought to appear first in a volume of your own, – &#38; moreover it is I think hardly admissable into his plan which purposes only Psalms, Miscellaneous Hymns &#38; Anthems. – Send me something if you can, – or tell me if you cannot, – &#38; in either case I shall hear from you, – for I am seriously uneasy at your silence. My thoughts are often with you, &#38; there is not a spot here where we have walked together, but what brings you to my mind.</p>

Can any be more incongruous with dignified poetry than the name of <del>such a</del> &#60;this latter&#62; personage? – yes, – his portrait is even more so. But I wish I could shew you both, – for you have a liking for odd things &#38; these I am sure would amuse you. – I am bound however to pursue this long delayed poem,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s unfinished epic, ‘Oliver Newman’, set in New England.
