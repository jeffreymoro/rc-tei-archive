            <p rend="indent1">I am glad you are satisfied with my proceedings in the Peninsular War.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832) had just been published; the whole work was dedicated to George IV.</note> – <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnightonSirWilliam">Sir Wm Knighton</ref> has written to me expressing by <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Kings</ref> command his satisfaction at receiving the book, &#38; his estimation of the usefulness &#38; importance of my literary labours, – this is said in terms sufficiently flattering, – to which <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> has added with his own hand “entirely approved GR.” – This I suppose is a mark of especial favour.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Booksellers will always be booksellers, &#38; estimate books merely by their sale. But I do not believe that if the book had been published seven years ago, which would have been seven years too soon, that fifty copies more if it would have been sold. I have heard nothing from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">him</ref> since its appearance, &#38; little from any body else. Except that <ref type="m" target="people.html#DalrympleHew">Sir Hew Dalrymple</ref> has thanked me for his copy, &#38; expressed himself much gratified by the manner in which he is mentioned; – at the same time disclaiming any share in the censure conveyed in p. 583;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, p. 583, had condemned British officers for socialising with their French counterparts after the Convention of Cintra (1808). Given the war crimes that the French had perpetrated in Portugal, this was to Southey ‘a moral fault, as well as a political error.’</note> saying that he never saw Junot,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean-Andrache Junot (1771–1813), a French General who commanded the forces that invaded Portugal in 1808.</note> &#38; did not enter Lisbon till the French had embarkd.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> A Major Tomkinson of the Light Dragoons has also written to me, in consequence of reading this volume, to offer me any parts of his journal, which I may wish to see.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">William Tomkinson (1790–1872) joined the 16th Light Dragoons as a cornet in 1808 and served in Spain 1809–1813. He was a Captain at Waterloo (1815). His diary was later published as <title>The Diary of a Cavalry Officer in the Peninsular and Waterloo Campaign, 1809–1815</title> (1894).</note> He joined in 1809, &#38; was in every battle with the <ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke</ref> till the end of the war, except that of Talavera, having been left wounded at Porto.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Battle of Talavera, 27–28 July 1809, in which Anglo-Spanish forces compelled the French army to withdraw. Tomkinson had been seriously wounded at the Battle of the Douro on 11 May 1809 and so missed Talavera.</note> – I have requested him to let me see the whole Journal.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> It is not my fault that the second vol. is not in the press. I applied to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> more than six months ago to procure me a history of the war in Catalonia, &#38; a biographical work connected with it , both by the same author Luis de Oliveira (I think) is the name.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. It mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877; and 1 November [1822], Letter 3911.</note> He served in that province, &#38; is said to be a man of great talents. The first chapter of this volume must include the proceedings in Catalonia from the entrance of Gouvion S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cyr &#38; the siege of Rosas, to the defeat of the Spaniards, &#38; the breaking up the blockade of Barcelona,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), II, pp. 37–59. French forces led by Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr (1764–1830) captured the town of Rosas on 5 December 1808 after a month-long siege. This allowed them to proceed to relieve the French army surrounded in Barcelona.</note> – - &#38; of course I will not write this part, till I can have these Spanish works before me. Then I shall get on briskly; being fully provided with matter, &#38; having no difficulties of arrangement.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">At present I am pursuing the B of the Church<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> – but I must very soon set about a paper for the Review,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Henri Grégoire (1750–1831), ‘Histoire de la Théophilantropie, depuis sa Naissance jusqu’à son Extinction’, part of Grégoire’s <title>Histoire des Sectes Religieuse, qui, Depuis de Commencement du Siecle Dernier Jusqu’a l’Epoque Actuelle, sont Nées, se sont Modifiées, se sont Éteintes dans le Quatre Parties du Monde</title>, 2 vols (Paris, 1814), II, pp. 55–171, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 28 (January 1823), 493–536, published 8 July 1823. The book was no. 2838 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> – of all employments that which I like the least, – but I cannot supply my current expences without it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> is got to the head of his department in his Exchequer.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">James Fisher (c. 1758–1821), the Chief Clerk in the Auditor’s Office had died on 15 December 1821. Bedford duly succeeded Fisher as Chief Clerk 1822–1834, relinquishing his post of Clerk of Registers and Issues, which he had held since 1806. The salary was £1,200 p.a., hence the large amount of stamp duty Bedford had to pay on the documents appointing him to his office.</note> The situation ought to be a good, for the stamps upon his appointment come to 75£. – <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> noluit episcopari<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">‘did not want to be bishop’. Elmsley had declined the Bishopric of Calcutta that Wynn had offered him. The post was in Wynn’s gift as he was President of the Board of Control. Eventually, Reginald Heber accepted the post.</note> at Calcutta, very wisely, – tho he would have been the better for melting. I believe there is some difficulty in finding a fit person to accept that undesirable promotion. It is a banishment for life, &#38; they require as much personal exertions from the Bishop, as a Manufacturer does from one of his Riders.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. salesmen.</note> A man must have the spirit of a Missionary to <del>a xxxx</del> undertake it. A church in India they ought to have, in every account, political as well as religious; – but as I have told <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, they can never supply it from this country, &#38; therefore ought to educate half-cast men for it, in India.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Our weather is severe. The report in <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> – which I have just heard, is, that I have prophesied a frost of thirteen weeks continuance, &#38; ice upon the lake eighteen inches thick!!</p>

            <postscript><p rend="indent1">I must get <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Dr</ref> to enquire among his Portugueze acquaintance whether any account of the war has been published in that country subsequent to that of which I have made so m[MS missing] by Jose Accursio das Neves.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">José Acúrsio das Neves (1766–1834), <title>Histório Geral da Invasão dos Francezes em Portugal e de Restauração deste Reino</title> (1810–1811), no. 3164 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> His history ends with the first invasion, – &#38; I should think as well as hope that there may be some later accounts.</p></postscript>
