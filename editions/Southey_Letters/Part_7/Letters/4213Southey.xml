          <salute>  My dear Sir,</salute></opener>
          <p rend="indent1">  Yesterday evening I had the great pleasure, for such it truly was, of receiving your picture.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Beaumont had given Southey a painting he had made of the view from Greta Hall.</note> It is a beautiful example of the manner in which, according to your principle, real subjects should be treated. You have dealt with this landscape as a poet does with an historical tale: modifying it to his purpose, and supplying whatever it wanted to make it suitable for his art. I thank you most sincerely for it; and this I can venture to say, that you have never painted a picture which will be regarded with more delight, nor prized more highly by its possessor.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  You give us hopes of seeing you in the autumn. By that time I trust I shall be in a condition to accompany you in some of your excursions. My usual visitant at this season has seized me somewhat more violently than usual, and effected a lodgment in the chest, where it keeps its ground more obstinately than in any former attack. The inconvenience is more in the debility which it induces, by making me keep house when the catarrh is in full force, than in the complaint itself. Next year I will, if it be possible to get from home, try to fly from it; and as I know by an experience of more than twenty years that the only chance of escaping it is by travelling at the season when it would otherwise certainly come on, I will endeavour to set off at the end of April, and spend six or eight weeks on the Continent, probably in Holland and the north of Germany.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did undertake this journey in 1825, though it was circumscribed by an injury to his foot.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"> You will have seen by the papers that the Floating Island has made its appearance.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Floating Island of Derwentwater is a mass of vegetation that rises to the surface every few years. It appeared from 21 June 1824 to the end of September, its first siting since 1819.</note> It sunk again last week, when some heavy rains had raised the lake four feet. By good fortune Professor Sedgwick<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Adam Sedgwick (1785–1873; <title>DNB</title>), Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Woodwardian Professor of Geology 1818–1873.</note> happened to be in <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, and examined it in time. Where he probed it a thin layer of mud lies upon a bed of peat which is six feet thick, and this rests upon a stratum of fine white clay, the same I believe which <ref type="m" target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref> found in Borrowdale when building her unlucky house.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The house at Rosthwaite, Borrowdale built by Mary Barker. Its scale and the expense caused by complications with the build forced her to relocate to Boulogne in 1819 to retrench.</note> Where the gas is generated remains yet to be discovered, but when the peat is filled with this gas, it separates from the clay, and becomes buoyant. There must have been a considerable convulsion when this took place, for a rent was made in the bottom of the lake several feet in depth, and not less than fifty yards long, on each side of which the bottom rose and floated. It was a pretty sight to see the small fry exploring this new-made strait and darting at the bubbles which rose as the Professor was probing the bank. The discharge of air was considerable here when a pole was thrust down. But at some distance, where the rent did not extend, the bottom had been heaved up in a slight convexity, sloping equally in an inclined plane all round; and there, when the pole was introduced, a rush like a jet followed as it was withdrawn. The thing is the more curious, because as yet no example of it is known to have been observed in any other place.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> We miss the two eldest girls sadly. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> is gone into Devonshire, where I hope she will have leisure to profit by the lessons which she received from Fielding<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">There were four Fielding brothers, all fashionable painters of watercolours: Theodore Henry Adolphus Fielding (1781–1851; <title>DNB</title>); Anthony Vandyke Copley Fielding (1787–1855; <title>DNB</title>); Thales Fielding (1793–1837; <title>DNB</title>) and Newton Smith Fielding (1799–1856; <title>DNB</title>). One of the brothers had been giving lessons to Edith May Southey.</note> when in town. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> is in Hampshire with my friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman’s</ref> family, and there is little chance of our seeing them on this side Christmas. The others, thank God, are well. </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Our kindest respects to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeaumontLadyMargaret">Lady Beaumont</ref>, in which <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs. C.</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> join. I may add <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> also, for he is here. – Believe me, dear Sir George, yours with sincere respect and regard,</p>

            <p rend="indent0">A manufactory of Whitehaven notes has been discovered in this little town. The principal in this hopeful scheme was a bookbinder,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">William Crampton (c. 1785–1843), a Keswick bookseller, had obtained a copper plate to forge one-guinea banknotes of the Whitehaven Bank of Johnston, Adamson, Hope &#38; Co. He was condemned to death at Carlisle Assizes on 26 August 1824, but recommended to mercy and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.</note> of whom I must say, that I could have better spared a better man.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The First Part of Henry the Fourth</title>, Act 5, scene 4, line 103.</note></p></postscript>
