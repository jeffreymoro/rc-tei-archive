           <p rend="indent1"> The mistake concerning the two sheets which I now return, may very possibly have been this, that when they were sent me a second time, I supposed them to be <hi rend="ital">clean sheets</hi>, &#38; laid them aside accordingly.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Proofs of Southey’s <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> <hi rend="ital">Three</hi> such sheets, I have with their correspondent proofs; – please to send me the others which have been struck off, that I may have them at hand to refer to.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Herewith you have a farther portion of copy. I am steadily proceeding with it, &#38; shall go on without interruption till it is compleated.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> When do you publish the first vol. of the Peninsular War?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> <del>I ha</del> Let me know, because I have some letters to write with it. I am working at those papers from <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereBartholomew">Mr B. Frere</ref> which you sent me, &#38; have worked two or three hours every day since they arrived. As soon as I have got thro them we may go to press with the second volume. They bring me down most satisfactorily to the time when the papers which I obtained from another quarter commence. Some time ago I requested you to procure a “History of the War in Catalonia,” &#38; also “Anecdotes of Chiefs employed in the Catalonian War”, by Francisco de Olivarez, both in Spanish – printed at Seville.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. This had mentioned Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title> (1815) in four volumes, published at Seville, 1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &#38; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). However, none of these works seem to exist. Southey had already asked Murray to try and acquire them; see Southey to John Murray: 10 July 1820, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3509; 27 February 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3641; 11 June 1821, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Six</title>, Letter 3693; and 27 July 1822, Letter 3877.</note> You may easily have overlooked this in the multiplicity of your concerns, – but you will see how <hi rend="ital">necessary</hi> it is that I should have them, – the author being himself a Catalan, &#38; having served actively in that province.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Your last number has some very good papers, the second is that which pleases me best.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Palgrave’s review of the first volume of Lewis Cottingham (1787–1847), <title>Plans, Elevations, Sections, Details and Views of the Magnificent Chapel of King Henry VII at Westminster Abbey Church, with a History of its Foundation &#38;c</title> (1822–1829), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 27 (July 1822), 308–336, published 23 October 1822.</note> The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is an important one,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Major George Procter (1795–1842), Adjutant and Superintendent of Studies at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, reviewed a number of books on the war of 1812 in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 27 (July 1822), 405–449, published 23 October 1822.</note> &#38; has very little of that tone respecting America which has given so much offence. I very much regret that that tone was ever taken. It gives great pain to those Americans who are friendly to England, – alienates some of them, &#38; produces nothing but mischief, without the possibility of its doing any good. I am at this time reading a new American work (D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dwights Travels in New England &#38; New York)<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Timothy Dwight (1752–1817), <title>Travels in New-England and New-York</title> (1821–1822), no. 881 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, reviewed by Southey in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 30 (October 1823), 1–40, published 17 April 1824.</note> from which I could make an exceedingly interesting paper, were it not <del>for</del> that the spirit in which I should write would form such a total contrast to that of the<del>se</del> unlucky articles which have preceded it:<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Croker and Sir John Barrow (1764–1848; <title>DNB</title>), two of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>’s most regular and important contributors, were both hostile to America; see, for instance, Barrow’s article, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (January 1819), 124–167.</note> The work is in four octavo volumes containing as much as so many English quartos There are not many readers who would go thro it with as much patience &#38; pleasure as I am doing. But it contains a compleat view of society in that country, &#38; a great number of curious facts, – &#38; the facts as well as the opinions of the author all come in aid of those principles &#38; institutions, – which, God knows, stand in need at this time of all the aid that can be found for them.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am grieved to hear of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> state. When he <del>hints to me</del> said to me that he feared he should soon become unable to conduct the Review, &#38; knew not where to look for a successor, <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Coleridge</ref> occurred to me as a person in whom all the main requisites were to be found, – acquirements, talents, discretion, sound judgement, &#38; a character upon which the most entire reliance may be placed. – Your interests, &#38; those of the country, could not be in safer hands, – &#38; both are seriously concerned in the decision.</p>
