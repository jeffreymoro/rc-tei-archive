           <p rend="indent1"> I am much obliged to you for your Illustration of the Literary Character,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The 3rd edition of D’Israeli’s <title>The Literary Character, Illustrated by the History of Men of Genius, Drawn From their own Feelings and Confessions</title> (1822), no. 839 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> which is, like all your works, full of interesting matter agreably arranged. Here too you draw from yourself when you enlarge upon the advantages &#38; comforts derived from a love of literature. When you treat of the Calamities &#38; the Quarrels of Authors<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">D’Isareli’s <title>Calamities of Authors: Including some Inquiries Respecting their Moral and Literary Characters</title> (1812) and <title>Quarrels of Authors; or, Some Memoirs for our Literary History, Including Specimens of Controversy to the Reign of Elizabeth</title> (1814), no. 839 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> you happily write of evils in which you have had no share.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> If inclination should ever lead you to the Lakes, I should have great pleasure in showing you my stores. You have seen a great deal of literary men in towns, but, for one class at least, the country is the proper place. You know what Cowley has said</p>
