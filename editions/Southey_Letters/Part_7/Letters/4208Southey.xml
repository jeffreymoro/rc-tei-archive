                  historians as the first King of England.</note> I was more persevering, &#38; fairly transcribed several folio sheets the sight of
                  <del>which</del> &#60;these&#62; was an encouragement to proceed, &#38; I often looked at them with <del>solitary</del> delight in
               the anticipation of future fame. This was a <del>sacred</del> solitary feeling, for my ambition or vanity (whichever it may deserve to
               be called) was not greater than the shyness which accompanied it. My port-folio was of course held sacred. One day however it was
               profaned by an acquaintance of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> who called to pay a morning visit: she
               was shown into the parlour &#38; I who was sent to say <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> would presently
               wait upon her, found her with my precious Egbert in her hand. Her compliments had no effect in abating my deep resentment at this
                  <del>unf</del> unpardonable <del>impertinence</del> &#60;curiosity&#62;, &#38; tho she was a good natured woman I am afraid I never
               quite forgave her. Determining however never to incur the risk of a second exposure, I immediately composed a set of characters for my
               own use. </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> In my twelfth &#38; thirteenth years besides these loftier attempts, I wrote three heroic epistles in rhyme, the one
               was from Diomede to Egiale,<note n="39" place="foot" resp="editors">In Homer’s <title>Iliad</title>, Diomedes was one of the leading

               teens &#60;instead of compleating it.&#62; &#38; looking upon that as an aweful sort of step in life I wrote some verses in a strain of
               reflection upon mortality grave enough to provoke a smile when I <del>then</del> recollect them. Among my attempts at this time were
               two descriptive pieces entitled Morning in the Country &#38; Morning in the Town, in eight syllable rhyme &#38; in imitation of

               of the poets, &#38; that more sacred part of it in which Homer, Virgil, Tasso, Spenser, Camoens &#38; Milton<note n="47" place="foot"

                  All three were epic poets.</note> were assembled. While I was regarding them Fame came hastening by with her arms full of laurels,
               &#38; asking in an indignant voice if there was <del>any</del> &#60;no Poet&#62; who would deserve these, upon which I reached out my

            <p rend="indent1"> One of these juvenile efforts was wholly original in its design. It was an attempt to <del>relat</del>
               &#60;exhibit&#62; the story of the Trojan war in a dramatic form, laying the scene in Elysium where the events that had happened were
               related by the souls of the several heroes as they successively descended. The opening was a dialogue between Laodamia &#38;
                  Protesilaus<note n="48" place="foot" resp="editors">In the <title>Iliad</title>, Protesilaus was the first Greek hero to be killed

               had as yet written. But I did not proceed far <del>in</del> &#60;probably&#62; because the design was too difficult, &#38; this would
               have been reason enough for abandoning it, if I had not entered with more than usual ardour upon <del>an</del> a new heroic subject,
                  <del>taken</del> of which Cassibelan<note n="49" place="foot" resp="editors">Cassivellaunus (1st century BC), a leader of the

                  <del>written</del> finished three books of this poem &#38; advanced far in the fourth before I went to Westminster. All was written
               fairly out in my own private characters, &#38; in my best <del>hands</del> &#60;writing&#62;, if one may talk of calligraphy in an
               unknown hand, which looked something like Greek, but more like conjuration from the number of trines &#38; squares which it contained
               These characters however proved fatal to the poem: for it was not possible for me to continue it at school for want of privacy, &#38;
               disuse made the <del>characters</del> cypher so difficult that I could not read it without almost spelling as I went on, &#38; at last
               in very vexation I burnt the manuscript<note n="50" place="foot" resp="editors">In Southey’s catalogue of his juvenile poems, now held

            <p rend="indent1"> I wonder whether Spurzheim<note n="51" place="foot" resp="editors">Johann Gaspar Spurzheim (1776–1832), the German
                  pioneer of phrenology.</note> could at that time have discovered an organ of constructiveness in my <del>xxxxxxx</del> pericranium.
               The Elysian drama might seem to indicate that <del>I possessed</del> &#60;that&#62; the faculty &#60;was there&#62;, but not a trace of
               it was to be found in any of the heroic poems which I attempted. They were all begun <del>with</del> &#60;upon&#62; a mere general
               notion of the subject, without any prearrangement – &#38; <del>almost without one</del> little preconception of the incidents by which
               the catastrophe was to be brought about. When I sate down to write I had to look as much for the incidents as for the thoughts &#38;
               language in which they were to be clothed. I expected them to occur just as readily, &#38; so indeed, such as they were, they did. My
               reading in &#60;the old&#62; Chivalrous romances has been extensive enough to justify me in asserting that &#60;the greater number
               of&#62; those romances were written just in the same way, without the slightest plan or forethought: &#38; I am much mistaken if many
               of the Italian romantic poems were not composed in the same inartificial manner. This I am sure that it is more difficult to plan that
               to execute well, &#38; that abundance of <del>good poetry</del> &#60;true poetical power&#62; has been squandered for want of a
               constructive talent in the poet. I have felt this &#60;want&#62; in some of the Spanish &#38; Portugueze writers even more than their
               want of taste. The progress of my own mind towards attaining it (so far as I may be thought to have attained it) I am able to trace
               distinctly, not merely by the works themselves, &#38; by my own recollections of the views with which they were &#60;undertaken
               &#38;&#62; composed, but by the various sketches &#38; memoranda &#60;for <del>for</del> four poems&#62;<note n="52" place="foot"

               me: – it seems as if I caught the bearings of a subject at first sight, just as <ref type="m" target="people.html#TelfordThomas"
                  >Telford</ref> sees from an eminence <del>xx</del> with a glance in which direction his road must be carried. But it was long before
