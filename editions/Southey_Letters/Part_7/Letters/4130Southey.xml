          <salute>  My dear Madam</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">  I am the more vexed at not having seen you in Devonshire, because it has been in no slight degree thro my own sin of omission that the disappointment has arisen. Having a wide circuit to take in the western counties first &#38; then in Norfolk &#38; Suffolk, it was necessary for me every where to fix the day of arrival &#38; departure. I counted upon finding you at Exeter &#38; passing a few hours with you either on my way to Crediton or on the day when I should leave that place &#38; take <ref type="m" target="people.html#AclandThomasSir">Sir T. Aclands</ref> on my return. To my great vexation M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Keenan<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Frances Keenan (d. 1838), an artist and widow of the Irish portrait-painter, John Keenan (d. 1819). Southey had first met them in Exeter in 1799.</note> who had undertaken to find out your direction for me informed me when <del>you</del> &#60;I&#62; arrived, that you were out of reach, &#38; the four &#38; twenty hours which I would willingly have allotted to that visit were no longer at my command, – for engagements had been made <hi rend="ital">for</hi> me during every day of my short continuance at Crediton, &#38; <hi rend="ital">by</hi> me for a long after journey.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> This would not have happened if I had written to you from town; &#38; I fear the wearying, – worrying – life in which I am always involved there will hardly plead my excuse. Yet you would excuse me if you knew by what shoals of people I am persecuted there, with letters upon all sorts of subjects, – in such numbers that I have now a portfolio full unanswered, – even of those which deserve as well as require reply.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Nor would it have happened if I had found <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrowneElizabethdau">Miss Browne</ref> at Leeds. The first thing I did on my arrival there was to enquire concerning her. I learnt that she was no longer in that town, &#38; taking up a Leeds paper, saw there in the announcement of her sisters<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Lydia Browne (c. 1789–1864) had been widowed on the death of her husband, Joseph Lea (d. 1821) of The Hill, Amblecote, a fact Southey was unaware of until he saw it mentioned in a Leeds newspaper when he passed through the city in November 1823. One possibility is that Southey read this news in the <title>Leeds Mercury</title> of 8 November 1823, which also announced Lydia Browne’s second marriage to John Addenbrooke (formerly Homfray) (1759–1837) of Wollaston Hall, Worcestershire. </note> second marriage – the first intelligence that she had become a widow.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The long-delayed &#38; long desired time of my return home is now thank Heaven within view, after an absence of fourteen week &#38; <del>xx</del> travelling (already) more than twelve hundred miles. My place is taken in the mail for Friday next, &#38; on this day week I hope to be once more seated by my own fire side: tho not with all my family around me, for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> will be left in London. It is possible that she may accompany Lady Malet<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), the widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>).</note> to the Devonshire coast early in the summer. Such an arrangement is talked of, &#38; if it take place, I hope she will find means of seeing you.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> S.</ref> &#38; the other children were well when I heard from them last. In every letter she repeats her vexation that I have not seen you, – almost reproachingly, – for I have not had time in my letters home fully to explain to her how I was entangled with engagements, so arranged, that the one could not be postponed without dislocating all the others.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> My Book<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> (which I finished at Crediton) was published on Monday last: &#38; as I did not know whether the direction which was given me at Exeter would be as secure for a coach-parcel, as for a letter, I sent your copy to my friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref> at Crediton requesting him to forward it. In the course of the summer I hope I shall have my Tale of Paraguay<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> ready to send you.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Tell me, I entreat, that you forgive me. Tell me of my little friend Marys<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Browne (1810–1892), daughter of Wade and Elizabeth Browne. She later married William Farwell (1806–1876), Rector of St Martin’s, Liskeard 1830–1876.</note> health, – <hi rend="ital">little</hi> I suppose she still is, &#38; <hi rend="ital">friend</hi> I must always consider her &#38; call her. Tell me also of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrowneElizabethdau">Miss Browne</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BrowneSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Crump</ref>, &#38; remember me to them most kindly. I live in hopes of again seeing them &#38; you. Indeed the desire of atoning for having left you unseen now, will operate strongly as a motive for drawing me westward whenever I may visit London again. It is not in my nature ever to forget those whom I have esteemed &#38; loved.</p>
