[Editors’ note: this relates to the payment to Westall.]</note> – I must request you to &#60;transmit it to&#62; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref>, whose address is 19 Mornington Place, Hampstead Road. He tells me that four of the plates for Roderick are finished, &#38; the other two very nearly so.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was secretly investing in Richard Westall (1765–1836; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths, by R. Southey. Illustrated with Engravings from the Designs of R. W.</title> (1824), nos 2627–2628 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. These engravings were published by Longman and were made to be removable so that they could be inserted in the appropriate places in Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> I have not yet seen them, but he is about to send me the proofs, &#38; he is as well satisfied with the engraving as with the designs. – If they succeed I shall be for trying the same adventure with Thalaba<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801). Richard Westall did not produce a set of engravings for this poem.</note></p>

These Views could be removed from the publication so that they could be inserted in the appropriate places in the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).
