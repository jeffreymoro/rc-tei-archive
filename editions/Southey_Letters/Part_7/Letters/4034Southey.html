               concerning myself to communicate to you, which would have given you such sincere pleasure,
               as the recovery of your eyes has given me, – that I would have let so long a time
               elapse without communicating it to you? – I should have thought the mail coach, with
               its increased speed, could hardly carry the news fast enough. Heartily rejoiced indeed
