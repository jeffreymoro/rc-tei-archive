            <p rend="indent1"> <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref> will be much obliged to you if you will purchase for her, &#38; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> if he will take charge of, two articles which it will neither incommode you to buy, nor him to put in his trunk.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">First a drawing book of coloured paper, – that sort of tint which is given by tobacco water:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A preparation made by boiling tobacco in water; it was a popular insecticide.</note> the size about 9 ½ inches long 6 ½ wide. Secondly a bottle of a certain preparation of lamp black<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Carbon black, made from the incomplete burning of products such as coal tar. It was widely used as a black pigment.</note> or ivory black (I know not which) used for painting screens &#38; such things &#38; sold at Fielders N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2 Greek Street, Soho.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Fielder (c. 1793–1854), maker of picture and looking glass frames.</note> She has excellent use of her fingers. If <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">poor Nash</ref> had been living, it would have delighted him to see the extraordinary progress she has made.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I have had a letter of thanks from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref>. One has the painful feeling of not knowing how much is to be believed of what he says, &#38; how much to be allowed for theatrical effect. What is the real state of his health?</p>
          <p rend="indent1">  I am nearly recovered, thank God, after an attack of an ugly nature. I have always apprehended that the violent catarrh which for the last twenty years has regularly seized me with the first warm weather would at last effect a lodgement in my chest, &#38; this year for the first time it has given serious indication of such a tendency. After trying squills<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A preparation known as squills, made from the squill, or sea onion, and used as an expectorant.</note> in vain, &#38; ipecacuanha lozenges,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Ipecacuanha, extracted from a South American plant, was used as an emetic and purgative.</note> I have nearly removed it by paregoric, taking at the same time calomel &#38; dandelion to counteract the effect which the smallest possible quantity of laudanum produces upon my liver.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Paregoric was a traditional pain relieving medicine, containing opium dissolved in alcohol, known as laudanum. Since this operated as a cough suppressant it would have given Southey relief from his hay fever. However, it also had a number of side-effects, including constipation, for which Southey took the purgative calomel and the laxative dandelion.</note> To day for the first time I have thought myself sufficiently free from any feverish symptom to venture upon wine.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> Miss Wilbrahams marriage<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Laetitia Wilbraham (1799–1874), Tom Southey’s lodger. She married Joseph Harrison Fryer (1777–1855) of Whitley House, Northumberland. Fryer was a surveyor, geologist and mining engineer who spent part of each year at Keswick. At this time he was renting Ormathwaite, a large house about a mile and a quarter from Keswick.</note> took place last week. Her brother<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Randle Wilbraham (1801–1887). Notably, Miss Wilbraham was not given away by her father, Randle Wilbraham (1773–1861), landowner, of Rode Hall, Cheshire.</note> came to give her away, &#38; returned immediately. The history of the courtship, with the talk, &#38; correspondence, &#38; broils that it has occasioned, would make a volume, in which neither <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> nor <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">his wife</ref> would appear to any advantage, – both having acted very intemperately, &#38; very foolishly. He has the vice of tetchiness in a very great degree, &#38; his wife in a greater, if that be possible. For me, I always bear in mind one of the first maxims which I teach my children. – The least that is said. Is the soonest mended.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I look shortly to hear from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> saying when we may expect to see him, – about Monday week I think.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">John May and his son, John May (1802–1879), visited Southey at Keswick 5 August–2 September 1822.</note> Your visit I suppose will be in September, when London is emptiest. Tell me how you all are, for it seems a long while since I have heard of you.</p>
