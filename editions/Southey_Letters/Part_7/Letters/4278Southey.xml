               Note on MS: fol. 1 is absent from the manuscript in the British Library and has not been traced elsewhere. However, Dowden had access to the now-missing fol. 1; his edition is therefore used to supply the copytext for this section of the letter. </note></head>

           <p rend="indent1"> If procrastination is the thief of time, letter-writing is quite as great a one, and I find the two thieves very closely connected. Some unexpected epistle arrives which is neither wanted nor welcome, but which must be answered; or some other demand upon my hours is made, for which I am neither prepared nor willing, and then the intention which had been formed, of writing that evening to you, stands over for the morrow; and when the morrow comes, other interruptions of the same kind occur, and prevent me from passing an hour according to my wishes.</p>

Southey used this precedent to describe Thomas Medwin (1788–1869; <title>DNB</title>), author of <title>Journal of the Conversations of Lord Byron: Noted During a Residence with his Lordship at Pisa, in the Years 1821 and 1822</title> (1824), as Byron’s ‘Blunderbuss’.</note> I have only seen some newspaper extracts.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>New Times</title>, 25–27 October 1824, where Stoddart used the newspaper he edited to comment extensively on Byron and Medwin’s <title>Conversations</title>. In the final article of 27 October 1824, Stoddart paid particular attention to defending Southey against Byron’s ‘vindictive hatred’ and attacking Byron’s <title>The Vision of Judgment</title> (1822), which had parodied Southey’s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).
