The objection to task-work is that it tempts the industrious to work beyond their strength: &#38; in intellectual, over-exertion is worse than in bodily labour.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have spent a very idle summer, <del>&#38; thereby</del> much to the advantage of my health. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">A fellow collegian</ref> for whom I have a great regard came to pass his Midsummer holy days with me, from Crediton, where he is Master of the Grammar school. I began a course of exercise with him, &#38; persevered in it, much as it cost me for some time, till at length the effect which I looked for was produced; – &#38; my constitution recovering its tone, I became once more a sound man. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> came to me just after <ref type="m" target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoots</ref> departure I walked about an hundred miles more with him, &#38; am now in as good trim for walking as any man of my years need be. This I hope will last till I visit London, which I think of doing as soon as the rigour of the winter shall be over.</p>

The time for publication rests with <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, &#38; I should not think he will delay it till what is called the season, because the demand for such a book cannot depend much upon peoples being in or out of town.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The London ‘season’, when the British elite congregated in the capital, was at its height from Easter to early August.</note> It is dedicated to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref>, briefly, &#38; becomingly.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, p. [iii]: ‘It is with peculiar fitness, as well as with pleasure, that I inscribe to your Majesty a History of the most glorious war recorded in the British annals./ When the Regency devolved into your hands, the fortunes of our allies were at their lowest ebb, and neither arts nor efforts were spared for making the spirit of this country sink with them. At that momentous crisis every thing depended, under Providence, upon your single determination; and to that determination Great Britain is beholden for its triumph, and Europe for its deliverance./ To your Majesty, therefore, this faithful History is offered, as a portion of the tribute due to a just, magnanimous, and splendid reign, and as a proof of individual respect and gratitude from/Your Majesty’s/Most dutiful subject and servant,/ ROBERT SOUTHEY.’</note> The Buonapartists &#38; the Whigs will be thoroughly exasperated; I have only said enough of the latter to show them what they may expect in the progress of the history, where they shall have full justice.</p>

He was a leading figure in the Tory party in Liverpool and one of Canning’s chief supporters as the city’s MP. His home at Storrs Hall was on the east side of Lake Windermere, two miles south of Bowness.</note> It is the opinion of his friends that if he accepts office, the H of Commons will kill him in two or three years.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Canning became Foreign Secretary and Leader of the House of Commons on 13 September 1822. He died five years later.</note> In reality flesh &#38; blood is not equal to such wear &#38; tear as is exacted from an English minister in these times. I told him plainly that the present state of things was a contest between wickedness &#38; weakness, &#38; that there needed no spirit of prophecy to foresee what the event must be. – To my sore vexation when I returned from this short absence I found that <ref type="m" target="people.html#TelfordThomas">Mr Telford</ref> whom I had rather have seen than all the statesmen in Europe had past thro <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>.

A revolution in 1820 had compelled him to return from Brazil and he finally agreed to a new liberal constitution in October 1822.</note> But I see no end to the miseries of either country, – except under a strong &#38; vigilant despotism, itself the worst of all evils, anarchy excepted. Who would not rather have lived in the days of Tiberius, or Nero,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Tiberius (42 BC–AD 37; Roman Emperor AD 14–37) and Nero (AD 37–68; Roman Emperor AD 54–68).

Charles Harold Herford (London, 1929), pp. 212–216. The ‘Roads’ are, in fact, lake terraces formed along the shoreline of an ancient ice-dammed lake.</note> He said the local names were in favour of the hunting theory, &#38; promised to send me a list of them, with their significations.</p>
