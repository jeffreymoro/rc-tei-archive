            <p rend="indent1">Since I returned I have been replying to the heap of letters which as they followed me about were <del>xxx xxx</del> laid aside till a more convenient season: you will easily understand that such letters are meant as had no right to more ceremonious treatment. I have &#60;been&#62; unpacking, arranging, &#38; idling over the long looked for box of books from Italy, &#38; a parcel of some forty volumes which I dispatched from <ref type="m" target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref>. I have been enjoying an old coat &#38; old shoes, – habits so regular that the clock might be regulated by them, – my usual breakfast, my usual hours, my <del>xxx</del> after-dinner sleep – the consciousness of being at rest, – in a word home after a long absence. <del>Every</del> All things are now resuming their old course. The children come to me regularly with their lessons, &#38; I go down to supper with folio under my arm, to be taken with the black-currant rum, as a composer. Rumpelstilzchen arches his back to meet my salutation in the kitchen, &#38; Hurlyburlybuss<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Feline members of the Southey household.</note> greets me with the like demonstration of good will in the garden. Proof sheets are the only things wanting to my contentment, &#38; I shall not be long without them.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I had been absent fifteen weeks wanting one day. To say nothing of the arrears of business which so long an interruption occasions, there were heavy arrears of sleep; &#38; if on the former score I am debtor, here I am on the creditor side of the account. By a fair calculation not less than three hundred &#38; forty five hours of good honest sleep were due to me when I reached home, at the rate of three hours lost in every twenty-four, besides six nights past in stage coaches. Such arrears are like the national debt, too large to be paid off; &#38; having taken out a small part, I am making a magnanimous resolution to cancel the remainder of the debt, &#38; rise as early as I did in London. The produce of this time before breakfast will find its way to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Buckland">Buckland</ref>, &#38; before you receive this letter I shall have made a beginning.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was beginning work on ‘Robin Hood’. The resulting incomplete work was published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [1]–36.</note></p>
           <p rend="indent1"> There can be no more difficulty in your writing the verse of Thalaba,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> than there is in an expert dancer’s acquiring a new step. The simple rule is to consult the ear alone, &#38; when you use lines of less than <del>the</del> ten syllables, let the pause generally be at the end of the line.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">  I sent your sea-poem<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles had offered to contribute ‘The Mariner’s Hymn’, later published in <title>Solitary Hours</title> (London, 1826), pp. 22–24, to Alfred Pettet’s <title>Original Sacred Music</title> (London, n.d., c. 1825–1827), though it was eventually rejected and replaced by ‘I weep, but not rebellious tears’, later published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [227]–228.</note> to <ref type="m" target="people.html#PettetAlfred">the poor Musician</ref> at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Norwich">Norwich</ref>. The other &#38; the finer of the two,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles’s ‘It is not Death’, <title>Solitary Hours</title> (London, 1826), pp. 58–60.</note> is not so appropriate to his purpose, &#38; is moreover too good to be so bestowed. My admiration of <del>xxx</del> &#60;it&#62; is nothing abated by frequent re-reading &#38; re-considering it. The feeling &#38; the movement are in beautiful accord, – &#38; the expression is every where excellent, except in the stanza respecting Lazarus.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>John</title> 11: 1–46. Lazarus was raised from the dead by Jesus.</note> – It is the second line, which I feel to be faulty – would either of these variations be better?</p>
            <lb/>
            <lg type="stanza"><l rend="indent3">Oer Lazarus’s livid clay, – </l>
               <l rend="indent3">Oer Lazarus where entomb’d he lay – </l>
               <l rend="indent5">a corpse</l>
               <l rend="indent3">When dead &#38; buried Lazarus lay – </l></lg>
            <lb/>
           <p rend="indent0"> The last is the best, – yet neither satisifies me.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">‘It is not Death’, <title>Solitary Hours</title> (London, 1826), p. 60, changed this line to ‘O’er him he loved – corrupting clay! –’</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">This poem if it were set to music with a thousandth part of the feeling that it breathes, would not fail of doing good. What are <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Shields</ref> merits as a composer? He is the only musician whom I know, but whether he has any merit or not in his profession is what others must tell me, for I am utterly ignorant upon that subject. If however you think well of him, he I know would think himself obliged to me if I sent him the poem.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">When you write under cover to <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> remember that his privilege extends only to two ounces. I keep two of the <title>old</title> penny pieces<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Copper penny pieces minted from 1797 onwards weighed one ounce exactly and so were a good way of measuring the weight of a letter. Copper pennies minted from the mid-1810s onwards were smaller and weighed less than one ounce.</note> <del>among my weights</del> to ascertain the weight of a doubtful packet, a single letter is not worth the trouble of inclosing; you see I set you the example of sending one direct. But my next I hope will bring with it an attempt at a beginning: &#38; ‘what is well begun is half done.’<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">A proverb, derived from Aristotle (384–322 BC), <title>Politics</title>, Book 5.</note> I hope to do a great deal this year, – &#38; among other things to compleat the series of Inscriptions,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s inscriptions on the Peninsular War, most of which were unpublished until the eighteen finished poems, were collected in <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837–1838), III, pp. 122–156. Southey originally planned to write thirty inscriptions.</note> – the sooner they are published the better, because every year lessens the number of those persons who would be gratified by seeing the tribute paid to their lost friends – God bless you – RS.</p>
