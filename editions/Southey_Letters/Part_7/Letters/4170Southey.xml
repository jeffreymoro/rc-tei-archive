         <p rend="indent1">   Nearly a fortnight has elapsed since I received your letter with the notices which I requested.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles had sent Southey information about her first cousin Paul Henry Durell Burrard (1790–1809), Ensign in the 1st Foot Guards, who was mortally wounded at the Battle of Corunna (1809). Southey used this to compose ‘Lines. To the Memory of a Young Officer, Who was Mortally Wounded in the Battle of Coruña. By Robert Southey, Esq. Poet Laureate’, <title>The Literary Souvenir; Or, Cabinet of Poetry and Romance</title> (London, 1826), pp. [341]–344.</note> They are exceedingly affecting, – so much so indeed as to make me feel how flat &#38; unprofitable any composition must appear when compared with the plain narration of such circumstances. However what I am contemplating will not be liable to any such comparison, – otherwise I might well be deterred from the attempt. – In my youth, the more striking <del>xxx</del> a story appeared to me, the stronger was my inclination to clothe it in verse; whereas in later years the feeling that circumstances affecting in themselves are more likely to be marred than rendered more so by versifying them, has repeatedly withheld my hand. – But for this subject, it will not be out of mind till I see how to cast it.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The vexatious part of your prosecution is the expence:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles’s outhouses had been burgled and she was worried about the prospect of prosecuting the offenders at Winchester Assizes.</note> otherwise I should be hardly be sorry for so flagrant an instance of the egregious absurdity &#38; injustice of our laws, such as they are in practice. </p>
    <p rend="indent1">        Since your letter arrived I have been engaged at one time with the prevalent catarrh (- not my annual visitor, or it would not have left me so easily, or so soon) – &#38; afterwards with an unexpected guest.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Wade Browne (1796–1851), only son of Wade Browne and later a country gentleman at Monkton Farleigh in Somerset. He had been travelling in the Near East.</note> – I send you now a few more stanzas,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Stanzas for Bowles and Southey’s ‘Robin Hood’. The resulting incomplete work was published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [1]–36.</note> – the next batch will probably conclude the canto – Send me some in return, – &#38; take up the story where you will; – in the next canto if you like it, – with the infancy &#38; childhood of the orphan, – &#38; conclude it with the return of the few forlorn survivors who bring home their Lords heart. I shall proceed with the better will when I am assured that you are at work</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Such resemblances in sound as that between <hi rend="ital">faith</hi> &#38; <hi rend="ital">fate</hi>, I <del>xxx xxx</del> gladly avail myself of, when they occur without the appearance of being sought for. The use of alliteration in our poetry is as old as that of rhyme, indeed it supplies the place of rhyme in <del>that</del> one form of verse, – that in which Pierce Ploughmans Vision is written.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Langland (c. 1332–c. 1386; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Piers Ploughman</title> (c. 1370–c. 1390), written in unrhymed alliterative verse. Southey possessed an edition from 1550, no. 1414 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> Like every other artifice in versification it has been overdone, &#38; thereby rendered disgusting. I was a great offender in this way in my boyhood, before I learnt the use of my tools. </p>

He died from fever during a journey from China to the Dutch East Indies.</note> I know not whether in battle or by course of nature, &#38; she describes in these verses, how while she hoped for his return, she used to apply that part of the poem about Alphonso &#38; his mother to her own heart.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Rodrigo de Goth, Koning van Spanje</title>, 2 vols (The Hague, 1823–1824), I, pp. vii–viii.
