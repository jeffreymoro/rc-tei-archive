           <p rend="indent1"> We have been looking every day for a letter from you, &#38; none comes, – happily we heard yesterday from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> that you were alive &#38; had not lost the use of your hands. – Do you desire so large a packet of that second best of all sense (common sense is the <hi rend="ital">best</hi>) – which is called nonsense?</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The Hogg letter<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a letter from James Hogg to Southey; the two had corresponded intermittently since at least 1814.</note> I will send <ref type="m" target="people.html#CharterLouisa">Miss Charter</ref><note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Louisa Charter had travelled with Southey and Edith May Southey from Keswick to London in November 1823.</note> in the next packet. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LovellRobert">Robert Lovell</ref> shall copy it for me. You will distribute my love &#38; kind remembrances among the ladies, according to your discretion, – &#38; present the latter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">the General</ref>, adding that I mean shortly to write to him.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">  <ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorHenrySir">Henry Taylor</ref> dines here to day – &#38; therefore I must make up my dispatches – So God bless you</p>
