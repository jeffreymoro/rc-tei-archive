            <p rend="indent1">I was very glad to receive your long letter &#38; well pleased with all its contents, as well knowing that in one part you had rather expressed a transitory feeling than a settled one. There is a great deal of sterling friendship in the world, &#38; you are one of the last persons who should doubt it. You have so much of it yourself, that you would not only turn in your bed to serve me, but will, I dare say, save my corn-factor Joey Lock<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Locke (dates unknown), Southey’s shoemaker in London. Southey punningly refers to him as a ‘corn factor’, literally a trader in grain, but in this case a maker of corns on Southey’s feet.</note> the trouble of sending me a <del>bill the second</del> second bill for <del>the cxxx</del> his good works; – &#38; also prevent the like danger, (if it still exists) from Willis, on the score of the Stewardship.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been persuaded by his uncle, Herbert Hill, to share the role of Steward (i.e. bear part of the expenses) for the annual meeting of Westminster School ex-pupils in London. This took place at Willis’s Rooms in King Street, St James’s, in 1821.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">There is, (I repeat it), a great deal of sterling friendship in the world. It is very true that as men get higher in this world they are less able to act from feeling &#38; inclination. They are involved in party obligations. &#38; political considerations must of necessity predominate over personal ones. This is the case officially with all men, – &#38; in his honour, who I suppose is now to be <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">his Right-Honour</ref>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn had joined the Cabinet as President of the Board of Control and was admitted to the Privy Council on 17 January 1822, making him a ‘Right Honourable’.</note> there is more than this, arising from what <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">a Doxtor</ref> would call his idiosyncrasy. He who every morning of his life has been doing something else when he ought to have been dressing himself, will in like manner be doing some thing else when he might be serving those for whom he has the sincerest regard. But upon the specific subject of your wishes, (to which however I see there is an end, by your letter of today) I should really think the surest &#38; easiest way of serving <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> would be by endeavouring to secure his promotion in his own office, where he has the strongest claims, &#38; where he is master of the business.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Bedford had been a Clerk in the Admiralty since 1804. He was a Second Class Clerk 1816–1826, rising to First Class Clerk 1826–1844.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">I shall look for you without fail next summer, &#38; lay out my plans accordingly in full assurance of your coming. Now I pray you, bring <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</ref> with you – Do not either of you, think of any difficulties in the way, but make up your minds to it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">My Aunt Mary</ref>, who is old enough to be <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Ps</ref> mother took a longer journey last year. You do not know how much pleasure it would give <del>me</del> &#60;us&#62; to have her under this roof. – &#38; I say this for <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my Governess</ref> as well as myself. Give my love to her, – &#38; <del>let me have a xxxxxxx</del> let no persuasions on your part be wanting to make her undertake the journey.</p>

            <postscript><p rend="indent1">The Courier comes regularly to me. I cannot guess who wrote the letter signed Vindex.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A letter headed ‘Lord Byron and Mr. Southey’ and signed by ‘Vindex’ had appeared in the <title>Courier</title> on 9 January 1822. It defended Southey against Byron’s attack in the ‘Appendix’ to ‘The Two Foscari’, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, where Byron had cautioned: ‘I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey’s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816. For the argument that ‘Vindex’ was William Wordsworth, see Nicholas Joukovsky, ‘Wordsworth’s Lost Article on Byron and Southey’, <title>Review of English Studies</title>, 45 (November 1994), 496–516.</note> My own tender Epistle<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776.
