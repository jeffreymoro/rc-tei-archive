<salute>My dear G.</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I have had in the course of my life three such twinges in the toe-major as you describe, – but which I have rather likened to having it injected with scalding water. This I have supposed to be a gouty affection, tho in my case there is no hereditary right to it, &#38; as little personal pretension as in yours. Ask <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Osiris</ref> about it when he rises above your horizon next.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Your mem. concerning the clean sheets is accurate as far as it goes.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Proofs of the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> You sent me afterwards as far as p.744. &#38; it is the remaining sheets, together with the title page &#38;c which I want, to make the set compleat, – otherwise all this is but waste paper.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">The operation of nerving the horse<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A neurectomy that was carried out as a last resort on horses with chronic foot pain.</note> is very curious. The analogous experiment of dividing a nerve to cure the tic doloreux<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Tic douloureaux, or trigeminal neuralgia, is a disorder of the fifth cranial nerve and causes intense facial pain. Attempts to use surgery to relieve the condition had been made as early as 1748 but were unsuccessful.</note> – I believe has generally failed. We should know more about the nerves if some young <ref type="m" target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref> would make a voyage in a Whaler he would then find them upon a scale – which would enable him not only to ascertain their structure, but possibly to analyse their contents. – This reminds me of a friend<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Tom’s</ref>, who when he was upon such a voyage, made some whale-cheese. How <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">his Right Honour</ref> would have delighted in toasting it!</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You seem not to understand that the lithographic prints are <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westalls</ref>.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey’s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &#38;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> They have not been sent me, probably because Westall expects me in London. There however I can not possibly be before the month of May, – tho I am working now as hard as any government clerk who is making up accounts upon the motion of some such <del>pest xx</del> public-pest as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hume.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Hume (1777–1855; <title>DNB</title>), a Scottish radical MP who was greatly disliked by Southey for his campaigns against government expenditure. </note> I am however now in the full current of composition,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was writing <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> making great way with the stream. This evening, as soon as this scrawl is dispatched I shall conclude all matters antecedent to Henry 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry VIII (1491–1547; King of England 1509–1547; <title>DNB</title>). Southey had completed the first volume of <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824).</note> &#38; it will be a pleasure to write the chapters which ensue.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">If <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> thinks proper I shall set about a paper upon Spanish &#38; Portugueze affairs,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write on this subject for the <title>Quarterly Review</title> at this time.</note> a subject upon which there can be no difference of opinion among persons who are really acquainted with the situation &#38; character of the two nations, &#38; capable of forming a just judgement upon a plain case. A letter which I received lately from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteJosephBlanco">Blanco White</ref><note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Blanco White to Southey, 16 March 1823; see G. Martin Murphy and André Pons, ‘Further Letters of Blanco White to Robert Southey’, <title>Bulletin of Hispanic Studies</title>, 62 (1985), 357–372.</note> would have convinced me of this, had I been doubtful of it before. What you tell me of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> is all that I have heard of him. – We look now for the French blue<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Bleu de France, a blue pigment used in painting. Bedford was supplying this for Edith May Southey’s use.</note> by every post, &#38; thank you for it by anticipation. Remember me to <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</ref>, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">the Consumer of Snuff</ref>. We have had a week of delicious weather here which has just ended in gentle rain.</p>
