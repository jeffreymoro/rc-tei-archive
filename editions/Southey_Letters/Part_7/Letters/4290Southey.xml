Do not hesitate at sending over a fourth. The book is making you known, as you ought to be, – &#38; it is one of those few books which nothing can put aside.</p>

            <p rend="indent1">There is no difficulty in writing English hexameters upon the principles of adaptation on which I proceeded.

           <p rend="indent1"> Our prospects are blackening for a storm. The system of conciliation as it is called is producing in Ireland its proper &#38; inevitable consequences. We have taken up a nest of frozen vipers &#38; laid them upon the hearth, &#38; now unless we mean to leave the house to them (&#38; the estate too) – we must set to work &#38; scotch them. A rebellion is to be looked for, – the object being the separation of the two countries, &#38; the establishment of the worst of all existing superstitions in its worst form. On the subject of that abominable system there is not a shade of difference between us; – but I deduce from my detestation of it, this principle that no person who holds it ought ever to be admitted to political power. Instead of trusting them with a seat in Parliament, they ought not to be trusted with the electors franchise. – But I must leave room for Wordsworth –</p>

            <p rend="indent1">My dear Sir,</p>
              <p rend="indent1"> I have begged this space from S – which I hope you will forgive, as I might not otherwise for some time had courage to thank you for your admirable Dialogues.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Savage Landor, <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title> (1824).</note> They reached me last May, at a time when I was able to read them, which I did with very great pleasure. I was in London then, and have been a Wanderer most of the time since. But this did not keep me silent. I was deterred such is the general state of my eyes, by a consciousness that I could not write what I wished. I concur with you in so much and differ with you in so much also, that though I could have easily disposed of my assent, easily and most pleasantly, I could not face the task of giving my reasons for my dissent! For instance it would have required almost a pamphlet to set forth the grounds upon which I disagreed with what you have put into the mouth of <hi rend="ital">Franklin</hi> on <hi rend="ital">Irish</hi> affairs, the object to my mind of constant anxiety.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue II of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 19–48, was between George Washington (1732–1799; President of the United States 1789–1797) and Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), American polymath. On pp. 35–41, Landor had Franklin expound an enormous scheme of reform in Irish affairs, including the reorganisation of the Anglican Church of Ireland, endowment of the Catholic clergy, security of tenure for tenants and the appointment of Irishmen only to government or church posts in Ireland.</note> What would I not give for a few hours talk with you, upon Republics, Kings and Priests – and Priest craft. This last I abhor, but why spend one line in declaiming against it. Better endeavour to improve priests, whom we cannot, and ought not therefore endeavour to do without. We have far more to dread from those who would endeavour to expel not only organized Religion but all religion from society, than from those who are slavishly disposed to uphold it. at least I cannot help feeling so. – Your dialogues are worthy of you and great acquisitions to literature. The classical ones I like best, and most of all that between Tully and his Brother;<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue XVIII of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 349–394, between the Roman statesman, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BC), and his brother, Quintus Tullius Cicero (102–43 BC).</note> That which pleases me the least is the one between your self and the Abbe de Lille.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Dialogue XV of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), I, pp. 249–310 between Landor himself and Jacques Delille (1738–1813), a French poet and translator.</note> The observations are invariably just I own but they are fitter for illustrative notes than the body of an Dialogue; which ought always to have some little spice of dramatic effect. I long for the third Volm;<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">The third volume of <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title> finally appeared in 1828.</note> a <del>xxxxx</del> feeling which after my silence I should not venture to express, were you not aware of the infirmity which has been the cause of it. <del>xxxx</del> I sent a message of thanks, from Cambridge through <ref type="m" target="people.html#HareJulius ">Julius Hare</ref> whom I saw at Cambridge in May last. ever affectionately and gratefully yours,</p>
