            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> has told me of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fishers death,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">James Fisher (c. 1758–1821), Chief Clerk in the Auditor’s Office, had died on 15 December 1821. Bedford duly succeeded Fisher as Chief Clerk 1822–1834, relinquishing his post of Clerk of Registers and Issues, which he had held since 1806.</note> &#38; I am anxious to know whether you are to ascend in the old &#38; proper course of things or to suffer in consequence of any new order, upon the present system of rascally retrenchment. This is a point which interests me much more than any possible change of ministry could do</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I suppose you have seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</ref> note concerning me.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In the ‘Appendix’ to ‘The Two Foscari’, <title>Sardanapulus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p. 328, Byron had cautioned: ‘I am not ignorant of Mr. Southey’s calumnies on a different occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his return from Switzerland against me and others.’ Southey had visited Switzerland in his continental tour of May–August 1817. The ‘calumnies’ Byron believed Southey to have later spread were rumours that Byron and Shelley had engaged in a ‘League of Incest’ during their residence in Switzerland in 1816.</note> I heard of it a week ago from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>, &#38; began a newspaper reply, that I might be sure of the advantage of writing while I was cool. Today I have seen the passage in a newspaper:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle</title>, 29 December 1821.</note> a little of my reply must be struck out as irrelevant (that is to say not called for) – &#38; a concluding paragraph must be added. When that is done, &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> has seen it, I shall send it to you, on its way to the Courier.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title>, 5 January 1822, Letter 3776. The letter appeared in the <title>Courier</title> on 11 January 1822.</note> – If I had been in danger of lowering &#38; exposing myself by losing my temper, <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">his Lordships</ref> example would have saved me: but I am too sensible of my strength to fall into his error. His affectation of contempt comes to my hands curiously, just after I have received from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> an account of the manner in which he extolled Roderick upon its first appearance.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron greatly admired Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814); see Southey to John Murray, 4 December 1814, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2510.</note> But this inconsistency, which must be known to all his friends, is beneath my notice. I have nothing to do but to repel the charge of calumny &#38; lay on the scourge a second time upon the author of Don Juan.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), ‘Preface’, pp. xvii–xxii, where Southey denounced ‘the Satanic School’ of modern poetry without naming any one poet. However, this was clearly a riposte to Byron’s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819), whose suppressed ‘Dedication’, mocking Southey, had circulated widely.</note></p>
