<opener><salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">I thought I had told you that as my journey had been so long delayed I should probably put it off till the autumn, when I could take up <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref> with me to pay her promised visits in the South. The 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> sheet of my second vol. of this B of the Ch. is on the table, – but I have still three Chapters to write:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 313–528.</note> &#38; certain it is, whatever may be the cause that I have not the same alacrity in writing as when I was younger. The cold which <del>seizes</del> &#60;fastens upon&#62; me every year at this season sometimes disables, &#38; more often indisposes me for employment. And the only remedy is in a continued course of exercise, – occasioning an expense of time which I can very ill afford.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Your note puts me in fear that <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref> may ask me to meet <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Ld Grenville</ref> at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Lowtherestate">Lowther</ref>. I can hardly escape a visit thither this year, but I should much rather make it at any other time than when he is there.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Though Grenville was Charles Watkin Williams Wynn’s uncle, and the head of the political group of which Wynn was a member, Southey had come to dislike Grenville for his advocacy of Catholic Emancipation and his critical attitude to the government’s conduct of the war in Spain and Portugal in 1808–1814. In his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), I, p. 55, Southey had condemned the ‘factious animosity’ with which the Grenville group had criticised government policy. </note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">The Dog Star</ref> owes his appointment<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey had been elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1823; the <title>London Gazette</title>, 1 July 1823, announced he had been appointed a Physician in Ordinary to George IV.</note> to <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnightonSirWilliam">Sir W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Knighton</ref>, – aided a little perhaps by his having formerly met <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> at Lord Ravensworths.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth (1775–1855), a landowner and colliery owner in Durham and Northumberland and a friend of George IV.</note> It is taking a high degree in his profession, &#38; I hope he will feel it in his practise, which indeed has lately been much on the increase.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I have just heard that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Tom</ref> is this day returned. To go in three months from <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> to the Falls of Niagara &#38; back is pretty quick work.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey had sailed from Whitehaven on 20 April 1823 on the brig <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> and reached Quebec on 27 May. He had been considering emigrating to Canada.</note></p>
