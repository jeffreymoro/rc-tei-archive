<salute>My dear Harry</salute></opener>
   <p rend="indent1">The letter from the Colonial Office arrived yesterday, those in <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> frank to day; – tomorrow <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> &#38; his eldest boy<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Castle Southey (1813–1828).</note> take their departure &#38; sleep at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</ref>; &#38; on Monday they embark at Maryport.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In fact, Tom Southey sailed from Whitehaven on 20 April 1823 on the brig <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> and reached Quebec on 27 May. He was considering emigrating to Canada.</note> The Captain<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> carries them both, &#38; gives them such fare as he has for himself, for the very small sum of 15£, – they take their own cots, &#38; such extra fare, solid &#38; liquid, as they please. So far economy has been well consulted. – If we can obtain any farther introductions they must be sent after him, to the care of Matthew Bell Esq<hi rend="sup">re</hi> Quebec.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Matthew Bell (1769–1849), a wealthy merchant, iron manufacturer and land speculator in Quebec, originally from Berwick-upon-Tweed. He was a relative of Sarah Southey.</note> One he has picked up here to Col. Marshall,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Marshall (b. 1779), Colonel of the Lanark Militia and Captain in the Canadian Fencibles. He was Secretary and Superintendent of the new Lanark settlement on the Clyde river in Eastern Ontario from its foundation in 1820 until 1830.</note> who has the distribution of lands upon the Clyde at a settlement called Lanark. If we can get one to the naval Captain<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> whom you mention, so much the better, – but he does not know him. On the whole however, he goes well fortified with letters.</p>
   <p rend="indent1">Yesterday <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">E May</ref> dispatched a piece of her work for your youngest son,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Herbert Southey, Jnr (1822–1829) was born on 6 November 1822.</note> which <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyLouisa">Louisa</ref> will receive, thro the Board of Controul, &#38; his Majestys Exchequer,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In other words, the gift would be forwarded via the Board of Control, of which Wynn was President, and the Exchequer, where Grosvenor Bedford worked.</note> – great powers being properly put in motion on great occasions. I am sorry to say that <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">E May</ref> is not well, &#38; that I am somewhat uneasy concerning her. She complains of pain in the chest, always produced by walking, &#38; felt not unfrequently when in inaction, – like a weight which oppresses her. And of a weakness in both wrists, both being in the slightest perceptible degree swoln.</p>
   <p rend="indent1">I wish to hear how you are going on, – &#38; how <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> stands in the challenge. By this time it must be pretty clear whether he will get in to College or not.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Hill had taken ‘The Challenge’, an examination among boys of Westminster School to determine who would receive a King’s Scholarship and join College, a group of forty boys with considerable privileges, including the right to proceed to a Closed Scholarship at either Trinity College, Cambridge, or Christ Church, Oxford.</note></p>
   <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</ref> is in town, – &#38; if he has not called on you, you will find him at the Pr. of Wales’s Hotel, Leicester Place, Leicester Square. – In another month or five weeks I hope to be able to start: – &#38; for that purpose I am pursuing more perseveringly than is agreable, my B of the Church.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824). He did not leave Keswick until 3 November 1823 and the book was still unfinished.</note> If you happen to call in at <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref>, beg him to quicken his printer.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Roworth (c. 1765–1851), printer based at Bell-yard, Temple Bar, London.</note> Here I can correct the proofs with proper deliberation, – &#38; refer to my books when needful, – the latter being impossible in London, &#38; the former not easily to be done. – The book must not be delayed, for there will be heavy demands upon it.</p>
   <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> must be incapable of much business, – for he has not answered my question whether I should write upon the Sp. &#38; Port: affairs:<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this paper for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> a subject upon which I could have begun a paper here, &#38; finished it advantageously at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref></p>
