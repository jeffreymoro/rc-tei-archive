               Dating note: Dating from content. The letter must have been written after 22 March 1824, when Landor told Southey of the misdirection of Alois’s book, in a letter and accompanying ‘catalogue’ (see John Forster, <title>Walter Savage Landor. A Biography</title>, 2 vols (London, 1869), II, pp. 117–118), but before 3 May 1824, when Southey noted in his letter to Edith May Southey of that date (Letter 4182) that he had already started taking the <title>Morning Herald</title> to replace the <title>Courier</title> – a circumstance that had not occurred when this letter was written. We have therefore placed it at the end of April.</note></head>
