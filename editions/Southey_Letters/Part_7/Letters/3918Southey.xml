            <note type="headnote" place="foot" resp="editors">MS: Royal College of Surgeons, London, Hunter-Baillie Collection, Vol. 4.2, no. 165. ALS; 6p.<lb/>
               Previously published: The letter text is previously unpublished; the text of the poem appeared in Joanna Baillie (ed.), <title>A Collection of Poems, Chiefly Manuscript, And From Living Authors</title> (London, 1823), pp. 280–283.</note></head>

           <salute> My Dear Madam</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">As you are well supplied with graver &#38; better matter for your benevolent volume,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">‘The Cataract of Lodore’, sent to Baillie in this letter, was included in Joanna Baillie (ed.), <title>A Collection of Poems, Chiefly Manuscript, And From Living Authors</title> (London, 1823), pp. 280–283, no. 99 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. This volume was produced to benefit Baillie’s old schoolfriend, Margaret Stirling, née Murdoch (b. 1763), widow of the Glasgow textile merchant, James Stirling (1760–1822). Mrs Stirling had been left in distressed circumstances by her husband’s business failures and death.</note> I send you something which is sure to be unlike any other of its contents. You will at once perceive that it was at first produced in sport, &#38; afterwards amplified as a whimsical exhibition of the richness of our language. – As such it is likely to be copied into newspapers, &#38; “Guides to the Lakes.”</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I am much gratified that the Lines upon <ref type="m" target="places.html#Lowtherestate">Lowther Castle</ref><note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Lines. Written in Lady Lonsdale’s Album, at Lowther Castle, Oct. 13. 1821’, Joanna Baillie (ed.), <title>A Collection of Poems, Chiefly Manuscript, And From Living Authors</title> (London, 1823), pp. 50–51.</note> should have pleased you. The stanza is good, &#38; I could have wished the verses better. But the truth is that I have almost ceased to be a poet; that I am so, has for many years been rather a matter of remembrance than of feeling; time has produced this sensible change, &#38; has kindly withdrawn from me the inclination before it bereaves me of the power. When I shall have compleated two poems, each of some length, which were begun long ago, I shall write no more in verse.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825) and Southey’s unfinished epic, ‘Oliver Newman’, set in New England. A fragment of the latter was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale (Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey </title>(London, 1845), pp. 1–90.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">Should you be in town in the spring, I may perhaps have the pleasure of meeting you there. It would be a great pleasure.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Mrs Southey</ref> joins with me in respects to your sister<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Agnes Baillie (1760–1861), with whom Joanna Baillie shared a house in Hampstead.</note> &#38; yourself. The evening which you did us the favour of passing here is fresh in our remembrance.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a reference to Joanna Baillie’s visit to Keswick in 1808, Southey to Herbert Hill, 9 July 1808, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.
