               &#38; either in the latter end of that year, or the ensuing January I was placed at poor old Williams’s. I had commenced poet before
               this: – at how early an age I cannot call to mind; but I can very well remember that my first composition both in manner &#38;
               sentiment might have been deemed <del>an unsuccessful</del> &#60;<del>humble</del> a very <del>promising</del> hopefull&#62; imitation

                  condemning reading fairy tales to children or discussing religion with them.</note> I was lucky enough to escape from any
               experiments of this kind, &#38; then good fortune provided better for me that any method could have done. Nothing could be more
               propitious to me, considering my aptitude, &#38; tendency of mind, than <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss
                  Tylers</ref> predilection, – I might almost call it passion for the theatre. Owing to this Shakespere was in my hands as soon as I
               could read, &#38; it was actually long before I had any other knowledge of the history of England than what I gathered from his plays.
               Indeed when first I read the plain matter of fact the difference which appeared there, puzzled &#38; did not please me; &#38; for
                  <del>ten</del> some time I preferred Shakesperes authority to the historians</p>
            <p rend="indent1">It is curious that Titus Andronicus<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">William Shakespeare, <title>Titus
                     Andronicus</title> (c. 1588–1593), a particularly gruesome play that involves murder, rape, dismemberment and (inadvertent)
                  cannibalism.</note> was at first my favourite play: – partly I suppose because there was nothing in the characters above my
               comprehension, but the chief reason must have been that tales of horror make a deep impression upon children as they do upon the
               vulgar, for whom as their ballads prove, no tragedy can be too bloody: – they excite astonishment rather than pity. – I went thro
               Beaumont &#38; Fletcher<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Beaumont (1584–1616; <title>DNB</title>) and John Fletcher
                  (1579–1625; <title>DNB</title>), who wrote about 12–15 plays together.</note> also before I was eight years old (circumstances
               enable me to recollect the time accurately.) – They were great theatrical names, &#38; therefore there was no scruple about letting me
               peruse their works. What harm indeed could they do me at that age? I read them merely for the interest which the stories excited, &#38;
               understood the worse parts, as little as I did the better. But I acquired imperceptibly from such reading a familiarity with the
               diction <del>of that last age</del> &#38; <del>an</del> ear for <del>metre</del> the blank verse of our great masters. In general I
               gave myself no trouble with what I did not understand, – the story was intelligible, &#38; that was enough. But the Knight of the
               Burning Pestle<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Beaumont, <title>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</title> (1607), a
                  satire on chivalric romances.</note> perplexed me terribly: – burlesque of this kind is the last thing that a child can comprehend.
               It set me longing however for Palmerin of England, – &#38; that longing was never gratified till I read it in the original
                  Portugueze.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Palmerin d’Angleterre</title> (1547) was one of a number of books of
                  romance about the exploits and descendants of Palmerin d’Oliva, Emperor of Constantinople. Its author was Francisco de Moraes Cabral
                  (c. 1500–1572), a Portuguese writer and diplomat. Southey had produced his own version of <title>Palmerin of England; by Francisco
                     de Moraes. Corrected by Robert Southey from the Original Portugueze</title> (1807). The book was one of many satirised in
                     <title>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</title>.</note> – My favourite play upon the stage was Cymberline, – &#38; next to that,
               As you like it.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">William Shakespeare, <title>Cymbeline</title> (1611) and <title>As You Like
                     It</title> (1599).</note> They are both romantic dramas; – &#38; no one had ever a more decided turn for music, or for numbers,
               than I had for romance.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">You will wonder that with this education I did not become a dramatic writer. I had seen more plays before I was seven
               years old that I have seen since I was twenty; &#38; heard more conversation about the theatre than any other subject. <ref type="m"

               years takes off so much from the pleasure of dramatic representation. Every thing answered the height of my expectations or desires.
               And I saw it in perfect comfort, – from the front row of a <del>side</del> box, not too far from the centre, of a small theatre, – in

               most intimate friend, – she was then in high reputation for the first volume of the Recess, &#38; for her Chapter of Accidents. You
               will not wonder that hearing as I continually did of living authors, &#38; seeing in what estimation they were held, I formed a great
               notion of the dignity <del>which</del> attached to their profession. Perhaps in no other circle could this <del>have</del> effect have
               so surely been produced as in a dramatic one, – where ephemeral productions <del>produce</del> &#60;excite&#62; an intense interest
               while they last. Superior as I thought actors to other men, it was not long before I perceived that authors were still a higher
               class.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">My earliest dreams of authorship were, as you might anticipate from such circumstances, of a dramatic form, &#38; the
               notion which I formed of dramatic composition was not inaccurate. It is the easiest thing in the world to write a play! said I to <ref
                  type="m" target="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</ref>, as we were in a carriage on Redclift Hill, one day, returning from
               Bristol to Bedminster. Is it my dear? was her reply. Yes, I pursued, for you know you have only to think what you would say if you were
               in the place of the characters, &#38; to make them say it. This brings to mind some unlucky illustrations which I made use of about the
               same time, to the same Lady, with the view of enforcing what I thought good &#38; considerate advice. <ref type="m"
                  target="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</ref> was visiting <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> at
               Bedminster: they had fallen out, as they sometimes would do, &#38; these bickerings produced a fit of sullenness in the former, which
               lasted some days, &#38; while it lasted she usually sate with her apron over her face. I really thought she would hurt her eyes by
               this, &#38; told her so, in great kindness – for you know <ref type="m" target="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</ref> said I, that
               everything gets out of order if it is not used. A book which is never opened will become damp &#38; mouldy, – &#38; a key if it is
               never turned in the lock gets rusty, just when <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> entered the room, –
               Lord, <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</ref>, said the offended Lady, what do you think this child has been
               saying? he has been comparing my eyes to a rusty key &#38; a mouldy book! – The speech however was not without some good effect, for it
               restored good humour. Miss Palmer was an odd woman with a kind heart, – one of those persons who are not respected so much as they
               deserve, because their dispositions are better than their understanding. She had a most generous &#38; devoted attachment to <ref
                  type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</ref>, which was not always requited as it ought to have been. The earliest
               dream which I can remember related to her, &#38; it was singular enough to impress itself indelibly in my memory. I thought I was
               sitting with her in her drawing room (- chairs, carpet &#38; every thing are now vividly present to my minds eye) when the Devil was
               introduced as a morning visitor Such an appearance, – for he was in his full costume of horns, black-bat-wings, tail &#38; cloven feet,
               – put me in ghostly &#38; bodily fear; – but she received him with perfect politeness, called him Dear M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Devil,
               desired the servant to put him a chair, &#38; expressed her delight at being favoured with a call.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">There was much more promise implied in my notion of how a play ought to be written, than would have been found in any of
               my attempts. The first subject which I tried was the Continence of Scipio<note n="27" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a play about
                  Scipio Africanus the Younger (185–129 BC), who destroyed the Spanish settlement of Numantia in 134–133 BC.</note> – suggested by a
               print in a Pocket Book. Battles were introduced in abundance, – because the battle in Cymberline was one of my favourite scenes. And
               because Congreves hero in the Mourning Bride finds the writing of his father in prison,<note n="27" place="foot" resp="editors">William

                  imprisoned, finds a letter written by his own father when he, too, was imprisoned.</note> I made my Prince of Numantia find pen ink
               &#38; paper that he might write to his mistress. An act &#38; half of this nonsense exhausted my perseverance. Another story ran for a
               long time in my head, &#38; I had planned the characters to suit the actors on the Bath stage. The fable was taken from a collection of
               Tales every circumstance of which has compleated faded from my recollection, – except that I think the book must have been thirty or
               forty years old at least at that time, – &#38; I should recognize it if it ever fell in my way. While this dramatic passion continued,
               I wished my friends to partake it, &#38; soon after I went to Williams’s school, persuaded one of my schoolfellows to write a tragedy.

               good-natured good fellow – with a round face which I have not seen for seven or eight &#38; thirty years, – &#38; yet fancy that I
               could recognize it now, &#38; should be right glad to see it. He liked the suggestion &#38; agreed to it very readily, – but he could
               not tell what to write about. I gave him a story. – But then another difficulty was discovered, he could not devise names for the
               personages of the drama. I gave him a most heroic assortment of Propria quae maribus &#38; foeminis.<note n="31" place="foot"

               tell what to make them say, &#38; then I gave up the business. I made the same attempt with another schoolfellow, &#38; with no better
               success, – it seemed to me very odd that they should not be able to write plays as well as to do their lessons. The subject of this
               second experiment was a boy<note n="32" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> whose appearance prepossessed every body, –
               (it is heedless to say that both these friends were of my own age, – that is always the case with school intimacies) – <ref type="m"

               lessons were solitary ones, so few boys were there in my station, &#38; indeed in the station above me who received a classical
               education in those days, compared with what is the case now. Writing &#38; arithmetic – with, at most a little French, was thought
               sufficient for the sons of opulent merchants at Bristol. I was in Phaedrus<note n="34" place="foot" resp="editors">Phaedrus (fl. 1st

               deemed there of more importance. Writing was taught here very differently from what it was at Corston, &#38; much less agreably to my
               inclinations. We did copies of capital letters there, &#38; were encouraged to aspire to the ornamental parts of penmanship. But

               absurd &#38; wearisome perseverance. Writing was the only thing in which any pains were ever taken to ground me thoroughly, &#38; I was
               generally thought a most unpromising pupil. No instruction ever could teach me to hold the pen properly, – of course therefore I could
                  <del>not</del> make none of those full free strokes which were deemed essential to good writing, &#38; this drew upon me a great
               deal of unavailing reproof, – tho not severity, – for old Williams liked me on the whole, – &#38; Mr Foote<note n="37" place="foot"

               &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">my Uncle Thomas</ref> used to shake their heads at me, &#38; pronounce that
               I never should write a decent hand. The cyphering book however made some amends in my masters eyes. It was in this that his pains &#38;
               the proficiency of his pupils were to be shown. The books he used to sew himself, – half a dozen sheets in the common quarto size,
               &#38; they were ruled with double red lines, &#38; the lines which were required in the sums were also double, in red ink. When the
               book was filled, <del>x</del> pencil-lines were carefully rubbed out, &#38; Williams tearing off the covers deposited it in an envelope
               of fine cartridge paper, on which he had written in his best hand, the boys name to whom it belonged <del>And</del> When there were
               enough of these to make a volume, – they were consigned to a poor old man, the inhabitant of an alms-house, who obtained a few comforts
               beyond what the establishment allowed him, by binding them. Now tho I wrote what was called a stiff cramp hand, there was a neatness
               &#38; regularity about my books, which were peculiar to them. I had as quick a sense of symmetry as of metre: My lines were always
               drawn according to some standard of <del>regularity &#38;</del> proportion, so that the page had an appearance of order at first sight.
               I found the advantage of this when I came to have business with the press. The method which I used in my cyphering book led me to teach
               the printers how to print verses of irregular length upon a regular principle.<note n="39" place="foot" resp="editors">As in Southey’s

               my admiration of German text at school.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I remained at this school between four &#38; five years, which if not profitably, were at least not unhappily spent. And
               here let me state the deliberate opinion <del>wh</del> upon the contested subject of &#60;public or private&#62; education which I have
               formed from what I have experienced &#38; heard &#38; observed. A juster estimate of ones-self is acquired at school than can be formed
               in the course of domestic <del>education</del> &#60;instruction&#62;; &#38; what is of much more consequence, a better intuition into
               the characters of others than there is any chance of learning in after life. I have said that this is of more consequence than ones
               self-estimate, because the error upon that score <del>x</del> which domestic education tends to produce is in the right side – that of
               diffidence &#38; humility. These advantages a day-scholar obtains, <del>&#38; he escapes more much of the pollution &#38; all the
                  unhappiness</del> &#38; he avoids great part of the evils which are to be set against them. He cannot indeed wholly escape
               pollution, – but he is far less exposed to it than a boarder. He suffers nothing <del>from</del> &#60;from&#62; tyranny, – which is
               carried to excess in schools, – nor has he much opportunity of acquiring or indulging malicious &#38; tyrannical propensities himself.
               Above all his religious habits, which it is almost impossible to retain at school, are safe. – I would gladly send a son to a good
                  <del>day</del> school by day, but rather than board him at the best I would educate him myself. What I have said, applies to public
               schools as well as private; of the advantages which the former possess I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</p>
