            <p rend="indent1">Your letter arrived safely, &#38; upon due consideration I thought the best thing I could do was to seal up it &#38; its contents in a blank cover, &#38; send them to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, which I did by Miss Castle<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Ann Castle (b. 1792), eldest unmarried sister of Tom Southey’s wife <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Sarah Southey</ref>.

Part Five</title>, Letter 2723. </note> this afternoon. It is quite proper that he should feel – as I hope he will feel upon receiving it. – I have sent his Prospectus<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey’s <title>Chronological History of the West Indies</title> (1827), which he was proposing to publish by subscription. It was finally published by Longman.</note> in various directions.</p>

It will show you what are the impediments to the establishment of representative governments in that country, what the real political evils <del>xxxx</del>, &#38; what the practicable reforms. You will find also some very judicious remarks upon the Lutheran Church, &#38; the condition of the Protestant Clergy.</p>

Southey had made it known that he did not wish to receive this honour.</note> – his friends it seems having <hi rend="ital">canvassed</hi> most actively in his behalf. – I suppose they will hardly withhold his honorary as they call it, if he does not furnish the yearly paper which is required: – but if he furnishes more than one, I own it will surprize me, – &#38; a little if he does that.</p>
