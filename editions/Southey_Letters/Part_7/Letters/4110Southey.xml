<opener><salute>My dear Sir</salute></opener>
	<p rend="indent1">I thank you for the papers, &#38; for the Gazettes also, &#38; I return the latter because I have a compleat series of them at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, &#38; pretty full references to their contents<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey eventually acquired a collection of 24 volumes of Spanish <title>Gazetas</title>, 1808–1813, no. 3472 in the sale catalogue of his library. These included <title>Gazetas</title> ‘de Gobierno’ (‘of the Government’) and from the Juntas of Seville and Valencia.</note></p>
	   <p rend="indent1">My second volume will come down to the time of Massenas retreat, &#38; his defeat at Fuentes d’Onoro.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">André Massena (1758–1817) commanded the invasion of Portugal in 1810–1811. Southey did not deal with his retreat until <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), III, pp. 127–154. On 3–6 May 1811 at Fuentes de Oñoro, an Anglo-Portuguese force stopped Massena relieving the besieged city of Almeida; see <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), III, pp. 210–217.</note> I shall have no room for documents.</p>
	      <p rend="indent1">Concerning the burning of Manresa.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The town of Manresa in Catalonia was burnt to the ground by French forces on 30 March 1811; see <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823–1832), III, pp. 248–249.</note> I have only such accounts as the Gazettes furnish. When I return home &#38; am settled to the work, upon that subject, or any other on which I may feel myself deficient in information, I shall very gladly avail myself of your friendly offer, &#38; apply to you for it.</p>
