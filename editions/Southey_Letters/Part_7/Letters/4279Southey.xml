          <p rend="indent1">  In the case of a book, half a loaf is not better than no bread. I never yet saw any epitome, or selections from a book that was good for anything, which did not omit things of main consequence, – &#38; perhaps the very things which would have been to me the most interesting I would have nothing abridged except <del>the Stat</del> Acts of Parliament, – &#38; Comments on the Bible, – &#38; if they were cut down to what is either useful or necessary, the Statutes at large<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Statutes at Large was the common term for a published collection of all the laws passed by Parliament, as in Owen Ruffhead (1723–1769; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Statutes at Large from Magna Carta to 1763</title> (1762–1765). </note> would be contained in a pocket volume of reasonable type, &#38; Mants Bible lose 99 notes out of an hundred.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Mant (1776–1848; <title>DNB</title>) and George D’Oyly (1778–1846; <title>DNB</title>) edited <title>The Holy Bible, According to the Authorized Version; with Notes, Explanatory and Practical</title> (1814).</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"> If you had gone to <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</ref> you would have found that he merely came to town to be present at the proroguement,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Parliament was prorogued on 4 November 1824 until 6 January 1825.</note> – &#38; made no stay there. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> &#38; the family will not return there till after Christmas. We heard from them yesterday, when there arrived a gold chain for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Isabel</ref>, in a letter, sent by <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">R.</ref> in <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Berthas</ref> name as her remembrance of her sisters birthday – another frank bringing at the same time poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Berthas</ref> genuine remembrance – which was a cornelian cross. This is like <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> – whose hand is as open as his heart.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I am now amusing myself with Budaeus’s Epistles,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Guillaume Budé (1467–1540), <title>Lucubrationes Variae</title> and <title>De Asse et Partibus Eius</title> (1557), no. 473 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. </note> – at least such of them are in Latin, for they are half in Greek, &#38; the Greek is printed that the contractions present quite as great an impediment as the language. His works are among the books which I last received from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref>, – from whom I had a very pleasing letter last week. He has sent over another volume<del>s</del> of Conversations<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Landor’s <title>Imaginary Conversations of Literary Men and Statesmen</title> (1824) were not followed by a third volume until 1828.</note> to the press.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> One of the ugliest &#38; dirtiest of all my Spanish books is affording me great amusement at this time – Obras en Prosa de D Juan de Zavaleta – Coronista del Rey – (<del>Charles xxxx 2d</del>) (Carlos 2)<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Juan de Zabaleta (c.1610–1670), <title>Obras En Prosa de Don Ivan de Zavaleta. Coronista del Rey Nuestro Senor. Por el Mismo Anadidas</title> (Madrid, 1667), pp. 224–453, no. 3779 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Southey here refers to Zabaleta’s <title>Dia de Fiesta por la Manana</title> (1654) and <title>Dia de Fiesta por la Tarde</title> (1659), describing customs during a Spanish holiday of his times. Zabaleta was a chronicler in the reign of Charles II (1661–1700; King of Spain 1665–1700).</note> The book looks as if Mal-lavado<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Ill washed’; Southey and Hill’s nickname for a bookseller they had known in Lisbon.</note> had read it. I know nothing more of the author, – he has all the faults of his age in great perfection, but they were faults which it required some ability to excel in, – &#38; I have seldom raked in a dunghill where so many pearls were to be found. The valuable part of his writings relates to the manners of his time. In a work which would fill two English octavos he gives <del>xxx</del> the history of a Dia de Fiesta<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">‘holiday’.</note> as past by the different classes of men in Madrid. With some caricature, &#38; a great deal of inane sententiousness, it is a more compleat picture of manners than I have any where else seen.</p>

Its side effects were severe, including a slowing of the heart, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhoea. Fatalities were not uncommon.</note> You would be relieved if you were within reach of the Caldas, or if you would try the English Caldas.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">The hot, sulphurous spring and spa town of Caldas da Rainha in Portugal.

         <p rend="indent1">   Poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> is in a deplorable state – if indeed he be still alive. As far as I can understand, when he was apparently recovering from a renewed attack of dropsy, a paralytic seizure supervened, <del>xx</del> which at once reduced his mind to a mere wreck.
