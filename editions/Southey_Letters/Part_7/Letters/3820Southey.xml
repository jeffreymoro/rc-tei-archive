           <salute> My Dear Sir,</salute></opener>
           <p rend="indent1"> I received your little volume a few days ago.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Allan Cunningham, <title>Sir Marmaduke Maxwell, a Dramatic Poem; The Mermaid of Galloway; The Legend of Richard Faulder; and Twenty Scottish Songs</title> (1822), no. 745 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note> It is sometimes convenient to thank an author for his book before you have perused it; but in this case I chose to read the book first, – knowing very well that I should read it, as I have done, with great pleasure.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> The first time I took up one of the London Magazines<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Cunningham was a regular contributor to the <title>London Magazine</title> (1820–1829).</note> (about fifteen months ago), I recognised your hand there, and was not a little pleased at finding it. You have now acquired for yourself a claim upon public attention. Your powers have developed themselves, and you have improved in the art of poetry, even more than might have been expected, since I first saw a specimen of your compositions. You have only to go on and prosper. But the more you rely upon yourself, the better. Admiration naturally leads to imitation; but, by bearing another author too much in mind, either in the choice of your story or the conception of a character, you will do an injustice to yourself.</p>
           <p rend="indent1"> I like your dramatic language; it is of the right stamp – free and forcible. And the play is full of poetry, without being overlaid by it.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I thank you sincerely for offering to send copies to any of my friends. But this is too much for me to desire. As far as my private voice can recommend it, it shall not be wanting. I have no public one in such cases, so false is the common opinion that I am actively employed in criticising contemporary writers.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">If at any time you should revisit your native country,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Cunningham was born in Keir, a village in Dumfriesshire.</note> remember Keswick is <hi rend="ital">in</hi> the way if you cross the Solway, and only one stage out of it if you go round; and that I shall be heartily glad to see you.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Make my remembrances to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ChantreyFrancis">Mr. Chantrey</ref>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Cunningham was Chantrey’s clerk of works 1814–1841.</note> His bust of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> is full in my sight at this moment.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Chantrey had sculpted Wordsworth in 1820 and sent a copy to Southey as a gift. Southey reciprocated by sending a copy of the bust of himself made by James Smith (1775–1815) in 1813.</note> The more I consider it, the better it pleases me.</p>
            <closer><salute rend="indent1">Farewell, my dear Sir, and believe me,</salute>
               <salute rend="indent2"> Yours, with sincere regard,</salute>
           <signed rend="indent4"> ROBERT SOUTHEY.</signed></closer>
