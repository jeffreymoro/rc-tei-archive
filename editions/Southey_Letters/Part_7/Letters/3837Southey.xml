            <p rend="indent1">Miss Wilbraham<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Laetitia Wilbraham (1799–1874), Tom Southey’s lodger.</note> is going to be married; – consent has been asked &#38; given, &#38; I know not which is happiest; she in the prospect of matrimony, or <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">his Wife</ref> in getting rid of a boarder, whom I verily believe they wished to get rid of in any underhand way. Perhaps you may know something of the intended husband,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Harrison Fryer (1777–1855) of Whitley House, Northumberland. A surveyor, geologist and mining engineer, Fryer spent part of each year at Keswick. At this time he was renting Ormathwaite, a large house about a mile and a quarter from Keswick.</note> in many respect a much better one than she had reason to expect. He is a Land Surveyor by profession, a Newcastle-man by birth, Frier by name, &#38; now inhabits Ormathwaite: – a very handsome man, of gentlemanly manners &#38; appearance, &#38; scientific acquirements, forty years of age. He has lived in this neighbourhood several years. – What can be his inducement you will ask. I suspect her money, &#38; her connections. The rest, as a man of liberal opinions, he takes easily. All things considered however, her father<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Randle Wilbraham (1773–1861), landowner, of Rode Hall, Cheshire.</note> may look upon it as a very eligible match, this son in law being a person who is producible any where. I hope her poor wits will hold together till the time appointed which is not till after – Carlisle Assizes.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Assizes were courts that periodically heard more serious cases (including capital offences) in each county. The Carlisle Assizes began on 13 August 1822.</note> Marriage &#38; hanging you know, go together in an old proverb.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Marriage and hanging go by destiny;/ ’Tis the old proverb; now they come together’, John Fletcher (1579–1625; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Wife for a Month</title> (1624), Act II, scene 1, lines 2–3.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry to hear from <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> that you have not been well. A run among the mountains will do wonders for you. I was in the river on the last day of April. We have had winter again since; &#38; now summer is returned. We were on the Lake this morning for the first time.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref> has sent me proofs of two Portugueze scenes, – part of the series with which he means to accompany my history.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Series of Views of Spain and Portugal, to Illustrate Mr. Southey’s History of the Peninsular War; Drawn on Stone by W. Westall, A.R.A., from Sketches by General Hawker, Mr. Locker, Mr. Heaphy, &#38;c. Part I, containing Eight Views, illustrating Vol. I</title> (1823). These pictures could be inserted into the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> They are some of the finest things I ever saw. I am fast approaching the end of the volume.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I write this merely to tell you about Miss Wilbraham. Her father has not thought it necessary to make any enquiries concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Frier, but takes her report of him.
