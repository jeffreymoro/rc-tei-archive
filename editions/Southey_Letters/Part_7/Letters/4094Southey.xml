On Saturday morning I walked from <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>, &#38; had like poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cupn</ref>, only two breakfasts that day, one with <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>, the other with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>. We dined with Lady Malet,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Susanna Malet, née Wales (1779–1868), widow of Sir Charles Malet, 1st Baronet (1752–1815; <title>DNB</title>), the maternal uncle of Emma Peachy (who was the first wife of Sir William Peachy).

It begins in Hertfordshire and originally terminated in the Clerkenwell area of Islington, although most of its water is now diverted into a reservoir at Stoke Newington.</note> A more abominable situation I never saw &#38; cannot conceive, – &#38; yet because it had been a pleasant one in his childhood – &#38; he remembered it with pleasure,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Colebrook Cottage was on the west side of the New River, an area which remained relatively undeveloped into the 1790s.</note> he it seems had fixed his heart upon living there. The new river is filthy, green &#38; apparently stagnant, the garden which is of tolerable size is surrounded by houses &#38; there are yards <del>als</del> very near full of unhappy cows who live knee deep in their own litter, &#38; a population of pigs whose stench is pestilential.

Westall had two further sons: Thomas Westall (b. 1825), later an engineer; and Robert Westall (1829–1908), who became an artist.</note> Then I went down to Westminster to settle &#60;with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>&#62; about <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</ref> going to the play with his family when <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> goes, which will be either tomorrow or Monday.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">George IV attended the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on Monday, 1 December 1823.

She is the sort of woman that Miss Rickman<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Ann Rickman (b. 1808).</note> was, but handsomer, &#38; just in her full bloom.
