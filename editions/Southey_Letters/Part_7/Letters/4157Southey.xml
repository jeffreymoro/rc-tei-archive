           <p rend="indent1"> Your letter was a relief to me, – for I was afraid illness had been the cause of your silence, – &#38; it brought news of your amendment. – These hasty lines accompany a few more stanzas<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was beginning ‘Robin Hood’. The resulting incomplete work was published in <title>Robin Hood: a Fragment. By the Late Robert Southey, and Caroline Southey. With Other Fragments and Poems By R.S. and C.S.</title> (London, 1847), pp. [1]–36.</note> – When next you write, speak of the poem on a slip of paper by itself, &#38; let your letter have no allusion to it. I expect much amusement from keeping the secret, &#38; some advantage from it. What I write generally receives a good deal of amendment before it passes thro the press, – wherever you can mend a passage, do so. I shall soon finish the canto. – Do you describe how the <del>infant</del> &#60;boy&#62; like a pet lamb that had lost its mother – was fondled &#38; spoilt.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Bowles did not include these lines in ‘Robin Hood’.</note></p>

However, this privilege only applied to letters of less than two ounces’ weight.</note> was only a caution, – the purse was far within the mark, &#38; came safely.</p>
