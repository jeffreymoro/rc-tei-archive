<opener><salute>My dear friend</salute></opener>
			<p rend="indent3">I received by yesterdays post the inclosed bills, – in payment of my first volume.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832).</note> – For 150£ – (a few pounds more or less) I am engaged (you shall know how, hereafter) – &#38; I expect to be called upon for it in the course of the present month.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">This money was required for a set of illustrations to accompany Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814). Richard Westall produced six such illustrations, <title>Illustrations of Roderick, the Last of the Goths. A Poem, by Robert Southey, Esq. from the Drawings of R. Westall, R.A.</title> (1824), nos 2627–2628 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Longman published them and purchasers could arrange for the engravings to be bound into their copy of <title>Roderick</title>. Southey secretly invested in this venture.</note> Let me draw upon you for it. – The two remaining volumes will be clear of any demands upon them, &#38; I can engage for both in the course of eighteen months. The payment for them shall be transmitted to you, as soon as it is made – &#38; I pray you, do not judge of my will by my poor ability in such things. I owe you a long &#38; large debt of kindness, &#38; whatever money I may realize shall never be placed anywhere but in your hands, as long as it can be of any use to you.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">Your <del>xxxx xx</del> strong beer is <del>xx</del> in my cellar, where I am very happy to see it, &#38; where I expect shortly the farther pleasure of seeing a barrel of Devonshire &#60;cyder&#62; on each side of it, – excellent supporters.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The cider was a present from Nicholas Lightfoot.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">I was surprized as well as sorry to hear you had been laid up with the gout. We learnt it from <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara Coleridge</ref>; – for it is long since I heard from you, &#38; as for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</ref>, he scarcely ever writes.</p>
	<p rend="indent1">All here unite in kindest remembrances.</p>
