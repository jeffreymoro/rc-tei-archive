<salute>My dear Senhouse</salute></opener>
   <p rend="indent1">In the hope &#38; expectation of seeing you soon, (&#38; the sooner the better) I will ask you to pay <ref type="m" target="people.html#MorrisonJohn">Morrison</ref> for me the sum of six pounds, seventeen shillings, – being the balance of my half years rent, – after deducting 13 shillings for roof repair, – &#38; 30£ expended at this time by an agreement with the Landlord,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Tolson, Jnr (1756–1842), a commission agent in Liverpool and the owner since 1815 of Greta Hall.</note> of which he (<ref type="m" target="people.html#MorrisonJohn">Morrison</ref>) has been apprized. – The balance is less than I like to draw for, – &#38; an awkward sum to send, – where there is no direct carrier to whom it may be entrusted.</p>
      <p rend="indent1">The packet which you brought for me, containing some interesting communications concerning the campaigns of 1809 &#38; 1810 in Portugal, – from Sir Nicolas Trant,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Brigadier-General Nicholas Trant (1769–1839; <title>DNB</title>), an Irish army officer who was assigned to command Portuguese forces. He served with distinction in many actions in the Peninsular War 1808–1813.</note> who performed the good service of occupying Coimbra after the battle of Busaco,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">After the Battle of Bussaco (27 September 1810), French forces continued to advance on the defensive Lines of Torres Vedras, leaving their sick and wounded at Coimbra. Trant re-occupied the city on 6 October and acted as its governor throughout the winter, while the French retreated to wait out the bad weather. He then played a major role in forcing the French Army to abandon its plans to occupy central Portugal and instead leave for Spain in March 1811.</note> &#38; thereby securing the most fertile provinces from the French.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">The change of weather commenced just on your return. We had the finest month of April that I ever remember in this country, – they had rain on seventeen days out of the thirty, at Kendal, – &#38; certainly we had it not on seven at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. But this week has been almost one continued storm, – the waters are out &#38; many acres have just been sown in time to lose the seed.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">You will come I hope as soon as the weather becomes good – I shall enjoy a little laking &#38; mountaineering with you. – We expect <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref> &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> in a few days. They have made a long progress, &#38; I shall not begin mine till July, – the book<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> which was to have been one volume, having grown into two. This sort of work is something like building a house, – the cost is very apt to <del>double</del> &#60;exceed&#62; the estimate twofold.</p>
         <p rend="indent1">The aspects on the continent are not favourable for your plans.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">France had invaded Spain on 7 April 1823.</note> – When armies are in motion, or even on foot, there is no knowing how far the inconvenience which they occasion extends. I had once after a long &#38; fatiguing days journey in the mountains, to ride about the streets of a popular city (Tavira) from house to house, begging a nights lodging <hi rend="ital">por amor de Dios e Maria Santissima</hi>,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">‘for the love of God and Most Holy Mary’.</note> – because the place was full of soldiers.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">This incident occurred on 15 April 1801, while Southey was travelling in Portugal, at a time of tension on the border between Spain and Portugal (<title>Robert Southey: Journals of a Residence in Portugal 1800–1801 and a Visit to France 1838</title> (Oxford, 1960), ed. Adolfo Cabral, pp. 42–43).</note> And we were literally in danger of passing the night in the streets. Our kindest remembrances to all your friends -</p>
