Dating note: According to his letter to Nicholas Lightfoot, 22 December 1823 (Letter 4104), Southey had booked a place in a coach which would leave London on Friday 2 January 1824. It seems likely that Southey’s request for a letter from Edith May to Lightfoot, to be ready for ‘Friday next’, refers to a letter Southey would carry with him. That being so, this letter dates from the final week of December 1823.</note></head>
