<salute>My dear friend</salute></opener>
            <p rend="indent1">The demand upon me which I expected in the course of last month has been delayed till now; – &#38; if in the course of a fortnight you will lodge one hundred &#38; eleven pounds for me in <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</ref> hands this will be a better way than drawing upon you for it, as it will save the stamp.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was secretly investing in Richard Westall (1765–1836; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths, by R. Southey. Illustrated with Engravings from the Designs of R. W.</title> (1824), nos 2627–2628 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. These drawings were published by Longman and could be inserted into Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814).</note> He may be found either at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 9 <ref type="m" target="places.html#StaffordRow">Stafford Row</ref> Buckingham Gate, – or any time after breakfast – at the Exchequer.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brother Tom</ref> was to sail on Thursday to reconnoitre his grant in Canada, – a business which has occupied much of my thoughts for some time past, – &#38; will long continue so to do.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey sailed from Whitehaven on 20 April 1823 on the brig <hi rend="ital">Maria</hi> and reached Quebec on 27 May. He was considering emigrating to Canada but decided not to do so after visiting the country.</note></p>
            <p rend="indent1">I write in haste, – having many dispatches to make up for this post. – We are all tolerably well thank God. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your god daughter</ref> busily employed in making certain memoranda of this country with her pencil, – which are designed for you, – but I believe this ought to be a secret, till I appear with them in town. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> is reduced to two breakfasts, but continues firm in his archepiscopal determination.</p>
            <p rend="indent1">Are you &#38; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MaySusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> May</ref> the better for your return to Richmond? You will have enjoyed the change heartily if your weather has been as fine as <del>yours</del> ours</p>
            <p rend="indent1">I will write shortly at more length. Would that I could see the end of the work upon which I am employed. It is even mortifying to perceive as I proceed with what want either of diligence, or fidelity, or feeling, – or of all three. English history, – &#38; especially church history – has been written.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was writing his <title>Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> And how impudently a dishonest writer relies upon the ignorance – &#38; therefore, the credulity, of his readers.</p>
