These were in return for copies of their writings that the Danes had gifted to Southey; see Robert Southey to Andreas Andersen Feldborg, 26 June 1822, Letter 3858. Three volumes of Oehlenschläger’s works and ten volumes of Ingemann’s works were nos. 786 and 1480, respectively, in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note></p>
