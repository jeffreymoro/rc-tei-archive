           <p rend="indent1"> My next years resources are likely to be derived more from verse<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was completing <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title> (1825).</note> than from prose, inasmuch as I am of opinion that my time may now be employed more profitably in that way. So I am trying what may be done by a little resolution, spurred – not indeed by necessity, but by a prudent apprehension of it. – Thank Heaven my shoulder is still strong enough to be set to the wheel with effect.</p>
