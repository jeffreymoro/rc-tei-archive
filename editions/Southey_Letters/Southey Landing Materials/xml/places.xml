								attempted to create a model estate, planting trees, importing merino sheep and improving the roads. His visitors
								included Southey. A series of disputes with his neighbours, including his tenant Charles Betham, whom Southey had
								recommended to him, and mounting financial problems led Landor to depart for the continent in early 1814.</desc>
