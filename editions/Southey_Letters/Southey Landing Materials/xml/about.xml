        </p>
        <p>
          <title level="m">The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</title> is divided into eight Parts: I: 1791-1797, II:1798-1803, III:1804-09,
               IV:1810-15, V:1816-21, VI:1822-27, VII:1828-33, VIII:1833-39. </p>
        <p>The General Introduction outlines the project&#8217;s research context. In addition, each individual Part has a brief introductory essay. </p>
        <p>Throughout the edition, letters are presented in chronological order, each letter being assigned its own number. Any letters that have
               been located after the first publication of an individual Part of the edition are inserted at their appropriate chronological point and
               given a suffix number (e.g. .1,.2): see, for example, Letter 1889.1. Previously unpublished letters have all been newly transcribed
               from the autograph manuscript, when that survives. In cases where the letter now exists only in a manuscript transcript in another
               hand, copy-text is taken from the transcript and this is recorded in the editorial headnote. Where letters have been previously
               published, we have returned to and transcribed the original manuscript when it survives. In cases where we have been unable to locate
               the manuscript of a published letter, copy-text is taken, without emendation, from the published version and this is recorded in the
               editorial headnote. There are two instances where a previously published version of a letter is fuller than the surviving manuscript.
               In these an edited, annotated transcript of the manuscript version has been placed within the main run of letters (see Letters 46 and
               147), and the text of the longer, previously published version in Appendix 1.</p>
        <p>We have followed the editors of the letters of Mark Twain and adopted a &#8216;plain text&#8217; methodology in order to produce a text that is
               more quickly intelligible to the reader but that also represents, as closely as our digitised transcriptions can, the original
               holograph letters.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">For a full explication of &#8216;plain text&#8217; see &#8216;Guide to Editorial Practice,
                  (MTDP 00005).&#8217; In Mark Twain Project Online. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press. 2007. <ref target="http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/MTDP00005.xml;style=letterletter;brand=mtp">&lt;http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=letters/MTDP00005.xml;style=letterletter;brand=mtp&gt;</ref>, accessed
                  2014-12-19.</note> Our aim is to allow the reader to get as close as possible to what Southey wrote and thus to provide an insight
               into the creative processes that underpinned his letter writing. This is particularly important now, when the older idea of Southey as
               someone who wrote with ease and never blotted a line or deleted a word is being challenged by new textual and critical scholarship. All
               letters are transcribed in full and editorial intervention in the text has been kept to a minimum. Southey&#8217;s original spelling, and
               mis-spelling, grammar, punctuation and any slips of his pen have been retained. Deletions are indicated by striking through the
               cancelled word or phrase, but without any attempt to indicate the heaviness of the deletion: e.g. &#8216;<del>he said</del>&#8217;. In those cases
               where Southey changed his mind and wrote over his original thought, we have put his final version in the text of the letter and
               indicated the original words or characters in an endnote. Throughout the text, &#8216;x&#8217; is used to indicate an illegible character: e.g. &#8216;he
               xxid&#8217;. Underlining is indicated by italics: e.g. &#8216;<hi rend="ital">he</hi> said&#8217;. The exception to this rule is where Southey used
               underlining not for emphasis but to indicate an abbreviation written in superscript: eg. &#8216;D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>&#8217; rather than &#8216;Doctor&#8217;
               or &#8216;Dr&#8217;. This was something Southey did occasionally and irregularly, particularly on address leaves. It is not possible to code a
               character or set of characters in both underline or italic and superscript, so in these cases we have silently regularised his practice
               and presented all his superscript abbreviations, both underlined or not, in superscript: e.g. &#8216;M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Smith said&#8217;.
               Editorial [...] within the text of an individual letter are used to indicate issues relating to the manuscript: a tear, cut, missing
               section or area obscured by a seal mark or blot, or a substantial section of a letter in the hand of a co-correspondent. See, for
               example, Letter 56, co-written with Grosvenor Charles Bedford. Editorial {...} are used to indicate an authorial insertion of
               text above or below the line. </p>
        <p>We have retained Southey&#8217;s paragraphing but have not otherwise replicated the lineage of prose, the pagination, the hand, or any other
               physical features of his letters that it is clear Southey did not invest with any meaning. Throughout the edition, words split in the
               text of an individual letter by the end of a line or a page have been silently emended to reflect Southey&#8217;s customary spelling: eg.
               &#8216;mis-/ chief&#8217; has been emended to &#8216;mischief&#8217; in our text. In the case of poems included by Southey in his letters, we have retained the
               lineage and stanza breaks, with the exception of lines and stanzas that run onto the following line or page of the manuscript. In these
               cases, the run over word or line/s has been silently incorporated into the preceding part of the line or stanza as it is clear that the
               break had no meaning to Southey and was dictated purely by the spatial constraints of the manuscript page.</p>
        <p>Each letter has an editorial headnote. This records the location of the manuscript, if it has survived, and describes its physical
               characteristics, using the following abbreviations:</p>
        <p>ALS: autograph letter signed</p>
        <p>AL: autograph letter, without signature</p>
        <p>(A)LS: more than 50% of the manuscript in a hand other than Southey&#8217;s</p>
        <p>TR = survives as a transcript in another hand</p>
        <p>TS = survives as a typescript</p>
        <p>p. = numbers of pages of the letter containing script, including the address leaf, when this has survived</p>
        <p>(c) = letter transcribed and checked from a digital scan, photograph or photocopy of the manuscript</p>
        <p>The headnote also notes any previous instances of publication and deals with other relevant issues, such as endorsements, watermarks,
               postmarks, franks, stamps and dating. This edition provides important new information about when many of Southey&#8217;s letters were
               actually written, and re-dates letters that have been misdated or misleadingly dated by previous editors. For example, Southey&#8217;s
               earliest correspondence is here demonstrated to date to late 1791, rather than 1790 as claimed by John Wood Warter. The following
               conventions have been observed in dating individual letters: [...] is used in headnotes to indicate an editorial dating; &#8216;c.&#8217; to
               indicate a dating taken from the postmark or from internal evidence within an individual letter; &#8216;before&#8217; is used either when a letter
               contains an authorial date, but there is evidence within the letter that it was begun before that time, or when an endorsement on the
               letter indicates its date of receipt; &#8216;after&#8217; is used when a letter contains an authorial date, but there is evidence within the letter
               that it was continued after that time; &#8216;?&#8217; is used to indicate a dating about which there remains some uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Detailed information about Southey&#8217;s correspondents, along with other important figures in his letters, can be found in the
               &#8216;Biographies&#8217; section. Each entry in this section also contains a list of letters to and list of letters about the person it deals
               with. People mentioned in the &#8216;Biographies&#8217; section are hyperlinked from the text of individual letters, but are only hyperlinked from
               editorial endnotes when their identity needs further clarification than that supplied by the letter text. Information about where
               Southey lived, locations he was associated with, and the homes of friends he visited is provided in the &#8216;Places&#8217; section of this
               edition and hyperlinked from the texts of individual letters. </p>
        <p>Editorial notes to the text are used to clarify references to persons, books, places, and events within the main body of each
               individual letter. They also identify quotations and provide translations of foreign language material. A &#8216;Chronology&#8217; covers key
               events in Southey&#8217;s life. &#8216;Indices of People and Letters&#8217; organise Southey&#8217;s correspondence by, respectively, the individual to whom a
               letter is addressed and the person or persons mentioned in it. The links in the &#8216;Primary Navigation&#8217; bar, on the left-hand side of the
               page, allow navigation across difference sections of the edition. The &#8216;Search&#8217; facility allows the reader to perform dedicated word or
               phrase searches both across the entire edition (including the editorial apparatus) or within a particular part of it.</p>
        <p>All transcriptions and editorial materials are checked by the editor or editors of that particular part of the edition and by at least
               one other member of the editorial team. After xml encoding and transformation, each Part of edition is proofed online by its editor or
               editors, who also check the index and search engine. The editor, or editors, also ensure any corrections are implemented before the
               text is made publicly available. After publication, any corrections or comments should be directed to Lynda Pratt from whom a copy of
               the current version of the correction file is also available on request.</p>

        <p>This electronic edition was TEI-encoded by Averill Buchanan under the supervision of Laura Mandell and her team at Miami University of
               Ohio, and with the assistance of David Rettenmaier and Mike Quilligan at the University of Maryland. Buchanan used the new Word Macros
               tool developed at Miami University by Holly Connor and Jerry Gannod in order to learn TEI encoding. Mandell transformed the TEI files
               into HTML by using modified versions of the transforms provided by the <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org">TEI</ref>. Dave Rettenmaier
               and Mike Qulligan designed the splash pages, banners, etc., comprising the HTML design. The HTML pages do not use frames but rather
               make extensive use of tables and stylesheets for layout and presentation. The site works best when viewed with Mozilla Firefox v. 3,
               Netscape 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.0, or higher, or a comparable browser; earlier browsers may not display everything properly.</p>
