        <p>Robert Southey was born in Bristol in 1774 and died at his home on the outskirts of Keswick in 1843. The son of a bankrupt
					linen-draper, he was educated at Westminster School and Balliol College, Oxford, which he left without taking a degree. He
					published his first collection of poems in 1795 and in 1813 became Poet Laureate, a post he held until his death. Southey was a
					prolific and influential poet, essayist, historian, travel-writer, biographer, translator and polemicist, a dominant and
					controversial figure in British culture from the mid-1790s through to the mid-1830s. His highly experimental poetry, including the
					Islamic romance <title level="m">Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), paved the way for writers such as Byron, Shelley, Thomas
					Moore and &#8211; later in the nineteenth century &#8211; Browning and Tennyson. His essays, histories and reviews articulated the issues
					confronting a period dominated by nascent imperialism and industrialisation, and his biographies, including the best-selling
						<title level="m">The Life of Nelson</title> (1813), participated in and helped to form a culture increasingly concerned with
					celebrity. Southey was, throughout his career, someone his contemporaries found impossible to ignore. His ambition and ability
					were widely acknowledged, with <title level="m">Madoc</title> (1805) praised as &#8216;the second heroic production in the English
					language&#8217;, the first being <title level="m">Paradise Lost</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Anon., untitled review,
						<title level="j">Imperial Review</title>, 5 (1805), 465&#8211;73; reprinted in <title level="m">Robert Southey: the Critical
							Heritage</title>, ed. Lionel Madden (London, 1972), pp. 104&#8211;105 (p. 105).</note> Yet Southey was also the butt of satire and
					invective, his politics, poetry and prose attacked by opponents as diverse the <title level="j">Anti-Jacobin</title>, Byron,
					Hazlitt and Macaulay. <title level="m">The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</title> makes available for the first time
					complete, annotated, fully-searchable texts of all of the surviving correspondence of this complex individual. In so doing, it
					allows us to look anew at the writer described by Byron as &#8216;the only existing entire man of letters&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Byron, <title level="j">Journal</title>, 22 November 1813; reprinted in Madden, p. 157.</note>

          <hi rend="bold">Southey&#8217;s Letters</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Writing letters was an important part of Southey&#8217;s life. It was an activity that linked the youthful radical leader of the &#8216;New
					School&#8217; with the older conservative Poet Laureate. Between 1791 and 1839 he corresponded with leading figures in cultural,
					political, and religious life in Britain, Europe and North America. About 7000 of his letters are extant, and of these just under
					3000 have never before been published. The surviving manuscripts are dispersed amongst over 200 individual, international
					archives: letters can be found in New York, London, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and Tomsk (Siberia), testimony both to the global
					reach of his correspondence and to Southey as an active participant in cosmopolitan, international cultural exchange. </p>
        <p> The surviving letters written by Southey between 1791 and 1839 are immensely varied. They range from short notes of
					a couple of lines to huge epistles of several thousand words. Several early letters are entirely or largely in verse, whilst
					letters from all periods of his career include transcripts of his poems and other writings. Southey was a talented modern
					linguist: fluent in French, Spanish and Portuguese, and able to read German and Dutch. Most of his surviving letters are in
					English. However, a handful of letters written in French and Portuguese, and the liberal scattering throughout the correspondence
					of foreign languages, are evidence of his internationalism, his involvement in and shaping of a global Romanticism.</p>
        <p> Southey&#8217;s earliest surviving letter dates from 1791, his last from 1839. In 1791 he was sixteen years old, a pupil
					at Westminster School in the heart of London. Southey&#8217;s time at Westminster brought him into contact with boys from radically
					different backgrounds, scions of rich, powerful families. The first letter in this edition provides evidence of the elite circles
					into which school friendships drew the young Southey. It was sent in 1791 to Thomas Phillipps Lamb, the father of a fellow
					Westminster pupil, Thomas Davis Lamb. Written in the aftermath of a vacation visit to the Lambs home in the Sussex town of Rye,
					the letter testifies to both Southey&#8217;s high regard for his hosts and the relative ease with which he was assimilated into a
					wealthy, politically influential, family. It is also evidence of the complexity of his connections. In 1791, Southey was a
					discontented schoolboy, eager to rebel against the established order. In contrast, Thomas Phillipps Lamb, his correspondent, was
					an establishment figure, MP for the town of Rye and supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. </p>
        <p> Southey&#8217;s final extant letter, to be published in Part Eight of this edition, also looks back to his youth &#8211; and to
					the enduring nature of some of his earliest friendships. It was sent on 6 September 1839 to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, younger
					brother of a Baronet and scion of an Anglo-Welsh, Whig political dynasty. Southey and Wynn had been friends since their schooldays
					at Westminster. This final letter is a poignant close to Southey&#8217;s epistolary career. Brief, written in an uncharacteristic,
					poorly-formed hand and accompanied by an apologetic note from his second wife Caroline, it provides eloquent testimony to the
					dementia that made letter writing or letter reading impossible for the final years of Southey&#8217;s life.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey and Caroline Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 6 September 1839&#184; National Library of
						Wales, MS 4813D.</note> Its confusion is shared by other late letters, including one to the poet and civil servant Henry
					Taylor, which part-way through forgets the name and gender of its addressee and concludes with a salutation to Bertha, Southey&#8217;s
						daughter.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Henry Taylor, 27 July 1839&#184; Bodleian Library, Oxford, Eng
						Lett d. 9, fol. 206.</note> No letters survive after late 1839 and by the time he died on 21 March 1843, Southey had long been
					dead to his correspondents.</p>
        <p> The abrupt, tragic closing down of his correspondence in 1839 only throws into sharper relief the vitality and
					diversity of a lifetime of communication. Southey&#8217;s correspondents reflect his eclecticism and internationalism. They included
					family, friends, fellow writers, publishers, review editors, landlords, antiquarians, scientists, politicians, bishops,
					wine-merchants, people he had never met and &#8211; at times to his great irritation &#8211; autograph hunters. He exchanged letters and
					debated crucial issues of the day with prominent, sometimes equally controversial, figures, including: William Wilberforce, Thomas
					Clarkson, Humphry Davy, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, William Taylor, Percy Shelley, Walter Savage Landor, John
					Rickman, George Ticknor, Walter Scott, James Montgomery, Robert Bloomfield, Bernard Barton, Sir Robert Peel and the factory
					reformer Lord Shaftesbury. An active admirer of Mary Wollstonecraft and promoter of female literary endeavours, Southey
					corresponded with many women writers, including Caroline Bowles (who became his second wife), Anna Seward, Anna Eliza Bray,
					Margaret Holford Hodson, Maria Gowan Brooks, Mary Anne Watts Hughes, Amelia Opie, Mary Hays, and, most notoriously, Charlotte
					Bront&#235;. Southey was a busy man, and the wide range of men and women he found the time to write to indicates what might be
					described as the promiscuous nature of his correspondence &#8211; his ability to write a letter to virtually anyone and everyone, on
					virtually every subject. It is also compelling evidence of the diversity of Romantic period letter-writing. </p>
        <p> Southey wrote to individuals from very different walks of life and unsurprisingly the subject matter of his letters
					is extremely varied. It covers his domestic and professional lives, local matters and international affairs. It includes
					complaints about a difficult younger brother, tough financial negotiations with a publisher, regional events in Bristol or
					Keswick, and details of atrocities committed in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War. The letters give us access to the
					whole gamut of Southey&#8217;s experience, as we see him live through and respond to years of domestic, local, national and
					international upheaval. Here, for example, is Southey writing in December 1831 on the dangers to national well-being of a cholera
					epidemic:</p>
        <quote>What I look to with most apprehension is the moral effect that this pestilence may produce when it gets to such places as
					Carlisle, - still more in Manchester &amp; <hi rend="strikethrough">other such</hi> wherever there are such tremendous assemblages
					of human creatures in the most loathsome &lt;&amp; pitiable&gt; condition both as to their state of body &amp; of mind. It will
					spread far more rapidly among them, than it has done at Sunderland; &amp; in former visitations of pestilence &#8211; we know<del>
						xx</del> that the populace, seeing death before their eyes, &amp; by that present fear emancipated from all fear of human
					laws, have broken loose, set about plundering, &amp; taken their full swing in excesses of every kind.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Margaret Holford Hodson, 23 December 1831, Huntington Library, HM 2895.</note>
        </quote>
        <p>We see here the moralist and polemicist, the preacher against the evils of modernity and the sickness spread by industrialisation,
					urbanisation and democracy, a Southey familiar to the readers of both his <title level="m">Colloquies</title> and his essays in
					the <title level="j">Quarterly Review</title>. This is the man condemned by Macaulay as possessing in extraordinary measure &#8216;the
					faculty of believing without a reason, and the faculty of hating without a provocation.&#8217;<note place="foot" resp="editors">Review of <title level="m">Sir Thomas More; or Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829), in <title level="j">Edinburgh Review</title>, 50 (January 1830), 528.</note> Yet Southey is, as David Simpson has recently observed, fundamentally more &#8216;elusive&#8217; and less given to
					&#8216;wholeness&#8217; than his peers.<note place="foot" resp="editors">David Simpson, &#8216;Locating Southey&#8217;, <title level="j">Eighteenth-Century Studies</title>, 41.4 (2008), 566.</note> The stern moraliser is just one side of a complex character.
					Other letters disclose a playful friend or fond, anxious parent. Here is Southey writing in 1803 about his delight in his first
					child, born after nearly seven years of marriage:</p>
        <quote>Margaret in spite of a snub snout is grown out of her ugliness. &amp; has as good a face as one could wish for a child of 7
					months. take my last poems upon her. N.B. I call them all Effusions of a Father. </quote>
        <quote rend="indent3"> D.D. stands for Daughter Drivel</quote>
        <quote rend="indent4"> M.S. for Margaret Snivel.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 3
						April 1803; see Part 1, Letter 770.</note>
        </quote>
        <p>And here, is his anguished response, only some 4 months later, to Margaret&#8217;s death from hydrocephalus:</p>
        <quote>all is over &amp; poor Margaret in heaven ... I have forced myself to great &amp; unremitting exertions but the blow has gone
					to my very heart, &amp; made me often think those the happiest who have none but themselves to care for.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Thomas Southey, 29 August [1803]; see Part 2, Letter 832.</note>
        </quote>
        <p>Margaret&#8217;s death was a milestone. Southey and his wife immediately left their house in Bristol for Greta Hall, Keswick, then
					occupied by Edith&#8217;s sister Sara, her husband Samuel Taylor Coleridge and their three children. It was to become the Southeys&#8217; home
					for the remainder of their lives. In exchanging Bristol for the Lakes, Southey left behind the city in which he had been born and
					spent much of his first three decades, a city which by 1803 had become a spectral place, haunted by the ghosts of a dead daughter,
					mother, cousin and father, and by the monitory shade of Thomas Chatterton, summoned up by the teenaged Southey in &#8216;Bristol
					Church-Yard&#8217;, one of his earliest surviving poems.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bodleian Library, Oxford, MS Eng. Poet.
						e. 10.</note> In heading for the Lake District, Southey also left the city and the wider geographical region which had been at
					the very centre of his literary life, both as subject and as professional hub for his dealings with other writers, publishers,
					printers and booksellers. He literally put himself on the road to being tagged by his contemporaries as a member of the &#8216;Lake&#8217;
					school.</p>
        <p> Southey&#8217;s correspondence brings him into sharper focus. It charts his reading, maps his changing views on politics
					and society, and describes his activities as a professional man of letters, including drafts of poems and prose works. The letters
					published here contain important evidence of the labour involved in writing. They remind us that extensive planning, research and
					writing lay behind many of Southey&#8217;s published works and contain ideas for ambitious projects (such as a tragedy on the martyrdom
					of Joan of Arc, poems on all the major world religions and multi-volume history of Portugal) that never materialised. As his
					&#8216;cholera&#8217; letter of 1831 reveals, in his private and public lives, Southey rarely pulled his punches. The letters contain violent
					denunciations of opponents, including Byron and Hazlitt, and a disturbingly detailed description of Shelley&#8217;s corpse, washed
					ashore in Italy. It was, Southey noted, &#8216;much mutilated ... [t]he fish had half devoured it&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Bernard Barton, 26 November 1822, Kenneth Curry (ed.), <title level="m">New Letters of Robert
							Southey</title>, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), II, p. 240. [Hereafter <title level="m">New Letters</title>.]</note>

        <p>
          <hi rend="bold">Southey as a Letter Writer</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Southey&#8217;s peripatetic early life ensured that he did not establish regular habits of letter writing. He seems to have adapted the
					composition of letters to suit his circumstances, writing both in solitude and in company and, on occasions, jointly composing a
					letter with a family member or friend. This irregularity did not last. After his move to Keswick in 1803, letter writing became a
					more regularised, solitary occupation, pursued in Southey&#8217;s study at Greta Hall. Yet the impossibility of entirely separating his
					correspondence from the rest of the household is witnessed by the traces left, on the manuscripts that survive, by other people
					and other aspects of his life. These include playful deletions or insertions in the hand of his first wife Edith; and even the
					paw-prints of a kitten walking over a letter before the ink had dried. Southey was, fortunately for the kitten, very fond of cats,
					in a letter of 1801 decrying the nefarious conduct of a &#8216;Cat eater&#8217;, a man who had recently devoured &#8216;a large Tom Cat alive&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, [29 September 1801]; see Part 2, Letter 609.</note>

        <quote> ... generally speaking, he closed his <hi rend="ital">literary</hi> toils at dinner [&#8216;about half after five or six&#8217;]; the
					whole of the hours after that meal being dedicated to his correspondence ... At that period, the post ... reached Keswick about
					six or seven in the evening. And so pointedly regular was Southey in all his habits, that, short as the time was, all letters were
					answered on the same evening which brought them.<note place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Lake Reminiscences, from 1807 to 1830. By the English

        <p>The manuscripts of his letters bear inevitable traces of these evening sessions: those from the 1820s and 1830s are often written
					in a cramped hand and stained by wax or tallow from dripping candles. </p>
        <p> In spite of the pressure of time, Southey took great pains over what was an important channel of communication with
					friends, family and professional associates. This was a quality recognised by Thackeray, who praised the &#8216;goodness and purity&#8217; of
					Southey&#8217;s &#8216;private letters&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;The Four Georges. Sketches of Manners, Morals, Court, and Town Life.  IV.

					epistolary culture and that for him letter writing had private and public, domestic and professional dimensions. His letters could
					be private documents, sent to friends and family and intended to be read by the recipient and perhaps a close family circle. Yet
					they could also be public texts, available for wider consumption. From the outset of his career, Southey was keen to &#8216;correspond
					with the world&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Horace Walpole Bedford, 12 June 1796, see Part 1, Letter
						160.</note> He wrote to newspapers and periodicals, sometimes, though not always, adopting a pseudonym, and commenting on
					politics and culture. His signed newspaper letters could spark public controversy. In 1799, for example, he became entangled in a

					even more formidable opponent, Byron, in the pages of <title level="j">The Courier</title>. His advice to Byron &#8216;When he attacks

        </p>
        <p> For Southey, though, the public letter was not just restricted to ephemeral publications such as periodicals and
					newspapers. His first published prose work, <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and
						Portugal</title> (1797), exploited the public, literary potential of correspondence. It made use of letters Southey had
					written to friends during his time in the Iberian peninsula, blurring the boundaries between private and public
						correspondence.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example, compare Robert Southey to Joseph Cottle, [February-March
						1796?], Part 1, Letter 148, with Robert Southey, <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and

          <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence</title> went into two revised editions, in 1799 and 1808, though
					Southey&#8217;s plan to write a sequel based on his second visit to Portugal in 1800-1801 came to nothing. In 1807 he returned to the
					epistolary travel book in a slightly different guise, publishing <title level="m">Letters from England</title> under the pseudonym
					of Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. <title level="m">Letters from England</title>, which tapped into literary fashion, and into a
					culture keen to consume correspondence, was one of Southey&#8217;s best-selling publications.</p>
        <p> As he grew older, Southey&#8217;s sense of his own letters, including those intended only for private consumption, as
					potentially public documents and as an integral part of his legacy to posterity increased. It was a complex realisation. It could
					provide him with the &#8211; somewhat self-righteous &#8211; solace that his political and cultural judgements would be vindicated in the long
					term. As Southey explained to Caroline Bowles, his correspondence with Shelley would, when published, expose Byron and his
					biographer Thomas Medwin as &#8216;impudent&#8217; liars.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Caroline Bowles, 26
						November 1824, Edward Dowden (ed.), <title level="m">The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin
						and London, 1881), p. 75. [Hereafter Dowden.]</note> Yet his letters, especially their potential for manipulation by the
					unscrupulous, could also be a cause of anxiety.</p>
        <p> Southey was well aware of his contemporaries&#8217; fascination with the lives of others, acknowledging that anyone who
					wanted to keep their private life private was fighting a losing battle and that &#8216;in these days nothing can be kept from the joint
					demands of cupidity and curiosity&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Joseph Cottle, 30 September 1836,
							<title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, p. 457.</note> Yet his own relationship to this culture of consumption was
					deeply ambiguous. He was, after all, both a &#8216;personality&#8217; and an editor of the correspondence of others. In particular, his work
					on a biography and edition of William Cowper, brought him face to face with how a writer&#8217;s correspondence could be manipulated.
					Southey was proud that his life of Cowper had made extensive use of the poet&#8217;s &#8216;unpublished letters&#8217; and in so doing &#8216;brought much
					to life which Hayley was not allowed to make known, and of which none of his biographers knew any thing&#8217;. He not merely published
					new information about Cowper, he also reinstated passages in individual letters that had &#8216;formerly been withheld&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to William Peachey, 16 May 1836, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, p. 454.
						Not all of Southey&#8217;s contemporaries agreed with his treatment of Cowper. An anonymous reviewer in <title level="j">The
							Christian Observer</title>, 429 (1837), p. 610 described his &#8216;detailed account of Cowper&#8217;s attempted suicide&#8217; as
						&#8216;revolting&#8217; and accused Southey of lacking &#8216;good taste and right feeling&#8217; and &#8216;thinking of little but of literature and
						entertainment&#8217;.</note> Yet any sense of him as a modern scholarly editor needs to be tempered with the realisation that
					Southey believed not everything in a writer&#8217;s life could be revealed &#8211; that some information needed to be suppressed and that
					editorial intervention was necessary. In the case of Cowper, this included correspondence relating to the poet&#8217;s belief that he
					was an androgyne.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 6 November 1835, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, pp. 430&#8211;431.</note>
        </p>
        <p> Southey lived long enough to be in the potentially uncomfortable position of having both his own private letters
					and letters written to or about him appear in print during his own lifetime. In the 1830s, his concerns surfaced over the handling
					of the correspondence and literary remains of Coleridge, who had died in 1834. Southey knew that Coleridge had frequently attacked
					him in letters, both to himself and to others. The possible publication of Coleridge&#8217;s correspondence was therefore of
					considerable concern to him. He cautioned Coleridgean memoirists such as Joseph Cottle against publishing all they knew and also
					kept in reserve copies of Coleridge&#8217;s letters and his own to use &#8216;for my own vindication&#8217; if the need arose.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Joseph Cottle, 26 February 1836, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, pp.

						1834-1837&#8217;, <title level="j">Modern Language Review</title>, 98 (2003), 545-562.</note> His ultimate powerlessness in the case
					of Coleridge was reflected in the treatment meted out to other Southeyan correspondences. In 1838 Robert and Samuel Wilberforce
					published a life of their father, which contained tactlessly edited versions of Southey&#8217;s letters to the abolitionist.<note place="foot" resp="editors">R.I. Wilberforce and S. Wilberforce, <title level="m">The Life of William Wilberforce</title>
						(London, 1838).</note> The Poet Laureate was not amused. As he explained to Henry Crabb Robinson:</p>
        <quote> So little consideration is shewn in publications of this kind, that no one knows what mischief may arise from trusting any
					letters out of his own keeping. The Wilberforces have printed an extract from a letter of mine to their father in which the last
					Vicar of this place is spoken of in terms of great disparagement. His daughters are our next door neighbours, and we are of
					necessity and of good will also upon neighbourly terms with them. Now they will be very much wounded if they happen to see this
					book, which but for this circumstance, I should as a matter of course have lent them &#8211; yet it is hardly possible that they should
					not see it. And tho I have said nothing but what was perfectly true, they will be very much wounded, and I am as much annoyed as I
					can allow myself to be by any thing in which I do not feel myself to blame.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey
						to Henry Crabb Robinson, 17 June 1838, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, pp. 475-476.</note>
        </quote>
        <p>As his reaction to the Wilberforces&#8217; book reveals, by the late 1830s, Southey was aware that it was impossible to control the
					public&#8217;s appetite for consuming his life and letters. He resolved to manage his own posterity. In the case of his poems, Southey
					took charge , &#8216;setting ... [his literary] house in order&#8217; and publishing a ten-volume collected edition.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Mrs Septimus Hodson, 1 March 1837, <title level="m">New Letters</title>, II, p. 466.</note>
					His letters presented a different dilemma. The future editing and publication of his massive correspondence was entrusted to a
					friend and disciple, the poet and civil servant Henry Taylor, whom Southey named as his literary executor and official biographer.
					The intention was that Taylor would supervise the construction of Southey&#8217;s posthumous reputation, collecting letters and
					recollections from family and friends and writing an authorized life. However, all this careful planning came to nothing. On 4
					June 1839 Southey married Caroline Bowles. Shortly afterwards, his health, which had been declining for some time, completely
					collapsed. As a result, a train of events was set in motion that ruined these well-laid plans, wrecking Southey&#8217;s attempts to
					manage his posterity.</p>

          <hi rend="bold">About earlier editions</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Southey&#8217;s union with Bowles proved to be extremely controversial, splitting his children and friends into bitterly opposed
					factions. Hostilities did not cease with the Poet Laureate&#8217;s death on 21 March 1843. In the period immediately following, the
					feuding between the pro- and anti-Bowles camps intensified to an extent that Henry Taylor&#8217;s position soon became untenable. Having
					tried and failed to get cooperation from the warring factions, Taylor resigned his post. With his departure went any plans for an
					official life of the late Poet Laureate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For the impact of family feuding on Southey&#8217;s

						219-238.</note> The result was textual chaos: competing editions of poetry, prose and correspondence produced by family
					members who were often not on speaking terms with one another. The poetical remains were divided between Southey&#8217;s son-in-law
					Herbert Hill and widow. In 1845 Hill published an edition of the unfinished North American tale <title level="m">Oliver Newman and
						Other Poems</title>, which pointedly failed to mention the second Mrs Southey. Caroline Bowles responded with <title level="m">Robin Hood: A Fragment</title> (1847), emphasising her &#8216;intellectual union&#8217; with the late Poet Laureate.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline Southey and Robert Southey, <title level="m">Robin Hood: A Fragment</title> (London,
						1847), p. viii.</note> The mammoth task of collecting, selecting and publishing the surviving letters split along similarly
					factional lines: divided between John Wood Warter, Southey&#8217;s son-in-law and Bowles&#8217;s chief supporter, and Cuthbert Southey, the
					Poet Laureate&#8217;s only surviving son and bastion of the anti-Bowles faction.</p>
        <p> In 1849-1850, Cuthbert published a six volume <title level="m">Life and Correspondence</title> of his father,
					linking selections from Southey&#8217;s letters with a biographical commentary. It is a highly problematic edition. Cuthbert not only
					misdated many letters, but in order to sanitise what he believed to be the less palatable aspects of his father&#8217;s career and
					opinions, he, as was customary practice at the time, censored his source materials. His silent deletions covered Southey&#8217;s private
					and public lives, his views on politics and on literature. For example, he passed over Southey&#8217;s marriage to Bowles, whom Cuthbert
					loathed, and removed personal observations about friends and family, including incautious comments on the &#8216;crazy humours&#8217; of
					Charles Lamb and a description of Wordworth&#8217;s letter to Mathetes as &#8216;a ... {mouthful} of moonshine&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to John Rickman, 17-21 January 1810; see Part 4, Letter 1734.</note> He also
					silently removed passages indicative of political extremism, censoring both Southey&#8217;s earlier radicalism and his later unguarded
					comments against the freedom of the press. A letter to John Rickman of 11 February 1806 was published by Cuthbert without its
					opening paragraph, describing Southey&#8217;s response to the death in office of the Prime Minister and the proposal to erect a public
					monument to him:</p>
        <quote>If it had pleased God to send William Pitt to the Devil in the year 1790 &#8211; but better late than never. And so the wise people
					of England are going to record their own infatuation upon marble &#8211; as if paper &amp; printers-ink would not sufficiently preserve
					the memory of it to posterity!<note place="foot" resp="editors">See Part 3, Letter 1155.</note>
        </quote>
        <p>Cuthbert similarly glossed over cultural politics, omitting a description of the &#8216;lyer&#8217; Byron and his sharking biographer Thomas
					Medwin from a letter of 1824: &#8216;In his Lordship there were the motives of envy, hatred &amp; malice at work. Evil passions
					possessed him. But this fellow [ie. Medwin] has no other impulse than the desire of gain&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to John Rickman, 9 November 1824, Huntington Library, HM RS 454.</note>
        </p>
        <p> Cuthbert&#8217;s edition is partial in other ways. Circumscribed by the family feud, he had access only to a fraction of
					the voluminous surviving correspondence, and could see only the letters sent to individuals who were on his side of the dispute.
					This meant that whilst he was able to call on letters sent to John Rickman, Sharon Turner, Walter Scott, Coleridge, Wordsworth,
					and the family of Henry Kirke White, he could not use those to other important figures in Southey&#8217;s life and career such as
					Charles Danvers, John King, Mary Barker and Anna Eliza Bray. The result was an incomplete sense of the range of Southey&#8217;s contacts
					&#8211; the sense of a part rather than a whole life.</p>
        <p> The same problem also affected a second, rival edition: John Wood Warter&#8217;s four-volume <title level="m">Selections
						from the Letters of Robert Southey</title>, published in 1856. Warter was able to draw upon some of the major correspondences
					that Cuthbert had been refused access to, including those with Danvers and Mary Barker. Warter&#8217;s edition did not overlap with
					Cuthbert&#8217;s, rather it set out to be different: providing a completely new selection of Southey letters, minus any of Cuthbert&#8217;s
					biographical interpolations. By the time he came to work on the <title level="m">Selections</title>, Warter was, in fact, an old
					hand at editing Southey, having produced editions in 1847 of the final two volumes of <title level="m">The Doctor</title> and in
					1849-1850 of the <title level="m">Common-Place Books</title>. His experience showed. His text is, as a rule, more accurate and
					reliable than Cuthbert&#8217;s. However, this does not mean that he reproduced everything he saw on the manuscript page. Even Warter was
					capable of editorial intervention and he made countless minor, cosmetic changes to Southey&#8217;s prose, altering punctuation and word
					order at will. More seriously, he occasionally - and silently - removed passages from letters. Most of his omissions were
					connected to family matters, or to persons still living. A letter of 25 October 1834 was published without a section describing
					the mental health of Southey&#8217;s first wife, Edith, then confined in The Retreat at York:</p>
        <quote>The accounts from York are hopeful. But a considerable time must elapse before bodily functions which have been very long
					deranged can be set right by any curative treatment. <hi rend="strikethrough">xxx</hi> such treatment being necessarily slow in
					producing any perceptible effect.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to John Rickman, 25 October 1834,
						Huntington Library, HM RS 674.</note>
        </quote>
        <p>The omission was not surprising, given that Warter was married to Edith&#8217;s eldest daughter. Nevertheless, it undermined the textual
					integrity of Southey&#8217;s original letter.</p>
        <p> Warter was a vocal and capable supporter of Caroline Bowles. He inherited her papers after her death in 1854 and
					his commitment to her reputation was such that he planned to edit a selection of the correspondence exchanged by her and
						Southey.<note place="foot" resp="editors">John Wood Warter (ed.), <title level="m">Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</title>, 4 vols (London, 1856), I, p. [v].</note> He died before this could be completed, and the project was taken up by
					Edward Dowden, author of the biography of Southey in the &#8216;English Men of Letters&#8217; series. In 1881 Dowden published a selected
					edition of <title level="m">The Correspondence of Robert Southey and Caroline Anne Bowles</title>, some 199 letters exchanged
					between April 1818 and January 1838. A further five letters between Southey and Shelley were included in an Appendix. Dowden&#8217;s
					edition is unique, as the only attempt so far to see a Southeyan correspondence in the round by publishing both sides. It also
					made a case for Bowles&#8217;s own writing as &#8216;worthy of remembrance&#8217; and for the importance to Southey of their creative exchange.
						<note place="foot" resp="editors">Dowden, p. xiii.</note> Dowden was, though, highly selective. He included about
					&#8216;half&#8217; of the surviving letters and displayed sensitivity to surviving participants in the family feud by excluding entirely any
					letters exchanged during the controversial period of Southey and Bowles&#8217;s courtship and engagement. It was not that he had no
					letters to select from &#8211; evidence of the letters Southey wrote to Bowles during this key period in their relationship can be found
					in an account sent by Bowles to Anna Eliza Bray &#8211; but rather that he chose not to include any.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles&#8217; account survives only as a copy in another hand, West Sussex Record Office, Bray Papers, Box 3, &#8216;Copy

        </p>
        <p> The publication of Southey&#8217;s correspondence was not limited to the editions of Cuthbert, Warter or Dowden. From the
					mid-nineteenth century onwards, individual or groups of Southey letters appeared on a fairly regular basis, scattered amongst
					autobiographies, biographies, memoirs and accounts of his contemporaries, including Charlotte Bront&#235;, Anna Eliza Bray, Humphry
					Davy, Charles Lloyd, James Montgomery, Henry Taylor, William Taylor and Alaric Watts. Letters, or fragments of letters, also found
					their way into the footnotes of editions of the letters of Coleridge.<note place="foot" resp="editors">For example,

        </p>
        <p> This dispersal of the published correspondence continued into the twentieth century. The importance of the letters
					of Southey&#8217;s direct contemporaries Coleridge and Wordsworth was recognised and enshrined with the appearance of major scholarly
					editions. There was, however, no attempt to do the same for Southey and to publish all his correspondence in one place. This does
					not mean that the letters were neglected entirely, rather that Southey&#8217;s liminal position in the twentieth century Romantic canon
					was seen not as justifying a collected edition. Instead, letters continued to appear in scattered publications. In 1960 Adolfo
					Cabral included 63 letters in his edition of Southey&#8217;s <title level="m">Journals of a Residence in Portugal 1800-1801 and a Visit
						to France 1838</title>. Only 22 of these had previously been unpublished, the remaining 41 were reprinted directly from the
					problematic editions of Cuthbert Southey and Warter. A more substantial attempt to fill in the blanks left by unpublished or
					bowdlerised letters was made in 1965, when Kenneth Curry published a two-volume <title level="m">New Letters of Robert
						Southey</title>. This comprised 497 letters covering Southey&#8217;s entire writing life &#8211; beginning in 1792 and ending in 1838. It
					included both letters published for the first time and complete versions of ones previously censored by interventionist editors
					such as Joseph Cottle or Cuthbert Southey. Curry, the leading Southey scholar of the mid-twentieth century, also stated the case
					for the centrality of the correspondence for an understanding of the man and his writing, arguing &#8216;it is there that [one] will
					find the whole range of Southey&#8217;s life and career&#8217;.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title level="m">New Letters</title>, I, p. [xi].</note> Another new edition followed in 1976, when Charles Ramos edited a
					group of 170 letters sent by Southey to his friend John May. Both Curry and Ramos&#8217;s editions added to knowledge of Southey, but
					they were also both highly selective. Ramos used only the collection of letters from Southey to May held in the University of
					Texas, Austin, and not the parts of their correspondence scattered in other archives throughout the world. Curry, meanwhile,
					admitted that at least 2000 Southey letters still remained unpublished and that several hundreds more were available only in
					unreliable texts. <note place="foot" resp="editors">Kenneth Curry, &#8216;The Published Letters of Robert Southey: A Checklist&#8217;,

					undoubtedly dictated by Southey&#8217;s non-canonical status and it continued for the remainder of the twentieth century. In the three
					decades since the publication of Ramos, further letters have appeared in isolated journal articles, including essays by Lynda

        <p> In the past decade Southey&#8217;s reputation has been revolutionised. His centrality to a complex, international Romantic period
					culture has been recognised by critics including Marilyn Butler, Nigel Leask, Nicholas Roe, David Simpson, Dan White, Tim Fulford,
					Carol Bolton and Lynda Pratt.<note place="foot" resp="editors">Marilyn Butler, &#8216;Repossessing the Past: The Case for an Open
						Literary History&#8217;, in <title level="m">Rethinking Historicism: Critical Readings in Romantic History</title>, eds. Marjorie
						Levinson et al (Oxford, 1989), pp. 64-84; Nigel Leask, <title level="m">British Romantic Writers and the East: Anxieties of Empire</title> (1992);

							Native Americans, British Literature, and Transatlantic Culture 1756-1830</title> (2006); Carol Bolton, <title level="m">Writing the Empire: Robert Southey and Romantic Colonialism</title> (2007); Lynda Pratt (ed.), <title level="m">Robert
							Southey and the Contexts of English Romanticism</title> (2007).</note> Alongside the stirrings of this Southeyan critical
					renaissance has come the acknowledgement of the need for scholarly editions of Southey&#8217;s poetry, prose and correspondence. Those
					editions are now being produced and it is becoming once more possible to read him. The nine-volume <title level="m">Poetical
						Works</title> is helping to revolutionise understanding of Southey the poet.<note place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title level="m">Robert Southey: Poetical Works, 1793-1810</title>, gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols
						(London, 2004); and Robert Southey <title level="m">Later Poetical Works, 1811-1838</title>, gen. eds Tim Fulford
						and Lynda Pratt, 4 vols (London, 2012).</note> We hope that the <title level="m">Collected Letters</title>
					will do the same for the correspondence. The letters published here restore wholeness to this most fragmented of Romantic period
					writers, providing accurate texts of letters that were previously unpublished or available only in censored versions. Taken
					individually and as a whole, the letters reveal a more complete picture of Southey&#8217;s life, literary relationships, opinions on
					politics and society and development as a writer. Southey emerges from his correspondence as a consummate &#8211; even an &#8216;entire&#8217; &#8211; man
					of letters, intimately involved in the culture of his time. <title level="m">The Collected Letters</title> therefore both
					contributes to what can be called the new Southey criticism and provides the primary material by which future scholars can take
					that criticism in important fresh directions. </p>
