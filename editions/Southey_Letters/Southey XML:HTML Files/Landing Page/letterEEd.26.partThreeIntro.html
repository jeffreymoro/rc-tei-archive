            </header>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Introduction</span> by Tim Fulford and Carol Bolton</p>
            <p>Part Three is the first-ever collected edition of the surviving letters written by
               Southey between 1804 and 1809. The letters published here begin with Southey writing
               to his brother with a draft of his epic poem <em>Madoc</em>; they end on New Year’s Eve 1809, with him discussing Coleridge’s <em>The Friend</em> and his own new writing in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (published in 1810). Part Three follows the editorial conventions described in ‘About
               this Edition’ and publishes newly transcribed, fully annotated texts, bringing together
               in one place correspondence scattered between archives in North and South America
               and the United Kingdom. It comprises 850 letters, many of which are published for
               the first time or published in full for the first time.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The letters in Part Three were sent to over 50 very diverse individuals including
               friends from childhood and school (Charles Danvers, Grosvenor Charles Bedford and
               Charles Watkin Williams Wynn), from university (Nicholas Lightfoot), from radical
               youth (Samuel Taylor Coleridge) and from professional life (Joseph Cottle and Daniel
               Stuart). The years 1804–1809 saw the consolidation of important relationships and
               correspondences, notably with the statistician John Rickman, the translator William
               Taylor, and the writer Mary Barker. New correspondences of lasting significance were
               begun: with Neville White, brother of Henry Kirke White, leading to Southey’s editing
               of Henry’s <em>Remains</em>; with Matilda Betham, who would paint Southey’s and his family’s portraits in London
               and Keswick; with Anna Seward, who would support his poetry in the press and to whom
               he would make an hilarious visit; with Walter Savage Landor, whose enthusiasm for
               his poetry inspired him to return to writing verse in <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> and <em>Roderick Last of the Goths</em> (1814); with Walter Scott, whose good offices led Southey to a new career writing
               for the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em>, and to the Laureateship.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Writing for the journals produced much official correspondence: Part Three shows the
               beginnings of Southey’s relationships with his editor William Gifford, and his publishers
               John Murray and James Ballantyne. It also reveals him as an advisor of other writers:
               his reputation, if not his remuneration, was beginning to burgeon and he found himself
               sought out for advice by budding poets. Letters to Ebenezer Elliott show Southey’s
               pragmatic support of a young writer in whom he recognised talent. </p>
            <p class="indent1">The six years covered by Part Three were a time of gradual settlement into a way of
               life and a home. In the beginning of 1804 Southey was newly resident at Greta Hall,
               Keswick, which Coleridge had just left. By the end of 1809 he was an established family
               man there, with three children and many friendships – including the anti-slavery campaigner
               Thomas Clarkson, his old acolyte Charles Lloyd (in Ambleside), the landowner Humphrey
               Senhouse and Wordsworth, whose poetry he came to value very highly, even while bemused
               by his personal vanity. But it was not until 1807 that he had ceased hankering to
               move south – perhaps to Bristol or Bath, or to Portugal – and accepted that the Lake
               District would remain his home. By then he had established a pattern of intense literary
               work during the winter months, and fellwalking and boating in the summer. Visits to
               friends in London and Bristol punctuated the ‘bookmaking’ routine biennially. Constantly
               short of money in these years, and having to provide for Coleridge’s family and for
               Robert Lovell’s widow, child and mother, Southey drove his pen with unending determination.
               Each day was divided: verse writing came before breakfast because it paid too little
               to be done during the day, which was devoted to more lucrative work – writing reviews,
               translating medieval chronicles and romances, compiling anthologies, editing literary
               remains and labouring on his large-scale histories of Portugal and Brazil. After a
               break for dinner, letters were written in the evening, and were vital links to the
               world of literary gossip and publishing opportunities in London and Edinburgh. Southey
               used them to propose new literary schemes and to forge alliances; he also depended
               on them to maintain friendships that sustained him financially: both John May and
               Wynn loaned and gave him much needed money. With sales of his poems meagre, and rates
               for reviewing in London journals low, it was only when the opportunities to write
               for the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and <em>Edinburgh Annual Register</em> arose that financial security seemed possible.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s output in these years was phenomenal: two epic poems, two translations of
               medieval books, an anthology, two travel narratives, an edition of another writer’s
               works, the first volume of a major history, new revised editions of his poems, and
               over a hundred reviews and articles. He sent these works in manuscript through the
               post, availing himself of Wynn’s and Rickman’s parliamentary privileges to frank mail
               gratis. With these friends, he discussed his changing political views: by 1809 the
               once Jacobinical, pro-French Revolution radical was arguing that no peace with France
               was possible until Napoleon was overthrown. His pro-war politics were defined by his
               sympathy for the people of Portugal and Spain, where he had twice lived, in their
               struggle to liberate themselves from French imperial rule. It led him to despise the
               Whigs who argued for peace and to refuse to write for their main journal – the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>. Yet at the same time the ministry’s toadying to the corrupt princes and pusillanimity
               over sending soldiers to fight in Europe left him disgusted at the Tories: in 1808
               he was alienated from all parties and declared that either a reform must happen, or
               revolution would occur. Given this revulsion at political infighting and corruption,
               it is bewildering to see him accepting a pension from the government in 1807, and
               in 1809 requesting Tory power-brokers, whose influence he had formerly resented, to
               gain him a sinecure. Poverty was a motive, as was a desire for recognition that remained
               unfulfilled when his books were badly reviewed, but Southey believed, inexplicably,
               that his independence would not be compromised. Gradually however, it was compromised:
               although in late 1808 he wrote to several friends declaring that he would stop writing
               for the <em>Quarterly</em> if it toed the government line, he remained a contributor even when the editor cut
               his trenchant criticisms of church and state from his contributions. Reporting plaintively
               to friends the hand-writing of excised passages back into the margins of his own copies
               of the journal was his limited response to these editorial interventions.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Journalism changed Southey in the years 1804–1809; it did not, however, define him.
               Encouraged by Landor, he returned to epic poetry; inspired by his uncle, he took on
               himself the mantle of historian of Portugal and Brazil, perceiving his poems and histories
               as great works on which posterity would judge him. Journalism compromised his independence,
               but it supported him and his families, allowing him to pursue the higher callings
               of poet and historian. If this was a sometimes uneasy and divided conception of himself
               as a writer, it motivated him to pursue these callings with great thoroughness. The
               <em>History of Brazil</em> emerged from meticulous research in Spanish, Portuguese and Latin sources, carried
               on assiduously from 1806 onwards – and bringing books galore to Greta Hall by mail
               coach, ship and wagon. The correspondence of these years reveals Southey as a bibliophile
               in the making, assembling a fine collection of rare books and manuscripts on Iberia
               and its colonies; books he read thoroughly but also loved as objects.</p>
            <p class="indent1">By 1809, established in his study with its commanding view of Borrowdale, Derwentwater
               and the Newlands valley, surrounded by his library, harnessed to his multiple literary
               endeavours, supported by the families for whom he provided, he was a man at the centre
               of a world of his own making. If it seemed marginal to outsiders – a remote country
               retreat – to him it was a place of strength from which, by dint of his correspondence,
               his immense industry could influence both the present and the future. The coming years,
               in which his reputation reached its peak, would prove him at least partially right.
               They would see him develop influential networks of communication, as his reputation
               as a poet and journalist made him a public figure. Aspiring young authors (Elliott
               and Kirke White) depended on his advice and support, and experienced literary figures
               (Scott, Richard Duppa and Taylor) respected his archival knowledge, his expertise
               on Hispanic literature, and his ambitious works of historiography. At the hub of his
               literary operations in Keswick, and through an ever-growing network of correspondence,
               Southey was never cut off from the wider world around him. Yet the peace and stability
               of his home enabled his productive engagement in many literary forms and subjects
               of interest. The letters he wrote during the early years of the nineteenth-century
               see him forging relationships with politicians, social reformers, writers and publishers.
               His opinions on colonial ventures, the social problems created by industrialisation,
               events in the war with France, were just some of the topics that he tested his ideas
               on privately in his correspondence, and expanded on publicly, in books and review
               articles. </p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s networking abilities have had consequences for the modern period in more
               ways than through his own publication of poems, histories and biographies. Tracing
               the transfer of information from private letters to the public sphere reveals unexpected
               consequences. For instance, Southey was persistent in seeking information on the West
               Indian plantocracy from his sailor brother, which frequently appeared in his review
               articles. The material Thomas gleaned from his Caribbean voyages became the subject
               of a book by him that was eventually seen through the press by Southey in 1827. Another
               enthusiasm that is mentioned frequently in the correspondence during these years is
               medieval romance. The publication of <em>Amadis of Gaul</em> (1803) corrected the historical records in asserting that the source for this work
               was Portuguese, and he disseminated this belief in his letters to fellow authors and
               the pages of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>. It was his reputation in this field that led to the discovery through one of his
               correspondents of a previously unlocated, fifteenth-century metrical manuscript. Purchased
               through his connections with Scott, this is now housed in the archives of the National
               Library of Scotland.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Reading the letters, the only medium of communication available to Southey and his
               contemporaries, reinforces our understanding of the processes by which knowledge circulated
               in the Romantic period. It also reveals the increasing influence of middle-class morality
               as he became more settled in his profession, and reflects the values of like-minded
               members of his circle. Commenting on topical issues, Southey’s letters report his
               strong feelings on Catholic reform, and the mutual disgust of many at the corrupt
               practices of notable figures such as Lord Melville and the Duke of York. They also
               remind us of how events that had national consequences were viewed outside the centres
               of power in Westminster. The speed at which such information is communicated and commented
               on in Southey’s correspondence, belies assumptions that those in the provinces were
               isolated from the metropolis, or that geographical remoteness inculcated political
               apathy. </p>
            <p class="indent1">Correspondence may have been Southey’s lifeline and network of influence, but it was
               fragile. Letters got lost, or never arrived – even in his own time. He discovered
               that messages his brother Tom threw overboard in bottles were as likely to reach him
               as his letters to Tom, sent by post, were to arrive at his ship. And although inland
               post was reliable, many correspondents of this period did not keep Southey’s letters.
               Although over 800 survive, references within surviving letters to ones now lost remind
               us of the fragile, selective nature of what has come down to us. It is clear from
               this edition, that some important correspondences now exist only in part, or not at
               all, notably with Coleridge, George Dyer, Stuart, Cottle and Charles Lamb. Nevertheless,
               we are able to present here previously unpublished letters containing assessments
               of such luminaries as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott and Davy. Southey’s understanding
               of the writing of his peers and his centrality to Romantic literary culture are both
               on display as never before.</p>
