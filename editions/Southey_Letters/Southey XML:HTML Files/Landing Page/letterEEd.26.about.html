            <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Editorial Methodology</span></p>
            <p><em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</em> is divided into eight Parts: I: 1791-1797, II:1798-1803, III:1804-09, IV:1810-15,
               V:1816-21, VI:1822-27, VII:1828-33, VIII:1833-39.</p>
            <p>The General Introduction outlines the project’s research context. In addition, each
               individual Part has a brief introductory essay. </p>
            <p>Throughout the edition, letters are presented in chronological order, each letter
               being assigned its own number. Any letters that have been located after the first
               publication of an individual Part of the edition are inserted at their appropriate
               chronological point and given a suffix number (e.g. .1,.2): see, for example, Letter
               1889.1. Previously unpublished letters have all been newly transcribed from the autograph
               manuscript, when that survives. In cases where the letter now exists only in a manuscript
               transcript in another hand, copy-text is taken from the transcript and this is recorded
               in the editorial headnote. Where letters have been previously published, we have returned
               to and transcribed the original manuscript when it survives. In cases where we have
               been unable to locate the manuscript of a published letter, copy-text is taken, without
               emendation, from the published version and this is recorded in the editorial headnote.
               There are two instances where a previously published version of a letter is fuller
               than the surviving manuscript. In these an edited, annotated transcript of the manuscript
               version has been placed within the main run of letters (see Letters 46 and 147), and
               the text of the longer, previously published version in Appendix 1.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We have followed the editors of the letters of Mark Twain and adopted a ‘plain text’
                  methodology in order to produce a text that is more quickly intelligible to the reader
                  but that also represents, as closely as our digitised transcriptions can, the original
                  holograph letters.

                  </div> Our aim is to allow the reader to get as close as possible to what Southey wrote and
                  thus to provide an insight into the creative processes that underpinned his letter
                  writing. This is particularly important now, when the older idea of Southey as someone
                  who wrote with ease and never blotted a line or deleted a word is being challenged
                  by new textual and critical scholarship. All letters are transcribed in full and editorial
                  intervention in the text has been kept to a minimum. Southey’s original spelling,
                  and mis-spelling, grammar, punctuation and any slips of his pen have been retained.
                  Deletions are indicated by striking through the cancelled word or phrase, but without
                  any attempt to indicate the heaviness of the deletion: e.g. ‘<span class="strikethrough">he said</span>’. In those cases where Southey changed his mind and wrote over his original thought,
                  we have put his final version in the text of the letter and indicated the original
                  words or characters in an endnote. Throughout the text, ‘x’ is used to indicate an
                  illegible character: e.g. ‘he xxid’. Underlining is indicated by italics: e.g. ‘<span class="ital">he</span> said’. The exception to this rule is where Southey used underlining not for emphasis
                  but to indicate an abbreviation written in superscript: eg. ‘D<sup>r</sup>’ rather than ‘Doctor’ or ‘Dr’. This was something Southey did occasionally and irregularly,
                  particularly on address leaves. It is not possible to code a character or set of characters
                  in both underline or italic and superscript, so in these cases we have silently regularised
                  his practice and presented all his superscript abbreviations, both underlined or not,
                  in superscript: e.g. ‘M<sup>rs</sup> Smith said’. Editorial [...] within the text of an individual letter are used to indicate
                  issues relating to the manuscript: a tear, cut, missing section or area obscured by
                  a seal mark or blot, or a substantial section of a letter in the hand of a co-correspondent.
                  See, for example, Letter 56, co-written with Grosvenor Charles Bedford. Editorial
                  {...} are used to indicate an authorial insertion of text above or below the line.</p>
            </div>
            <p>We have retained Southey’s paragraphing but have not otherwise replicated the lineage
               of prose, the pagination, the hand, or any other physical features of his letters
               that it is clear Southey did not invest with any meaning. Throughout the edition,
               words split in the text of an individual letter by the end of a line or a page have
               been silently emended to reflect Southey’s customary spelling: eg. ‘mis-/ chief’ has
               been emended to ‘mischief’ in our text. In the case of poems included by Southey in
               his letters, we have retained the lineage and stanza breaks, with the exception of
               lines and stanzas that run onto the following line or page of the manuscript. In these
               cases, the run over word or line/s has been silently incorporated into the preceding
               part of the line or stanza as it is clear that the break had no meaning to Southey
               and was dictated purely by the spatial constraints of the manuscript page.</p>
            <p>Each letter has an editorial headnote. This records the location of the manuscript,
               if it has survived, and describes its physical characteristics, using the following
               abbreviations:</p>
            <p>ALS: autograph letter signed</p>
            <p>AL: autograph letter, without signature</p>
            <p>(A)LS: more than 50% of the manuscript in a hand other than Southey’s</p>
            <p>TR = survives as a transcript in another hand</p>
            <p>TS = survives as a typescript</p>
            <p>p. = numbers of pages of the letter containing script, including the address leaf,
               when this has survived</p>
            <p>(c) = letter transcribed and checked from a digital scan, photograph or photocopy
               of the manuscript</p>
            <p>The headnote also notes any previous instances of publication and deals with other
               relevant issues, such as endorsements, watermarks, postmarks, franks, stamps and dating.
               This edition provides important new information about when many of Southey’s letters
               were actually written, and re-dates letters that have been misdated or misleadingly
               dated by previous editors. For example, Southey’s earliest correspondence is here
               demonstrated to date to late 1791, rather than 1790 as claimed by John Wood Warter.
               The following conventions have been observed in dating individual letters: [...] is
               used in headnotes to indicate an editorial dating; ‘c.’ to indicate a dating taken
               from the postmark or from internal evidence within an individual letter; ‘before’
               is used either when a letter contains an authorial date, but there is evidence within
               the letter that it was begun before that time, or when an endorsement on the letter
               indicates its date of receipt; ‘after’ is used when a letter contains an authorial
               date, but there is evidence within the letter that it was continued after that time;
               ‘?’ is used to indicate a dating about which there remains some uncertainty.</p>
            <p>Detailed information about Southey’s correspondents, along with other important figures
               in his letters, can be found in the ‘Biographies’ section. Each entry in this section
               also contains a list of letters to and list of letters about the person it deals with.
               People mentioned in the ‘Biographies’ section are hyperlinked from the text of individual
               letters, but are only hyperlinked from editorial endnotes when their identity needs
               further clarification than that supplied by the letter text. Information about where
               Southey lived, locations he was associated with, and the homes of friends he visited
               is provided in the ‘Places’ section of this edition and hyperlinked from the texts
               of individual letters. </p>
            <p>Editorial notes to the text are used to clarify references to persons, books, places,
               and events within the main body of each individual letter. They also identify quotations
               and provide translations of foreign language material. A ‘Chronology’ covers key events
               in Southey’s life. ‘Indices of People and Letters’ organise Southey’s correspondence
               by, respectively, the individual to whom a letter is addressed and the person or persons
               mentioned in it. The links in the ‘Primary Navigation’ bar, on the left-hand side
               of the page, allow navigation across difference sections of the edition. The ‘Search’
               facility allows the reader to perform dedicated word or phrase searches both across
               the entire edition (including the editorial apparatus) or within a particular part
               of it.</p>
            <p>All transcriptions and editorial materials are checked by the editor or editors of
               that particular part of the edition and by at least one other member of the editorial
               team. After xml encoding and transformation, each Part of edition is proofed online
               by its editor or editors, who also check the index and search engine. The editor,
               or editors, also ensure any corrections are implemented before the text is made publicly
               available. After publication, any corrections or comments should be directed to Lynda
               Pratt from whom a copy of the current version of the correction file is also available
               on request.</p>

            <p>This electronic edition was TEI-encoded by Averill Buchanan under the supervision
               of Laura Mandell and her team at Miami University of Ohio, and with the assistance
               of David Rettenmaier and Mike Quilligan at the University of Maryland. Buchanan used
               the new Word Macros tool developed at Miami University by Holly Connor and Jerry Gannod
               in order to learn TEI encoding. Mandell transformed the TEI files into HTML by using
               modified versions of the transforms provided by the <a class="link_ref" href="http://www.tei-c.org">TEI</a>. Dave Rettenmaier and Mike Qulligan designed the splash pages, banners, etc., comprising
               the HTML design. The HTML pages do not use frames but rather make extensive use of
               tables and stylesheets for layout and presentation. The site works best when viewed
               with Mozilla Firefox v. 3, Netscape 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.0, or higher, or a comparable
               browser; earlier browsers may not display everything properly.</p>
