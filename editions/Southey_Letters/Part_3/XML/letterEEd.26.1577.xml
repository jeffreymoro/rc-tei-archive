        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for your letter, &amp; for your offer of a bed at Hammersmith, when circumstances lead me to London.
                    That luckily is but seldom, &amp; then as my business is in town, my head-quarters must be there also, &#8211; but I shall &lt;have&gt;
                    more opportunities of seeing you than if you had continued at Bristol. I thank you also for offering to transact any little
                    affairs between me &amp; the booksellers, tho I have none but what can be readily transacted by letter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">

                    time printed, &amp; talks of beginning the first week in March.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> For Coleridge&#8217;s new
                        periodical <title>The Friend</title>, the first number of which was published on 1 June 1809.</note> I should press upon him
                    the expediency of fixing a later day if there were any probability that he would employ the intermediate time in getting
                    before-hand with the Press, &#8211; but as let the birthday of his Paper be when it will, he will always <del>xxxx to</del> prepare his
                    matter upon the spur of the occasion, &#8211; or rather always have it to prepare, it as well to begin one time as another.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You &amp; all the world no doubt <del>ask</del> are talking about Col. Wardel &amp; the Duke of York.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>), Commander in Chief
                        of the army. He held the post from 1798&#8211;1809, but was forced to resign in the wake of allegations that he had profited by
                        allowing his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>), to accept money from army officers, in return for
                        which promotion was arranged. Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle (c. 1761&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>) played a central role in exposing the
                        scandal. However, his own reputation was quickly sullied when, in July, it emerged that Wardle had bought Clarke&#8217;s testimony
                        against the Duke of York with a promise to pay for the furnishing of her house. It was alleged by Clarke that Wardle had been
                        acting for the Duke of Kent.</note> I can tell you what is very odd, &amp; yet very true, &#8211; that there are strong reasons for
                    supposing <del>that</del> the accusation has been set on foot by the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince of

                    their more &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211;&#8211; brother. Be this as it may, &amp; be the issue of the Enquiry what it may, &#8211; &amp; probably <del>must</del>
                    &lt;will&gt; be in such a House of Commons, &amp; under such a Government as the present, enough has been proved for the people of
                    England. The thing has long been known, &amp; even notorious, &#8211; but the <del>D of</del> Dukes character is now blasted with all
                    the virtuous part of the community, &#8211; &amp; there wants but one honest &amp; able man in the H of Commons to attack him upon the
                    Constitutional ground, that he holds a high &amp; important office, &amp; yet is not responsible for his discharge of it. Such a
                    man would deliver us <del>of</del> &lt;from&gt; one abomination. &#8211; If I were in the habit of drinking wine which plague on the
