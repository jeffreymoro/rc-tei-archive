                        Thomas Rowley, a fictitious fifteenth-century monk. Chatterton is thought to have concocted his medieval diction by reading
                        John Kersey&#8217;s (c.1660&#8211;c. 1721) <title>Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum</title> (1708).</note> &#8211; which has this advantage that it
                    passes for wit if you see the author meant to be witty, &#8211; because you cannot tell whether he is or no, &amp; allow him to
                    introduce all the beastliest phrases &amp; images in cant language, for which, if they had been in plain English or plain Scotch
                    the book would have been deservedly thrown behind the fire.</p>
