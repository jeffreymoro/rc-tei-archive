                    fault, &#8211; &amp; he promises that C. will forthwith forward them. He says something about your resenting his telling some news you
                    sent him, &#8211; in a manner as if he were apologizing to you thro me.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> My stock of contemporary observation is not half exhausted in these three volumes. The part allotted to travelling
                    for the sake of verisimilitude has taken up too much of the book, tho it brings in many things in a sort of dramatic order. It is
                    because such books as this have not been written that we are reduced to glean scraps of knowledge concerning other ages: whether I
                    may succeed in obtaining a good temporary sale remains to be seen, &#8211; but I am sure the book will increase in value as it grows
                    old, &#8211; upon that score for which you rightly value the old periodicals. Some months ago I began to mark in all English books which
                    I had occasion to read all passages relating to this home-history, &amp;, by my own hand in idler minutes, &amp; <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> before <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> made his
                    appearance &#8211; transcribed a bundle of some size, &#8211; each extract on a separate little leaf: some twenty years hence, if I live so
                    long &amp; can afford to risk the expence I will sort them into due order &amp; print them as contributions to English History.
                    This way of reading I well remember you taught me, &amp; I believe nothing of any possible application to any thing in the
