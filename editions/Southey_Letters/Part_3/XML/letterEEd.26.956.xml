        <p rend="indent1"> Tis a heartless thing dear Tom to write from this distance &amp; at this uncertainty. the more so when I recollect
                    how many letters of mine were sent to the West Indies when you were last there, which never reached you. Two Packets, say the
                    papers, have been taken. &amp; if so two of my epistles are now deeper down than your sounding lines have ever fathomed &#8211; unless
                    indeed some shark has swallowed &amp; digested bag &amp; billets. &#8211; We are uneasy at receiving no letter since that which
                    announced your arrival at Barbadoes. I conceived you were on the Surinam Expedition,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In
                        May 1804 a British expedition led by Commodore (later Vice-Admiral) Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet (1762&#8211;1814;
                            <title>DNB</title>) attacked and took possession of the South American Dutch colony of Surinam, between French Guyana and
                        Guyana. The colony was returned to the Dutch later that year.</note> &amp; waited for the Gazette to day with some unavoidable
                    apprehensiveness. It has arrived &amp; I can find no trace of the Galatea<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Tom Southey&#8217;s
                        ship, HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi>, was a fifth-rate 32-gun frigate commissioned in 1794; it did not participate in the
