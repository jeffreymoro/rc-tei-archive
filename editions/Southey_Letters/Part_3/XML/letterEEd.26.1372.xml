                    politics at present stand you can have no interest with the Lord Chancellor, but it is not impossible that some how or other &#8211; you
                    may have some with the <hi rend="ital">Lady</hi> Chancellor, who I am told exercises over her husband in these matters the same

        <p rend="indent1"> Poor <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>! &#8211; the truth is that he has no
                    opinions upon any subject whatsoever. Instead of being a canvass capable of retaining what images are laid on it, his mind is like
                    the whited wall on which the figures of the optical-Raree-show-man pass along, &amp; leave <del>it as</del> it just as blank as
                    before. Poor fellow, he is no infidel, tho <del>he</del> in some idle hour of self-importance, he may have thought proper to
                    settle his head in his neck handkerchief, &amp; <del>aver</del> proclaim himself <del>xxx</del> such. He has neither read nor
                    thought upon the subject of religion: &#8211; &amp; now when he begins to <hi rend="ital">feel</hi> about it, all will be set to rights,

                    have produced some impression.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If you remain so far thro the winter in Wales I shall certainly be able to see you on my way to London: where I
                    shall go as soon as my reviewing is over, that is in six weeks or two months. My own family is likely to be increased about the

                    pleasure as that you should be the means of introducing some reform into that branch of jurisprudence, &amp; of saving some of
                    those lives which are now so unnecessarily <del>xxxxx</del> sacrificed, &#8211; to use the mildest term. Could any thing be more
                    shocking to the common-sense feelings of the people than to see a man &amp; his wife for coining suffer the same punishment as
                    Patch <del>xx</del> at the same time!<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Patch (1770?&#8211;1806) was hanged, on 8 April
                        1806, for the murder at Rotherhithe of his employer Isaac Blight. Benjamin and Sarah Herring, who had been convicted of
                        coining, were executed alongside him.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> God speed to you in your Welsh studies. I thought to have done something that way, but have too much to learn in
                    other things, &amp; too little time for it. If <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>  lives, &amp; those
                    bright eyes of his do not play false in the promise of intellect which they give, I shall make him a Keltic scholar in the easiest
                    &amp; best way, by sending him into Wales &amp; into the Highlands to acquire both dialects orally, &amp; then into Ireland if any
                    thing Christian can be <del>xxx xxx</del> ventured among the wild Paddies. To give him much learning may not perhaps be the best
                    way of enabling him to make a fortune, &#8211; but it will enable him to be very happy without one, &#8211; which is a much better thing.</p>
