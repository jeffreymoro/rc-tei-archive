                        <del>xxx</del> England we have our sickly seasons, &#8211; more regularly than we have warm weather in the dog days: indeed in my
                    growlings I should call half the days in the year dog days, &#8211; as being days only fit for dogs. I am unlucky &lt;enough&gt; just to
                    know so much of physic as to discover bad symptoms very readily, &amp; there is <del>xxx</del> hardly &lt;a&gt;
                        symptom<del>s</del> which I cannot refer to some damnd thing or other, &amp; which is most vexatious in that I can always
                    &lt;find&gt; good reasons for a bad prognosis. Your <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">godson</ref>  here,
                    who is as sweet a play-fellow as ever blest a fathers eyes, &#8211; is very unwell, &amp; I am very uneasy, &#8211; &amp; so I am going hard
                    at work, to cram other thoughts into my head because I cannot bring any others out of it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have had my visitation also in the shape of cold, &#8211; but not to any great degree. The violent catarrhs which hang
                    upon me for six weeks &amp; one of which may perhaps do my business in six days, do not come till the warm weather, &#8211; they have a
                    connection with sunshine which is to me inexplicable.</p>

                    month. My <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">sister-elect</ref>  is a Lisbonian, who will have
                    something considerable after her fathers<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Sealy (dates unknown) a wealthy Lisbon
                        merchant.</note> death &amp; I suppose enough immediately to help him forward till he gets into good practise. He has been
                    very successful, &#8211; this first year his fees having somewhat exceeded 100 Guineas, which is doing much, I know a little of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">Mary Sealy</ref> personally, &amp; more of her by the good report
                    of one of her friends whose judgement is implicitly to be relied on. In every respect this is a circumstance which gives me great
                    pleasure, &amp; I consider it as a great piece of good fortune that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>
                    should be settled within an easy days of journey of me, Durham being only fourscore miles by the turnpike roads, &amp; not about
                    sixty for crow, horseman or ten-toe-traveller.</p>
