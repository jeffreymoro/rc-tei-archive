        <p rend="indent1"> I have remedied my neglect to Ld Carysfort.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Joshua Proby, 1st Earl of
                        Carysfort (1751&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>): judge, diplomat, Whig politician and poet, who was the author of <title>Dramatic
                            and Narrative Poems</title> (1810). He was a fellow pupil of Southey at Westminster School.</note> &#8211; to <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref> I shall not send a copy, because tho I have written to him, &amp; twice
                    sent him books to India he has never written me a line. The truth of the matter is this. At one time he thought it prudent to drop
                    his acquaintance with me &#8211; but the recollection which he had of old times, &amp; the feeling which he had <del>for</del>
                    &lt;towards&gt; me in the bottom of his heart, &amp; the connecting link which you formed, &#8211; forced him to an occasional
                    intercourse which was always uncomfortable. &#8211; &amp; which I ought to have broken off, seeing that it was uncomfortable to him,
                    &amp; that his father past me in the streets. <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref> feels all this &amp; when he
                    remembers me is not pleased with himself, because he knows he has acted inconsistently, <del>xxx</del> less unkindly than he meant
                    to have acted &#8211; more so than he ought. I did not myself know how like a scabby sheep I had been considered before the touch of the
                    Irish Chancellor had purified me, till Daunceys poor wife,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Mrs Dauncey was the daughter of
                        Southey&#8217;s childhood friend, <ref target="people.html#DoliognonLouisa">Mrs Dolignon</ref>. She was married to Philip Dauncey
                        (d. 1819), a barrister who became a Kings Counsel and Treasurer of Gray&#8217;s Inn.</note> &#8211; the very last time I ever saw her,
                    burst into tears &amp; took my hand &amp; almost in direct terms asked me to forgive her for having for so many years shunned me.
                    Dauncey himself was present &#8211; <del>x</del> I <del>xx</del> was never more <del>xxxxxxx</del> &lt;confounded&gt; in the course of
                    my life &#8211; &amp; have seldom been more affected. With her family <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref> was very
                    intimate &amp; that he was acting in the same manner I very well know, not merely from my own observations &#8211; but from some of his
                    own letters which were once inadvertently shown me. &#8211; I will not therefore write to him again, nor in way force myself upon him.
                    When he returns to England if we should meet by chance as most probably we shall, I shall not forget his very many very excellent
                    qualities, nor the deep &amp; unaffected prepossession in his favour which I felt the very first day I ever saw him, when I was
                    placed under him as his shadow.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> At Westminster School Strachey was &#8216;substance&#8217; to
                        Southey&#8217;s &#8216;shadow&#8217; and thus responsible for teaching him the customs and rules of the school.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As yet I have heard of Madoc from nobody but <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>
                        Taylor</ref> &#8211; his opinion is very flattering &#8211; &#8216;one believes it, he says, as one believes the historical plays of
                    Shakespere.&#8217; This &#8211; which applies to the first part more particularly is high praise, &amp; such praise as I conceive most
                    appropriate. I heartily rejoice that the preface first meditated was laid aside at your advice &#8211; for the cloud under which it was
                    written has passed away &#8211; I do not now feel the distrust of the poem which then hung over me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thinking over your remarks upon Kehama<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>The Curse of
                            Kehama</title>, published in 1810. Southey had sent Wynn an early draft of the poem; see Southey to Charles Watkin
                        Williams Wynn, 24 March [1805], Letter 1050.</note> it seems to me that occasional rhymes may be admitted into a
                        <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;stanza&gt; where the blank endings very much predominate. &#8211; but that blank endings must not be
                    perceptible in a stanza of rhyme. The Curse<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), Book
                        2, lines 144&#8211;169.</note> is certainly ill expressed &#8211; if I cannot mend its rhyme &#8211; it shall be given in some marked rhythm.
