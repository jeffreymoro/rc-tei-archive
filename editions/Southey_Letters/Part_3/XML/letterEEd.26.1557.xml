          <salute>My dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Here is my vindication of the Indian Mission packed up on the table,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey&#8217;s review of <title>Periodical Accounts of the Baptist Missionary Society</title>, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 1
                        (February 1809), 193&#8211;226.</note> &#8211; but unluckily too late for to days coach &#8211; so it cannot reach London before Monday. It is
                    written with hearty good will, &amp; requires no signature to show from whence it came. Now I wish you would ask <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gifford</ref>, if he thinks it expedient to use the pruning knife,
                    &#8211; to let the copy be returned to me when the printer has done with it: because it is ten to one that the passages which he would
                    curtail being the most Robert Southeyish of the whole, would be those that I should like best myself, &#8211; &amp; therefore I would
                    fain have the pleasure of putting them in again for my own satisfaction, if for nobody else&#8217;s. That <ref target="people.html#AikinArthur">Arthur Aiken</ref> in the days of his reign (which Heaven be praised is over) actually
                    emasculated half the things I sent him, as clumsily &amp; as mercilessly as a sow gelder performs his operations</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must still confess to you Grosvenor that I have my fears &amp; suspicions as to the freedom of this review, &#8211;
                    &amp; this article will in some measure put it to the proof. For it is my nature &amp; my principle to speak &amp; write as
                    earnestly, as plainly, &amp; as straight to the mark, as I think &amp; feel. If the <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Editor</ref> understands his own interest he will not restrict me. A review started against the Edinburgh, will
                    instantly be suspected of being a ministerial business, &amp; a sprinkling of my free &amp; fearless way of thinking will win
                    friends for it among those very persons most likely to be prejudiced against it, &amp; to be misled by the Scotchmen. The high
                    orthodox men both of church &amp; state will always think as they are told, &#8211; there is no policy in writing to them, &#8211; the
                    Anti-Jacobine &amp; British Critic are good enough for their faces of brass, brains of lead, &amp; tongues of bell-metal, I shall
                    not offend them, &#8211; tho my reasoning appeal to better hearts &amp; clearer understandings. &#8211; I would say this to him if I knew him,
                    &#8211; but I do not desire you to say it, because I do not know how far it might suit the person to whom it <del>x</del> relates. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Spain! Spain! &#8211; By the God who made me, were the resources of the nation at my command I would stake my head upon
                    the deliverance of that country &amp; the utter overthrow of Bonaparte. But good God what blunders &#8211; what girlish panics &#8211; what
                    absolute cowardice is there in our measures! &#8211; Disembarking troops when we ought to send ship after ship full as fast as they
                    could be put on board. It is madness to wait for transports &#8211; &#8211; send ships of the line, &amp; let them run singly for Lisbon &amp;
                    Cadiz &amp; Catalonia <del>xxx</del> Nothing can ruin <del>Spa</del> the Spaniards, unless they feel the misconduct of England &#8211;
                    as I am grieved to say &#8211; I feel it. It is the more heart breaking &#8211; because the heart of England is with these noble people, we
                    are not only ready &#8211; willing &amp; able to make every effort for them, but even eager to do it, &#8211; &amp; yet all is palsied by
                    plans so idiotic that the horse whip were a fitter instrument of punishment for them than the halter, if it were not for their
                    deadly consequences</p>
