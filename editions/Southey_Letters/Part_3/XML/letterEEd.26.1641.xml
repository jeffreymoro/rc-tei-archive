        <p rend="indent1"> More than once have I been on the point of writing to you, and as often prevented by some disquieting or
                    distressing circumstance. Within this week I have deposited in yonder churchyard, the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">little
                        girl</ref> who was newly born when you saw me. I had not ceased to thank God for the preservation of my <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">only boy</ref>, who had been saved from the croup, when this visitation befell us, and I
                    do not cease to thank Him now. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has happily an <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">infant</ref> at the breast, a better comforter than I could be; still it will be long
                    before she recovers from the stroke, which was as unexpected as it was severe.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I go on Thursday next to Durham, to visit <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</ref>, who is
                    just married.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Southey had married <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">Mary-Harriet Sealy</ref> the daughter of a Lisbon acquaintance of Southey&#8217;s.</note> My absence from home will not exceed
                    a fortnight. The sooner you arrive after my return the better, for the delight of the country is in the long evenings at
                    Midsummer, and I shall be sorry if you miss them. The straight road from London is to Penrith, one stage short of Carlisle, and
                    eighteen miles from <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. From thence there is a stage which runs through this place
                    Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. But if you reach Penrith early enough to come by chaise it is less wearisome to proceed to a
                    house where you will feel yourself at home than to pass a night at an inn, for this stage leaves Penrith in the morning. If you
                    come by way of Leeds or Manchester there is no stage nearer than Kendal, which is thirty miles from hence. It is a long journey,
                    but if you start from London the least fatiguing plan is to take the mail; remember, <hi rend="ital">not</hi> that which goes by
                    Manchester to Carlisle, for that takes in the unwary passengers for some thirty additional miles, and for a spell of two hours in
                    the dead of the night at a Manchester inn, waiting to be turned over to another coach; but the Carlisle mail, which goes by Newark
                    and Doncaster. I enter into these particulars because some of my friends have been deceived by book-keepers and sent the more
                    circuitous route. Allen<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Untraced.</note> was at school with me: I remember him well, but
                    never had any intimacy with him. John Dolignon<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Dolignon (dates unknown) was the son
                        of <ref target="people.html#DoliognonLouisa">Louisa Dolignon</ref>, who acted as a guardian for Southey while he was a pupil
                        at Westminster School.</note> was one of my earliest playmates, and while I was at Westminster <ref target="people.html#DoliognonLouisa">his mother&#8217;s</ref> house was my home every Saturday and Sunday. The chances and changes
                    of the world have thrown us far asunder, the more so perhaps because ever since we ceased to associate, we must have grown more
                    unlike each other. I used to shoot with him, fish with him, and lay snares for rabbits. These things I could not do now. Were I,
                    however, to meet Dolignon (and I would turn fifty miles from my way for the sake of meeting him) my first feeling would be like
                    that of a brother &#8211; we should both shed tears at thinking of his dear mother and of his sister, and when that sympathy was over I
                    should begin to feel a weight at my heart from perceiving how little other sympathy was left us. I know what the feeling is by
                    experience, and there are few feelings more painful.</p>
