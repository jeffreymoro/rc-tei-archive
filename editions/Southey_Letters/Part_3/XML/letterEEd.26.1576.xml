                        died in 1808, had married Anna Edgeworth (1772&#8211;1824), the daughter of Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>)

                        <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> would have done himself more honour by volunteering upon this service than by waiving it. for not to show respect in this instance, is to manifest a
                want of it. Peace to the memory of the dead if D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stock is to <del>be his biographer</del>

                        Medical Institution in Hotwells, Bristol, was commissioned by Anna Beddoes to write his biography. This appeared in 1811 as

          </note> it will be without feeling &amp; without philosophy, &#8211;
                    &amp; the properest frontispiece would be a portrait of the historian putting an extinguisher upon a sepulchral lamp, &#8211; which else might burn for ever.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I can &amp; will write an inscription for paper, &#8211; but one for marble I have no skill to execute. There is a
                    felicity required for the lapidary style which I have not <del>acquired</del> attained, tho I have more than once unwillingly
                    attempted it. If <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> will do any thing he will do this, &#8211; for he had

                    death, even to a superstitious depression of spirits. I expect to see him in a day or two. About the books it is not in &lt;my&gt;
                    power to be of any use. The London sales by auction usually answer well, &#8211; but medical books soon grow stale like drugs, &amp; the
                    library is not of that kind to yield a third part of its value. If <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref> has a

        <p rend="indent1"> You will it is to be hoped write your essays on physical education. From Beddoes I hoped for more good to the human
                    race than from any other individual, &amp; if you have not received his mantle he has taken it with him. This too increases my
                    regret that you are not to be his biographer, for no man living is so competent as yourself to explain his views, &amp; so to
