                    seasoning down a little seriousness with some merriment I have desired him, either to do the business at once, or tell me he

                    he may take the pill heaven knows &#8211; but it was gilded &amp; rolled in sugar for him. He might have done all I left for him to do
                    in a fortnight &#8211; I could have done it in a third of the time. &amp; my main motive for transferring it to him was a very foolish
                    hope of teaching him to do something. but this lazy loitering shilly-shallyness is in the very blood bones &amp; marrow of him. He
                    has I am well assured as true a regard for me as for any person breathing &#8211; but it is not enough to rouse him to common exertion.
                    the service to be done me was very trifling &#8211; but the disservice of putting off a publication twelvemonths on which I had
                    calculated &#8211; &amp; he knew I had calculated &#8211; for my ways &amp; means, &#8211; is a very serious one. a positive loss which it will cost
