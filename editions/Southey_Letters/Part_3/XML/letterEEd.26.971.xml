          <salute>Dear Danvers</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will not talk of this disappointment &#8211; for that is of little consequence &#8211; nor have I any thing to say respecting
                    the worst part of your letter. &#8211; only remember that in doing your duty something is due to yourself, &amp; that if you reduced
                    yourself to absolute want it would afford but a temporary Relief to your brother. as therefore no sacrifice on your part could
                    permanently help him, none ought to be made which should materially inconvenience you, or at all <del>xxxxxxx</del> amerce you of
                    your comforts. All this I have said to you before &#8211; &amp; it will be said I well know by your friends at Bristol. That the
                    creditors are little disposed to accommodation is probably no evil, certainly less than any false hopes would be which might tempt
                    to a farther trial of plans which cannot succeed. The war opens the same resources as formerly, &amp; he must submit to a
                    separation from his family as the only possible means of ultimately providing for them, for in army or navy there may be a chance
                    of obtaining some situation at last which would secure half-pay.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter was indeed a sad disappointment.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Danvers had been planning
                        to pay a visit to Southey in Keswick.</note> I jumped up from my afternoon nap on the sofa &amp; cried this is the letter I
                    wanted &#8211; &amp; you may guess what an altered state of feeling its contents produced. <del>I xx in</del> To day I am going to <ref target="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</ref> on my way to hear <ref target="people.html#ThelwallJohn">John Thelwall</ref>
                    lecture at Kendal, &amp; had calculated upon meeting you before my return. do not however abandon all thoughts of your journey. it
                    is a cheap road &#8211; long coaches all the way. any time till December the country is beautiful.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> News from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>. a recapture which will give him &#163;120 &amp; set him on his
                    legs for he was behind-hand &#8211; &amp; a ship from Hambro<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Hamburg.</note> detained, which
                    if it be condemned (&amp; they say there is every reason to suppose it will) will double his half pay. the ship very healthy &#8211; but
                    they were going to the very head quarters of infection at Antigua for stores. however as the stay would not exceed 48 hours &#8211;
                    probably only 24 &#8211; &amp; they are on their guard I hope &amp; trust they may escape. Tom is delighted with the small Islands &#8211;
                    quite as much as ever <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref>  was. &#8211; I expected to have pleased you with his letters
                    which are really very interesting. Do write to him at Barbadoes. his last letter is dated June 11. &amp; he had never received one
                    line from England &#8211; for three Packets had been taken. Provoking! there was a long letter in each, with scraps of Madoc<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poem <title>Madoc</title>, which Southey had written in 1797&#8211;1799 and since then had been
                        intermittently revising. It was completed in October 1804 and published in 1805.</note> written by <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> in double columns, all gone to edify the sharks. It was some relief to hear from
                    Tom for I was really under considerable apprehensions, knowing what work pestilence was making there, &amp; this letter brought
                    good news.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Nine Sheets of Madoc corrected &#8211; &amp; I am now in the 8th section of the second part which brings me into the old

                    so that the labour is over. My Anthology pieces (the best of them) are now to be collected into a little volume &#8211; which will
                    probably sell &amp; yield me at least enough in the course of twelvemonths to pay for a years wine.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Annual Anthology</title> 1799 and 1800; Southey&#8217;s contributions to these volumes were

                    not succeed well. that accursed diabetes annoys me sadly. I shall else be excellently well. &#8211; here is fine swimming here &amp;
                    that is one of the enjoyments I had lookd out for you &#8211; all well.</p>
