        <p rend="indent1"> I am very sorry to learn by your brothers letter, which has just reached me, that you are suffering from a
                    complaint, in which I can from sore experience so well sympathize.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> It is not clear which
                        of May&#8217;s brothers wrote on his behalf.</note> You have doubtless the best advice, &#8211; yet it may not be amiss to tell you that
                    the remedy which I have found most efficacious was an infusion of cayenne pepper, &#8211; the infusion just strong enough to make the
                    eye smart strongly. it was recommended to me by <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Beddoes</ref>,
                    &amp; frequently proved effectual, &#8211; but <del>as</del> the inflammation with me lay originally in the <hi rend="ital">eye lid</hi>
                    &amp; <del>not</del> only by sympathy in the eye itself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been several times on the point of writing to you, &amp; still delayed it in the expectation that another
                    post might bring me letters from you, or from Lisbon. &#8211; The Metrical Tales are &#8211; as I believe you know &#8211; only a republication from
                    the two volumes of the Anthology, which <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> has.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s contributions to the <title>Annual Anthology</title> (1799&#8211;1800) were republished under his own name
                        in <title>Metrical Tales and other Poems</title> (1805).</note> Still there is a sort of curiosity about Title pages &amp;
                    Prefaces &amp;c. which may make it worth while to send him the book, as he has expressed a wish for it, &#8211; <del>but</del> the copy
                    should <del>xxx</del> be got in my name from <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Longmans</ref> &#8211; which
                    may be done without any difficulty by showing this part of the letter. have you received a copy of Madoc to be sent him
                    likewise?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will imagine that the news from the Leeward Islands must have been a source of considerable uneasiness to me.
                    Nothing has yet appeared to give me any alarm for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom&#8217;s</ref> personal safety, &#8211; but
                        <del>there is</del> he has lost all he had gained. the very day on which the French arrived at Dominica, he, little dreaming
                    of such an event, wrote to me from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christophers,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The more formal
                        name for the island of Saint Kitts, one of the Leeward Islands in the West Indies.</note> saying that he expected soon to
                    remit me a bill of exchange for 1000&#163;, his prize money on the lowest computation amounting to as much. these prizes were sent into
                        S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Vincents, &amp; that island has been visited by the enemy.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> St
                        Vincent is an island in the southern part of the Windward Islands of the West Indies. It had been ceded to the British by
                        the French in 1763. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in
                        armed conflict, and Southey was concerned that his brother would lose his prize money from the possession of Spanish ships
                        taken by HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi> in December 1804.</note> This however is a less evil than it will be to him to have

                    here, he will be able to recover his arrears, &amp; start clear for the next term, &amp; I trust he has prudence enough to keep

                    slowly. she has but four, tho nearly thirteen months old, &amp; it is three months since the last two made their appearance. Our
                    weather was very severe the beginning of this month, &#8211; blighting &amp; blasting winds from the East &amp; North East, &#8211; I had a
                    slight attack in my bowels, which has somewhat debilitated me, &amp; which probably I should not have had in a better climate. The
                    country is now becoming very beautiful, &amp; I, like other hibernating animals, have begun to crawl out of my den, &amp; warm
                    myself in the sunshine. If <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> had come to England I should have met him in
                    London, where I am in no want of business to call me, &#8211; but without some such preponderant motive, the fatigue &amp; expence of so
                    long a journey will deter me from undertaking it while it can possibly be avoided. And in fact my resolution still holds to settle
                    near London as soon as I can command<del>s</del> sufficient money for the necessary expences. &#8211; The sale of Madoc is quite a thing

                    by the character which it will establish for me, &#8211; &amp; if I should not live to feel the benefit myself, they whom I may leave
                    behind me will.&#8211; Some portion of my time has of late been occupied neither pleasantly, nor profitably in weeding out the faults of
