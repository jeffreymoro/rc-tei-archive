                        15&#8211;18.Dating note: In his &#8216;Text of Robert Southey&#8217;s Published Correspondence: Misdated Letters and Missing Names&#8217;, Curry
                        gives the date as &#8216;Sept. 8. 1808&#8217;, but this would seem to be a mistake on his part, as he comments that the letter as printed
                        in Warter is &#8216;correctly dated but placed with letters of 1807&#8217; (142).</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>
