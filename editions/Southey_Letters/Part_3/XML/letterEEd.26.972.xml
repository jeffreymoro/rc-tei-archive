                        revising. It was completed in October 1804 and published in 1805. For the changes Southey made to his manuscripts of <title>Madoc</title>, see <title>Robert Southey: Poetical

                    part of what he criticises had been altered or omitted &#8211; not all however &#8211; nor should I have assented to all his remarks. It is I
                    who am of the old school &#8211; not Lord C. I am of the school of Homer &amp; the age of Elizabeth &#8211; not of Virgil &amp; the age of

                    of the poem, tho the whole first part resembles more the Odyssey than the Iliad. The second part you shall speedily judge by
                    yourself. If you wish it I will certainly send Ld C. certain extracts &#8211; but should rather decline it, lest I should either be
                    obliged to declare a wider difference of opinion than would please him, or else to alter against my own judgement. Still if you
                    wish it, send me his address that I may not blunder into any errors of etiquette, &amp; he shall have another book about

                    expected. what there is of a melancholy disposition in him is easily accounted for by his situation. I can pardon his vanity. it
                    is a long while before a man learns his ignorance. But he certainly possesses genius &amp; there is something in that so
                    unamalgamable with calvinism that I certainly hope he may be more useful to the world than he expects to be himself. He has a
                    better chance at Cambridge than at Oxford. it is <del>certainly</del> a better university, &amp; mathematics may perhaps teach him
                    to require some little proof before he assents to anything.</p>

                        intended the titlepage of <title>Madoc</title> (1805) to pay tribute to Wynn, his patron, by depicting his family coat of
                        arms, thus illustrating Wynn&#8217;s supposed descent from Madoc&#8217;s brother Rhodri. The titlepage, however, does not show Rhodri&#8217;s
                        monument but rather a troph&#233;e of Wynn&#8217;s shield, a harp and an unidentified stringed instrument, a sword, a bow with arrows, an
                        Indian bonnet, and an opened book of music.</note>
