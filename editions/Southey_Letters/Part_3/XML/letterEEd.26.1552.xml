               the whole paper leads me to a different conclusion. Can you tell me which are <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Goochs</ref> articles? The journal is very well done, but there is a twang of Edinburgh insolence about it, which will make
               enemies, which can do no good, &amp; of which the writers when they are a little older will be sorry &amp; ashamed. Severity may often
               be right, insolence is always wrong. Generous minds &amp; tempers, Domine, are mellowed like wine as they grow older, &#8211; You may repent
               a sarcasm, &#8211; you never can repent having forborne one. I like <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</ref> so much,
               &amp; was so thoroughly pleased with all I saw of him, that this character which he has given to his review surprizes me. It is not his
               nature, &amp; why in Gods name will he graft crabs<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> That is, sour crab-apples on the stock of a

               during the summer to introduce some Lakers &#8211; who never came. It was a vile palavering letter, &#8211; provokingly so, &#8211; &amp; set both <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> &amp; me growling. Nevertheless I should have been civil to his friends had they
