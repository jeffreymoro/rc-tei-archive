                        Southey translated poems for Duppa’s <title>Life and Works of Michel Angelo Buonarroti, with his Poetry and Letters</title>,
                        which was published in 1806. Wordsworth translated one sonnet; Southey three sonnets and a madrigal. A further poem, ‘And
                        sweet it is to see in summer time’, was a joint effort, the first four stanzas by Wordsworth, the following five by Southey.
