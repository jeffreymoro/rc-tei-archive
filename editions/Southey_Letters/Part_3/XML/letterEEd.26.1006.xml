        <p rend="indent1"> I have letters from<ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom"> my brother</ref> thank God &#8211; which tho of a very
                    unpleasant nature still were very acceptable. in consequence of a quarrel with his Captain<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Captain (later Admiral) Henry Heathcote (1777&#8211;1851), in command of HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi> 1803&#8211;1805.</note> he has
                    been brought to a Court Martial for disobedience of orders, neglect of duty &amp; contempt of his commanding officer. the two
                    first charges were not proved. the last was that is he was convicted of having replied when charged with being off deck &amp;c &#8211;
                    &#8216;I beg you pardon Sir, I must contradict you.&#8217; &#8211; &amp; for this sentenced to be dismissed the ship. Commodore Hood<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Commodore (later Vice-Admiral) Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet (1762&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), in
                        command of the fleet in which Thomas Southey served.</note> wished the matter not to be brought to trial, &amp; said that if
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> would make a satisfactory apology he would have the order for trial cancelled.
                    Tom therefore wrote a humbler letter than either his temper liked or the strict justice of the case warranted, but the Captain
                    replied nothing but a full confession of all the charges could be satisfactory. &#8211; The day on which he wrote he had breakfasted
                    with the Commodore to whom he applied for an appointment. Sir A. very properly answered &#8216;my doing that before I have read the
                    minutes, for only the sentence has been sent me yet, will be prejudging the case. if you incline to wait till I have read them I
                    will then let you know.&#8217; the trial was at Antigua &#8211; this took place at Barbadoes. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>
                    therefore forewent the only opportunity of returning to England in a Kings ship that will offer till April, relying on this as the
                    minutes are more in his favour than the sentence, &amp; probably Sir A Hood is disposed to befriend him <del>for the</del> from
                    the remembrance of his brother.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Captain Alexander Hood (1758&#8211;1798) died of a wound to the
                        thigh sustained when his ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Mars</hi> engaged the French ship <hi rend="ital">Hercule</hi> off the coast
                        of Brittany. Nearly 400 men, and both captains, died in the fight. Tom, who was on board the <hi rend="ital">Mars</hi>, was
                        wounded.</note> &#8211; Good however comes out of evil. <hi rend="ital">this</hi> prevented him from being in the affair with the
                    Lilly, &amp; the Lieutenant who went in his stead fell!<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 14 August 1804, the boats of
                        Thomas Southey&#8217;s ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi> made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer <hi rend="ital">General Ernouf</hi> (formerly the British sloop of war <hi rend="ital">Lilly</hi>) lying at the Saintes near
                        Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission 65 were killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that his brother was among the
                        dead, having read in the newspapers that the first lieutenant had been killed. Thomas had been placed under arrest and it was
                        his replacement on the raid, Lieutenant Charles Hayman (d. 1804), who died.</note> An effectual consolation were the matter
                    worse than it is.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At any other time this would have given me much uneasiness, for of course it will injure him. the merits of these
                    things never can be looked into, &amp; it is a rare instance of good fortune that Captain Hoods brother should happen be the
                    Commander on that station &#8211; else he might have reviewed the minutes by the sentence &#8211; as I do many a book by the first page. but
                    unless he be speedily appointed he cannot afford to wait in a country where money is of so little value that the very negro
                    beggars will hardly accept of copper. his finances he told me would last six weeks, before which period the minutes would arrive.
                    the letter was nine weeks on its way &#8211; &amp; I shall look very anxiously for another. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> is as good an officer &amp; as brave a man &#8211; to use one of his &lt;own&gt; phrases, as ever stept between stem
                    &amp; stern &#8211; but as he would be the kindest creature in the world to those below him I fear he has more honesty than prudence in
                    his dealings with his superiors. The constitution of the navy like every thing else has undergone a great alteration, &amp; he is
                    a sailor of the old mould which is now out of fashion.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So much for that. you would probably see the fact in the papers &#8211; or else perhaps I should not have mentioned it. &#8211;
                    I am not only very fond of my brother &#8211; but very proud of him, &amp; have a strong hope in my heart that if he lives I shall have
