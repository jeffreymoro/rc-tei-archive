                        Staffordshire.<lb />Postmark: [partial] KESWICK/ 8<lb />MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, &#8216;The
                        Letters of Robert Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826&#8217; (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 179&#8211;181<lb />Previously
                        published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <title>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</title>, 4 vols (London, 1856), I, pp.
                        352&#8211;354.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Both your letters are arrived, &amp; my sole motive for writing is, in the manner of business to acknowledge their
                    receipt. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> will send you an account of the disbursement. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of course you take your sketches to Bath. I shall therefore beg leave to send <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> to look at them, when I know where he can find you. It will delight him to
                    recollect the places &amp; to talk about the Lakes. I suppose if the fair balance were struck in my own mind, Danvers is of all
                    men living the one whom I most entirely &amp; heartily esteem &amp; love, &#8211; I pray you remember this if you should be disposed at
                    first sight to think him only an odd-looking good-natured little man.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall certainly not pass thro <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</ref>, you being gone, but either go
                    in the mail from Penrith, or travel slowly, as I find stage coaches to suit me, thro Yorkshire &amp; Derbyshire, for the sake of
                    seeing the country. It was my intention to have picked up Espriella<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s
                            <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807).</note> on my way,
                    &#8211; you can take it with you to Bath, &amp; send it me to London when I get there. &#8211; <hi rend="ital">but neither show it nor speak
                        of it to any body</hi> except <ref target="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir E.</ref> for I consider its success &amp; sale
                    as almost wholly depending upon secrecy.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s fears were justified. <title>Letters
                            from England</title> was published anonymously, but as soon as the authorship became generally known, towards the end of
                        1807, its sales fell off. Southey&#8217;s profits amounted to just over a hundred pounds. See Jack Simmons, <title>Letters from
                            England</title> (London, 1951), p. xxiv.</note> &#8211; Remember the <hi rend="ital">fugues</hi>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s plan to include letters on music in <title>Letters from England</title> did not
                        materialise.</note>
          <hi rend="ital">&amp;</hi> write me a letter about the Rooms, &amp; the form of government under the Master
                    of the Ceremonies<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A visit to Bath, presumably contributed by Barker, is included in
                            <title>Letters from England</title>, Letter 74.</note> &#8211; in fact as much about the place as you please, which I will knead
                    up with my own knowledge. There is no place in England, except Bristol with which I am so well acquainted, &amp; none anywhere
                    which I think so beautiful, tho it is much injured within my remembrance, as well as much improved. Senhora if these things are
                    done at all it must be within the next weeks, &amp; the sooner the better. Think of the vignettes<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had wished Barker to provide illustrations for <title>Madoc</title> (1805); her procrastination meant
                        that the poem was published without them.</note> &amp; do not procrastinate till it be too late.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If Barker<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Barker (1769&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>), called Barker of
                        Bath (to distinguish him from another painter of the same name), was a popular painter of historical subjects and landscapes.
                        His designs of rustic scenes can be found on the pottery and printed fabrics of the period. There is no evidence that he was
                        related to Mary Barker.</note> recollects me, as probably he will do, Wynn having introduced me to him, when I went to see his
                    picture from Mary the Maid of the Inn<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Mary the Maid of the Inn&#8217; was written in
                        1796. Southey&#8217;s note in the 1837&#8211;1838 edition <title>Poetical Works Collected by Himself</title> states that it was the
