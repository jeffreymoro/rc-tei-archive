                    days, thinking a necessary brood of cattle far better than a superfluous augmentation of mankind. But if it should come to pass
                    that any foreign invasion should be made (which the Lord God forbid for his mercies sake!) then should men find that a wall of men
                    is far better than stacks of corn, &amp; bags of money, &amp; complain of the want when it is too late to seek remedy.&#8217; Our good
