        <p>.  Previously  published: Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), Life and Correspondence
                            of Robert Southey, 6 vols (London, 1849&#8211;1850), III, pp. 8&#8211;10 [in part].Dating note: RS states that the letter
                        was written at &#8216;two days many sittings&#8217; before he dates it 1 January, so it was probably begun on 31 December
                    1805.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I am exceedingly well pleased with all the European except just the conclusion which is rather too broad.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford&#8217;s review appeared in <title>The European Magazine, and London Review</title>, 48
                        (October, 1805), 279&#8211;286.</note> if the Old Gentleman<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s wealthy uncle, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southey</ref>. Southey hoped that reading a favourable review of his poem
                            <title>Madoc</title> (1805) in the <title>European Magazine</title> would influence his uncle in his favour.</note> have
                    any sort of vulgar notion that authors review themselves, he will shake his long head &#8211; for his head is a very long one &#8211; when he
                    comes to the end. For Heavens sake don&#8217;t put any engines at work to get at him &#8211; he takes the Magazine himself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You use <ref target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Godwins</ref> name as if he had maliciously reviewed Madoc &#8211; which
                    I do not by any means suspect or believe, tho he has all the will in the world to make me feel his power. The Monthly was rather
                    more stupid than he would have made it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The review of <title>Madoc</title> was not by
                        Godwin, but John Ferriar (1761&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), a Scottish physician who practised medicine in Manchester and often
                        contributed articles to the <title>Monthly Review</title>. See <title>Monthly Review</title> (October 1805), n.s. 48,
                        113&#8211;122.</note> I should well like to know who the writer is &#8211; for by the Living Jingo &#8211; a deity whom D. Manuel conceives to
                    have been worshipped by the Celts,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s fictional traveller in <title>Letters from
                            England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807). His reference to the Jingo supposedly
                        worshipped by the Celts appears in Letter 20.</note> &#8211; I would contrive to give him a most righteous clapper-clawing in
                    return.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thalaba<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note>
                    is faulty in its language. Madoc is not &#8211; I am become what they call a puritan in Portugal, with respect to language, &#8211; &amp; dare
                    assert that there is not a single instance of illegitimate English in the whole poem. The faults are in the management of the
                    story at the conclusion &#8211; where the interest is injudiciously transferred from Madoc to Yuhidthiton. it is also another fault, to
                    have rendered <hi rend="ital">accidents</hi> subservient to the catastrophe &#8211; you will see this very acutely stated in the Annual
                        Review,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Taylor reviewed <title>Madoc</title> in the <title>Annual Review for
                            1805</title>, 4 (1806), 604&#8211;613.</note> the remark is new &amp; of exceeding great value. I acknowledge no fault in the
                    execution of any magnitude except the struggle of the women with Amalahta, which is all clumsily done &amp; must be
                        rewritten.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part 2, Book 16.</note> Those faults which are inherent in, &amp; inseparable from the story, as
                    they could not be helped so are &lt;they&gt; to be considered rather as defects &lt;or <hi rend="ital">wants</hi>&gt; than faults.
                        <del>xxxx</del> I mean the division of the poem into two seperate stories &amp; scenes, &#8211; &amp; the inferior interest of the
                    voyage, tho a thing of such consequence. &#8211; But as for unwarrantable liberties of language &#8211; there is not a solitary sin of the
                    kind in the whole 9000 lines &#8211; let me be understood &#8211; I call it an unwarrantable liberty to use a verb deponent &#8211; for instance &#8211;
                    actively &#8211;, &#8211; or to form any compound contrary to the strict analogy of the language &#8211; such as<hi rend="ital"> tameless</hi> in

                    authority &#8211; but depend upon it the Jews have been called so a thousand times. That word is unobjectionable. It is in strict
                    analogy &#8211; its meaning is immediately obvious, &amp; no other word could have expressed the same meaning. &#8211; Archaisms are faulty if
                    they are too obsolete. <hi rend="ital">thewes</hi>

                    the only one I recollect &#8211; that also has a peculiar meaning for which there is no equivalent word. But in short, so very
                    laboriously was Madoc rewritten &amp; corrected time after time, that I will pledge myself if you ask me in any instance why one
                    word stands in the place of another which you perhaps may think the better one, to give you a reason &#8211; most probably <hi rend="ital">euphoni&#230;</hi> grati&#226;<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning &#8216;for the sake of euphony&#8217;.</note> &#8211; which
                    will convince you that I had previously weighed both in the balance. Sir the language and versification of that poem are as full
