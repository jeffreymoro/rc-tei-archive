                    lived years together in the most thorough intimacy could not now find matter of common interest enough for half an hours

                    the more hateful for the mixture of good which now &amp; then appears in them. Both these men are such thoroughly unprincipled

                        minister-plenipotentiary to the Central Junta on 4 October 1808 and when the French marched on Madrid he urged Sir John
                        Moore (1761–1809; <title>DNB</title>), the Commander of the British forces in northern Spain also to advance upon Madrid, despite his inclination to retreat
                        through Portugal. After the disastrous retreat to Corunna, Frere was blamed for this advice and recalled by the British
                        government. Frere’s correspondence with Moore was published in 1810 in a work entitled <title>To the British Nation is
                            Presented by Colonel Venault de Charmilly, Knight of the Royal and Military Order of St. Louis, the Narrative of his

                        the comic stories that he and <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> spun, in the style of Rabelais,
