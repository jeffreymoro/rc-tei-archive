                        vols (London and Princeton, 1969).</note> on this huge &amp; stiff paper, come to any thing, or not? &#8211; this is the question
                    which you will be ready to ask &amp; which I am not ready to answer. My earnest advice to him has been, not to begin till he was
                    stocked with materials for twenty weeks, &#8211; twelve he thought sufficient, &#8211; so perhaps might I, had it not been for a suspicion
                    that if twelve were the stock in hand resolved on he would begin with six, &#8211; or probably half that diminished number. Here however
                    the Prospectus is. If the plan be carried on it will produce him a considerable income, &amp; will be of great general good &#8211;
                    eventually. &#8211; He has begun clumsily with a Prospectus which already requires <del>xxx</del> alteration. &#8211; for if the numbers be to
                    be delivered by the Post, they must be stamped, &amp; in that case must be printed on a single sheet, &#8211; &amp; should he have any
                    number of country subscribers this must be the method adopted.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is well for our troops in Spain that the country is so strong, &#8211; &amp; well for Sir John Moores part of the
                    army, that the fortified places along the frontier are at hand.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809;
                        <title>DNB</title>), Scottish General with a long and varied military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. In December Moore began a
                        retreat but did not make a stand at the frontier but on the coast, at Corunna, in a defensive battle in January 1809, at which
                        he was killed.</note> I am less alarmed than most people, &amp; my confidence in the final success of the Spaniards remains
                    unshaken.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God bless you. I have many of these things to send off which I do with no very good heart, tho certainly not
