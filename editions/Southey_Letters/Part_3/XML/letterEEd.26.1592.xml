        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter, and its enclosed draft, reached me this afternoon. I have to acknowledge the one, and thank you for
                    the other. It gratifies me that you approve my defence of the missionaries,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey

                        (February 1809), 193&#8211;226.</note> because I am desirous of such approbation; and it will gratify me if it should be generally
                    approved, because I wrote from a deep and strong conviction of the importance of the subject. With respect to any alterations in
                    this or any future communication, I am perfectly sensible that absolute authority must always be vested in the editor. The printer
                    has done some mischief by misplacing a paragraph in p. 225., which ought to have followed the quotation in the preceding page. The
                    beginning of the last paragraph is made unintelligible by this dislocation; and indeed you have omitted the sarcasm, which it was
                    designed to justify. I could have wished that this Review had less resembled the Edinburgh<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, which the <title>Quarterly Review</title> was set up to rival.</note> in the tone and
                    temper of its criticisms. That book of Miss Owenson&#8217;s<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">William Gifford</ref> reviewed Lady Sydney Morgan (n&#233;e Owenson; bap. 1783&#8211;1859;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>Woman, or, Ida of Athens</title> (1809), in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 1 (February 1809),
                        50&#8211;52.</note> is, I dare say, very bad both in manners and morale; yet, had it fallen into my hands, I think I could have told
                    her so in such a spirit, that she herself would have believed me, and might have profited by the censure. The same quantity of
                    rain which would clear a flower of its blights, will, if it falls heavier and harder, wash the roots bare, and beat the blossoms
                    to the ground. I have been in the habit of reviewing more than eleven years, for the lucre of gain, and not, God knows, from any
                    liking to the occupation; and of all my literary misdeeds, the only ones of which I have repented have been those reviewals which
                    were written with undue asperity, so as to give unnecessary pain. I propose to continue the subject of the Missions through two
                    other articles, neither of which will probably be half so long as the first; one respecting the South Sea Islands, the other South
                        Africa.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey reviewed the <title>Transactions of the Missionary Society in the
