          <salute>My dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will be a little surprized to hear that <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> has expressed a wish to
                    serve me, &amp; that in consequence <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> has been <del>xx</del> desired to
                    communicate this to me &amp; find out in what manner it can be done conformably to my own inclinations. There was a situation of
                    300 &#163; a year in his own department which he would have offered, &#8211; but that was nobly judged by himself, <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</ref>  to be inadequate
                    to the <del>x</del> expence of time &amp; attendance which it required. So Scott wrote to mention to me Professorships at the
                    Universities, Diplomatic Situations, &#8211; or any other thing which could be pointed out. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Professorships in England are fenced about with subscription, &amp; therefore unattainable by me. In Scotland I
                    would accept one if nothing more suitable can be found. The Secretaryship in Portugal is now no longer desirable. <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref>  has left that country &amp; the salary would not support
                    me there. I am too old to begin the pursuit of fortune in that line, &#8211; &amp; nothing but the desire of becoming independent ever
                    made me desirous of a situation for which I know myself in many points to be exceedingly unfit. The truth is that I have found
                        <del>xx</del> my way in the world, &amp; am in that <del>xxxxxxxxxx</del> state of life unto which it has pleased God to call
                    me, &amp; for which it has pleased him to qualify me. At the same time my means are certainly so straitened that I should very
                    gladly obtain an addition to them, if it could be obtained without changing the main stream of my pursuits. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Now <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</ref>  has told me that the Stewardship &lt;to Greenwich
                    Hospital&gt; for the Derwentwater Estates is expected soon to be vacated by the death of a Mr Walton.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Nicholas Walton (d. 1809).</note> Long<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Untraced.</note> is the
                    managing Director, &#8211; &amp; for this Sharp has advised me to apply, &#8211; I have therefore written to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> to tell him this, &amp; I now write to you, well knowing that if you can be of
                    use <del>of</del> to me in this application you will.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey asked several friends to
                        intercede on his behalf for this position, but in the end it was considered to be unsuitable for him; see Southey to Walter
                        Scott, 8 August 1809 (Letter 1666) and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 12 August 1809 (Letter 1669).</note> What the
                    value of the appointment is I do not know. Sharp fancies from 6 to 800 a year. If this be thought &#8216;too good a thing for me&#8217;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> In an earlier letter to Walter Scott, Southey recounts his attempt to get a diplomatic
                        position in Portugal through <ref target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Charles James Fox</ref> who was Foreign Secretary in
                        the &#8216;Ministry of all the Talents&#8217; before his death in 1806, reporting that Fox considered the &#8216;Consulship&#8217; to be &#8216;too good a
                        thing for me&#8217;; see Southey to Walter Scott, 16 June 1809, Letter 1645.</note> &#8211; as I dare say it will, &#8211; the Cumberland
                    estates might be divided from the Northumberland ones. Certes I should rather have the whole than half, but better half a loaf
                    than no bread. And now I have done all that it is in my power to do; having thus found out a specific thing, &#8211; asked for it, &amp;
                    written to you for your assistance, if you can give me any. Having done this I dismiss the subject altogether from my thoughts. In
                    this respect I have been truly a philosopher that no hopes or fears with respect to worldly fortunes have ever given me an hours
                    anxiety.</p>
