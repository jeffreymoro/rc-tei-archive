                    me as much again for the sake of saying that they pay so much, &#8211; it being the fashion &amp; the folly of the English people to
                    estimate things according to their <hi rend="ital">price</hi> &amp; not their intrinsic value, I am <del>cert</del> quite willing
                    to accommodate them by being paid as highly as they please.</p>
