        <p rend="indent1"> [MS torn] more sections will conclude the poem, &amp; I expected to have finished them six weeks ago, but since my
                    mind has been in a right state my body has not. My summer cold is upon me, &amp; I lie abed as late as I possibly can, because the
                    moment I wake it wakes with me, &amp; it is better to be asleep than to be wholly employed in sneezing &amp; blowing an excoriated
                    nose. About half the next section however is written, &amp; a weeks work, as soon as I get a weeks comfort, will carry me
                    triumphantly to the end.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> was detained so long in London that I could not accompany him back to Edinburgh
                    as we intended. In May I could have gone, &amp; he was detained till the end of June. My visit therefore is prorogued sine die, &#8211;
                    but probably it will take place early in the winter. His bookseller <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref> was
                    here lately, &amp; his advice to me was to sell the copy right of whatever I wrote, because he said booksellers repaid themselves
                    by selling off shares of the copy-right, &#8211; more persons were thus interested in the success of the book, &amp; consequently
                    greater efforts were made to sell it. This may be true, but it is a truth which is not applicable to my case, for it is utterly
                    impossible that the Poem should become popular now, &#8211; the copy right therefore is worth little or nothing at present, &amp;
                        <del>my</del> yet if it be as good as I believe it to be, there will come a time when it has its reward. The better way I
                    think will be to print it in a pocket volume, &amp; let it take its chance. 200 pages will hold the poem &amp; about 150 more the

                    against the friends of Sir John Moore, in the shape of a reviewal of James Moores books,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), the British commander of the British forces in the Peninsular, was killed in battle at Corunna on 16 January 1809
                        after a disastrous retreat. Southey was highly critical of Moore&#8217;s conduct, accusing him, for example, of forming &#8216;unjust and
                        self-paralysing prejudices against the Spanish people&#8217;, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 479.
                        James Moore (1762&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>), defended his elder brother&#8217;s conduct in <title>A Narrative of the Campaign of the
                            British Army in Spain</title> (1809). Southey did not write an article on this subject.</note> in the Quarterly, &amp; if
                    this offer be accepted I shall make some use of these letters of yours. Wordsworth has written upon the Cintra Convention &amp;

                        published, in <title>The Courier</title>, an article condemning the Convention. In May 1809 Longmans published the article as
