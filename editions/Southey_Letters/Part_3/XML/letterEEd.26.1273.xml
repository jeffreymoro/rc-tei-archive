        <p rend="indent1"> I am writing all the letters to my Barker, says <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> this morning
                    (my Barker she always calls you, &amp; always adds &#8211; will she come again) It is time for conscience-sake that I should follow my
                    daughter&#8217;s example.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A great deal has happened to change my plans for the ensuing campaign. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">My Uncle</ref> wrote me two pressing letters two days running, to send for his papers
                    upon Brazil, to offer the information which they contain to Government &#8211; &amp; to lose no time in bringing forward that part of my
                    history. I wrote accordingly to <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> For
                        this, see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, [15 December 1806], Letter 1243.</note> proffering thro him to <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord Grenville</ref>,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lord Grenville, Wynn&#8217;s
                        maternal uncle, Prime Minister. His administration fell in March 1807.</note> more information concerning the interior of
                    South America than probably any other individual in Europe possesses &#8211; except one Frenchman &#8211; who has seen these very papers.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The identity of this French cleric is unclear. It is likely that he was Abb&#233; Francois
                        Garnier (1722&#8211;1804), the long-standing chaplain to the French factory in Lisbon. A less likely possibility is Abb&#233;
                        Jean-Antoine Dubois (1765&#8211;1848), a French Catholic missionary in India, whose long sojourn in the southern districts
                        brought him into contact with the legacy of Portuguese Catholic colonialism there. Dubois&#8217;s manuscript history of Indian
                        religion was purchased by the East India Company and published in English as <title>Description of the Character, Manners and
                            Customs of the People of India, and of their Institutions, Religious and Civil</title> (1816).</note> Lord G.s answer was
                    (I am writing secrets Senhora, not to go beyond yourself) that my information seemed to relate to the wrong side of S. America &#8211;
                    which was not a very wise answer &#8211; for it related to the state of the interior, which would show him how far schemes of conquest
                    are feasable (he may as well think of conquering the Moon &amp; making his Majesty the Man of it) &#8211; &amp; it would also show him
                    the whole detail of the Brazilian mines, &amp; teach him the necessity of putting those endless resources in security from France.
                    But no matter &#8211; the answer suits me better than a more politic one would have done, for God knows I have no wish to draw up
                    memorials for statesmen. The way to instruct them is thro the people, &#8211; truth gets at them in that way in about fifty years. He
                    added advice to me to lay aside every other literary pursuit &amp; give this information to the public as soon as I could, &#8211;
                    because it would be so advantageous to <del>him</del> myself, &#8211; &amp; said that government had no wish to keep any such things
                    secret but rather wished them to be generally known. Of which the English is that they like to be guided by public opinion, &amp;
                    that Senhora is good English, &amp; as it should be.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Well &#8211; here are the Mss. arrived from London &#8211; a most invaluable collection &#8211; which would show you that <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> is as indefatiguable as I am, &amp; that the good blood in my veins comes
                    from that side. here are my books about Brazil from London &amp; from Bristol &#8211; this very day Feby. 1. I have begun &#8211; &amp; here
