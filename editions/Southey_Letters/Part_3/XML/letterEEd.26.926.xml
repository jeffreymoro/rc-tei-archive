        <p rend="indent1"> I am transcribing the first part of Madoc, designing to leave it in London with the printers,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Madoc</title> (1805), which Southey had written in 1797&#8211;1799 and was revising for publication, was in fact printed by

        <p rend="indent1"> Politics are indeed become very interesting. I look with rather more apprehension to the enormous extent of our
                    East Indian empire, &amp; the sulky selfishness of our West Indian planters, than to any effects that invasion can produce, if
                    indeed Bonaparte does design to invade us &#8211; &amp; if he be permitted to live to carry his design into execution. Pichegru was
                    probably murdered. it does not appear to me a practicable mode of suicide. one convulsive motion might have slipt the stick &amp;
                    loosened the handkerchief, &amp; there was a motive for murdering him.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean-Charles
                        Pichegru (1761&#8211;1804): a French Revolutionary general, victor over the Austrians and British, who became a royalist. He planned
                        a coup d&#8217;etat in 1797, was imprisoned, escaped to Britain in 1798, and returned to Paris in August 1803 to head an uprising
                        against Napoleon Bonaparte. He was betrayed and arrested on 28 February 1804, and found strangled in prison on 5 April.</note>
                    if it was dangerous to execute the Duc d Enghein<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duke of
                        Enghien (1772&#8211;21 March 1804): a Prince of the Blood, Enghien fought against the revolution from exile in Baden, just across
                        the Rhine from France. In March 1804, suspecting him (erroneously) of involvement in Pichegru&#8217;s plot, Napoleon had him
                        kidnapped and brought to Paris, where he was executed.</note> by day light, it would be still more dangerous to put to death
                    publicly men who like Pichegru &amp; Moreau have actually saved France.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean Moreau
                        (1763&#8211;1813), a French Revolutionary general, jailed on 15 February 1804 for his supposed involvement in Pichegru&#8217;s royalist
                        plot against Napoleon&#8217;s life.</note> You remember telling me what P. said of poor Lord Camelford,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford (1775&#8211;10 March 1804), was the cousin of William Pitt (1759&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1783&#8211;1801, 1804&#8211;1806. He served in the Royal
                        Navy from an early age and his career was punctuated by acts of insubordination and violence, including the cold blooded
                        killing of a fellow officer in a dispute about rank. An habitual duellist, Pitt died of a wound sustained on 7 March 1804 in a
                        duel with a friend that both men felt bound by honour to fight. &#8216;P.&#8217; has not been identified.</note> &amp; now they are both

                    to 1745 &#8211; &amp; the very practice of this very country during the last war. As for the assassination of Bonaparte being part of
                    the plot &#8211; the plot was to overthrow his power, &amp; if when you kickd him from his throne, his neck happened to break in the
                    fall &#8211; that was a contingency. But the follies of public opinion form a perpetual comment upon the text of straining at a gnat

                    volume. In reviewing I have merely stuck to my text &amp; demolished a heap of sophistry &#8211; but the subject as it relates to this
                    country is of exceeding importance, &amp; I feel that I could produce something upon it which should deserve to be remembered
                    hereafter.</p>
