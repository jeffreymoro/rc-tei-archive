        <p rend="indent1"> So far is your sheet of Butlerology from having convinced me that what I want you to perform is impracticable, that
                    it is on the contrary sufficient proof how easily &amp; triumphantly you could perform it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey refers to comic inventions which originated in schoolboy stories at Westminster. They were never published by
                        Bedford, but provided the hint for Southey&#8217;s comic novel/ miscellany <title>The Doctor</title> (1834&#8211;1847).</note> Write me
                    half a dozen such, &amp; then if you do not feel your own strength &amp; go on of your own accord, you shall have no more of my
                    objurgatory advice. Set out upon the heroic principle of writing all the odd things that come into your head: it will be easy
                    enough to pen a satirical allusion to the tail of some five or six of them, &amp; these being plain, the whole will pass for a
                    profound satire. Rabelais,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Fran&#231;ois Rabelais (c. 1494&#8211;1553) was a writer of fantasy,
                        satire and the grotesque in works such as <title>Gargantua and Pantagruel</title>.</note> Grosvenor, was but a type of what
                    you may be if you will but take courage &amp; write on.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If <ref target="people.html#RobertsBarreCharles">Barr&#233; Roberts</ref> have any consumptive symptoms it is trifling
                    with his life to let him stop short of Lisbon; there he should go in October, &#8211; &amp; if he goes before the disease has taken root
                    he will be saved.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We are here in great agitation about news of a victory which has reached Edinburgh &amp; set the Castle Guns
                    firing, &amp; the whole streets blazing with bonfires. God send that the Scotchmen may not have been premature in their
                    rejoicings. Be that as it may things look well, &amp; must end well if the peace mongers here &amp; in Austria do not prevent that
                    good issue which perseverance is sure to meet with in a good cause.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Britain and Austria
                        were in alliance against France in 1809, but Napoleon advanced into Austria where he suffered a significant defeat at the
                        battle of Aspern-Essling (22 May 1809). The Austrians failed to follow up this victory, which allowed Napoleon to seize the
                        capital, Vienna, in early July. The Austrians were then defeated by the French at the battle of Wagram on 5&#8211;6 July
                        1809.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Dickenson<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Dickinson (1771&#8211;1837), a pupil at Westminster School,
                        who later went on to Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1793, MA 1795). He was Civil Lord of the Admiralty 1804&#8211;1806.</note> has been
                    here &#8211; I dined with him not having seen him since the year 1792. He spoke as if he knew there was an intention of serving me,
                    saying he should not wonder if the secretary ship at Lisbon was to be offered me. This Grosvenor you must at once perceive is no
                    longer an object. It is but 100 a year more than any pension, &amp; I could not live upon it. <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</ref>  tells me the Stewardship to Greenwich for the Derwentwater Estates now

                    soon to be vacated by his death, &amp; this he has advised me to ask for.

                        these letters, see Southey to Walter Scott, 6 July 1809 (Letter 1648) and Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 8 July 1809
                        (Letter 1651).</note> Being on the spot it would suit me well &amp; it would please me well, inasmuch as it would give me the
                    power of preserving the woods, &amp; improving both the property &amp; this beautiful place by planting. That I shall get it is
                    not however very likely.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey asked several friends to intercede on his behalf for
                        this position, but in the end it was considered to be unsuitable for him; see Southey to Walter Scott, 8 August 1809 (Letter
                        1666) and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 12 August 1809 (Letter 1669).</note> It may be already promised, it may not be

        <p rend="indent1"> One of my desperate summer colds has seized me by the nose, &amp; there it has been these three weeks resisting all
                    modes of cure. To day I have again been trying to wash it off in the cold bath. It stops Kehama,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
