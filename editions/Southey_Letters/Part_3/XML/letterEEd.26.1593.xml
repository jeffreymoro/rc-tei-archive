          <salute>Dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> It was well that <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> very handsome letter inclosing sweet
                    remuneration in the shape of L 21.13. arrived a few hours after the Quarterly itself. For when I beheld the cruel mutilation which
                    my poor article had suffered,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey reviewed the <title>Transactions of the Missionary
                            Society in the South Sea Islands</title> in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 2 (August 1809), 24&#8211;61, but there are no
                        reviews by him on the South African missions.</note> &amp; saw how dexterously he had <del>no xxx xxx</del> cut every thing
                    down to the standard of orthodoxy, &#8211; in spite of all former experience of the sow-gelding propensities of Review-Editors, I was on
                    the point of vowing a vow that nothing should ever again induce me to send my opinions <del>to be</del> for revision &amp;
                    correction at <del>xxx</del> &lt;an&gt; Inquisition. Anger does not last long with me; &#8211; it is some comfort that he has only <hi rend="ital">implied</hi> for me an assent to Doctrines which I disbelieve, for <del>that</del> &lt;had&gt; there been an
                    express belief asserted, that, even I, should not have borne. So upon taking into consideration the number of sound &amp; orthodox
                    divines, Doctors, Deans, yea haply Bishops, &#8211; who <del>on</del> will read this good Review with their wigs on, I began to think
                    him not unwise in expunging things which might have made those wigs start off, abhorrent of my heresies. I have returned an answer
                    of perfect acquiescence; &#8211; observing only that the printer has jostled one paragraph out of its place, &amp; that the beginning of
                    another is made nonsensical, by the omission of what proceeded it in the Manuscript.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                        Southey to William Gifford, dated 6 March 1809.</note> &#8211; This is the danger of omissions, &#8211; they are sure, in any thing which
                    is carefully &lt;&amp; philosophically&gt; written, to injure the train of reasoning, &#8211; or break the chain of thought, or
                    dislocate the connection of language. I could show you some striking instances in this case.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Cid is ill done.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>The Chronicle of the Cid</title>
                        (1808) was reviewed by <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 1 (February
                        1809), 117&#8211;134.</note> In the first place, there is not the slightest intimation given of the age of the book, &#8211; that it is
                    considerably older than any thing either in French or English literature. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> seems
                    to have forgotten this, or he would not have compared the Cid with Froissarts<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean

                        1327&#8211;1377.</note> The sin which most easily besets a Reviewer (&amp; which I hold to be a very great one) is that of taking
                    credit to himself for knowledge which he does not possess. What are the <hi rend="ital">words</hi> which I have misunderstood?
                    would they not have been pointed out if the Reviewer had known them? &#8211; <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> himself
