                    done for me!<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey is referring to his joint project with Bedford, published with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 1807 as <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>. It was
                        intended as a companion work to George Ellis, <title>Specimens of the Early English Poets</title> (1790, 2nd edn 1801, 3rd edn

                    paper. I shall be censured for it, &amp; very justly. the sixth stanza in 200 ought to have been prest into the previous page. All
                    that rascally spread of blanks 206 &#8211; occasions such another piece of fat 212. all this costs paper &amp; the price of printing,
                    looks damnably ill, &amp; exposes me to that very kind of censure which of all other I most dislike &amp; least deserve. Why have
                    you left out in Sheffields epitaph the <hi rend="ital">Christum adveneror</hi> which gives it its whole character &amp;
                    characterizes him too?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby (1647&#8211;1721;
                            <title>DNB</title>): politician and author. See <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>, 3 vols (London,
                        1807), I, p. 219, where the Latin epitaph is quoted with these words, meaning, &#8216;venerator of Christ&#8217;, replaced by a dash. In
                        fact, Bedford had copied the inscription as it appeared on Buckingham&#8217;s monument. According to William Betham, <title>The
                            Baronetage of England: or The History of the English Baronets</title>, 5 vols (London, 1801&#8211;1805), III, p. 251, &#8216;the words,
                        &#8220;Christum adveneror,&#8221; are omitted, at the desire, as is said, of bishop Atterbury, who thought the verb <hi rend="ital">adveneror</hi> not full enough, as applied to Christ. Great clamours were raised against this epitaph, many asserting
                        that it proved the Duke a sceptic; and as great a trifle as it may seem, his grace&#8217;s orthodoxy became the subject of a
                        controversy: it was, however, defended in form by Dr. Fiddes, in &#8220;A Letter to a Freethinker,&#8221; 1721&#8217;. See also Southey to
                        Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 26 August 1805, Letter 1098.</note> I am not sorry for the <hi rend="ital">b</hi> in improbus<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning &#8216;wicked&#8217;, &#8216;inferior&#8217; or &#8216;outrageous&#8217;.</note> as it makes one easily resolve to
                    cancel the leaf, &amp; so restore the phrase, &#8211; of which I suppose you have been afraid. There must be another cancel too of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gildons finish to his poem.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Gildon (c.1665&#8211;1724;

                    his poems might advantageously receive their golden mead. When you fill the blank page, leave as little blank in it as you can.
