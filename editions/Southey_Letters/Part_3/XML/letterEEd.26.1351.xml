        <p rend="indent1"> On my return last night from <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyds</ref>
          <del>where</del> &lt;with whom&gt; I past three days (partly for the sake of curing an obstinate cold by deign of air &amp;
                    exercise &amp; partly for the sake of getting to our nearest large town which lies a step beyond him) I found a letter from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>; telling me that the <del>hospital x</del> hospital surgeon is now of opinion with
                    the physician of the fleet that it is absolutely necessary for him to go into the country, &#8211; this has been duly notified to the
                    Admiralty, &amp; their answer, which was expected on Wednesday last would set him off on his way. Thus this matter has ended after
                    having given me quite as much vexation as I ever allow myself to feel.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> For a fuller
                        account of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas Southey&#8217;s</ref> health problems, see Southey to John May, 12 August

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I found also an importation of books containing those for which I waited expecting the Cid, &amp; some of great
                    importance respecting South America.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had been sent books from Lisbon by his uncle

                    farther delay, to open a negociation with the <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Long-Men</ref> of literature, &amp; send it
                    to press. The notes must inevitably be placed at the end because so much will be to be gleaned for them from Ld Hollands

                    which I shall feel proud, &amp; for the appearance of which I am a little impatient, as being the first fruits of a long

                    matter for a melancholy concluding chapter. The frantic folly of their proceedings &amp; views in that quarter is so monstrous,
                    that the very excess of abhorrence &amp; contempt which I feel for such policy, will sufficiently set me on my guard, &amp; make
                    me write with as much temper &amp; coolness as severity. Sir Home Popham<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> In June 1806,
                        with Spain, the colonial master of South America, under French sway and Britain&#8217;s enemy, a force under Admiral Sir Home Riggs
                        Popham (1762&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) and William Carr Beresford (1768&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>), occupied Buenos Aires and
                        held it until 14 August. On 3 February 1807 the attack was renewed when the British took Montevideo from the sea. In July a
                        British attempt to retake Buenos Aires was repulsed with great loss of life.</note> might have done very well in the

                            <title>DNB</title>), buccaneer and circumnavigator.</note> As for keeping any conquests in that part of the world, there
                    is a case in point which is perfectly decisive &#8211; that of the Dutch in Brazil, &#8211; turned out of provinces which had been ceded to
                    them by treaty, when they had been settled about twenty years, &amp; which they had managed ten times better than we should manage
                    them; but the Portugueze &amp; the concerted natives could not bear the dominion of heretics, &amp; they were expelled by these
                    insurgents, without any aid from Portugal. The case is precisely in point, as has been already pretty plainly proved at Buenos
                    Ayres. We might have insisted upon a free trade with the Spanish colonies at peace, &#8211; or we might have guaranteed to them their
                    independence during war; Of three possible modes of conduct two were good, &amp; therefore we blundered upon the third. Oh that
