        <p rend="indent1"> The vile cold which had just commenced its operations when you left us, is I hope now ending them. The fountains of
                    my head are choaked up, &#8211; which is a previous step to their drying up, &amp; I am resuming my regular employments after this
                    unaccountable interruption. This morning I finished that section of Kehama which was begun while you were here, &amp; which
                    continues with laying Ladurlad in the Ship of Heaven.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810), Book 7.</note> What ship&#8217;s that, you will not say upon this occasion, inasmuch as
                    you know something about her, <del>&amp;</del> her commander, &amp; her crew. Tomorrow I land them above the great magnet rock at
                    the North Pole, &#8211; &amp; <del>that</del> &lt;this next&gt; section will have nothing but images of beauty.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Where can <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> be? I have been daily hoping to hear from her,
                    &amp; to hear that she was coming this way, &#8211; as there can be nothing but the journey now to prevent her.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> She had been turned out of her home with him by her brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Thomas</ref>.</note> As for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">him</ref>, we must disinherit him, that&#8217;s
                    certain, &#8211; nobody will take him at half-price, &amp; the Devil has my consent to take him for nothing. This last freak is quite
                    unaccountable, he behaved to me as civilly as was in his nature, &amp; I thought was disposed to do so to all of us. There must
                    surely Tom be some twist in the head both in his case &amp; his <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">brothers</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">

                    out very well, &amp; our domestic <del>xx</del> affairs are very much improved by the change. the two young<del>er</del> ones have
                    just had the cow pock.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Who&#8217;s this for? said I to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</ref> last night, when the third kiss was
                    given me on going to bed. For Uncle. What am I to do with it? &#8211; Send it in a letter. How am I to send it? &#8211; Put it in the letter.
                    How am I to put it? Write it in the letter, &#8211; after half a minutes consideration. &#8211; Be pleased therefore to take notice, that
                    there is a kiss inclosed herein, for every night since you went away.</p>

                            Verdadeira, que elle escreve em Cantos Lyricos</title> (1780).</note> &#8211; by far the most curious &amp; interesting poem in
                    the Portugueze language. These are sweet lines, &amp; describe a sort of psalm-singing quite in unison with my feelings. &#8211; I shall
                    work steadily on with these Letters &#8211; beginning a great many at once, as I did with D Manuel,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> See note 8.</note> &#8211; &amp; I shall send them to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> to
