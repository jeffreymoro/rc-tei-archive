                    it separately in one little five shilling volume, &#8211; because it is not so essentially necessary to the history as perhaps it ought

                    But to do this I should want four books from Bristol &amp; Heaven knows how you would find them, however I will mention what they

                    I shall be gathered together. Labour as hard as I will I seem equally far off from the point to which I am aiming. &#8211; <hi rend="ital">Our</hi> Letters<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    town. I work at them &#8211; not very rapidly, &#8211; to speak truth very slowly &#8211; but what is done satisfies me &amp; will please you; &amp;

                    it will pay me in the end by its consequences &#8211; but upon its profits I reckon nothing. There will be a second edition certainly &#8211;

                    charitably design to buy the first, &amp; in fact the corrections will not be important. How many persons who would give me five
