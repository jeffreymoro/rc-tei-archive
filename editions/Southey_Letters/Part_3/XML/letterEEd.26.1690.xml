        <p rend="indent1"> I had begun to write in enquiry what was become of you, when your letter arrived, nearly three weeks after its
                    date: &#8722; mine probably would have been finished &amp; dispatched before that time, &#8722;&#8722; had it not been for a growing uneasiness
                    respecting the Dutchess of Gordon,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The East Indiaman ship, <title>Jane, Duchess of
                            Gordon</title>, (first launched 1804) was lost during a voyage to Ceylon and Bengal, having been last sighted off the
                        coast of Mauritius in March 1809. Betham&#8217;s brother Edward (dates unknown) was among the drowned.</note> &#8722; which made me put it
                    off from day to day, in daily hope that the next paper might enable me to congratulate you upon good news. There is this good
                    &amp; substantial ground of hope that so many ships are missing: their number rendering it less likely that they should be lost,
                    &amp; more likely that they should be captured. This I think is to be expected, &#8722; &amp; the evil in this case will have some
                    mitigation, because prisoners taken in the E or W Indies are exchanged.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We missed you when you left us. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> has not yet <del>xx</del>
                    ceased to ask where is Miss Betham gone? &amp; why did she go? &#8722; to which he adds frequent enquiries concerning his boy &#8211; what is
                    to be done to him, &amp; when he is to be put. We were dreadfully alarmed about him on Thursday last &#8211; When <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">his mother</ref> went up as usual, the last thing at night, to look at him. &#8211; she
                    heard the croup sound in his throat. &#8722; &amp; you may conceive the agitation into which it threw us. But it seems that the disease
                    wears itself out when it does not prove fatal at first, &amp; it appears to be got under, God be praised, without the necessity of
                        <del>xxx</del> recurring to those remedies which so greatly tormented &amp; reduced him before. Poor fellow, &#8722; I have so deep
                    &amp; ever-present a sense of the precariousness of an infants life, &#8722; that had you talked of taking his picture before me, I
                    believe I should have tried to invent some excuse <del>for</del> why it should not be done, &#8722; when the real reason would have been
                    &#8211; a secret dread lest it should ever become to me an object of pain. He will not be persuaded that his father loves him too much,
                    &#8722; but his father is very well convinced of it himself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#FrickerMartha">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Lovell</ref>  has been a month from home. She went first
                    to the <ref target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouses</ref>, &amp; they have persuaded her to go to Gilsland<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The village of Gilsland in Cumbria is situated northeast of Carlisle.</note> &amp; try
                    the waters there, &#8211; it is a place about 50 miles from hence, where a few people go because they are unwell, &amp; a great many
                    because they are idle: &amp; there she is at present. Poor <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> lingered some
                    eight or ten days after you left us, &amp; was then released. I saw him laid to rest, &amp; wore black <del>f</del> as the only
                    mark of respect for him which it was in my power to show till a day or two ago, when I became impatient of being longer with dirty
                    hands. <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> arrived here on Thursday last, &amp; departs tomorrow. &#8211; This is the
                    history of our proceedings since your departure.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You were here in an unlucky season, &amp; I am vexed that it should have been so, &#8722; but I hope &amp; trust it will
                    not be your only visit to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> &#8722; &amp; that when next you come we shall be better
                    provided both with weather &amp; society for you. It was very much my wish that you would have planned a poem here, when I might
                    have scrutinized its defects with the severest sincerity; &#8722; five minutes may alter that in a plan, which when executed becomes
                    unalterable, &#8722; I did not press this upon you &#8722; as I would have done at any other time, because I was aware that then you were more
                    uneasy respecting your brother than you expressed yourself to be, &#8722; &amp; this I fear will for a long while <del>xxx</del> be the
