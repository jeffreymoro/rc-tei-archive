        <p rend="indent1"> There are two very valid reasons why I should write the biography of Thomas Day: because you grievously mistake the
                    drift of Sandford &amp; Merton, which is written not for the inferior ranks, but for the higher ones. If such books could be in
                    the hands of the poor, &amp; they could comprehend them &#8211; all that such men as Day <del>xxxx</del> desire would already be
                        accomplished.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Day (1748&#8211;1789; <title>DNB</title>), writer of instructive

                        included in <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>, 3 vols (London, 1807), III, pp. 308&#8211;316.</note> I think very
                    highly of him &amp; must speak of him as I think. Besides this duty in conscience I am intimate with a family nearly connected
