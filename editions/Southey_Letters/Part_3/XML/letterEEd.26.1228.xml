                        ‘apparatus’ which is likely to have been an early version of carbon paper, first patented by Ralph Wedgwood (1766–1837) on 7
                        October 1806 as the ‘stylographic manifold writer’; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 9 October [1806], Letter
                        1223.</note> – some contrivance is wanted to keep the under paper from slipping, tho perhaps the habit of using it may render
                    it less needful. The invention has the merit of being very simple, &amp; I expect sometimes to find it very useful. </p><p rend="indent1"> I am deeply obliged by what you have done for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref>. He is now at
                    Taunton with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">his Uncle</ref> &amp; namesake. The estate which has been left to a
                    stranger lets for 500£ a year, &amp; this it seems is what I was heir at law to, for in the Vale of Taunton, where the rest of the
                    land lay Borough English prevails. My <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">younger brother</ref> is therefore presumptive heir
                    – whose history I may as well bring down to the present time – After thrice leaving the navy he obtained a commission in the
                    Caermarthenshire Militia, from which he has now been dismissed – it is said for plundering some French prisoners under his guard!,
                    – &amp; is now turned strolling player under the name of Smith. – What a career for one who is not yet 18!</p><p rend="indent1"> Surely this rocket expedition is something more than foolish. The French have only to take sure aim with these very
                        rockets<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> During the night of 7–8 October 1806, eighteen British boats carrying rockets
                        on launching frames rowed into the bay of Boulogne to destroy French invasion barges moored there. The attack caused more
                        damage to the town than the fleet, and Napoleon initiated a rocket-making scheme for his own forces in retaliation.</note> –
                    (for it is absurd to suppose any such invention can be kept secret) – &amp; half a dozen gun boats may destroy our fleet. Our
                        seventy-four<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ‘seventy-four’ was a two-decked sailing ship of the line, so named
                        because it carried 74 guns. It was originally developed by the French in the mid-eighteenth century and was adopted by many
                        countries, including Britain.</note> in the Gut of Gibraltar<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The bay of
                        Gibraltar.</note> have often been endangered by gun boats which they cannot strike, &amp; to which they present a dead mark.

                        that fired large projectiles at great distances.</note> – &amp; our naval superiority is at an end.</p><p rend="indent1"> Do not forget to make enquiries respecting the duty on books. You must know better than I whether the P. court is
                    to remove<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Portugueze royal family and the court escaped from Lisbon to Brazil on 29
                        November 1807, with British assistance, just before Napoleon’s forces captured the city on 1 December 1807.</note> – I am
                    strongly inclined to think <del>xxx</del> &lt;it&gt; will &amp; that in consequence <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        Uncle’s</ref> library must ere long be sent over to England.</p><p rend="indent1"> The fact respecting Palmerin seems to be this – that the French &amp; Italian translations were printed before the
                    Port: original.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> This text was written by the Portuguese writer Francisco de Moraes Cabral
                        (1500–1572) but first published in Spanish in 1547. A French translation of it was published at Lyons in 1553, and an Italian
                        one at Venice in 1555. It was published in Portuguese in 1567.</note> If certain blunders in the English version be in there
                    also the point will be decided, &amp; this I can get <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> to examine for me

Nothing more is required as <hi rend="ital">data</hi> than one splendid event, characters of sufficient interest, &amp; a final issue of sufficient
                    importance. This is all which one need ask from history. My characters would be these. Pelayo – a hero of fifty, – on whom I could
                    throw a new interest by making him not so much a Goth as a Cantabrian, – an ancient-Briton-Spaniard, – for which there is
                    authority enough for my purpose. His daughter Ormisinda, Munuza the tributary governor who chuses to have her for his wife, &amp;
                    so irritates Pelayo to revolt. Young Alonso, who married her &amp; became King in her right, Count Julian &amp; Oppas among the
                    Moors. Egilona the Queen of Rodrigo, now wife of a Moorish chief. Rodrigo himself as a hermit, &amp; Florinda – in a state of half
                    derangement, finally killing herself in her fathers sight. The storming of Gijon, the death of Munuza &amp; the marriage of Alonso
                    would form the conclusion.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Characters in <title>Roderick, The Last of the
