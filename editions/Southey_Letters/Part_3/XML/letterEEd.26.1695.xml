        <p rend="indent1"> I have got from an Edinburgh Catalogue the <title>Historiale Description de l&#8217;Ethiopia</title>, Anvers 1558 &#8211; a
                    title tempting enough to make me send for it tho I suspected it might be what it has proved &#8211; a translation of Fr. Alvares. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francisco &#193;lvares (c. 1465&#8211;1536/1541): Portuguese missionary. Southey owned a Portuguese
                        copy of his narrative <title>Verdadera Informac&#257;om das Terras do Preste Joam</title> (1540), no. 3305 in the sale catalogue of
                        his library, as well as the French translation he refers to here, <title>Historiale Description de l&#8217;Ethiopie</title> (1558),
                        which was no. 37 in the catalogue.</note> It is however translated from Ramusio<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Giovanni Battista Ramusio (1485&#8211;1557), <title>Delle Navigationi et Viaggi</title> (1556&#8211;1588), no. 2382 of the sale catalogue
                        of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; who it seems collated the printed copy with a MS. which he borrowed from Damiam de Goes,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dami&#227;o de Goes (1502&#8211;1574), <title>Fides, Religio, Moresque Aethiopum</title>
                        (1544).</note> &amp; finding them very different, composed his version from the two. Prefixed are two letters by Andres
                        Corsal,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Italian explorer Andrea Corsali (b. 1487). Two of his letters were
                        included in Ramusio&#8217;s <title>Delle Navigationi et Viaggi</title>.</note> &#8211; a Florentine who sent out in the same fleet with
                    Mathias &amp; Duarte Galvam.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Portuguese diplomat Duarte Galv&#227;o (1435&#8211;1517) who was
                        employed at the court of Manuel I (1469&#8211;1521; King of Portugal 1495&#8211;1521). Manuel&#8217;s reign was notable for creating a vast
                        overseas empire and sponsoring missions to the new Portuguese colonies. In 1513 Galv&#227;o brought the Ethiopian ambassador,
                        Mathias (or Mateus, also known as Matthew the Armenian (d. 1520)) to Lisbon to strengthen religious ties between the
                        countries.</note> These also are from Ramusio.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> From the same Catalogue I have procured Urretas Hist. of Ethiopia,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Luis de
                        Urreta (c. 1570&#8211;1636), <title>Historia Eclesiastica, Politica, Natural, y Moral de los Grandes y Remotos Reynos de la Etiopia,
                            Monarchia del Emperador, llamado Preste Iuan de la Indias</title> (1610). This was no. 3777 in the sale catalogue of
                        Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; but this incomparable liar also published two histories in two succeeding years,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Urreta&#8217;s other history was <title>Historia de la Sagrada Orden de Predicadores, en los Remotos
                            Reynos de la Etopia</title> (1611), a continuation of his earlier one of 1610.</note> &amp; this is not the one which
                    Geddes describes.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Michael Geddes (c.1647&#8211;1713; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The
                            Church-history of Ethiopia</title> (1694).</note> I am inclined to think however that they are not different works as
                    would appear by Nic. Antonio,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Nicol&#225;s Antonio (1617&#8211;1684) was a Spanish bibliographer, who
                        published several editions of his <title>Bibliotheca Hispana</title>.</note> but that he amplified the second edition with a
                    stuffing of fresh lies, &amp; altered the title. This copy like several other books which I have picked up, bears the stamp of the
                    Lamoignon Library.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Lamoignons were an illustrious French family, with many
