          <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your parcel reached me on Sunday evening, and I have perused every line of its contents with deep and painful
                    interest. The letters, and your account (of which I should say much were I writing to any other person), have made me thoroughly
                    acquainted with one of the most amiable and most admirable human beings that ever was ripened upon earth for heaven. Be assured
                    that I will not insert a sentence which can give pain or offence to anyone. There will come a time (and God only knows how soon it
                    may come) when some one will perform that office for me, which I am now performing for your incomparable <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">brother</ref> ; and I shall endeavour to show how that office ought to
                    be performed. I will be scrupulously careful; and if, when the papers pass through your hands, you should think I have not been
                    sufficiently so, I beg you will, without hesitation, expunge whatever may appear exceptionable. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">.&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160;
                    &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

                    the impulse which led me to undertake this task,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> That of compiling <title>Remains of
                            Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham</title>, 2 vols (1807).</note> it was from a knowledge that <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry White</ref> had left behind him an example, which ought not to be lost, of
                    well-directed talents, and that, in performing an act of respect to his memory, I should at the same time hold up the example to
                    others who have the up-hill paths of life to tread. No person can be more thoroughy convinced that goodness is a better thing than
                    genius, and that genius is no excuse for those follies and offences which are called its eccentricities. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The mention made in my last of any difference in religious opinions from your brother was merely incidental;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had remarked on <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry Kirke
                            White&#8217;s</ref> evangelical connections; see Southey to Neville White, 3 February 1807, Letter 1271.</note> nor is it by any
                    means my intention to say any more upon the subject than simply to state that those opinions are not mine, lest it should be
                    supposed they were, from the manner in which I speak of him. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall now proceed as speedily as I can with the work.</p>
