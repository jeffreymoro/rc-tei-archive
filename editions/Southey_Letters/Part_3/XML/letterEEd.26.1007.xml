                        Southey and his brother Harry were reviewing Robert Charles Dallas (1754&#8211;1824), <title>Aubrey: a Novel</title> (1804) for the
                            <title>Annual Review</title>. The review included Southey&#8217;s anecdote about Causey Pike in the Newlands valley, south of
                            <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> and visible from <ref target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref>.
                        Seen from Derwentwater, it displays a prominent bump on the ridge line near the summit and was named &#8216;Georgris&#8217; because the
                        bump made it resemble George III (1738&#8211;1820, King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) in profile; see Southey to
                        John Rickman, 15 October 1804, Letter 983. Though a review of <title>Aubrey</title> did appear (in the <title>Annual Review
                            for 1804</title>, 3 (1805), 551&#8211;553) it does not seem to have been by Southey according to letter 1093 of this edition
