        <p rend="indent1"> The worst part of your letter is that which relates to your own health; look well to that &amp; Time will do the
                    rest. It is better to have <del>a sister dead than that</del> &#8211; that is certain, &#8211; but it is better <del>to have her dead than
                        miserable</del>, &#8211; than for instance to have her years in dying of a cancer, or what is worse of a broken heart from the ill
                    usage of a husband, like <ref target="people.html#GonneMrs">Mrs Gonnes</ref> sister. I am very glad you thought of <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref>, &#8211; he is truly a kind hearted man, &amp; even his profession has not

                    human skill. He is no favourite of mine, but of his talents I have the highest possible opinion. &#8211; It is useless to afflict
                    yourself. Against this calamity, &amp; against still greater ones you can bear up, &amp; must bear up. Did you ever read Mrs
                    Carters Epictetus?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Epictetus</title> (AD 55&#8211;AD 135), the Stoic philosopher, was
                        translated by Elizabeth Carter (1717&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Works of Epictetus</title>, the fourth edition
                        appearing in 1807.</note> &#8211; next to the bible it is the best practical book &amp; the truest philosophy, in existence. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As for your damned <del>cousins or uncles</del> or whatever they be I could wring their necks off, &#8211; &amp; if
                        <del>xxx</del> were in my hands his would be in some danger,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The cause of the
                        family squabble is not known, but may have related to the estate and the business of Barker&#8217;s father, Thomas Barker (dates
                        unknown), an ironmaster in <ref target="places.html#Congreve">Congreve</ref>, Staffordshire, who died in September 1806. Her
                        brother Frederick (dates unknown) took over the running of the business.</note> &#8211;<del> xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx</del> &#8211;
                    This cause of trouble however time will wear down: the first thing the human mind does under any affliction, is to set about
                    bearing it, &#8211; as instinctively &amp; as surely as <hi rend="ital">life</hi> sets about healing a cut as soon as it is inflicted, &#8211;
                    &amp; happily few mental wounds are mortal. What other evils you allude to of course I cannot guess, &amp; perhaps if I knew them
                    should not allow that they were such as ought to make you unhappy. &#8211; Look to your health, &amp; as soon as you can <del>xxx xxx

                    of comforters or buckets full of physic.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have now much to tell you concerning myself &#8211; &amp; had indeed begun to tell it you in a more playfull mood. Know
                    then that I am settled at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, for an indefinite time, with no prospect of removing
                    from it. Some plans of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> made it necessary for me either to
                    determine upon quitting <ref target="places.html#GretaHall">this house</ref> at a given time or upon remaining with it.
                    The first I could not do, for want of means &#8211; which is in plain English for want of money; so I determined upon the second, &amp;
                    it so happens that this topsey-turvey in the ministry has made me well satisfied with my choice.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, who held office in the Ministry of All the Talents,
                        procured for Southey, as it fell in March, a state pension, since his chance of obtaining employment in Portugal would lapse
                        with Wynn&#8217;s departure from government.</note> Of course my prospects are gone out with them &#8211; hopes I will not call them, for
                    I never thought enough about them for them to become hopes, &#8211; &amp; to confess the truth like best to be left alone &amp; not put
                    out of my way. Well, &#8211; <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> procured for me &#8216;out of the fire&#8217; as he says, the offer
                    of a place in the West Indies<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The post of Register of the Vice-Admiralty Court of St.
                        Lucia.</note> worth 600&#163; a year, &#8211; which he refused for me &#8211; as there was no time for my answer.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, [25 March 1807], Letter 1298.</note> Instead he has got me a
                    pension of 200&#163; &#8211; (by the Lord Senhora you <hi rend="ital">shall</hi> smile at my having a pension from the Treasury.) You may
                    congratulate me, &#8211; but not upon an accession of fortune; &#8211; for the truth is that hitherto I have received 160&#163; a year from <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> (which is all I have except what I earn) &#8211; &amp; that now of course I shall
                    receive this no longer, &#8211; for <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> is not a rich man. And as his Majesty is
                    graciously pleased to give me 200, so is he graciously pleased to stop 56&#163; <del>xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx</del> out of it for fees &amp;
                    taxes, &amp; eke &#8211; also to pay it so irregularly, that I am told he who is only a quarter in arrears is in good luck. I am
                    therefore a loser by this bounty of 16&#163; a year during the war; When the income tax is taken off I shall be 4&#163; a gainer &#8211; but
                    always have the inconvenience of uncertain remittances. I gain by it in as much as I cease to receive any fresh obligations, &#8211; tho
                    it would be absurd to say there was much pain in this &#8211; for in such cases I just take as I would give. Had Wynn <ref target="people.html#WynnSirWatkinWilliams">his brothers</ref> fortune, or were he still a single man
                    with his own, I should even have preferred receiving from him rather than from the public &#8211; but as it is, it is best as it is.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Accordingly settled I am in this house &#8211; we are inclosing the garden &amp; planting currant trees &amp; shrubs. The
                    parlour is to be papered with cartridge paper &#8211; &amp; the abominable curtains died of a chocolate brown which will make them

                        as the first leader to call himself the Great Khan (Gran Can), because he had once been enchanted into the form of a dog.
                        &#8216;Ca&#245;zinho&#8217; is Portuguese for &#8216;doggy&#8217;. Southey&#8217;s humorous point is that his children&#8217;s eyes resembled those of central
                        Asians.</note> He is a great tyrant, &#8211; farther I cannot say of him except that he gives good proof of taste by pricking up his
