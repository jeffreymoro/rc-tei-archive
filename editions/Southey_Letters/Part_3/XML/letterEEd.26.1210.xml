                    &amp; worthy interest can be attached to the conquering interest in either. 1. William of Normandy is less a hero than Harold<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors"> William I (c.1028&#8211;1087; <title>DNB</title>), also known as William the Conqueror, defeated
                        Harold Godwinson (Harold II) (c. 1022&#8211;1066; <title>DNB</title>) at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, to claim the throne of

                    favoured the Pagans, &amp; the Normans were helped by the Priests. 2. Alaric is the chief personage of a French poem by Scudery
                    which is notoriously worthless.<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors"> Georges de Scud&#233;ry (1601&#8211;1667), French novelist,

                        that converted to Christianity under threat of exile in 1502. Between 1609 and 1614, the Spanish government systematically
