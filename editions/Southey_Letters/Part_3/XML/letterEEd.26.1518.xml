          <salute>My dear Friend.</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> You have, I hope, before this received the &#8216;Chronicle of the Cid,&#8217; and the new edition of the &#8216;Letters,&#8217; both which
                        <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> was instructed to send to Tavistock Street.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (1808) and the expanded edition of his <title>Letters Written
                            During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (1797, 1798) published in 2 volumes as <title>Letters Written
                            During a Journey in Spain, and a Short Residence in Portugal</title> (1808).</note> On the latter work I laboured just
                    eight days, from morning till night; unluckily it was thought expedient to hurry it through two presses at once, with all possible
                    expedition; time, therefore, was not allowed for the proof sheets to travel here, and I anticipate many vexatious blunders of the
                    printer, which will stare me in the face on cutting the leaves. The booksellers would have republished this book three years ago
                    if I had wished it. People asked me about it; the subject excited curiosity just at this time. To destroy the 1250 copies which
                    were abroad was impossible, for alas! <hi rend="ital">Nescit vox missa reverti</hi>;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;A
                        word once spoken can never be recalled&#8217;. Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65 BC&#8211;8 BC), <title>Ars Poetica</title>,
                        390.</note> the best way therefore, which could be done was to reprint it in such a form that I should have less reason to
                    feel ashamed of its contents. So by plentiful erasures, and a good deal of pertinent matter of fact, which my favourite studies
                    enabled me easily to lay hand on, I have made the book more respectable than it was.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I need not tell you what my feelings were respecting Sir Hew Dalrymple&#8217;s convention.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s exasperation was caused by the Convention of Cintra, signed on 30 August, whereby the French army
                        commanded by Jean-Andoche Junot (1771&#8211;1813) and defeated by Anglo-Portuguese forces under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st
                        Duke of Wellington) (1769&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>) at Vimeiro on 21 August, was allowed to retreat intact, with its weapons,
                        from Portugal. Wellesley, who did not sign the Convention, had been superseded in command by two veteran generals, just
                        arrived in Iberia, who were content to make peace: Sir Harry Burrard (1755&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>) and Sir Hew Dalrymple
                            (1750&#8211;1830;<title> DNB</title>). Public outcry led to an inquiry, after which Burrard and Dalrymple never again took
                        command.</note> Since the execution of the Brissotines,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 31 October 1793 the French
                        Revolutionaries known as Brissotins or Girondins were executed in Paris after a show trial.</note> no public event ever
                    distressed me so deeply. I could not sleep the whole night after the news reached me; the whole business indicates such a total
                    want of all honourable and generous feeling on the part of our commander that it sickens me to think of it. Thank God, the nation
                    has redeemed itself, as far as words can redeem it. What the Government will do remains to be seen; what they ought to have done
                    they have not done. Had I been minister I would have followed the Roman example in such cases &#8211; annulled the treaty, and delivered
                    up the generals who signed it to the French, with ropes round their necks. It is nonsense to say that we were bound by the treaty,
                    as if any claims which the French could derive from the act and deed of a fool or a coward could be paramount to those of such
                    allies as the Spaniards, and such a cause as they are engaged in. Surely we have men in England who would have humbled the French
                    when they had beaten them, and made Junot sign his capitulation in his own infamous name; not by a title which is not, and cannot
                    be his, if we have any grounds for going against him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There will be bloody work in Spain, but I have no fears for the result. Meantime, will this present deliverance of
                    Portugal enable you to recover some part of your lost property?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Winter is come upon us here prematurely &#8211; at least six weeks before its usual time. My grasshopper season is at an
                    end, and fire and candle evenings bring with them regular employments, which there is now nothing to disturb. When Longman will be
                    for putting my first volume<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Of the <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810).</note> to the
                    press I know not; in all probability his next letter will say the sooner the better. It will finish with the Dutch treaty after
                    the Acclamation.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The acclamation in 1640 of Joam IV (1603&#8211;1656), as King of Portugal and
                        the Algarves.</note> I wish the &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217; had preceded this work upon Brazil; for I am sure common readers will
                    blame me for the want of interest in great part of the events which are related.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s
                        long-planned &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217; was never completed. His <title>History of Brazil</title> appeared in three volumes from
                        1810 to 1819.</note> Thinking minds will judge differently. I have begun this branch of my history with a sort of exordium, in
                    which the nature and character are explained; this will, perhaps, be ridiculed now, but I think it will be approved hereafter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The last news from my publishers was that the edition of &#8216;Thalaba&#8217;<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> had at last reached the end of its slow seven years&#8217; sale; that its later
                    movement had been rather of accelerated pace, and that they recommended reprinting it with as little delay as possible.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> A second edition was published in 1809.</note> The property now reverts to me, and as the sale
                    certainly will not slacken, I may, in the course of a second seven years, look for another 115<hi rend="ital">l.</hi> from this
                    source. Slow and sure, but it is satisfactory to see the fruit trees of one&#8217;s own planting beginning to bear, however slender the
                    first crop. The most apparent alteration will be in the manner of printing. It went through the press while I was last in
                    Portugal, and I never saw a proof sheet of it. There is an unpleasant effect by the manner of placing the notes; for many pages
                    have only a line of text, and so the eye runs faster than the fingers can turn them over. I shall now place the notes at the end
                    of each book.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am getting on with my new &#8216;Letters&#8217;,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not publish a new book
                        of this description but a new edition of <title>Letters Written during a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> did
                        appear in 1808.</note> and have the comfort of finding at hand <hi rend="ital">almost</hi> all the information with which
                    books can supply me. We go on well. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> grows stout, and <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> looks like a great girl beside the two younger ones. Of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> I have not heard for some time, but I conclude he has not much
                    employment, because the papers do not speak of any remarkable mortality at Durham. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>
                    has no chance of any practice in his line: the maritime war is at end as to what Irishmen call &#8216;de fun of de ting&#8217;, and with that
                    said fun has gone all his chance of preferment.</p>
