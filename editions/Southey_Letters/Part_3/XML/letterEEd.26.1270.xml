        <p rend="indent1"> I thought when in London that <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> looked miserably ill &#8211; as
                    if some thing was out of order in him, &#8211; &amp; I thought too that his mind had taken such a turn &#8211; that unless he took a sectarian
                        <del>turn</del> bias &amp; became Methodist or Quaker he was in danger of derangement. people are sometimes driven mad this
                    way, but they are also sometimes saved from madness &lt;by it.&gt; their feelings find vent in a regular channel, &amp; they
                    themselves find persons who sympathize with them. Thus it is that where there are convents madmen are almost unknown. I wish he
                    were acquainted with Wilberforce<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Wilberforce (1759&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), the

                    &#8211; I would learn who was the most eloquent of the Evangelical Preachers, &amp; propose to him as a matter of curiosity to go &amp;
                    hear him. If what he heard there should harp in with his own feelings &#8211; it would be like Davids harp &amp; charm the evil spirit
                    out of him. The malady of his mind being thus indulged would abate, &#8211; it would become zeal &#8211; a source of pleasure to himself &#8211;
                    &amp; others would not regard it as a malady. I could show you cases in point. Perhaps no man living is so well acquainted with
                    the history of enthusiasm as I am, &amp; that history throws as much light upon the morbid anatomy of the human mind,
