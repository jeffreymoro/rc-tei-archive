        <p rend="indent1"> My objection to this Prospectus<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Prospectus for Coleridge&#8217;s
                        self-published journal <title>The Friend</title>, which he produced in 1809 and 1810. For the text see <title>The
                            Friend</title>, ed. Barbara E. Rooke, 2 vols (London and Princeton, 1969).</note> of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge&#8217;s</ref> is that it looks as if it realy was extracted from a letter, and
                    that there are some things in it which would be fitly enough said to a friend, but are not so fitly said to the Public. Some few
                    corrections of little importance he has made in it, two of more importance I believe are yet to be made. It is not possible that
                    he can get together the list of his subscribers in time to publish so soon as this paper proposes, and if there should be any
                    number of copies engaged by persons residing either in the country or in small towns, his only way of circulating it will be by
                    post. In that case it must be stamped, and the stamp will only carry a single sheet. Larger paper, however, and smaller type will
                    bring it to the same quantity of contents and the same marketvalue.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have never seen <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>. He is in so many points so far
                    superior to all other men whom it has ever been my lot to fall in with, that I wish you had seen him, tho I know how much you
                    would differ from him, and can guess what you would dislike. If this scheme of his be carried into effect, a greater body of sound
                    criticism and sound philosophy will be given to the world, than modern times have ever yet produced. I have doubts and fears about
                    it, and now that it is too late, believe that monthly or quarterly parts, or even of irregular publications would have been a
                    preferable mode of proceeding for his habits. However, his common-place books are numerous and well-filled, and little more is
                    necessary than to put his loose materials in order.</p>

                            Convention of Cintra</title> (1809) was triggered by the agreement, made on 30 August 1808, of the British generals to
                        allow a defeated Napoleonic army to withdraw from Portugal to France unmolested and with its weapons &#8211; a decision he and

                    at heart in consequence of it. We among the mountains here, are as earnest for flinging away the scabbard, as you at Liverpool are
