        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref> tells me you have had your name entered at Cambridge &amp; design to
                    keep terms there. I am inclined to think he has mistaken the will for the deed, &amp; misinterpreted the kakography<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey uses this word to mean &#8216;bad writing&#8217;.</note> of your letter,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Taylor had misunderstood; see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 24 January 1805, Letter 1025.</note> &#8211; for I
                    do not think that you would take this step without first consulting both him &amp; me, &amp; I cannot conceive that you can need
                    any advice at all upon the subject, it being so utterly impossible with your means, &amp; so little desirable if
                        &lt;<del>xxx</del>&gt; possible. I do not know any one thing which would be so certainly prejudicial to you as this which you
                    are wishing for. In the first place you are too old &#8211; it being more usual to go under eighteen than above it. in the next place
                    you would find yourself behind hand in University attainments &#8211; for the sake of obtaining immediate gratification you would devote
                    yourself to these &#8211; which would lead to nothing, &amp; you would find when too late that you had abandoned one pursuit &#8211; without
                    getting any other. Be content as you are: repeated change of profession is folly in those who can afford it, &#8211; in you it would be
                    something worse. what only makes them ridiculous would ruin you. An English degree is of no other use to a physician than as it
                    enables him to be a Fellow of the College of Physicians. he may practice in London as a Licentiate without it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You ask me concerning the origin of the Venereal Disease.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Harry&#8217;s
                        university dissertation, to graduate as MD, was on the origins and course of syphilis, in which he suggested an American
                        origin for the disease.</note> Since the question arrived I have found the passage on which I suppose the common opinion is
                    founded, &amp; which is certainly irrefragable. It is in a work by Oviedo whose whole title you may &lt;see&gt; in one of the
                    Madoc notes<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Gonzalo Fern&#225;ndez de Oviedo y Vald&#233;s (1478&#8211;1557), <title>De la Natural
                            Hystoria de las Indias</title> (1526) is cited in <title>Madoc</title> (1805), in a note to Part 2, Book 8, lines 60&#8211;62.
                        See <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works 1793&#8211;1810</title>, gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004), II, p. 327.</note> &#8211;
                    so I need not hunt for it again. He says that the first Spaniards who went to the West Indies (N B where he was <del>xxx</del>
                    settled) caught it there, where it was a very common but very mild disease &#8211; &amp; he goes on with the history of the war at
                    Naples &amp;c to account for its names in France &amp; in Italy. Possibly some analogous disease may have existed in Europe
                    before, <del>which was</del> &amp; this may have been a worse sort &#8211; as if the Small Pox had turned out the vaccine. Certain it is
                    that till the discovery of America it was never known as a general &amp; dreadful malady. If you want more particulars tell me,
                    &amp; I will translate the passage from Oviedo at length &amp; send you chapter &amp; verse.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As no proofs have reached me of late I conclude you are doing my office &amp; that the work is nearly at an
                        end.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> For <title>Madoc</title> (1805) which was being printed by <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">James Ballantyne</ref> in Edinburgh.</note> indeed every days delay is now injurious
