                        previously written to Heber; see Southey to Richard Heber, 16 November 1807, Letter 1379.</note> what I wish the booksellers
                    to do, &amp; what materials I have. &#8211; My preliminary matter will take in a wide range. I shall examine the old question of the
                    origin of romance, with the hope of saying something new about it; &#8211; &amp; I shall prove that it was in no instance intended to
                    outrage probability, till it got into the hands of the Italian poets. With respect to its effects on society a good many facts
                    have fallen in my way, which my predecessors have not met with, my reading lying in a track which has been little beaten. &#8211; The
                    proceeding to the Round Table. I shall as far as materials can be procured, give the critical bibliology of the subject; &amp; in
                    the notes indicate the source of every chapter in the Mort Arthur.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey realised his

                    this I wish to persuade the publishers; &#8211; it is not likely that they will object, &#8211; but your opinion will have weight with them.
                    No man knows the public taste better than <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>. I shall be able to make out the
                    materials of costume, as it is a part of my plan to enter with some minuteness into the subject of armour, &amp; all its
                    varieties. To make the work really handsome there should be a half title with a vignette to every book. Engraving on copper is
                    better than on wood, &amp; has the great advantage that it is more easily procurable, there being more artists.</p>
