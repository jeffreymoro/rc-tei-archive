        <p rend="indent1"> And this catch word<del>s</del> leads me to the great political question. A Catholic establishment would be the
                    best &#8211; perhaps the only &#8211; means of civilising Ireland. Jesuits &amp; Benedictines, tho they would not enlighten the savages, would
                    humanise them, &amp; bring the country into cultivation. A petition that asked for this &#8211; saying plainly we are Papists &amp; will
                    be so, &amp; this is the best thing that can be done for us &amp; for you too, &#8211; such a petition I could support, considering what
                    the present condition of Ireland is &#8211; how wretchedly it always has been governed &#8211; &amp; and how hopeless the prospect is. But the
                    present Petition is comparatively trifling in its object &#8211; &amp; positively false in its assertions. the petitioners who have
                    signed it, may possibly hold such tenets as they profess &#8211; but those are not the tenets of the Catholic church &#8211; never were &amp;
                    never can be. Their canons, their councils, their doctors all teach a different creed &#8211; so most certainly do the Irish clergy &#8211;
                    always &#8211; since the downfall of the Culdees<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ascetic Christian monastic and eremitical

                    It was highly proper to let the emigrant monastics associate together here &amp; live in their old customs &#8211; but it is not proper

                        and declare their disbelief in transubstantiation, invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass. The Acts excluded
                        Catholics but also many Protestant dissenters from office (although in practice dissenters were indemnified from the penalties
                        incurred).</note> &amp; you kill them. they affect to appeal wholly to reason &amp; bewilder themselves in the miserable
                    snares of materialism &#8211; besides this creed is not reasonable &#8211; it is a vile mingle-mangle which a Catholic may well laugh at. But
                    Catholicism, having survived the first flood of reformation &#8211; will stand &#8211; perhaps till the end of all things. It would yield
                    either to a general spread of knowledge (which would require a totally new order of things) &#8211; or to the unrestrained attacks of
                    infidelity, &#8211; which would be casting out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils. But if it be tolerated here &#8211; if the old
                    laws of prevention be suffered to sleep &#8211; it will gain ground, perhaps to a dangerous extent. You do not know what the zeal is,
                    and what the power of an army of priests &#8211; having no interest whatever but that of their order. Were the country in a state of
                    revolution I would vote against all religious establishments as contrary to the spirit of Xianity. As the country now is, &amp; as
                    the minds of men now are I would vote against Catholic emancipation, &amp; frame new tests to shut out the Methodists.</p>
