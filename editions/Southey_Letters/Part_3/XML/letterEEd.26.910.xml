        <p rend="indent1"> I have to acknowledge the receipt of a Billum Curiosum &amp; eke of a letter, &amp; I have moreover something to
                    say. &#8211; first to thank you for what notice you have taken of <ref target="people.html#FrickerGeorge">George Fricker</ref>, a poor
                    fellow who has been hitherto very unfortunate, but who is altogether free from vice &amp; deserves to do well. I did not ask you
                    to help him forward because the employment under <ref target="people.html#PooleThomas">Poole</ref> could be but temporary, &amp;
                    because I have a sort of conscience about asking favours of this kind, &amp; now that he is in town I need not ask you, being sure
                    that you will help him if you can. if he were in any situation wherein regularity &amp; good conduct would bring him forward he
                    would certainly do well: &#8211; And next to your invitation, which has come seasonably, for if all things go on well here, my business
                    will lead me to London towards the close of April, partly for Madoc,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem
                            <title>Madoc</title>, which he had written in 1797&#8211;1799 and was revising for publication. It was published in 1805.</note>
                    but more particularly to compleat for the printer another job whereof I believe you have heard nothing &amp; whereby I hope I
                    shall get much. This is a companion, continuation or supplement to <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis&#8217;s</ref> Specimens
