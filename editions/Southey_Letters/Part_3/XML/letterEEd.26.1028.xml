          <salute>My dear friend</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I received a letter last night from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> which has vexed me a
                    good deal. he mentions the receipt of the last ten &#163; you sent him, &amp; the inconvenience which he suffers for want of more
                    regular &amp; adequate supplies he goes on in these words &#8216;To write to a person with whom I have so little personal acquaintance
                    as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> May upon this subject is disagreeable to myself &amp; must be troublesome to him. I have indeed so often
                    annoyed him that I feel unwilling to write now, the more so, as I cannot express myself so strongly as I would wish without
                    appearing rude. In a fortnight I shall be pressed for money if I do not receive some. Let me be regularly supplied even with
                    little, &amp; let me know what I am to expect, &amp; I shall accommodate myself to my situation &#8211; or endeavour to better it.&#8217; &#8211; he
                    says also &#8211; &#8216;I do not lead an extravagant life, on the contrary I never was more &#339;conomical in my habits&#8217;.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A year &amp; half hence when he has his diploma in his pocket it will be very well that he should endeavour to
                        <del>attempt</del> better himself &#8211; but any attempt of that kind now would ruin all his professional views &#8211; &amp; I own it is
                    what I have been at times apprehensive of, recollecting the effect of a similar pressure upon myself &#8211; tho my supplies were more
                    scanty than his.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What I know of <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref> English income was communicated in my
                        last,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John May, 25 January 1805, Letter 1026.</note> &amp; I hope soon
                    to communicate a confirmation of it from his agents. at any rate I am sure there will be more than 300 &#163; &#8211; <del>prob</del> the
                    next quarter as the allowance from <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylor</ref> will be coming in,
                    there will be no call on my Uncle &#8211; under these circumstances I think I am justified in requesting you to send him 20 &#163; &#8211; tho I
                    write with almost as much reluctance as he himself would have done &#8211; for in all likelihood it is asking you to advance &#8211; in plain
                    English to lend &#8211; the money. &amp; the habit of receiving obligations from you has as little blunted the feeling with which I
                    remember them &#8211; as it has the sense of their value.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There would have been money in abundance but for what has been squandered upon <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref>. fifty you remitted to <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss
                        Tyler</ref> &#8211; for his first fitting out &#8211; on which she did not expend a third part of the sum. 140 <ref target="people.html#ThomasDr">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas</ref> expended &#8211; all this in one year &#8211; when a third part would
                    have done all we wished for <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>. &#8211; the same revenues which supplied this
                    money <del>will</del> are coming in again, &amp; you may be assured that had there been a doubt of the whole 300 &#163; being paid in,
                        <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> would not have preferred <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> to his brother. his intention was to increase our power of disposing of his money &#8211; not to limit it.</p>
