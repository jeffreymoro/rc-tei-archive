        <p rend="indent1"> You will wonder at not having heard from me, &#8211; the fact is that I have heard nothing more concerning the
                    Rhadamanthine project from <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</ref>:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See
                        Southey to William Taylor, 24 May 1809, Letter 1635. Southey had been approached by James Ballantyne concerning the
                        possibility of his editing a new review, to be called the <title>Rhadamanthus</title>. In Greek mythology Rhadamanthus was a
                        wise king who was one of the judges of the dead. Southey&#8217;s plans for this periodical were never fulfilled.</note> &#8211; his
                    silence is to be attributed for the first part of the time to an expectation of seeing me at Edinburgh, &amp; there talking over
                    the matter with <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> who is his Magnus Apollo,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning his mentor or luminary.</note> &#8211; &amp; latterly I <del>believe</del> suspect to an abandonment of the
                    scheme on his part, because he thinks he can employ me more advantageously for himself. I have undertaken the historical part of
                    his Ed. Annual Register, for the first year (1808) &#8211; he wishes me to engage regularly for this department &amp; offers for it 400
                    &#163; a year, which is certainly very liberal pay. I have however promised only for the first volume, &#8211; which will suffice to show him
                    how far my view of things, &amp; my manner of speaking of them may accord with his objects, &amp; also how far it will be
                    compatible with my better pursuits, to undertake so large a portion of trade work. He has applied to me upon very short notice,
                    &amp; I am by no means prepared for the task: it was indeed in other hands, but the sample sent was so thoroughly tame &amp;
                    worthless (I had it sent to me) that he has done wisely to pay for it &amp; cancel it at once. &#8211; I am waiting for documents, which
                        <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> is slow in sending, &amp; mean time get on with a preliminary view of
                    parties at home, so written as to be sure of pleasing no party, because it will speak bitter truths of all.</p>

                    at low wages, &amp; must have struck had it continued longer. Our Well-beloved Cousin<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        metaphysical works for the <title>Annual Review</title>.</note> doubtless contributed to its death by overdosing it with his

                    transcribing the last chapter, &#8211; supplementary notes &amp; a Bibliographical Appendix will extend the volume to something above

                    more interesting of the two.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The second volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title> was

                    has I believe fallen seriously to work upon what has long been a favourite project of his, &amp; one in which I have always
                    encouraged him, &#8211; a history of the Crusades. He is well situated for this, there being two libraries belonging to the Church at
                        Durham,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Bishop&#8217;s Library and the Chapter Library.</note> both at his command,
                    &amp; both abounding with old books &#8211; among which are the most important of his materials. Some I can help him to, &amp; the rest
                    I know where to borrow. I have instructed him in my method of historical book-keeping, &#8211; the result of nine years experience &#8211;
                    which will save him much labour, &#8211; that is in preventing him from losing any.</p>

                        twenty-eight issues and ending in March 1810.</note> I have always expected every number to be the last. He may however
                    possibly go on in this intermitti[MS torn] way till subscribers enough withdraw their names (partly in anger at its irregularity,
                    more because they find it heathen Greek) &#8211; to give him an ostensible reason for stopping short. Both &#8211; he &amp; <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> powerfully as they can write &amp; profoundly as they usually think,
                    have been betrayed with the same fault, &#8211; that of making things easy of comprehension in themselves, difficult to be comprehended
                    by their way of stating them. &#8211; Instead of going to the natural spring for water, they seem to like the labour of digging wells.
                    The tower-of-Babel character of your English offends them grievously,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey often took
                        Taylor to task for the obscurity of his review articles in letters to him.</note> &#8211; the hardness of theirs appears to me a
