        <p rend="indent1"> You ask me for my opinion of Marmion,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott&#8217;s new poem (1808).</note> &#8211; you
                    have yourself pointed out its worst defect, &#8211; a want of taste, &amp; of propriety, which <del>almost</del> &lt;in that
                    introduction of the stocking&gt; amounts to a want of feeling. This pervades the whole poem, &#8211; he buries his story in his
                    circumstances, just as ladies of old used to be lost under the load of their full dress. <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> is too passionately the Antiquarian, &#8211; a painter who has to paint Knights in armour has no need of any anatomical
                    knowledge, &#8211; &amp; if he keeps their bevers closed it is of no consequence whether he can even paint a human face, <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> has done wilfully what such a painter might do to hide his ignorance, &#8211; he has
                    cased <del>all</del> every thing in costume, &amp; made that the essence of his writings which ought only to be their ornament. &#8211;
                    He never narrates perspicuouly, &amp; it is necessary to read slowly, or to read twice before the thread of his story can be
                    comprehended. His language has the unpardonable fault of belonging to no age or country &#8211; sometimes rust, sometimes tinsel; &#8211;
                    &amp; he spells &amp; accents the same word either in the new fashion or &lt;the&gt; old, &amp; writes Scotch or English, just as
                    happens to be convenient. With all this <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> is a poet of great powers &amp; great
                    originality; when I was in town it fell to my lot more frequently to defend Marmion than to speak of its faults, &amp; I did it
                    more willingly. The story of this poem would be excellent if he had only developed it well, <del>&amp; not</del> given himself
                    time to mature it, &amp; not hurried it up to be in time for the season, &#8211; as green geese are fattened for the London market: &#8211;
                    yet I would rather have two such poems as Marmion, than one on which he <del>had</del> should bestow twice the time, because the
                    sum total of beauty &amp; of delight would be greater, &#8211; &amp; the defects are not worth mentioning in the general estimate.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Gebir<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor&#8217;s oriental poem of 1798.</note> is the only contemporary poem
                    to which I am, as a poet, in the slightest degree indebted, &#8211; &amp; it was certainly from Gebir that I learnt ever to have my eye
                    awake, &#8211; to bring images to sight, &amp; to convey a picture in a word. I know no poem from which I have ever derived so much
                    improvement. It is so obscure that certainly I suspected <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">the author</ref>
