          <salute>Dear Rickman,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Birth day is over, &amp; I looked for a letter from you in the joy of your heart. it has not appeared &#8211; &amp;
                    so I will write to you in the sorrow of mine &#8211; for my eyes are out of order, &amp; nothing so much oppresses my spirits as this
                    grievance for nothing else renders me so perfectly helpless.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have references to certain statutes which perhaps you can with little trouble verify for me at your leisure. &#8211; A
                    statute made at Kilkenny, 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> of Edward 2. AD. 1310 mentions the Shells of Cocoa-Nuts for drinking cups.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had been reading Edward Ledwich (1738&#8211;1823), <title>The Antiquities of Ireland. The
                            2d ed., with Additions and Corrections, to Which is Added a Collection of Miscellaneous Antiquities</title> (1804), pp.
                        262&#8211;263. Southey reviewed this work in the <title>Annual Review for 1804</title>, 3 (1805), 398&#8211;413.</note> &#8211; This implies
                    more inter course with the East than is consistent with other facts. <del>for</del> Boccacio tells you of a parrots feather which
                    was shown by a friar for one from the Angel Gabriels wing.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Giovanni Boccaccio
                        (1313&#8211;1375), <title>The Decameron</title>, Sixth Day, Tenth Tale: &#8216;Friar Cipolla and a Feather of the Angel Gabriel&#8217;.</note>
                    &amp; but cocoa shells are so bulky &amp; so little worth that they seem odd articles to be imported into Ireland by the
                    Frescobald Society at Florence.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Frescobald Society&#8217;s role is discussed in Ledwich,
                            <title>The Antiquities of Ireland</title>, 2nd edn (Dublin, 1804), p. 262.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The law against ravishment makes it felony to commit a rape upon a lay woman, &amp; only a trespass upon a nun. 3
                    Edward 1. Cap. 13 &amp; 33. the latter is omitted in the statute book. &#8211; This I copied from a magazine. Where is the omitted part
                    to be found?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The statute is to be found in the publication of the Records Commission for
                        which Rickman worked, <title>Statutes of the Realm</title>, I (1810), pp. 81, 87&#8211;88, 91&#8211;97.</note> &#8211; if the <del>xxxx</del>
                    law be accurately stated it was designed to afford an excuse to the nuns for incontinence. &#8211; If at your leisure you can send me
                    the authorities I shall be glad, &#8211; <del>xx</del> if you are over busy, as most likely you are, &#8211; <del>xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx
