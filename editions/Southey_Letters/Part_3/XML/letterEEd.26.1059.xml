                    of Laws written in Spain fifty years before its reputed discovery at Amalfi or Naples by Gioia.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to John Rickman, 22 March 1805, Letter 1049. He found the reference in the <title>Siete
                            Partidas</title> (Seven-Part Code) or <title>Libro de las Leyes</title>, a comprehensive legal code compiled during the
                        reign of Alfonso X (1221&#8211;1284), King of Castile, Le&#243;n and Galicia from 1252 until his death. No. 3610 of the sale catalogue of
                        Southey&#8217;s library was <title>Las Siete Partidas del Sabio Rey Don Alonso el Nono</title> (1789). Flavio Gioja or Gioia (c.
                        1300), of Italy, was credited with inventing the mariner&#8217;s compass by suspending the needle over a design on which the
                        cardinal points were indicated. Modern scholarship doubts Flavio&#8217;s existence.</note>
