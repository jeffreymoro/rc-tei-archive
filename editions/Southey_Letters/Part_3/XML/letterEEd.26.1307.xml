                        1807.</note> last acts was to give me a pension of 200 &#163; to which the King &#8220;graciously assented&#8221; &#8211; &#8211; You cannot be more amused
                    at finding me a pensioner than I am at finding myself so. &#8211; I am not however a richer man than before. Hitherto <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has given me an annuity of 160, &#8211; which I felt no pain in accepting from the
                    oldest friend I have in the world, with whom my intimacy was formed before we were either of &lt;us&gt; old enough to think of
                    differences of rank &amp; fortune. But <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> is not a rich man for his rank, &#8211; so
                    little so that he could not marry till he got a place, &#8211; &amp; of course I shall receive this no longer from him, now that it is
                    no longer necessary. Of 200 &#163;, the taxes have the modesty to deduct 56, &amp; the Exchequer pays irregularly. he is in luck who
                        <del>xx</del> &lt;has&gt; only one quarter arrears &#8211; so <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> tells
                    me &#8211; who has an office there. I therefore lose 16 &#163; per year during war, &amp; gain 4 &#163; whenever the income tax is repealed;
                        <del>x</del> having the discomfort always of uncertain remittances. &#8211; <del>xxxx</del> &#8211; it is but wearing a few more grey

                    ever yet had of getting a head, as you will presently see.</p>

                    probably get into an Evangelical circulation, &amp; should that be the case the profits will be useful to his family, for whom he
