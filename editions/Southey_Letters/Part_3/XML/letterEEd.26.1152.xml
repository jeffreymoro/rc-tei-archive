                        metrical romances since the sixteenth century. It was compiled by one Richard Heege in the fifteenth century. Southey was
                        arranging for its purchase, through the good offices of Scott, by Scott’s friend Thomas Thomson (1768–1852;
                        <title>DNB</title>), an Edinburgh advocate, record keeper and editor of medieval manuscripts. From Thomson the manuscript went
                        to the Advocates Library, Edinburgh. It remains in their collection today (National Library of Scotland, Advocates MS 19.3.1).
                        For further details; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 3 October 1805, Letter 1109. The first name and dates of Mrs
                        Sherbrook are untraced.</note> – &amp; transmitted by me. She has requested me when I may chance to pass near her to inspect
                    certain other M.S.S. all of which were saved by one of her ancestors from the wreck of a parochial library at the Reformation. The
                    friend who sent me this invitation says he believes they <del>all</del> are all religious books, but he is not conversant with
                    MSS. &amp; reads the writing badly.</p><p rend="indent1"> We are under considerable uneasiness respecting <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>,
