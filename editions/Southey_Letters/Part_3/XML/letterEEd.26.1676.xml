                        appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in 1807.</note> letters that the place required experience which I do not possess, &amp;
                    application which I would not for any possible emolument bestow. You perhaps may suppose as <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> seem to do, &amp; as Lord Lonsdale does, that this
                    reply of Lord Mulgrave means only that that he wants the place for somebody else, &#8211; but it tallies precisely with the result of
                        <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</ref> enquiries, &amp; thereupon I am satisfied. I am told that if
                    Canning has any influence in disposing of Dutens&#8217;s situation when he dies that I shall certainly succeed him.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>), a French Protestant, held the post of
                        Historiographer Royal until his death on 23 May 1812. Southey&#8217;s campaign for the post proved unsuccessful and it went to James

                    calculate the expence of time. The very little which I have yet done interests me enough in doing it to induce a belief that sweet
                    remuneration will tempt me to continue it hereafter. I write with thorough freedom, equally aloof from all parties, &#8211; &amp; I
                    suppose the manner in which I shall speak of some of the ministerial measures would hardly go down with <del>xx</del> my Scotch

                    which could be pursued. How far it may be prudent in me is another question, but &#8211; blessed be God for it, I have never yet weighed

After the controversial Convention of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. For Southey&#8217;s account, see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810), 442&#8211;459. Although he praised
                        many of Moore&#8217;s personal qualities, Southey suggested that he was not &#8216;equal to the difficulties of his situation&#8217;
