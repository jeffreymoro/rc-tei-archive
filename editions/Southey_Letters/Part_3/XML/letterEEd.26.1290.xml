                    good miniature of himself by Millet, which was taken gratis with the idea that some time or other it might be engraved; you, I am sure, will anxiously inquire after this, (the existence of which you seem either to
                    have forgotten or not to have known): if it be a better likeness than the profile, it may not be too late to engrave it in
                    preference; at all events, while one is prefixed to the book, the other may be engraved for the ‘Monthly Mirror,’ and thus we who
                    wish to preserve every relic may insert both in our own copies.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A miniature of Kirke White by an unknown artist is
                        currently in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.No engraving after a miniature was published in either
                        the <title>Remains</title> or the <title>Monthly Mirror</title>. The painter was probably H. Millett (dates unknown) who lived in Bath in 1809 and in London from 1810 to 1817. From 1809 to 1817 he exhibited at the Royal Academy.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Do not be apprehensive of sending me too many materials; a single sentence of his own which can aptly be inwoven
                    gives that sort of life and soul to biography which make it most valuable.</p><p rend="indent1"> Before <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> went to Cambridge, I spoke of him to <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">Mr. Basil Montague</ref>, who then resided in that town, knowing a <hi rend="ital">family</hi> acquaintance to be one of the things most wanted in a University, and thinking this would prove a desirable one.
                    Montague entered fully into my feelings, and promised also to interest Mr. Smythe,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> William
                        Smyth (1765–1849; <title>DNB</title>), Regius Professor of Modern History, fellow of Peterhouse.</note> of Peter House, in
                    your brother’s favour. You probably know whether anything resulted from this, – for I am not in correspondence with <ref target="people.html#MontaguBasil">Montague</ref>, and only saw him accidentally; but if <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> at any time frequented his house, I would write to him to learn whether he
                    recollected anything worthy of preservation. You will easily perceive that to ask him the question without knowing whether he ever
                    noticed your brother at all would place him, (if that were the case) under the necessity of making some awkward excuse; and this I
                    half suspect to be the case, not finding any mention of him in any of these letters. In all things I had only the <hi rend="ital">will</hi> to befriend him, not the <hi rend="ital">means</hi>. Now it is otherwise, and I <hi rend="ital">can</hi> do what I
                        <hi rend="ital">would</hi>: but that this should be the case is regretted almost as deeply by me as by his nearest relatives.
                    It is my full belief that English literature had never a greater loss.</p><p rend="indent1"> To a part of your letter I have only thanks to give, and to say that as I am so thoroughly acquainted with all <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</ref> dearest friends, the intimacy must not always be only on one side.
                    Nottingham is not in my way to London, but assuredly I will one day make it so.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> Yours very truly,</salute><signed rend="indent2"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
