					Newark Castle on the Yarrow for your prospected illustration.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Newark Castle is a ruin in
						the valley of the Yarrow Water, three miles west of Selkirk in the Scottish Borders. Presumably Wynn was sourcing
						illustrations to be tipped into his copy of Scott&#8217;s <title>Lay of the Last Minstrel</title> (1805), in which Newark castle
						features.</note> The little one he says is well done by a Mr Skene<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Skene
						(1775&#8211;1864; <title>DNB</title>), friend of Walter Scott, gentleman artist and promoter of the fine arts in Scotland.</note> or
					Skrine &#8211; of some eminence. The others you can have made into drawings if you like them. they are like the place. &#8211; I am not
					without hope of getting a drawing of Dacre Castle for you.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dacre Castle, Cumbria, a pele
						tower built in the 14th century for protection against the Scots. It also features in Scott&#8217;s <title>Lay of the Last
							Minstrel</title>.</note> there is a print of it in the Beauties of England &amp; Wales,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Beauties of England and Wales</title> (1801&#8211;1818) was a series of lavishly-illustrated accounts of
						the historical features of Britain, produced by John Britton (1771&#8211;1857; <title>DNB</title>), the antiquary, with his friend
						Edward Wedlake Brayley (1773&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>). Dacre Castle is described and pictured in vol. III (1802), pp.

          <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref> having been asked to meet me this evening for the first time,
					sent me the review of Madoc as printed: there was a gentlemanly decency in thus doing, as the review is exceedingly uncivil, tho
					mixed up with <del>xxxx</del> compliment enough.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jeffrey reviewed Southey&#8217;s poem
							<title>Madoc</title> (1805) in the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 7 (October 1805), 1&#8211;29.</note> It will serve the poem,
					as being long, &amp; making it appear of consequence; &amp; it will hurt him instead of me as it every where shows the wish of
					finding fault without the power, &amp; exemplifies more forcibly than any thing he has yet done that utter ignorance concerning
					what is good or what <del>xxx</del> bad in poetry, of which even his friends have already begun to suspect him. &#8211; Of course, I
					shall meet him with good humour, thank him for his fair dealing in letting me know upon what terms we stood, just observe that, as
					he must suppose, I have quite as little respect for his opinions as he has for mine, &#8211; &amp; then pass to other subjects. A man
					who has been &lt;reviewing&gt; above fifty times as I have been, may be considered as proof. You &amp; all who like the poem, or
					who like fair dealing, will be more offended than I am.</p>
