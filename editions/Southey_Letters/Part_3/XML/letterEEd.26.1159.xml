        <p rend="indent1"> Nicholson, I see, sets up a new review.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Nicholson (1753&#8211;1815;
                            <title>DNB</title>) had set up, in 1797, the <title>Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts</title>,
                        popularly known as &#8216;Nicholson&#8217;s journal&#8217;. The review he commenced in 1806 was the <title>General Review of British and Foreign
                            Literature</title>.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref> ought to get you well taken care of there. Need you be told the history
                    of all reviews? If a book falls into the hands of one who is neither friend nor enemy, &#8211; which for a man known in the world is not
                    very likely &#8211; the reviewer will find fault to show his own superiority, though he be as ignorant of the subject upon which he
                    writes as an ass is of metaphysics, or John Pinkerton of Welsh antiquities and Spanish literature.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Pinkerton (1758&#8211;1826; <title>DNB</title>): Scottish antiquarian and cartographer whose many publications
                        earned him a reputation for irreligious views, arrogant irritability and personal immorality. In <title>A Dissertation on the
                            Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths</title> (1787), Pinkerton argued that the Celts were incapable of rising to
                        high levels of civilisation and sought to prove that Scottish place names were not of Celtic origin: he wished to trace the
                        Scottish people to the ancient Goths and to purge Scottish culture of Celticism. Pinkerton criticised <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Sharon Turner</ref> for treating, in his <title>History of the Anglo-Saxons</title>
                        (1799&#8211;1805), recently-published Welsh poems as historical documents detailing real events of the sixth century. Pinkerton
                        assumed them to be forgeries. Turner replied to Pinkerton&#8217;s critique in his <title>Vindication of the Genuineness of the
                            Ancient British poems of Aneurin, Taliessin, Llywarch Hen, and Myrddin</title> (1803).</note> As your book, therefore, has
                    little chance of fair play, get it into the hands of your friends. Have you any access to the Monthly?<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Monthly Review</title>.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> For politics. As far as the public is concerned, God be praised! How far I may be concerned, remains to be seen. My
                    habits are now so rooted, that everything not connected with my own immediate pursuit seems of secondary consequence, and as far
                    as relates to myself, hardly worth a hope or fear. So far as anything can be given me which will facilitate that pursuit, I
                    greatly desire it, and have good reason to expect the best. But nothing that can happen will in any way affect my plan of
                    operations for the present year. I go to London in a month&#8217;s time, I go to Lisbon in the autumn, and in the interim must work like
                    a negro. By the by, cannot you give me a letter to Bartolozzi?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francesco Bartolozzi
                        (1728&#8211;1815; <title>DNB</title>), engraver, was born in Florence, Italy and lived and worked in Britain from 1764 onwards. In
                        1801 he moved to Lisbon where he stayed until his death. Southey anticipated meeting Bartolozzi on his projected visit to
                        Portugal, which never took place.</note> he will like to see an Englishman who can talk to him of the persons with whom he was
                    acquainted in England. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am reading an Italian History of Heresies in four folios, by a certain Domenico Bernino.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Domenico Bernini (1657&#8211;1723), <title>Istoria, di Tutte l&#8217;Heresie</title> (1705&#8211;1717).</note> If there be one
                    thing in the world which delights me more than another, it is ecclesiastical history. This book of Bernino&#8217;s is a very useful one
                    for a man who knows something of the subject, and is aware how much is to be believed, and how much is not.</p>

                    navy, was scholar enough to quote Virgil aptly, had turned Quaker or semi-Quaker, and was now a dealer in wool somewhere about
                    twenty miles off. He had seen much and thought much, his head was well stored, and his heart in the right place.</p>
