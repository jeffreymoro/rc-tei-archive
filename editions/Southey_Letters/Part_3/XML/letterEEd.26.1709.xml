                    sins rather than errors of judgement I fear, to answer for, &#8211; &amp; suffered loose morals to grow out of vicious principles. For
                    many years we had been estranged without any dispute, &amp; each I believe continuing dearly to love the other, &#8211; for seldom have
                    I known a man of brighter talents, never one of a kinder heart.</p>

                    an Old Woman, nevertheless I &amp; the Old Woman agree upon this question, &#8211; &amp; it is perhaps the only one on which we are
                    agreed. It is unlucky that the D of P. did not live a few months till <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">your Uncle</ref>
                     was in power (as I suppose he &lt;soon&gt; must be)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Duke of Portland
                        (1738&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>) resigned from the Prime Ministership in October 1809 and died on 30 October. Portland had also
                        been Chancellor of the University of Oxford; Grenville was installed as the new chancellor of the university in 1810.</note> &#8211;
                    the Old Woman would then have been quite as ready to kiss his Netherlands as she was to kick them in 1807.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Oxford University, Southey&#8217;s alma mater, was opposed to the emancipation of Catholics. It had opposed
                        Grenville on the issue during his ministry in 1807. Portland&#8217;s ministry, which succeeded Grenville&#8217;s, had opposed emancipation
                        but fell in October 1809. Southey means that, rather than face the prospect of Grenville becoming its chancellor, the
                        University would have toadied to the Duke of Portland, had he lived, to ensure that he, as an opponent of Catholic
                        emancipation would have remained its chancellor.</note>
