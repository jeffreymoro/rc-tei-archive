        <p rend="indent1"> All well. Thank God you are arrived.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey had been serving in the
                        West Indies as part of the British campaign to achieve naval dominance in the Caribbean during the Napoleonic wars.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wrote a long letter designing to send it for the West Indies from the Admiralty. it lies in <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor Bedfords</ref> desk to be by him directed as soon as he learns your
                    arrival, so that very probably you may receive it before this can reach you.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey
                        to Thomas Southey, 22 May 1806, Letter 1186. It was sent to Bedford on 27 March; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 27
                        May 1806, Letter 1188.</note> I have nothing to add as to our home politicks except that the Doctor<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Herbert Southey had graduated as MD on 24 June 1806.</note> has been here about ten days. &#8211; Yet I
                    recollect when finishing the sentence that there is something to add. The <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">old boy</ref> is
                    dead &amp; has named none of us in his will. A distant relation of his mothers family has one newly purchased estate. 2000&#163; goes
                    in legacies &#8211; all the rest to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">his brother Tom</ref>, &#8211; who concludes his letter upon
                    the occasion with an invitation to you &amp; to me. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> is to live with him at
                    the Cottage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So much for that. &#8211; I have still a light heart &amp; a thin pair of pantaloons to go thro the world with, &amp;
                    having had not hopes felt no disappointment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">My daughter</ref> will be delighted to hear you are coming &#8211; if any thing can add to her
                    present delight, as she has just put on a new pair of green shoes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Caradocs complection is Welsh:<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A character in Southey&#8217;s
                            <title>Madoc</title> (1805); the paragraph discusses incidents in Part 1, &#8216;Madoc in Wales&#8217;.</note> among
                    the Celts there is no choice but between flax &amp; carrots. You are right in objecting to the battle with the women at Caermadoc.
                    it is the worst part of the poem, &amp; is to be altered. I have a great dog who is to play his part there. The Gorsedd<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The meeting of Welsh bards that occurs in <title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part 1, Book 11.</note> cannot be
                    spared because it introduces Caradoc. the wind on the harp is in the second instance only a little circumstance of the moment &#8211;
                    not operating so as to influence the action of the poem. there is therefore no sameness of <del>imagery</del> &lt;action&gt; such
                    as would make it faulty. Lincoyas death is in character. he is a savage of the best possible constitution, &amp; all savages
                        <del>all</del> are as violent in their loves as in their enmities. The old mans story is introduced to give effect to his
                    death &#8211; in fact the manner of his death grew out of the story. I do not think it needful to cover Madocs loins &#8211; on the contrary
                    there would be an indecency in doing it. It would look like the bough of the tree which always sticks out straight before Adam
                    &amp; Eve.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your two letters arrived this evening &#8211; that to which I have been replying bearing the Portsmouth post&#8211;mark &#8211; the
                    other announcing your return from Deal.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Perhaps you may be able to get leave of absence so soon that there will not be time to receive any directions from
                    me. You must go thro London. Call on <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> whose name you will find on his door, in
