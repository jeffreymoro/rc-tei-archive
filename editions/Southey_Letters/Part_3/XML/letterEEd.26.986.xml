        <p rend="indent1"> I was about to answer your last immediately to request speedy intelligence how <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> continued, when some incident prevented me, &amp; some dissipation of
                    time or other has been continually occurring since. doubtless however he is better for of a relapse in such cases there can be no
                    danger, &amp; surely I may venture to write to see if he were quite well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Send me a list of the poets which you have not yet been able to find, &amp; I will cause enquiry to be made for
                    them at Edinburgh when <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</ref> goes back. divide them into <hi rend="ital">reigns</hi> as <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</ref>
          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey is
                        discussing the anthology that he and Bedford compiled and published with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>
                        in 1807 as <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>. It was a companion work to George Ellis&#8217;s, <title>Specimens of
                            the Early English Poets</title> (1790, 2nd edn. 1801, 3rd edn. 1803).</note> has done, by a half title &#8211; the remarks which
                    he has affixed to each I shall not follow, as the whole will appear in the form of a preface. I shall be very glad to hear that
                    you have received the first proof, a work begun is half done. In all likelihood one morning at the Museum<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The British Museum.</note> would supply you with all you want for half a dozen sheets on. I wish exceedingly
                    that this was done, for if it succeed fairly I shall certainly send out a volume of Selections from the Early Poets containing the
                    choice pieces which Ellis has omitted, he having far far more learning than taste.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">If his
                        project to publish <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title> (1807) proved successful, Southey intended to
                        supplement Ellis&#8217;s <title>Specimens of the Early English Poets</title>. Late, and riddled with errors owing to Bedford&#8217;s
                        dilatoriness, the project did not sell and the supplement to Ellis did not appear.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I am ashamed to think for how long this letter has remained in my desk, hidden under sundry others all in a like
                    predicament. The fact is that about the time when it would have been finished came tidings that <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref> has actually relapsed &#8211; of which I expected duly to hear some immediate
                    report hoping also to hear of his recovery. Just now I am myself alarmed about <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>;
                    this unfortunate affair of the Galatea<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey&#8217;s ship, HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi>, a fifth-rate 32-gun frigate. On 14 August, the Galatea&#8217;s boats made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the

                        the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that Tom was
                        among the dead.</note> has just reached me by letter. how long it may be before any certain accounts reach us God knows &#8211;
                    &amp; I am sadly afraid on calculating probabilities that they lie on the worse side.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">

                    by certain symptoms which may possibly proceed from other causes &#8211; but which I very naturally attribute to the one I fear make me
                    very apprehensive of the same disease which carried off the other. At present she continues strong &amp; lusty, so that one who
                    only saw her accidentally would think that nothing ailed her. &#8211; Shall I go with the catalogue of vexations? <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">my youngest brother</ref> has again left his ship &amp; is vagabonding about the country,
                    there is no hope of him. the only chance of his escaping transportation or hanging is that he may kill himself by debauchery, or
                    so far rise into respectability as to turn Strolling Player. This however does not lie very near my heart. I have long foreseen
                    &amp; foretold the evil &amp; so made up my mind to it &#8211; You have I suppose heard from <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> that we shall be turned out of <ref target="places.html#GretaHall">our house</ref> at Whitsuntide.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s landlord, <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">William Jackson</ref>, was
