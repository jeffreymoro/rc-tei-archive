        <p rend="indent1"> My friends leave Bristol on Monday next, &#8211; on their way hither, &#8211; you thus perceive how impossible it is that I can
                    now accompany you to Edinburgh, &#8211; as I should else willingly have done.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The latter part of your letter requires a confidential answer. &#8211; I once wished to reside in Portugal, because
                        <del>my</del> the great object of my literary life related to that country. I loved the country, &amp; had then <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">an Uncle</ref>
          <del>xxx</del> settled there. Before <ref target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Fox</ref> came into power this was told him by <ref target="people.html#WynnSirWatkinWilliams">Williams Wynn</ref>, &amp; when he was in power he was asked by Wynn to send me
                    there. It so happened that John Allen<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Allen (1771&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>),
                        political and historical writer on Spain who was part of the Holland House set around <ref target="people.html#FoxHenryRichard">Lord Holland</ref> (nephew of Charles James Fox).</note> wanted something which was
                    in the <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Grenvilles</ref> gift, and this was given him, on condition that Fox in return
                    provided for me. There were but two things in Portugal which I could hold, the Consulship, &#8211; or the Secretaryship of Legation. The
                    former was twice given away, &#8211; but that Fox said was too good a thing for me, &#8211; the latter he promised, if an opportunity occurred
                    of promoting Ld Strangford,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The diplomatist Percy Clinton Sydney Smythe, 6th Viscount
                        Strangford (1780&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; &amp; that never took place. Grey<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey (1764&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1830&#8211;1834 and leading Whig; he became First
                            Lord of the Admiralty in 1806 in the &#8216;Minstry of All the Talents&#8217; and succeeded Fox as Foreign Secretary 1806&#8211;1807.</note> was reminded of his predecessors
                    engagement &amp; expressed no disinclination to fulfill it. The party got turned out, &#8211; &amp; <del>the</del> one of the last
                    things <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Ld Grenville</ref> did was to give me a pension of 200. Till that time I had
                    received one of 160 from <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Charles W. Wynn</ref> &#8211; my oldest surviving friend, &#8211; the
                    exchange leaves me something the poorer, as the Exchequer deducts above sixty pounds. This is all I have. Half my time I sell to
                    the Booksellers, &#8211; the other half is reserved for works which will never pay for the paper on which they are written, but on which
                    I rest my future fame. I am of course straitened in circumstances, &#8211; a little more would make me easy. My chance of inheritance is
                    gone by, my <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">fathers elder brother</ref> was worth 40,000, but he cut me off without
                    the slightest cause of offence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You would see by this that I would willingly be served, &#8211; but it is not easy to serve me. Lisbon is too insecure a
                    place to remove to with a family, &amp; nothing could repay me for going without them. I have neither the habits nor talents for
                    an official situation, nor if I had could I live in London &#8211; that is I should soon die there. I have said to <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> that one thing would make me at ease for life &#8211; &#8216;create for <del>the</del>

                        1239. Southey long coveted the post of Historiographer Royal. It was occupied by Louis Dutens (1730&#8211;1812; <title>DNB</title>),
                        and, on his death, given to James Stanier Clarke (1765?&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>).</note> the deductions would leave me with a
                    nett income of 278 &#8211; With that I should be sure of all the decent comforts of life, &#8211; &amp; for every thing beyond them it would
                    then be easy to supply myself. &#8211; Of course my present pension would cease. Whether <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Canning</ref> can do this I know not, but if this could be done it would be adequate to all I want,
                    &amp; beyond that my wishes have never extended. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry we are not to meet &#8211; but it would be unreasonable to expect it now, &#8211; &amp; at some more convenient
                    season I will find my way to you &amp; to the Advocates Library. You will hear from <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">Ballantyne</ref> what my plan is for Rhadamanthus,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ballantyne had sounded Southey out
                        on the possibility of his editing a new periodical which would review literary works by dead authors; see Southey to John
                        Rickman, 16 May [1809], (Letter 1629) and Southey to Thomas Southey, [16 May 1809] (Letter 1630). It was named after the Greek
                        mythological figure Rhadamanthus, a wise king, who was one of the judges of the dead. Southey&#8217;s plans for this periodical were
                        never fulfilled.</note> &#8211; concerning which I shall think nothing more till I hear from him upon the subject. &#8211; Since last you
                    heard from me I have lost <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">one of my children</ref>.
