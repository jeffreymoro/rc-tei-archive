Your Bucentaur<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The state galley of the Doges of Venice.</note> shall be turned to account elsewhere &#8211; for the
                    Translator is not learned enough to use it. It is curious &#8211; yet I doubt it, &amp; am rather disposed to believe the original form

                    &amp; if you will take notice thereof, you may perceive that where he is spoken of in the way one likes to speak of a very old

                    &amp; in short done every thing which he ought not to have done, as if he had been Inquisitor General, with absolute authority to
                    expunge &amp; add at pleasure &#8211; many of the omissions are thoroughly vexatious &#8211; he has full enough MSS. by him for a fourth

                    &amp; from bad ones. &#8211; I have seen the book since I wrote to you (<ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> franks me the
                    whole set of sheets which was overstepping the modesty of franking.) &amp; it is far worse than I expected. I have ordered many
