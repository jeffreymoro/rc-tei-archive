        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must reply in haste to your letter to prevent mischief.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s letter
                        is advising Grosvenor Charles Bedford on entries for their jointly edited anthology, <title>Specimens of the Later English
                            Poets</title>, published by <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 3 volumes in 1807.</note> The
                    preliminary remarks upon Day<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Day (1748&#8211;1789; <title>DNB</title>), writer of
                        instructive fiction, whose novel, <title>Sandford and Merton</title> was published in three volumes in 1783, 1786 and 1789. Day&#8217;s poetry is
                        included in <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>, III, pp. 308&#8211;316.</note> must not be altered &#8211; they are not
                    irrelevant, but strictly to the point &amp; purpose. Besides you may remember what I before told you, that I am acquainted with
                    Days nearest connections,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s Bristol friend, the surgeon <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">John King</ref> had married Emmeline Edgeworth (1770&#8211;1817); Day was a close friend of her
                        father Richard Lovell Edgeworth (1744&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &amp; in habits when within reach of visiting them
                    therefore as <del>be</del> in common decorum I would not in this book say any thing to offend them &lt;did I think it&gt; much
                        <del>xx</del> less will I forbear to express what are my real &amp; well grounded opinions.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As for <hi rend="ital">hounded</hi>
          <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> See <title>Specimens of the Later
                            English Poets</title>, III, p. 425.</note> if it be a familiar term to you I am glad to hear that it is not quite
                    obsolete. It is the word which has been formed into hunted, &amp; which was used in this particular place to recall the
                    metaphorical meaning, <del>up</del> custom having made us insensible of it. There is no jest in it &#8211; &amp; if you object to all
                    such things as jests &#8211; the book might avoid censure but would <del>xxxx</del> certainly have <hi rend="ital">no character at
                        all</hi>. I am not tenacious of trifles &#8211; &amp; you may alter it if you like.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To your next remark I wholly &amp; loudly dissent. Why not use the first person? Am I because I am writing a book
                    to speak of men whom I have known familiarly &amp; intimately just as of mere strangers &#8211; when their name comes in my way to look
                    at it &#8211; as a fellow from Westminster who wears a silk gown at Oxford stares at his old school &amp; <hi rend="ital">room-</hi>fellows when he meets them in the street, &amp; does not know them because forsooth he is a gentleman commoner? My dear
                    Grosvenor you forget how many persons will take up these volumes to whom Robert Southey is something more than an author &#8211;
                    something more than an invisible being who has no first person &#8211; to whom he is flesh &amp; blood, an actual existing being whom
                    they know to be possessed of human feeling, &amp; human recollections, &amp; from whom they expect, &amp; have reason to expect
                    the expression of that humanity. What is said of <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#CottleAmos">A. Cottle</ref>
          <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Lovell and Amos Cottle are not
                        included in the <title>Specimens</title>.</note> must not be altered, &#8211; do you not suppose that I would rather spit in the
                    face of all the critics of Xtendom &#8211; than tread unintentionally upon the toes of a common acquaintance &#8211; if I happened to hurt
                    him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Had you not better <del>let</del> direct Hollingsworth<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> S. Hollingsworth
                        (first name and dates unknown) of Crane Court, Fleet Street was the printer of the <title>Specimens</title>.</note> to send me
                    the proofs. that trouble you need not have.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As for all principles &amp; all personalities in the book remember it is I &#8211; not you who are responsible for them &#8211;
