          <salute>Dear Grosvenor</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have seen a sight more dreamy &amp; cheerful than any scenery
                    that fancy ever yet devised for Faery Land. &#8211; We had walked down to the Lake
                    side, it was a delightful day, the sun shining, &amp; a few white clouds hanging
                    motionless in the sky. the opposite shore of Derwent water consists of one long
                    mountain which suddenly terminates in an arch &#8211; thus [a large &#8216;u&#8217; shape drawn
                    here] &#8211; &amp; thro that opening you see a long valley between mountains, &amp;
                    bounded by mountain beyond mountain &#8211; to the right of this arch the heights are
                    more varied &amp; of greater elevation. Now as there was not a breath of air
                    stirring, the surface of the Lake was so perfectly still that it became one
                    great mirror, &amp; all its water disappeared. the whole line of shore was
                    represented as vividly &amp; steadily as it existed in its actual being &#8211; the
                    arch &#8211; the vale within &#8211; the single houses far within the vale &#8211; the smoke from
                    their chimneys &#8211; the farthest hills &#8211; &amp; the shadow &amp; substance joined at
                    their bases so indivisibly that you could make no separation even with your
                    judgement. As I stood on the shore Heaven &amp; the Clouds seemed lying under me
                    I was looking down into the sky, &amp; the whole range of mountains having one
                    line of summits under my feet, &amp; another above me seemed to be suspended
                    between two firmaments. Shut your eyes &amp; dream of a scene so unnatural &amp;
                    so beautiful. What I have said is most strictly &amp; scrupulously true &#8211; but it
                    was one of those happy moments that can seldom occur, for the least breath
                    stirring would have shaken the whole vision &amp; at once unrealized it. I have
                    before seen a partial appearance, but never before did, &amp; perhaps never
                    again may lose sight of the Lake entirely &#8211; for it literally seemed like an
                    abyss of sky below me &#8211; not fog &amp; clouds as from a mountain &#8211; but the blue
                    heaven spotted with a few fleecy pillows of cloud, that looked placed there for
                    Angels to rest upon them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am treating with my Booksellers to publish a supplementary or
                    companion work to <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis&#8217;s</ref>

                    English Poets good bad &amp; indifferent, with specimens of each &#8211; except the
                    dramatic writers. If this take place it will cost me a journey to London &amp; a
                    months hard work there &#8211; the main part can be done here. You know Ellis&#8217;s book

                    always either thus &#8211; or with a notion that I cannot find my books to go in with.
                    I never dream of Oxford, perhaps my stay there was not long enough to make an
