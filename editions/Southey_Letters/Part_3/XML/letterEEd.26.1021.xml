          <salute>Dear Danvers</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> It is so long since you have written that I begin to look with some anxiety for tidings of you. &#8211; I have letters
                    from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, twice since my last. The first to say that he had been brought to a Court
                    Martial by his Captain, for disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, &amp; contempt of his superior officer. The two first charges
                    were not proved. But it was proved that when Captain Heathcote<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Captain (later Admiral) Sir
                        Henry Heathcote (1777&#8211;1851), in command of HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi> 1803&#8211;1805.</note> had accused him of these
                    offences, he had replied I beg your pardon Sir I must contradict you. This was contempt in the Court Martial sense of the word,
                    &amp; for this he was sentenced to be dismissed the ship. &#8211; He now writes word that Commodore Hood,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Commodore (later Vice-Admiral) Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet (1762&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), who was in command of
                        the fleet in which Thomas Southey served.</note> having seen the minutes of the trial, &amp; spoken with some of the Captains
                    who were on it, has made him First Lieutenant on the Amelia, <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi> was a finer ship than Thomas Southey&#8217;s previous ship, the <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi>, because she was a
                        38-gun H&#233;b&#233;-class frigate of the French navy captured in 1796 and commissioned into the navy.</note> a much finer frigate than
                    the one he has left, &amp; speaks so highly of him that his present Captain<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William
                        Charles Fahie (1763&#8211;1833).</note> says he expects to see him a Commander in six months. The Commodore has even said he was
                    fitter to command the Galatea than Heathcote.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As soon as his first letter arrived I wrote hastily to bid him draw on you for thirty-pounds.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Thomas Southey, 17 December 1804, Letter 1004.</note> While I was writing the
                    second letter after some days, lest the first should have miscarried, <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> to whom I
                    had told the story, very unexpectedly wrote to say that if fifty pounds would be of any help to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> it was at my disposal for him. &#8211; As things now stand, I take it for granted he will
                    not draw: but if he should do you honour his drafts, &amp; the money shall be remitted to you as speedily as the posts will admit.
                    &#8211; This prevented him from being in the affair of the Lilly. he was under arrest &amp; could not go, &amp; the Lieutenant who went
                    in his place, &#8211; fell!<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 14 August 1804, the boats of Thomas Southey&#8217;s ship the <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi> made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer <hi rend="ital">General Ernouf</hi>
                        (formerly the British sloop of war <hi rend="ital">Lilly</hi>) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the
                        mission 65 were killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that his brother was among the dead, having read in the newspapers
                        that the first lieutenant had been killed. Thomas had been placed under arrest and Lieutenant Charles Hayman (d. 1804), his
                        replacement on the raid, died instead.</note> &#8211; Still I am uneasy about him, for the yellow fever was raging on board his
                    ship, having killed Lord Proby<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Allen Proby, Lord Proby (1779&#8211;1804), eldest son of

                    every day. It is not easy to conceive what is perfectly true &#8211; that he is totally destitute of any thing like modesty, yet without
                    the slightest tinge of impudence in his nature. His religion makes one of the most humorous parts of his character. &#8216;I&#8217;m a boy of
                    religious turn!&#8217; he says, &#8211; for he always talks of himself &amp; examines his own character just as if he was speaking of another
                    person, &amp; as impartially. Every night he makes an extempore prayer aloud, but it is always in bed, &amp; not till he is
                    comfortable there, &amp; got into the mood. When he is ready he touches <ref target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilson</ref> who sleeps with him, &amp; [MS torn] listen! &#8211; &amp; off he sets like a Preacher. If he has been
                    behaving amiss, away he goes for the Bible, &amp; looks out for something apposite to his case in the Psalms, or the Book of Job.
                    the other day after he had been in a violent passion, he chose out a chapter against wrath &#8211; &#8216;ah! that suits me!&#8217; The Bible is
                    also resorted to whenever he ails anything, &#8211; or else the prayer book. He once made a pun, upon occasion of the belly ache &#8211; tho I

                    me strikingly to resemble <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</ref>, in the affection he has for those who
                    are present with him, &amp; the little he cares about them when he is out of their sight. It is not possible for one human being

                    as fond of her as it is in his nature to be of any thing, &amp; probably loves her better than he does any body else. Last summer
                    she was dangerously ill, &amp; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> in consequence came &amp; lived at
                    home. He never manifested the slight uneasiness or concern about her, nor ever would go near her. I do not know whether I should
                        <del>xxxx</del> wish to have such a child or not. there is not the slightest evil in his disposition, but it wants something
                    to make it steadily good. physically &amp; morally there is a defect of courage. He is afraid of receiving pain, to such a degree
                    that if any person begins to read a newspaper, he will leave the room least there should be any thing shocking in it. This is the
                    explication of his conduct during <ref target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilsons</ref> illness. he would not
                    see her, because it would give him pain, &amp; when she was out of sight, he contrived to forget her. &#8211; I fear that if he lives he
                    will dream away life like <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</ref>, too much delighted with his own ideas
                    ever to embody them &#8211; or suffer them if he can help it, to be disturbed. &#8211; I gave him Robinson Crusoe two years ago. he never has
                    read, nor will read beyond Robinsons departure from the Island. No &#8211; he says &#8211; he does not care about him after wards, &amp; never
