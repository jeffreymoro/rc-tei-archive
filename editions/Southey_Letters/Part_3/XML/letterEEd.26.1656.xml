          <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will, I trust, excuse me for troubling you with a letter upon my own concerns, because it may possibly be in
                    your power to render me an essential service. Some little time since I was informed by <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> that <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Mr. Canning</ref> had expressed a wish to serve me, and the
                    result of some conversation which they held upon the subject was that Scott should inquire of me in what manner it might most
                    conveniently be done. A few years ago I would gladly have gone to Portugal; <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        uncle</ref> has now left that country. One main inducement is thus removed, and if it were necessary to enter into detail, it
                    might be shown that I should act imprudently, in the worldly sense of the word, by accepting anything that would be given me
                    there. The immediate emoluments would not support me, and for the prospects which might be held out hereafter, I am neither young
                    enough to enter upon, nor ambitious enough to desire them. To speak more truly, my ambition is fixed upon better things. There is,
                    however, a situation which it would perfectly suit me to hold: it is the stewardship for the Derwentwater estates, now held by a
                    Mr. Walton,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Nicholas Walton (d. 1809).</note> and expected soon to be vacated by his
                    death, as I am informed by <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Mr. Sharp</ref>, who indeed advised me to apply for it.
                    Accordingly I mentioned it to <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>; his answer is that the thing seems feasible, but
                    that it would be of great consequence to obtain <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale&#8217;s</ref> countenance, as his
                    recommendation will probably command that and everything else which falls in this country. These being the circumstances, may I
                    ask you to apply to Lord Lonsdale in my behalf? The situation is desirable, because it would suit my place of abode, and give me
                    the power of preserving the woods. My circumstances also are such that I must not refuse any fair opportunity of improving them;
                    and this opportunity have been offered, I trust you will excuse me for taking the only means in my power.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey asked several friends to intercede on his behalf for this position, but in the end it was considered
                        to be unsuitable for him; see Southey to Walter Scott, 8 August 1809 (Letter 1666) and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford,
                        12 August 1809 (Letter 1669).</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I beg my respects to <ref target="people.html#BeaumontLadyMary">Lady Beaumont</ref>. <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs. Coleridge</ref> and her sisters <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    little to do as possible with hopes and fears myself, and never communicate them unnecessarily to any one. For the literary news
                    of these mountains &#8211; heaven knows when you will see another number of <title>The Friend</title>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        twenty-eight parts between 1 June and 15 March 1810. Southey&#8217;s fears were prompted by a lapse between June and August when no
                        issues appeared.</note> To me and <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> it is a sore grief, and
                    earnestly did we wish that you might never see the first. A volume of my <title>History of Brazil</title> is far advanced in the

                    much longer. I am taking a lease of these premises for one-and-twenty years, and it is doubtful whether he may live to execute it,
                    averse as he is to anything like business, and as I am to pressing it upon him. <ref target="people.html#WilsonMrs">Mrs.
                        Wilson</ref> is his faithful and indefatigable nurse. She, I hope, will pass the remainder of her days with us, and it is
                    fortunate for her that the affection which she has formed for our children will in some measure supply the loss she must so soon
                    sustain.</p>
