                        him at his home in James Street, Westminster.</note> he however is not a man to be offended &amp; will not be displeased that
                    we escaped a long walk in the dust &amp; sunshine. I will send up the old Navigation book &amp; the Spanish Account of Sir Francis

                        listed in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, as nos 890 and 2382 respectively. Spanish accounts of Sir Francis Drake

                    have seen the title applied to a Saracen in Romance, but never in Spani[MS torn] history, where of course, if of Moorish origin,
