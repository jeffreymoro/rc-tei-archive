                        Letter 1387.</note> I bear as little ill-will to <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</ref> as he does to me,
                    &amp; attribute whatever civil things he has said of me to especial civility, whatever pert ones (a truer epithet than severe
                    would be) to the habit which he has acquired of taking it for granted that the Critic is, by virtue of his office, superior to
                        <del>the</del> &lt;every&gt; writer <del>who comes</del> &lt;whom he chuses to summon&gt; before him. The reviewals of Thalaba

                    aside, the objections which weigh with me <del>to</del> &lt;against&gt; bearing any part in this Journal are these. I have
                    scarcely one opinion in common with it upon any subject. Jeffray is for peace; &amp; is endeavouring to frighten the people into
                    it. I am for war as long as Bonaparte lives. He is for Catholick emancipation &#8211; I believe that its immediate consequences would be
                    to introduce an Irish Priest into every ship in the navy. My feelings are still less in unison with him than my opinions. On
                    subjects of moral or political importance no man is more apt to speak in the very gall of bitterness than I am, &amp; this habit
                    is likely to go with me to the grave; but that sort of <del>severity</del> &lt;bitterness&gt; in which he indulges, which tends
                    directly &amp; purposely to wound a man in his feelings, &amp; injure him in his fame &amp; fortune (<ref target="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</ref> is a case in point)<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Edinburgh
                        belittled the third edition of James Montgomery&#8217;s 1806 poem <title>The Wanderer of Switzerland</title> in volume 9 (January
                        1807), 347&#8211;54.</note> appears to me utterly inexcusable. Now tho there would be no necessity that I should follow this
                    example, yet every seperate article in the review derives authority from the merit of all the others, &amp; in this way whatever
                    of any merit I might insert there would aid &amp; abet opinions hostile to my own, &amp; there make me art &amp; part in a system
                    which I thoroughly disapproved. This is not said hastily. the emolument to be derived from writing at ten guineas a sheet Scotch
                    measure instead of seven pounds, annual, would be considerable, &#8211; the pecuniary advantage resulting from the different manner in
                    which my future works would be handled, probably still more so. But my <del>own</del> moral <del>xxxxxxxx</del> &lt;feelings&gt;
                    must not be compromised. To <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</ref> as an individual I shall ever be ready to show
