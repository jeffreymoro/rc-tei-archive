                    thanks be to God – is as well as could be wished, &amp; tomorrow I set my face southward &amp; depart from home. My habits have
                    long been so domestic &amp; so uniform that to set out upon any journey seems a more formidable undertaking, &amp; is a more
                    unpleasant one than it ought to be. I have however company to lighten the wearisomeness of the way as far as Staffordshire. My
                    brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</ref> goes with me to <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</ref>,
                    where after halting a day or two at <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Teddesley</ref>, we seperate, – he for Bristol &amp; I for
                    Litchfield on my London road. <del>xxxx xxxxx xxxxx</del> As we travel slowly for the sake of saving fatigue, seeing where we go,
                    &amp; beating up the quarters of one or two old acquaintance, it may be nearly a fortnight before <hi rend="ital">I</hi> reach
                    Litchfield, – but I will write from <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</ref>, &amp; tell you on what day I shall be at
                    your door. Had it not been for the sad knowledge that you are an invalid I think I should have made for Litchfield first, &amp;
                    ventured to show you my brother. He is three years younger than me, but made older in appearance &amp; in constitution by fifteen
                    years hard service in the navy. In the action between the Mars &amp; L’Hercule,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Fought
                        21 April 1798.</note> – the most memorable that was fought between two single ships during the last war, he distinguished
                    himself, &amp; earned his Lieutenants commission. We had reason to hope he would be promoted under M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                    Grenvilles reign at the admiralty;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Grenville (1755–1846; <title>DNB</title>),
                        First Lord of the Admiralty 1806–1807.</note> – that hope is over, &amp; length of service in the navy &lt;only&gt; lessens
                    the chance of reward. I could say much upon the state of that navy, which is now the only bulwark of liberty if it were not for
                    his sake. But however wholesome &amp; important the advice, the adviser would never be forgiven, – &amp; I pay more regard to his
                    interests than I would do to my own. You would have been well pleased with him, – he has all the best parts of the
                    sailor-character, &amp; his own good heart has preserved him from all the bad ones.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am too busy in preparing for a two months absence, &amp; too much occupied with thinking about it, to have either
                    leisure or spirits for writing as I wished &amp; meant to have done. My <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">eldest
                        girl</ref>  clings to me &amp; says don’t go, – my <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">little boy</ref>
                     will lead his nursemaid tomorrow to my study door, &amp; find no one there to show him the pictures. – I had need think
                    of Litchfield &amp; of what I shall see there with more respect than the <del>shrine</del> &lt;altar&gt; of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                    health; – yet I shall find &lt;you&gt; with a young heart, &amp; an intellect to which time has only given strength; with all that
                    is immortal about you fresh &amp; vigorous – the oracle still what it was, – whatever be the state of the shrine –</p><closer><signed rend="indent1"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
