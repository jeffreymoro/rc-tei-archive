                        Baronet of Isell, Cumberland (c. 1764–1806).</note> &amp; staid there two nights – an ugly place 18 miles off. His score &amp;
                    forty servants are the most insolent rabble I ever encountered in a great mans house. he is a good natured man – &amp; his library
                    very costly – 7000£ he has expended in prints &amp; books of natural history – but the other collection is by no means
                    proportionately valuable. he is liberal in the offer of his books &amp; I brought home some of real value. it was very interesting
                    to see his birds for he has all sorts of animals there – &amp; the birds that can bear the climate were all at liberty – so tame
                    that you may walk up to them, &amp; so wild that they fly (the water fowl) six <hi rend="ital">mile</hi> off to the nearest Lake.
                    They put me in mind of Adam &amp; Eves tame fowl.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Genesis 2: 19–20.</note> I met there
                    some good sturdy politicians, &amp; talked more to my hearts content than I had done for many a long day. Our politics here are
                    very different from what they are in the West of England, I do assure you that it would be a source of some pride to me were I a
                    Cumbrian by birth.</p><p rend="indent1"> No farther tidings of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref>. Of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> the news as good as I could wish. I hear <hi rend="ital">from</hi> him

                    sitting up at Sir Wilfreds. my stomach chose to grow very sour upon the occasion. yesterday I came home, &amp; am better to day,
                    till this I never remember four months of such high health as I have enjoyed here – &amp; I think I can feel it returning again.
                    quiet &amp; regularity suit me best, &amp; home is the best place after all. I compare returning after a visit, to slipping off
