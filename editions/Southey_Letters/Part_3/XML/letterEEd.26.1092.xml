          <salute>Dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> On my return last night I found both your letters. I found also letters from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> telling me that his Spanish Prizes were taken two days too soon &#8211; &#8216;they are now by some extraordinary act given to
                    indemnify the merchants who suffered when Spain laid the embargo &#8211; so much for my 2000&#163;!&#8217; &#8211; This at least is what the W. Indian
                    agents say. Many officers have received part of their shares in advance &#8211; &amp; cannot repay the money. This luckily is not <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</ref> case.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In December 1804, the naval ship HMS
                            <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and
                            cargo captured in armed conflict, but because these ships had been captured before war was officially declared, the prize money was being withheld. Southey took up his brother&#8217;s cause to have his share reinstated.</note> But I do not believe that Government
                        <del>xx x xxxxxxx xxxxx</del> can have resolved to reimburse the merchants by robbing the sailors, tho there was a paragraph
                    in the Courier stating that the <del>xxxxx xxx</del> frigates which were captured so villainously were to be so disposed of. The
                    Courier is a rascally paper, but if I find there be really good grounds for supposing that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</ref> prize money is to be made away with in this unprecedented manner, I believe I can get the Courier to take the
                    matter up, &amp; will certainly make as much noise as possibly about the rascality of robbing the navy.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The paragraph in <title>The Courier</title> which Southey refers to has not been traced, but presumably it was
                        his influence that caused <title>The Courier</title> to publish a paragraph supporting the sailors&#8217; claim to the prize-money
                        on Saturday 24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <title>The Courier</title> on 31 August
                        1805 under the title &#8216;Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turners</ref> book is rich in curious <del>xx</del> matter.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The fourth and final volume of Turner&#8217;s <title>History of the Anglo-Saxons</title> (1799&#8211;1805) was published
                        in 1805.</note> It would have been better if twice as long. still better if as much as possible had been woven into the
                    history in chronological order. The facts about chivalry are very important &amp; decisive. &#8211; Of Leo X I have read nearly two
                        volumes.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Roscoe, <title>The Life of Pope Leo X, Son of Lorenzo de&#8217;

                        449&#8211;467.</note> That book will disappoint every body, because every body expects a splendid story &#8211; &amp; the story is not
                    splendid. The names of a whole thousand &amp; one Latin versifiers with the list of their works are but little interesting except
                    to bibliologists. &#8211; the French men in Italy are told somewhat perhaps too much at length for their place, yet too <del>xxxxx xx
                        xxx</del> briefly if their own importance be considered, &amp; after all they are not very interesting in themselves. The
                    scene is not great enough for the drama. As for the book it is neither better nor worse than the Lorenzo.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Roscoe, <title>The Life of Lorenzo de&#8217; Medici</title> (1796).</note> But <ref target="people.html#RoscoeWilliam">Roscoe</ref> is so excellent a good man that I shall smooth it over, &#8211; lay all the fault
                    upon the subject &#8211; &amp; leave it to take its place upon the shelf &#8211; <del>for</del> others it will get by his reputation, &amp;
                    there it will stay by its own good-for-nothingness.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry to say that you have over rated the sale of Madoc. Nearly 300 only have been sold &#8211; the edition being
                    only 500. Its non reviewal is matter of chance &#8211; as I have no friend in any review except our own great Annual.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey worked for the <title>Annual Review</title> from 1802 to 1808.</note> One of my friends
                    expresses a wish to see young Roscius<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Roscius&#8217; is a generic term for an actor, after the
                        Roman actor, Quintus Roscius Gallus (c. 126&#8211;62 BC), but here Southey is referring specifically to William Henry West Betty
                        (1791&#8211;1824; <title>DNB</title>). He was a child prodigy who made his London debut at Covent Garden in December 1804 and then
                        proceeded on an extremely successful tour of Scotland and England in the summer of 1805. The excitement about him, which led
                        to him being hailed as the &#8216;Young Roscius&#8217;, peaked during the 1804&#8211;1805 season, and then quickly faded.</note> painted as

                        brothers; Dafydd gradually brought it all under his rule. When the sons of Henry II (1133&#8211;1189; King of England 1154&#8211;1189;

                        marriage in 1174 to the English king&#8217;s illegitimate half-sister Emma of Anjou (b. c. 1138). Dafydd was imprisoned by Llewelyn
                        in 1197 and then driven out by him in 1203, dying in the same year.</note>
