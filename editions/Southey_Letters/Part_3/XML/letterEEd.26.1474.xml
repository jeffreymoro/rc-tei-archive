                        paragraph, the version published in Betham, House of Letters, is actually a section of a 3 June 1809

        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter, my dear Madam, has just prevented some arrangements which I was making for the conveyance of the
                    picture to Cumberland, &amp; &lt;also&gt; for what, I perceive, must not now be mentioned.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey had sat to Betham for his portrait in March; it seems that she had now waived her fee.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> desires me to express her thanks at present, &amp; hopes you will one day give
                    her an opportunity of expressing them herself at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. We have heard of the miniature
                    from a friend who saw it unexpectedly in the Exhibition, &amp; was much struck with the likeness. &#8211; I thank you likewise for your
                    intentions with respect to <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>. You would have found him the most
                    wonderful man living in conversation, &#8211; but the most impracticable one for a painter, &amp; had you begun the picture, it is ten
                    thousand to one that you must have finished it from memory. His countenance is the most variable that I have ever seen; sometimes
                    it is kindled with the brightest expression, &amp; sometimes all its light goes out &amp; is utterly extinguished. Nothing can
                    convey stronger indications of power than his eye, eye brow &amp; fore head, &#8211; nothing can be more imbecil than all the rest of
                    the face; &#8211; look at them seperately you would hardly think it possible that they could belong to one head, &#8211; look at them together
                    you wonder how they came so, &amp; are puzzled what to expect from a character whose outward &amp; visible signs are so
                    contradictory.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry I should have expressed my sense of Lady Bedingfields<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charlotte
                        Jerningham, Lady Bedingfield (1771&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>), Betham&#8217;s friend since the 1790s, was proposing to illustrate one
                        of Southey&#8217;s poems.</note> kindness so lamely that you were not certain I was gratified, &amp; that in a very high degree. It
                    has been my lot, Miss Betham, to meet with much injustice in the world &#8211; both as an individual &amp; an author, &amp; the effect
                    it has had upon me has been to make me more sensible of any act of kindness. I have taken up a comfortable opinion that evil
                    tongues speak only for themselves, but that favourable ones may be considered as speaking for posterity; &amp; this opinion is
                    likely to be true, because they who abuse me do it in their vocation &amp; have therefore an obvious motive for so doing, whereas
                    on the other hand no person can have any other motive for praising me &#8211; than the belief <del>x</del> that I deserve praise. We who
                    write poetry have a double object in view, to please ourselves, &amp; to please others; it is very gratifying to succeed in
                    either. &#8211;Besides the general reason why I am greatly gratified in this <del>particular</del> instance, it will give<add>n</add> me
                    particular pleasure to see my own conceptions embodied, &amp; set before me in a visible &amp; permanent form. It has been always
                    my wish to have my <del>long p</del> long poems accompanied with <del>xxx</del> prints, because so many pictures are lost to those
                    readers who are not familiar with the costume: I particularly desired this for Madoc,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Madoc</title> (1805).</note> but the difficulty of getting designs was such that it was better to give up the
                    attempt, &#8211; &amp; what little was done had better have been left undone. &#8211; I got a ship copied from the Bayeux tapestry,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Bayeux tapestry, commissioned by Bishop Odo (d. 1097), the half-brother of William I, the
                        Conqueror (1027/8&#8211;1087; reigned 1066&#8211;1087; <title>DNB</title>), completed c. 1077.</note> &amp; sent to Pococke<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Nicholas Pocock (1740&#8211;1821): marine painter, formerly a merchant seaman. Pocock exhibited
                        regularly at the Royal Academy from 1782&#8211;1815 and was a founder member of the Old Watercolour Society in 1804. Southey felt
                        that Pocock spoilt the image of Madoc&#8217;s ship that he had been commissioned to make for the 1805 edition of the poem, by
                        drawing an anachronistic vessel.</note> to make a drawing from it, &#8211; he, hearing that the subject of the poem was the
                    discovery of America by Madoc, chose to think of Columbus, &#8211; &amp; accordingly laid the right ship aside &amp; put in its place
                    one of Columbus&#8217;s age, &#8211; that is, three hundred years more modern than it ought to have been.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It gives me much pleasure to hear that you are able to set foot to the ground; &#8211; I should like also to hear that
