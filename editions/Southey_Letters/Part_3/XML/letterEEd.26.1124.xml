        <p rend="indent1"> Colonel Hill, concerning whom you enquire, is the son of my grandfather by a first marriage.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s grandfather was named Edward Hill (1705&#8211;1765), as was this son of his first marriage,
                        who held a commission in the marines.</note> After his fathers death he quarrelled with my grandmother.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Margaret Tyler, n&#233;e Bradford (d. 1783).</note> One cause of dispute was respecting some place,
                    which came from her family, &amp; which he wanted to get possession of, but which was secreted from him. He certainly behaved very
                    ill upon the occasion. My grandfathers second marriage had been wholly to his advantage, &amp; to the injury of the Tylers,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Before Margaret Tyler married Edward Hill she had four children with her first husband,
                        John Tyler (dates unknown). They were: <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Elizabeth</ref>, John, William and
                        Edward.</note> &#8211; yet Captain Hill, as he then was, tho his father left a family of boys, even sold his fathers wardrobe, &amp;
                    so utterly neglected them, that <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> paid his own school bills when it was in
                    his power. This occasioned a quarrel between them, after <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> took orders,
                    &amp; almost a duel. the Captain said in the course of a paper war that it was only his gown protected him, &#8211; &amp; <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> replied in the same spirit &#8211; that he did not consider it a protection,
                    &amp; believed he was not the first coward who had worn a red coat.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</ref>, in spite of these circumstances, always remembered Capt. Hill with much
                    affection, for he had been kind to her in her childhood &#8211; being above twenty years older. &amp; <del>by</del> &lt;at&gt; her
                    pressing request I found him out in London in the year 98. &amp; once breakfasted with him. He was very civil &amp; expressed some
                    anxiety for his relations &#8211; but it seemed to be done as a thing which he knew ought to be done in decency &#8211; rather than from any
                    principle or real concern. He reminded me much of <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> in his person &amp; is
                    certainly a very fine old man. I should have liked him much if his heart had been in the right place. It is not in the right
                    place; &#8211; for my poor cousin <ref target="people.html#HillMargaret">Margerett</ref> (who first opend a communication with him, as
                    he had been of some service to her unhappy father<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably Joseph Hill (dates unknown),
                        the brother of Southey&#8217;s mother, Margaret Southey.</note>) received kind letters from him &amp; promises, which ended in
                    nothing &amp; were meant to be nothing. I found out his new lodgings when <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my
                        mother</ref> was in her last illness, &amp; left a card there; but he was then at Chatham (his usual residence) &amp; from
                    that time I have received no other intelligence of him than what your letter &lt;now&gt; communicates. In fact I have never looked
                    for him; my former advances were made on my mothers account &#8211; I spoke of him one day at Lisbon, &amp; saw that <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> retained his former feelings &#8211; he told me the story, took quicker strides
                    as he walked across the room, &amp; called him &#8216;the fellow&#8217; &#8211; which is the harshest phrase of anger he ever permits himself to
                    use. &#8211; He has no children &#8211; but his wife&#8217;s son will in all probability have his fortune, which, if the prize money for the Cape of
                    Good Hope<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Marines, like Royal Navy sailors, were entitled to a share of prize money from
                        captured enemy ships and their cargos. For instance Dutch ships captured at the Cape of Good Hope in October 1797 resulted in
                        a sum of &#163;120,000 being shared out among British ships and their crew-members. The Cape of Good Hope was captured by the

                        and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted
                        a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize money was contested because the
                        ships were captured before war was officially declared. Southey took up his brother&#8217;s cause to have his share reinstated and
                            <title>The Courier</title> published a paragraph supporting the sailors&#8217; claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24 August
                        1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <title>The Courier</title> on 31 August 1805 under the title
                        &#8216;Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants&#8217;. A &#8216;reply from a
                        Spanish merchant&#8217; appeared in <title>The Courier</title> for 6 September 1805. Southey&#8217;s response, that the prize money was
                        being withheld from the sailors in a measure that was &#8216;impolitic, ungenerous and unjust&#8217; was published in <title>The
                            Courier</title> of 25 September 1805, p. 2. This was refuted by an editorial article in <title>The Courier</title> of 28
                        September 1805, where it was stated that there was no truth in Southey&#8217;s assertion.</note> It seems that if the Ministry really mean to take the money they are ashamed to do it openly.</p>
