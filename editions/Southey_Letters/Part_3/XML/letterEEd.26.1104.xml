        <p rend="indent1"> Norris of Bemerton is the man I mean.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey is instructing Bedford on
                        entries to include within their joint project, <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>, published with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 1807 as a companion to George Ellis, <title>Specimens of the Early
                            English Poets</title> (1790, 2nd edn 1801, 3rd edn 1803). He had asked Bedford about &#8216;Norris of Bemerton&#8217; in an earlier
                        letter; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 26 July 1805, Letter 1086. John Norris (1657&#8211;1712; <title>DNB</title>) was a
                        Church of England clergyman and philosopher who published <title>A Collection of Miscellanies</title> (1687) which included
                        almost all the poetry he wrote. There is no entry for Norris in the <title>Specimens of the Later English
                        Poets</title>.</note> Did you not understand that those authors <del>whose</del> the time of whose death was not known, were
                    to be inserted according to the date of their publications? to class them at the end as you seem to talk of would be absurd. It
                    will be very easy to insert Norris &amp; any others who may have been omitted, in their right place, by only paging such
                    insertions with an * to mark the duplication. As for the Anonymous we had better altogether omit them &#8211; there are none of any
                        <del>xxx</del> notoriety before the political or personal satires of the present reign, therefore better left alone.</p>

                        (1729), is said to have &#8216;pronounced Mr Pope &#8220;a very honest Man&#8221;, by this time a well-known term for a Jacobite&#8217;

                    &amp; I were to contradict one another.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> There is no &#8216;preliminary notice&#8217; introducing the
                        selections from the poetry of Alexander Pope (1688&#8211;1744) included in the <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>,
                        3 vols (1807), II, pp. 10&#8211;14. Pope is, however, mentioned in Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Preface&#8217;, I, pp. xxix&#8211;xxxi.</note>

It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and
                        cargo captured in armed conflict, but the prize money was contested because the ships were captured before war was officially
                        declared. Southey took up his brother&#8217;s cause to have his share reinstated in <title>The Courier</title> which published a
                        paragraph supporting the sailors&#8217; claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence
                        of their position in <title>The Courier</title> on 31 August 1805 under the title &#8216;Indemnification to the Spanish
                        Merchants&#8217;.</note> If I were in town it might answer to keep it up by squibs &amp; allusions, &amp; to open in other papers to
                    which it would not be difficult to get access &#8211; At this distance I can do nothing more. I have stated the grievance fairly, &amp;
                    called upon Lord Barham<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham (1726&#8211;1813;

                    the navy. As he takes it up or neglects it, it will be a handle for his friends &amp; his enemies.</p>
