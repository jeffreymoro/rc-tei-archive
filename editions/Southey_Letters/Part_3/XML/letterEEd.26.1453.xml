          <salute>My dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> That part of your letter which relates to <ref target="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">Mr. Wilberforce</ref>
                    requires an immediate answer; for, by this time, you must have received my parcel, and no time ought to be lost in getting the new
                    edition through the press. Undoubtedly, if Mr. Wilberforce and Mr. Simeon desire to have their names withdrawn,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Wilberforce and Charles Simeon (1759&#8211;1836; <title>DNB</title>) had been recorded in
                            <title>The Remains of Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham</title> (1807), as having contributed &#163;20 and &#163;30 per annum
                        respectively to <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry Kirke White&#8217;s</ref> education. Now they were requesting that
                        this information should be omitted from the second edition.</note> they must be. At the same time, I cannot but say that it
                    appears to me a very idle request on their parts; for, admitting that there was any good reason for keeping the thing secret, that
                    which has been printed in 750 books, and read by ten times as many readers, copied into magazines and reviews, and by their means
                    circulated through all the reading populations of Great Britain, must be already as well known as it can be. They may object to
                    letting their light shine before men, but when the candle has been set up and looked at, if they choose to have it blown out, it
                    is my opinion that the smell of the snuff will attract more notice than the light would have done.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But the sum which <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> received from these gentlemen must not be
                    vaguely stated, &#8211; that is an essential matter of fact; it is of consequence that the precise nature and amount of his resources
                    should be reported, and I do not think any valid reason can be assigned, on the part of his patrons, for pressing this omission
                    upon me. The public would be deceived by the omission, and certainly suspect that the aid which he received was more, unless they
                    are told how little it was.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As little can I consent to leaving out that passage which expresses <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry&#8217;s</ref> intention of becoming a dissenting minister, if he could find no means of ordination in the establishment. It
                    is not possible that the sale of the book can be affected by it in the slightest degree. Had I overlooked the fact, I should have
                    deserved censure for negligence; did I expunge it now, I should be liable to a heavier charge.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I feel myself much indebted to you for your prompt vindication against the &#8216;Christian Observer&#8217;s&#8217; suspicions, and
                    shall much like to see your letter.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> A review in the <title>Christian Observer</title>, 7
                        (March 1808), 190&#8211;195, suspected Southey, as a radical unsympathetic to evangelical Christianity, of excluding from the
                            <title>Remains</title> papers of Kirke White&#8217;s concerning religion.</note> For their animadversions I have not the same
                    curiosity; it is satisfactory to know that they speak well of the book, and I have no desire to know more.</p>
