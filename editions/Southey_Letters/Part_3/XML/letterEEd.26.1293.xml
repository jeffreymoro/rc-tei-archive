                            White, of the Town of Wolverhampton, at Holywell, in Flintshire, on the 28th of June, 1805</title> detailing many cases of
                        miraculous cures at the fountain. Southey and Milner became opponents in print in the 1820s.</note> If you wish to see the
                    number of Catholick Seminaries in this country<del>s</del>, you may find a list of them in the Lay Directory, which is a Catholick
                    Almanack, published by Keating &amp; Brown the Catholick booksellers by Grosvenor Square. Many of these seminaries are regular
                    nunneries, into which the children of Protestant parents have been persuaded to enter, &#8211; that is, they have been driven mad by the
                    Catholick Priests, &amp; then have chosen these Bedlams for themselves.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I know the whole history of this religion so well (having for some years been collecting materials for a history of
                    the Monastic Orders)<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> This was never completed.</note> &#8211; &amp; am so deeply convinced of
                    its demoralizing &amp; fatal tendency, &amp; of the impossibility of relaxing our wise old laws against it without danger, that if
                    I were not so much employed as to render it impossible for me to find time, I should feel it my duty to write a pamphlet upon the
                    subject.</p>
