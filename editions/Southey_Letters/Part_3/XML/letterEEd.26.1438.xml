                    The story is enough for a ballad &amp; not for more, &amp; the poet is made subservient to the antiquarian not the antiquarian to
                    the poet. It has beautiful parts, &#8211; yet &#8211; before it appeared I thought within myself how glad I should be to write such a poem at
