                    page is torn, &amp; you will easily know it. it is not lettered &amp; the covers are wood within the leather. Send this for me to

                    great manuscript chronicle,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> This is probably the manuscript by Fernao Lopes (c. 1385&#8211;after
                        1459), &#8216;Cronica del Rei Dom Fernando o Noveno Rei de Portugal&#8217;, no. 3829 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library after his

                    &amp; has brass knobs on the binding &#8211; indeed you know the book. Wynn will get it bound for me, for till it is bound it cannot be
                    used without receiving injury from the board covers as it is opened. As the one is not mine, &amp; the other almost invaluable,
                    pray pack them in plenty of paper, &amp; pay the carriage. &amp; if you will take the trouble of dropping Wynn a line to say when
                    you have sent them, it will be a means of security.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> If Portugal be forced into a war with us, which by the public accounts seems exceedingly probable, what will you
                    do? if people leave off Port wine, because they can get none, there is a chance that they will not take any other foreign wine,
                    for indeed what can be got in its place? &#8211; I cannot but think that it would be a very promising speculation to manufacture wines
                    for sale, as good as are sometimes made for home consumption. Ten pounds sacrificed in experiments would enable one to produce
                    many different flavours, &amp; if they were really made good, as they certainly can be &#8211; it does not appear improbable to me that
                    the person<del>s</del> who starts upon the plan would find it a very profitable one at present, &#8211; still more so if the regular
                    wine trade should be so dislocated as it would be by a Portugueze war. Almost every foreign wine may be well imitated. <del>xxx
                        xxx</del> black currants will make something <hi rend="ital">essentially</hi> like port, that word is used <del>when</del>
                    with chemical accuracy as I am convinced that the colouring matter is the same. Enough use is not made of flowers in this way. why
                        <hi rend="ital">only</hi> cowslips? &#8211; This is worth thinking of, &amp; talking of with <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref>. many old beverages may be revived, many new ones by the help of chemistry invented, &amp; you would find the
                    pursuit interesting. I could throw out many hints upon the subject &#8211; but this is enough just now. A common brewing apparatus is
                    all that is necessary.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Instead of sending you news of Madoc now, I must look for <del>xxx</del> news from you. One is going to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southey</ref>, an experiment which may take heaven knows how. If he lived more in the
                    world there would be no doubt about it, &#8211; but he has probably no notion of the rank which literature gives in society, &amp; the
                    advantages resulting from it. However the sight of so handsome a book may perhaps please him, &#8211; &amp; at any rate it is best to
                    try. &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am tooth &amp; nail at the history,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217;,
                        which was never completed.</note> &#8211; you will be surprized to see how it has grown, in spite of all other business, &amp;
                    &lt;all&gt; interruptions. Should <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> come to England, which seems very
                    probable I shall prepare the first volume for the press in the course of next winter, &amp; delighted shall I be to see the first
                    proof sheet. &#8211; His coming would decide where my tent is to be pitched at last: an event which may probably be accelerated in an
                    other way by this war. for should <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> take any prizes<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of &#8216;prizes&#8217;, meaning ships and their
                        cargo, captured in armed conflict.</note> I will borrow a couple of hundreds of him &amp; delay no longer. Poor fellow if he
                    lives he is in a fair way. The Whitehaven paper<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Cumberland Pacquet and Ware&#8217;s Whitehaven Advertiser</title>.</note> stated that the Amelia with another ship had
                    sent three Spanish prizes into Barbadoes<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> In December 1804 HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and the ship
                            <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with
                        cotton.</note> &#8211; probably of no great value as they were not called rich, &amp; one was an old packet, but a trifling prize
                    looks well to the Lieutenants. &#8211; As for literary prizes I see little likelihood of their doing any thing more than just keeping me
                    even with the world, till I get my history out, of which I look upon the profits as almost certain; unless I could determine to
                    write a play, &#8211; at which my stomach turns.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As soon as the trees get into full leaf I would not have you delay your journey. a thousand accidents may be in the
                    way, &amp; you &amp; I need not now be told to take time by the forelock. I have no intention of remaining another winter here, if
                    it be possible to remove. The situation is too inconvenient, &amp; tho I can well forego the luxuries of society I cannot without
                    the necessaries. Nothing but the coarsest &amp; commonest wares are to be supplied here, &#8211; &amp; above all I want my Books. &#8211;
                    remember me to your brother<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly John Danvers (dates unknown).</note> if he be with
                    you. I hope he will have his share of the dollars.</p>
