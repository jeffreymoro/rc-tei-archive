          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Both cheese &amp; rug have at last arrived in safety &#8211; they parted company on the road, &amp; the latter was left a
                    week at Kendal, for the carriers convenience. &#8211; I would not write to thank you for them till both had made their appearance. The
                    cheese is in course of eating, &amp; an excellent specimen it is of the produce of my native county. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Great things have been done in Spain since the date of your letter. I myself, since the insurrection in Madrid<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The French army occupying Madrid was forced from the city by a popular uprising that began
                        on 2 May 1808.</note> &amp; the carnage which took place there, have never entertained a doubt of the eventual success of the
                    Spaniards, &#8211; the compleat deliverance of that peninsula is certain, &amp; I am not without a lively hope that it may draw after it
                    the deliverance of Europe. French literature which carries plague &amp; poison rottenness &amp; ruin with it wherever it goes, had
                    infected Germany from one end to the other. Every state there had its own politics, &#8211; its own vexations, its own tyrants, &#8211; they
                    were Saxons, Hessians, Bavarians &amp;c &#8211; any thing but Germans, &#8211; &amp; the Germanic body was a mazy limbed monster, with one
                    palsied head, &amp; without a heart. There was no common feeling then, difference of religion produced animosities which were
                    aggravated by their sameness of language, &amp; we have had disastrous proofs that their army &amp; jealousy of each other were
                    stronger than their hatred of an invading enemy. Every thing is different in Spain: there &amp; in Portugal the people have not
                    degenerated, tho the Governments have been below contempt, &#8211; &amp; such as the Governments were they, <del>xxx</del> excited pity
                    &amp; regret in the subject, rather than <del>hatred</del> &lt;resentment&gt;. The relaxation of criminal justice passed for
                    lenity, &#8211; &amp; the people even took a pride in the Despotism which had become inoffensive, &#8211; King Lion on a velvet cushion,
                    showing his teeth only when he yawn&#8217;d, &amp; his claws only when he stretched himself, is of all objects of political devotion
                    that which would most be admired by a people who can bear with any King at all; &#8211; &amp; the constant tendency of all monarchies
                    towards despotism is because the people are ashamed of King Log.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> From a classical fable in
                        which the frogs wanted a king, and Jupiter gave them a log of wood; when they complained, he sent them a stork, which promptly
                        gobbled them up [<title>OED</title>].</note> The Portugueze, would willingly hang three fourths of their fidalgos, &#8211; &amp; I
                    should have no objection to supply them with halters for the occasion; &#8211; but they love the house of Braganza.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Portuguese ruling family.</note> &#8211; In both countries there is a proud remembrance of their
                    faded greatness, a generous feeling<del>s</del> of what their fathers were, an exultation at the mention of old times, accompanied
                    with an expression of regret &amp; shame, yet not without hope, &#8211; which no person can ever have witnessed without a conviction
                    that the degeneration of those countries was at hand. Their very religion, amid fopperies &amp; follies which <del>pr</del> excite
                    a smile in every stranger, &amp; abominations which an <del>xxxx</del> enlightened Christian cannot regard without humiliation
                    &amp; sorrow, &#8211; has yet with it a life &amp; ardour which it is impossible to contemplate without wonder, &#8211; I might almost say
                    without respect. Never was any idolatry so fitted to the wants of weaknesses &amp; wishes of human nature, &#8211; never was any
                    mythology so rivetted &amp; rooted in the hearts of the people.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Bonaparte has not done all the work which I hoped he would do. The house of Austria is not <del>swe</del> yet swept
                    from the earth, &#8211; &amp; the Cross is not yet replaced upon the dome of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sophias.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> The mosque in Istanbul.</note> The heart of man is against him &amp; it will not surprize me if the French
                    themselves turn against him in his hour of evil. They are a cursed race on whom there can be no hold. Religion will sometimes
                    supply the place of moral feeling, moral feeling sometimes supply the place of religion. honour sometimes supply the want of both,
                    &#8211; but the French have neither. They have never loved Bonaparte, &amp; when Fortune forsakes him he has nothing to trust to.</p>
