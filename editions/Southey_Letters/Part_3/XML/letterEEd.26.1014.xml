                    child. she grew up there &amp; took the vows. Shortly after there came over a &lt;young&gt; Irish woman by name Louisa
                        Bourke,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Untraced.</note> who went thro her year of probation resolutely &amp;
                    professed. She had left her own country &amp; thus abandoned the world in a fit of jealousy. Her lover at length traced her,
                    followed her &amp; spoke with her at the grate. They corresponded upon the means of getting her out by way of dispensation &#8211; the
                    scheme was discovered &#8211; &amp; it was said Louise died <del>xxx</del> soon after. Jane Power was ill at this time. After her
                    recovery being in a remote part of the Convent which was not <del>xx</del> in use, she heard Louisa&#8217;s voice as within the wall,
                    thought it was her spirit &amp; asked if she should order any services for her soul. Louisa directed her how to find an entrance
                    to her place of confinement, which was on a higher story, matted round &amp; so entirely remote from all hearing that she had even
                    her instrument there. She had that day got down by finding some means of slipping back a lock or bolt &amp; by the same means Jane
                    was enabled to visit her which she did regularly every night for some months. Once she staid later than usual, because her friend
                    appeared more depressed than she had ever seen her; in consequence of this delay her lamp being exhausted went out in the
                    cloisters, she was afraid that she might mistake her cell &amp; thus be discovered, &amp; therefore sat herself down to wait for
                    day break. When the dawn came she thought she would first go back &amp; tell Louisa how she had past the night. She knocked &amp;
                    received no answer. She pusht the door &amp; found something against it. &#8211; <del>xx</del> on opening it saw Louisa lying on the
                    ground with her throat cut from ear to ear. Jane Power immediately fainted &#8211; &amp; in that state was found by the Nuns who came
                    with food for their prisoner. They made her take a solemn vow never to reveal what she had seen.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> She continued several years longer in the nunnery &#8211; her sister&#8217;s husband had a <del>xxx</del> civil appointment in
                    our army there: &#8211; (his name is Heatley or Headley) &amp; latterly the frequent visits of her sister &amp; her English friends made
                    her life more chearful than that of a nun usually can be. When the troops were removing she complained bitterly to her sister
                    &amp; Heatley determined to carry her off. he conveyed boy&#8217;s cloaths to her, &amp; gave her his watch to know the hour, &amp; that
                    all might be well made the male part of the establishment drunk. <del>xxx</del> Jane in her disguise came to the door the key
                    creaked &#8211; she had resolution to go back to the dormitory &amp; dip it in the lamp. The hour was too soon &#8211; for never having
                    &lt;had&gt; a watch before she had not wound it up, &amp; she flung the watch over the wall for a signal instead of a stone.
                    However she effected her escape.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Still there remained a difficulty. The Captain of the Packet who had promised to carry her repented &amp; refused
                    after she was out of the convent. She was got on board by the management of Colonel Trents wife<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Possibly the wife of Colonel Trent (dates unknown) who commanded a force of Portuguese infantry in the
                        Peninsular War.</note> who went in the same packet &amp; the Captain of a Frigate who was acquainted with the story convoyed
                    the vessel out, declaring that if Todd<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Captain Fortescue Todd (dates unknown),
