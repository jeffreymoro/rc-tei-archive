        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> who is not a very frequent correspondent to any body, desires me when I
                    write, to tell you that he is married, tho he says in all probability you will have heard it before. You will I suppose be not a
                    little surprized that he should have got the start of you. If he has chosen well, (for which he may be trusted) he has done
                    wisely: he had been too much accustomed to society to pass the remainder of his days alone in a country parsonage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The <ref target="people.html#HillCatherine">Ladys</ref> name was Bigg: her father Lovelace Bigg Wither, is, he
                    tells me a man of great weight in Hampshire, of the very antient &amp; good family of George Wither the poet, whom I hold in
                    especial good liking, both for his poetry &amp; his politicks.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lovelace Bigg (1741&#8211;1813)
                        inherited the estate of Manydown, Hampshire, in 1789. He then took the name Bigg-Withers and brought up his children there.
                        George Wither (1588&#8211;1667; <title>DNB</title>), the poet, was a distantly-related ancestor.</note> From <ref target="people.html#MayJohn">John May</ref> I learn that her fortune is said to be about 4000 &#163; &#8211; with the expectation of
                    something more at her fathers death: this, as she is his fourth daughter, implies considerable property in him. Nothing more do I
                    know. neither what her age is,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Catherine was thirty-three.</note> what part of Hants she
                    comes from,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Manydown is near Basingstoke in Hampshire.</note> nor any thing else, &#8211; except
                    indeed that the <ref target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">Imperial Colonel</ref> (who told me this was to be two months ago, &amp; I
                    contradicted him) says that he had the pleasure of seeing her, &#8211; &amp; that she is somehow connected with <del>a brother</del>
                    Awdreys family by marriage<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Awdry (1766&#8211;1844) married, in 1795, Catherine&#8217;s sister,
                        Jane Bigg (1770&#8211;1846).</note> &#8211; I forget how: not believing it at the time, &amp; having used up the whole double letter as
                    shaving paper, &#8211; it being too hard for other purposes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> By the Lord Harry this is very surprizing, &#8211; yet I am as much pleased at surprized. As for thinking of this new
                    relation as an Aunt, that is out of the question, it seems more like the marriage of an elder brother than an Uncle &#8211; &amp; the
                    cousins, if any there should be, will seem like nephews &amp; nieces &#8211; for cousinship implies contemporaneousness, &amp; this loss
                    of a whole generation will spoil all chronology of connection. &#8211; Well Sir, I shall be heartily glad when you have followed his
                    example, but tho I look carefully at the <del>newsp</del> deaths in the newspapers, &amp; the obituary in the Magazines, I do not
                    perceive any such mortality in the county of Durham, as <del>seem</del> &lt;should&gt; induce me to suppose <del>that</del> you
                    are getting into much practice.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is another good reason for rejoicing in this family news. Domine Doctor ours is a good breed &amp; ought to
                    be spread as carefully as that of the Merino sheep, but what there is good in it is not from the Southey side. It was the Hill
                    cross that made us what we are, &amp; the Hills ought not to be extinct.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I expect <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> here either on his way to or from London. He has
                    not told me the object of his journey there, but I have learnt it from another quarter. For more than a year Scott has cut with
                    the Edinburgh Review; &#8211; to its manner of criticism he always objected; &#8211; my refusal<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> For
                        Southey&#8217;s letter of refusal, see Southey to Walter Scott, 8 December 1807, Letter 1392.</note> to take a part in it
                    strengthened some political scruples of conscience which he had already felt <del>ag</del> at their cowardly cry for peace, &#8211;
                    &amp; how much Marmion<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott&#8217;s poem <title>Marmion</title> (1808) was negatively reviewed
