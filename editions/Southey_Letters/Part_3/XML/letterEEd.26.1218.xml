        <p rend="indent1"> If it were necessary to offer you an excuse for not furnishing you with an Epilogue,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Tobin had asked Southey to write an epilogue, probably to <title>The Curfew: a Play</title> (1807), the
                        posthumously-published work of Tobin&#8217;s brother John Tobin (1770&#8211;1804; <title>DNB</title>), a London solicitor and playwright
                        whose comedy <title>The Honey Moon</title> had been a success in 1805.</note> I could find a very valid one in the quantity of
                    business which presses upon me, &#8211; which, if you knew all, you would think sufficient for any two men, how indefatigable soever. In
                    spite of this I would do what you desire me if it were in my power; &#8211; but I could no more write an epilogue than I could dance a
                    minuet, or caper upon the slack wire. It is utterly out of my power, &#8211; nor can the strong wish I feel to do <del>any thing
                        which</del> so slight a service for you, remove the feeling of inability.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry that <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> designs to Lecture<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> According to a letter to <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Charles Danvers</ref>,
                        Coleridge was to lecture &#8216;at the Royal Institution upon the Principles common to the Fine Arts&#8217;; see Southey to Charles
                        Danvers, 18 October 1806, Letter 1229. He did not in fact lecture there until 1808, on the subjects of the Principles of
                        Poetry, Shakespeare and Milton.</note> &#8211; because it will detain him from his other work which is of more immediate importance,
                    &amp; because I fear he will <del>be</del> delay getting ready in time, always be behind hand, always hurried, <del>&amp;</del>
                    become thoroughly disgusted with what he has undertaken, &amp; fret himself into his old state of debility. That this will be the
                    consequence I am so certain, that, if it be not too late, I shall use my best endeavours to dissuade him from the scheme.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The poem which you sent me is curious. Baetas friend has learnt something from him. The words azote &amp; gas
                    appear (for the first time I suppose) in Portugeuze verse, &amp; the Ode concludes with a prayer to be delivered from Ignorance
                    who is the mother of all evil. I am glad Baeta<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francisco Xavier Baeta was a Portugueze
                        physician with whom Southey had become acquainted; see Southey to John May, 7 July 1807, Letter 1342.</note> is desirous of
                    keeping up his English acquaintance, &amp; shall send him over some of my own books in exchange.</p>
