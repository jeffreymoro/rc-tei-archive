        <p rend="indent1"> I have a fear upon me least <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> should get at my books,
                    &amp; carry any of them off with <del>them</del> &lt;him&gt;: for in the first place he spoils every decent book on which he lays
                    his hands, &amp; in the next place the moment it in his hands he considers it to all intents &amp; purposes as his own, &amp;
                    makes no scruple of bescrawling it, of giving it away, &#8211; in-short of doing any thing with it, &#8211; except taking care of it &amp;
                    returning it to its owner. &#8211; Perhaps I am too late, &#8211; but at any rate as soon as you can, set a man to box them up, &amp; ship
                    them off to me, &#8211; all except the box of German books, which may remain with the other articles where it is, being well secured: &#8211;
                    the glass &amp; china only may come with the books.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One box I would have sent by waggon containing the two Mss volumes &#8211; which will come to light in the
                        <del>search</del> &lt;packing&gt; &#8211; that vol: of the Voyages &amp; Travels which contains Nicholas Del Techos Hist: of

            <title>Rerum Hispanicarum Scriptores aliquot, ex Bibliotheca R. Beli</title> (1579).</note> a folio of cruel weight, &#8211; &amp;
                    then as many of the smaller books as will fill the box, chusing those which by the costliness of their dress seem to be of most
                    value &#8211; &amp; having them well secured with paper. <ref target="people.html#ReidSamuel">Sam Reid</ref> will I doubt not have the
                    goodness when they reach Liverpool to look after them &amp; see that they are forwarded either to Whitehaven or Workington, it
                    matters not which. It is now a good time of year for the coast, &#8211; you will let me know the number of packing cases &amp;c; &#8211; &amp;
                    this &#8211; Dear Charles &#8211; is the last trouble you will have with this, hitherto, unlucky library, &#8211; which is now thank Heaven about to
                    be of some use, &amp; to find its resting place. &#8211; I dare say you are little pleased at my settling here; &#8211; yet every body else
                    (except perhaps <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> ) sees the fitness of the situation; &amp; I think if
                    you consider above all things, &amp; above all what the expence of removal &amp; furnishing a house would be, &amp; how little
                    able I am to meet the expence, you will see not only that I have chosen wisely, &#8211; but that in fact I could not have chosen
                    otherwise. &#8211; So do not take this last trouble with an unwilling spirit, &#8211; but think rather what a joy it will be to me to see all
                    my books about me, &amp; to feel myself settled also &#8211; for be sure that tho I am, God be thanked, a chearful man under all
                    circumstances, I shall be a happier one when all disquieting thoughts of uncertainty &amp; unsettledness are thus removed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Once in two years I mean to visit London, &#8211; &amp; if you do not contrive to meet me there, I will make Bristol in
                    my way there or back, &#8211; which indeed may conveniently be done &#8211; for the sake of halting at Liverpool, &amp; afterwards at <ref target="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</ref> with <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref>. My first journey
                    will be in the close of this year, &amp; then I promise you a visit on my way to Taunton.</p>
