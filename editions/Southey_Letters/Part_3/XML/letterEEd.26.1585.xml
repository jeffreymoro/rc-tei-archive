                    &amp; the purblind prudence of these selfish times I am persuaded that it is still a blessing to have a large family,
                    notwithstanding modern policy contrives to unite an overcrowded state of society with a scanty population. Brothers &amp; sisters
                    help one another thro the world, – &amp; die when I may it will be without any fears for the well doing of those whom I leave
                    behind.</p><p rend="indent1"> Your draft was put in circulation. – I believe Kehama would never have been resumed had it <del>been</del> not been
                    for you.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s poem <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> was published in 1810.</note>
                    It had lain untouched for five years &amp; so it probably would have remained. You stung me to the resolution of going on, &amp; I
                    am not sure whether the more pleasure which I have felt in proceeding has not been the anticipation of addressing it to you &amp;
                    saying so. – It is announced thro the customary channel of Magazines as in forwardness. I am going to Edinburgh in May for the
                    purpose of hunting in the Advocates Library for any books which may relate to South America. While thus employed (a week or ten
                    days at the utmost) I shall be <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scotts</ref> guest. Kehama will then (God willing) be
                    compleated: &amp; I think Scott will enable me to ascertain in what manner it may most advantageously be published. I sold the
                    first edition of Thalaba to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> for 115 £. they printed 1000, – that edition is
                    just now exhausted, &amp; a second about to come forth<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1st edn 1801; 2nd edn 1809).</note> – But this has been a slow sale, – &amp; when seven
                    years ago I offered them another poem on the same terms (meaning to have finished Kehama for the purpose) they demurred &amp;
                    offered only the 100.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> On the terms Southey was offered by Longman after the failure of
                            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> to make much profit, see <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works 1793–1810</title>,
                        gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004), II, <title>Madoc</title>, introduction.</note> Just to the amount of defraying
                    all expences my name commands a sale, every thing beyond that depends upon the caprice of a public, who have any better motive
                    than caprice either for their censure or their approbation. Kehama however has cost me no expence of time, – I have fairly won it,
                    as Lincolnshire speculators win estates from the sea;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> That is, on the east coast, prone to
                        erosion and deposition, a speculator would buy land hoping that the sea would slowly, bit by bit, augment it.</note> – my
                    daily work has been done just as if no such composition was in my thoughts, without the slightest interruption. If therefore
                    nothing be got by its sale, it has not made me the poorer, – I am so much the happier for having written it, – so much the richer
                    as a Poet, &amp; in fact have received from you half as much as the profits of an edition would be, when shared by a publisher.
                    Its success (I speak solely of its <hi rend="ital">market</hi> success) will only thus far influence me, that a good sale would
                    make me afford more time for other such poems, which I should then publish as fast as they were written, – its still-birth (which
                    I entirely expect) will merely make me write others as this is written, in the early morning hours, which I shall continue to do
                    as long as the unabated power is in me, &amp; leave them behind as post-obits for my children, in perfect confidence that such
                    manuscripts will prove good &amp; secure property hereafter. At Edinburgh I shall feel my way about the publication</p><p rend="indent1"> When the obnoxious line was written I thought of better Painters than the Exhibitioners, – of those whose creative
                    powers entitle them to be mentioned any where; – it is however an ugly word, – because it always reminds one of the
                        house-painter.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor had expressed his dissatisfaction with a line in Southey’s draft
                        of Book 7 of <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>: ‘Eye hath not seen, nor painters hand pourtrayd’, which he said ‘not only
                        displeased but disturbed me’. ‘I have an insuperable hatred to such words as ‘painter’ and ‘portray’ in grave heroic poetry’,
                        Landor continued, ‘add to which, if ‘eye hath not seen’, it is superfluous to say the rest. The first few words are serious
                        and solemn,—the last put one in mind of the Exhibition and the French’; quoted in John Forster, <title>Walter Savage Landor: A
                            Biography</title>, 2 vols (London, 1869), I, p. 248. The line was omitted from the published version of the poem.</note> I
                    set a black mark upon the line. Your remarks shall be well weighed, &amp; every passage which I cannot [MS obscured]stify shall be
                    altered. – Do not however be at the trouble of criticising the first portion which you received, – for that has been greatly
                    altered since, by <del>putting</del> rhyming &lt;most of&gt; those parts whi[MS obscured] were rhymeless, – a task which is yet to
                    be compleated.</p><p rend="indent1"> Take your Letters to G Requelmi<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title>Three Letters written in Spain to
