                          .       .       .
                           I have retired to my library to thank you for the most splendid set of books it contains. I
                    thank you for them, Neville, truly and heartily; but do not let it hurt you if I say, that so costly a present gives me some pain
                    as well as pleasure. Were you a rich man, you could not give me more books than I would joyfully accept, for I delight in
                    accumulating such treasures as much as a miser does in keeping together gold; but, as things are at present, no proof was needed
                    of your generous spirit, and, from the little you have to spare, I cannot but feel you are giving me too much. You will not be
                    offended at my expressing this feeling, nor will you impute it to any unjust pride, which, blessed be God, I am too poor a man,
                    and too wise a one, to be guilty of in any, even the smallest degree. Be assured that I shall ever value the books far more than
                    if they had come from a wealthier donor, and that I write the donor’s name in them with true respect and esteem. You will be
                    pleased to hear they are books – of immediate use – to me. Seven years ago I began a long poem which Sir William Jones, had he
                    been living, would have liked to see, because it has the system of Hindoo mythology for its basis.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> I believe you heard me mention it at <ref target="people.html#HillThomas">Mr. Hill’s</ref>. I have been stimulated by the approbation of <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">one of the few
                        men living whose approbation could stimulate me</ref>, to go on with this poem, and am winning time for it by rising earlier
                    than was my custom, because I will not allow any other part of the day to an employment less important than writing history, and
                    far less profitable than that of writing any thing else, how humble or how worthless soever. In the hours thus fairly won for the
                    purpose I get on steadily and well. Now, though I had long ago gone through those works of Sir William, and made from them such
                    extracts as were necessary for my purpose, it was still very desirable that I should have them at hand. Lord Teignmouth’s Life
                    also is new to me.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have not seen the Scotch review of Marmion,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Though Scott wrote for the
