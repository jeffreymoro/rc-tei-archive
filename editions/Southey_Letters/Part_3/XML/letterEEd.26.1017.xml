                    than the Galatea;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi> was a finer ship than <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas Southey&#8217;s</ref> previous ship, the <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi>, because she was a
                        38-gun H&#233;b&#233;-class frigate of the French navy captured in 1796 and commissioned into the navy. Thomas&#8217;s captain was William

                        Vice-Admiral) Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet (1762&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), who was in command of the fleet in which Thomas
                        Southey served.</note> speaks of him in such handsome terms, that he has good reason to think him self in the way of promotion
                    &#8211; Still there is a very serious cause for uneasiness remaining &#8211; the yellow fever is raging violently on board.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The disease-ridden Leeward Islands station had already accounted for the previous captain of the

                        Carysfort (1751&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>), who died on 6 August 1804 at Surinam, from yellow fever.</note> Some symptoms had
                    attacked him the evening before he wrote, but had entirely disappeared. I shall be very anxious till another letter arrives.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The papers say we are certainly about to send forces to Portugal. Now could I get such an appointment as would
                    enable me in the course of two or three years to accumulate three or four hundred pounds &lt;which would settle me at the end of
                    the time&gt;, &amp; in the meantime do my own business abroad &#8211; I should think myself a very fortunate man.

                    family.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish General with a long and
                        varied military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention of Cintra (1808), Moore
                        was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna. In
                        December 1804 he was sent to review the practicability of defending Portugal from a French invasion. His favourable report was
                        widely leaked to the press, e.g. <title>Aberdeen Journal</title>, 9 January 1805. Moore was part of a large and well-known
                        family that included his younger brothers, Dr James Moore (1763&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>) and the Royal Navy officer Graham

                    It does not strike me that you can befriend me in this pursuit, &#8211; but if you can I am sure you will, &amp; perhaps you may &lt;be
