            <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the
                            Spanish</title> (1807). Letter 57 discusses the Quakers.</note> Of Espriella I expect to report progress very rapidly.
                    Only 70 pages remain to be written &#8211; if I write more it will be labour thrown away, 70 being enough &#8211; so I will limit myself to
                    that number &#8211; they will soon be done as that &amp; reviewing will be my sole employments till it is <del>done</del>

        <p rend="indent1"> We miss you. your place in the room seems to want its occupier. I must put your box of water colours out of sight &#8211;

                    there is something in having these things always in sight which is like being haunted. I have heard of men who when their wives
                    have died <del>left the</del> &lt;suffer&gt; every thing belonging to the dead <del>precisely</del> to remain precisely as she
                        <del>left</del> &lt;left it&gt; for years &amp; years, &#8211; the music book open &#8211; the shawl thrown across the chair, &#8211; the fan or
                    the parasol on the table &#8211; &amp; this till they died themselves. This is insanity, but one can understand <del>how</del> its
                    nature &amp; growth. If ever I should become insane it will not be in this way &#8211; There is the same excuse for drunkenness &amp;
                    debauchery as for over&#8211;sensibility. Twelve years ago I carried Epictetus<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Epictetus (AD

                    are made red by feeding him upon madder. And the longer I live, &amp; the more I learn, the more am I convinced that Stoicism,
                    properly understood, is the best &amp; noblest system of morals. If you have never read the book buy M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>

                    seldom good for any thing &#8211; the Stoical books are an exception. In morals as in every thing else one should aim high.</p>
