        <p rend="indent1"> I am much obliged to <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</ref> for the offer which you
                    communicated. In a few days I will write to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, consulting him as to the form
                    in which the poem had best be published,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> &#8211; that it <del>xx xx</del> is best to do so on my own account, I am
                    persuaded for these reasons, &#8211; that like my former poems it will sans doubt immediately pay the expences of publication. &amp; I
                    believe do little more at first, but if it be good for any thing it will have its day of sale at last. It is not worth booksellers
                    while to purchase &lt;copy-right&gt; in hopes of a joyful resurrection, &#8211; but it is worth mine to keep it in that hope. &#8211; And for
                    the old plan of sharing, &#8211; as there is no risque on the booksellers part, there is no good reason why I should not take the whole
                    profits to myself little as they will be, &#8211; especially as I have been offered any advance of money necessary for such a purpose,
                    from two quarters,&#8211;from either of which such an offer may be accepted without reluctance. The only question therefore seems to be
                    in what form to print. 180 Madocs in the warehouse plead I am afraid strongly against the quarto,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first edition of <title>Madoc</title> (1805) was published by Longmans in a luxury quarto form, but sales
                        were slow and the second edition, published in 1807, was more cheaply produced and priced.</note> &amp; these I think will
                    weigh with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, &#8211; but I shall be glad of your opinion &amp; <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">Balantynes</ref> upon the subject also.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You wonder that I have never tried the drama. In spite of many resolutions so to do, a conviction that I could tell
                    the same thing better epically than dramatically has always witheld me. Should this quest (of which but for you I never should
                    have had a prospect) prove successful, it will make a material difference in my literary occupations. I should be relieved from
                    the necessity of any employment which is not perfectly congenial to my own wishes &amp; aspirations, &amp; should without
                    interruption pursue the great historical works on which I have so long been busied at such fits and intervals as could be spared,
                    &#8211; relieving them by having always some poem in hand, the sale of which would then be to me a thing altogether indifferent.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The house of Austria is dishonoured as well as ruined by that base armistice.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Britain and Austria were in alliance against France in 1809, but Napoleon advanced into Austria where he
                        suffered a significant defeat at the battle of Aspern-Essling (22 May 1809). The Austrians failed to follow up this victory,
                        which allowed Napoleon to seize the capital, Vienna, in early July. The Austrians were then defeated by the French at the
                        battle of Wagram on 5&#8211;6 July 1809 and forced to sue for peace on unfavourable terms.</note> &#8211; I like our expedition, if it be
                    meant to keep the Islands, because it will be a bold, useful &amp; <hi rend="ital">galling</hi> manifestation of British
                        power.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Walcheren expedition was an unsuccessful British attempt to open another
                        front in the Netherlands in support of the Austrian Empire&#8217;s struggle with France. Approximately 40,000 soldiers with
                        supporting horses and artillery landed at Walcheren on 30 July 1809. There was little fighting but the army sustained heavy
                        losses from sickness, and in December 1809 the rest withdrew.</note> Still I wish 100, 000 men were sent to the North of
                    Spain, being perfectly sure that such an army would beat any force which could be brought against them.</p>
