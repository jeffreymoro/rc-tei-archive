                        publication during the years 1711&#8211;1714, <title>The Spectator</title> was edited by Joseph Addison (1672&#8211;1719;
                        <title>DNB</title>) and Richard Steele (1672&#8211;1729; <title>DNB</title>). <title>The Cave of Poverty</title> is discussed in
                        volume 9 (1715) in the numbers for 25 March (658: pp. 108&#8211;112) and 1 April (660: pp. 117&#8211;23).</note> &#8211;
                    &amp; it may be reason enough to prefer an extract from this to say that it is praised in that work. By the by I much wish to read
                    the Double Falshood. the very few lines I ever saw are too much like Shakespeare to have been written by Theobald, or by any man
                    of his generation.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> The play <title>Double Falshood, or, The Distrest Lovers</title>
                        (1728) was supposed to have been based on manuscripts written by Shakespeare and Fletcher (1579&#8211;1625; <title>DNB</title>).
                        Though it is now considered to be based on a lost script by these playwrights, Theobald&#8217;s enemies had suggested it was a
                        forgery.</note>
