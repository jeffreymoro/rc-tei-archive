        <p rend="indent1"> I have sent you all that is written of the Curse of Kehama.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The enclosed
                    draft of a section of <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810) has not survived. For the text, and for other manuscript drafts,
                    see volume 4 of <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works 1793&#8211;1810</title>, gen ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004).</note>
                    You offered to print it for me, &#8211; if ever I finish the poem it will be because of that offer, tho without the slightest intention
                    of accepting it. &#8211; Enough is written to open the story of the poem, &amp; serve as a specimen of its manner tho much of what is to
                    follow would be <del>of</del> &lt;in&gt; a wilder strain. Tell me if your ear is offended with the rhymes when they occur, or if
                    it misses them when they fail. &#8211; I wish it had never been begun, because I like it too well to throw it behind the fire, &amp; not
                    well enough to compleat it without the &#8216;go-on&#8217; of some one whose approbation is worth having.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My history as an author is not very honourable to the age in which we live. By giving up my whole time to worthless
                    work in reviews magazines &amp; newspapers I could thrive; &#8211; by giving up half my time to them I contrive to live. In the time
                    thus employed every year I could certainly produce such a poem as Thalaba,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> &amp; if I did I should starve. You have wakened in me prospects that had
                    been laid asleep, &amp; recalled hopes which I had dismissed, contentedly as I thought, for ever. If you think Kehama deserves to
                    be published I will borrow hours from sleep &amp; finish it, by rising two hours before my customary time. When it is finished I
                    will try whether subscribers can be procured for five hundred copies, by which means I should secure the whole profits to myself.
                    The booksellers share is too much like the Lions in the fable. &#8211; 30 or 33 per cent they first deduct as booksellers, &amp; then
                    halve the residue as publishers. I have no reason to complain of mine. They treat me with great respect &amp; great liberality, &#8211;
                    but I wish to be independent of them, &amp; this, if it could be effected, would make me so.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The will &amp; the power to produce any thing great are not often found together. I wish you would write in
                    English, because it is a better language than Latin, &#8211; &amp; because the disuse of English as a living, &amp; literary language
                    would be the greatest evil that could befall mankind. It would cost you little labour to write perspicuously, &amp; thus get rid
                    of your only fault. If you will not write English, &#8211; write Latin, &amp; in God&#8217;s name <del>get</del> overcome that superstition
                    about Robert Smith.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Percy &#8216;Bobus&#8217; Smith (1770&#8211;1845), former advocate-general of
                        Bengal, in which office he amassed great wealth, an imitator of Lucretius whose Latin poetry Landor greatly admired.</note>
                    When I consider what he is, it puts me out of all patience to think &#8211; that the ghost of what he <del>might have</del> has been
                    should overlay you like a night mare.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Literary fame is the only fame of which a wise man ought to be ambitious, because it is the only lasting &amp;
                    living fame. Bonaparte will be forgotten before his term in purgatory is half over, &#8211; or but just remembered <del>as</del>
                    &lt;like&gt; Nimrod<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Traditionally a great hunter and a rebel against the Lord.</note>
                    &amp; other cut throats of antiquity; who serve us for the common-places of declamation. If you made yourself King of Crete,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor did not in 1808 attempt the liberation of Crete from Ottoman rule but did fight as a
                        volunteer with the Spanish against occupying French forces.</note> you would differ from a hundred other adventurers only in
                    chronology, &amp; in the course of a millennium or two nothing more would be known of your conquest than what would be found in
                    the stereotype Gebir,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> That is, for a posthumous edition of Landor&#8217;s 1798 poem produced by
