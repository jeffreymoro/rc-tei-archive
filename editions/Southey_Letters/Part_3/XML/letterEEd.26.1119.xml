                        of 23 December 1798 , Taylor revealed that he, like Southey, had written a poem on the theme of the &#8216;Old Woman of Berkeley&#8217;
                        (J.W. Robberds (ed.), <title>A Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich</title>, 2 vols (London,
                        1843), I, p. 235). This poem, entitled &#8216;A Tale of Wonder&#8217; was written about 1791, but remained unpublished for many years
                        until its appearance in the Iris, the weekly Norwich newspaper edited by Taylor, on 29 October 1803. Southey wanted to
                        republish the poem with his own &#8216;Old Woman of Berkeley&#8217; but Taylor declined the offer and it was published in the
