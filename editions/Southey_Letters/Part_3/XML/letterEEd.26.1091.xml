        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am much gratified with your praise of Madoc, &amp; disposed to acquiesce with some of your censure. It was my
                    intention at one time to have made Erillyab arrive during the contest, &amp; put Amalahta to death with her own hands: an action
                    of savage heroism which might have been made sufficiently consistent with her character.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Errilyab is the queen of the Hoaman tribe in <title>Madoc</title> (1805); Amalahta, her son, disloyal to her.</note> Why this
                    was altered I cannot very clearly explain &#8211; this much is certain that the part as it now stands after the Hoamen are driven out
                    from the hut &#8211; offends me more than any thing else in the volume &#8211; &amp; is therefore most likely to be altered.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> On the history of the poem&#8217;s drafting and revision, see the editor&#8217;s introduction to
                        <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works 1793&#8211;1810</title>, gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004), II.</note> &#8211; What you
                    say of the earlier termination of the poem is not founded so well, as you will probably perceive if you reconsider the story. the
                    historical foundation of the story is the emigration of the Aztecas which gives by the concluding lines that same probability to
                    the second part which historical names &amp; facts have given to the first. &amp; there are many characters of the drama to be
                    disposed of, who must &lt;not&gt; be killed &amp; married off too precipitately. &#8211; It pleased me that you had selected for praise
                    the quieter passages, &#8211; those in an under key, with which the feeling has the most &#8211; &amp; the fancy the least to do. &#8211; the names
                    are uncouth only to the eye, &amp; were all selected for their euphony. &#8211; </p>
