                        published during his lifetime. <title>Mundus Novus</title> (1502/3) was a Latin translation of a lost Italian letter
                        describing a voyage to South America in 1501&#8211;1502. <title>Lettera di Amerigo Vespucci delle Isole Nuovamente Trovate in
                            Quattro Suoi Viaggi</title>, known as <title>Lettera al Soderini</title> (1504/5), was a narrative of four voyages to the
                        Americas made between 1497 and 1504. A Latin translation was published by the German Martin Waldseem&#252;ller (1470&#8211;1520) in
                            <title>Cosmographiae Introductio</title> (1507). In 1745, Angelo Maria Bandini (1726&#8211;1803) published <title>Vita e Lettere di

                    you may possibly give him information which may save him some trouble? You will thus see one of the most extraordinary men that it
                    has ever been my fortune to fall in with, &amp; one who would be one of the greatest, if it were possible to tame him. He does

                    playing off.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will wrap up this in <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref> Prospectus.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> For <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge&#8217;s</ref> new periodical <title>The
                            Friend</title>, the first edition of which was published on 1 June 1809.</note> For the Friend itself you may whistle
                    these three months, &amp; God knows how much longer. Hitherto however there is no other blame attachable to him, than that he
                    carried a <del>wet</del> prospectus wet from the pen to the printer, without consulting any body, or giving himself time for
                    consideration, &amp; so a day was fixed for the <del>first number</del> appearance of the first number which was impossibly soon.
                    Meantime a hundred difficulties open upon him in the way of publication, &amp; doubtless some very material change must be made in
                    the plan. I advise half a crown or five shilling numbers, irregularly whenever they are ready, &#8211; but no promised time, no promised
                    quantity, no promised any thing. The prospectus looks too much like what it pretends to be, talks confidently to the Public about
                    what the public cares not a curse for &#8211; &amp; has about it a sort of unmanly <hi rend="ital">humblefication</hi>, which is not
                    sincere, which the very object of the paper gives the lie to, which may provoke some people, &amp; can conciliate nobody. Yet such
                    as it is I shall augur best of those persons who expected most from it, such a habit of thinking &amp; such a train of thinking is
                    manifested there.</p>

                        evacuate Portugal. On 27 December 1808 and 13 January 1809 Wordsworth published, in <title>The Courier</title>, an article
                        condemning the Convention. In May 1809 Longmans published the article as a pamphlet, entitled <title>Concerning the Relations
                            of Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal, to Each Other, and to the Common Enemy, at this Crisis; and Specifically as

                    too, it will be such Generals &amp; such ministers as we are destined to be curst with. Even now the game is in our own hands if
                    we knew how to play it. But these wretches have no principles of action, no moral courage &#8211; their boldness is only face-deep &#8211;
                    bronze over plaister-of-paris heads, &#8211; &amp; their talents just equal to the dirty job work which has long been the main business

                    from the very nature of its subject.</p>
