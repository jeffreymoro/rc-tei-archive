        <p rend="indent1"> I value poetry as silversmiths do old plate, &#8211; by the materials &amp; not the fashion thereof. Upon that principle
                    I may say these verses are worth something, &#8211; for the silver is yours &amp; nothing but the workmanship mine, which as it adds
                    nothing to the intrinsic value, so I hope it takes nothing from it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Referring to the
                        verses written by Smith and improved by Southey at the end of this letter.</note> From the time that Madoc<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>Madoc</title> (1805).</note> was finished till my return from the South
                    last year I did not write a single line of poetry. since that time I have written about 3500,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> &#8211; every line before breakfast, &#8211; &amp; it
                    was &lt;some&gt; satisfaction to find that my hand had not forgotten its cunning.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A
                        paraphrase of a passage from Psalm 137:5 &#8216;If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its cunning&#8217;.</note> &#8211; If I
                    could have earned 200 &#163; a year <del>xxx</del> &lt;by&gt; doing it I would have written yearly a narrative poem of from three to

                    if I had not borrowed hours from sleep for this new Poem of mine it would never have been written at all. It will be mortifying
                    enough if that which has kept me waking should set other persons to sleep. &#8211; I will wish them no other punishment if this be the
                    case than such dreams as some parts of it are likely enough to occasion, &amp; which will not need the help of a Night Mare to
                    make my revenge compleat. It is not yet in the press, nor indeed have I yet determined in what form to print it.</p>
