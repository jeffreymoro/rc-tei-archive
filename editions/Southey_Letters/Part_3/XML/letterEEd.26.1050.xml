          <salute>Dear Wynn,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will perceive that this poem<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>, of which Southey was sending a draft to Wynn. For the text and the drafts, see
                            <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works of 1793&#8211;1810</title>, gen ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004), IV.</note> is much
                    altered &#8211; &amp; rhyme very frequently introduced. Of this arbitrary use or rejection of rhyme precedents are to be found in the
                    old dramatic writers &#8211; particularly in a pastoral of Daniels.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Daniel (1562&#8211;1619;
                            <title>DNB</title>), whose poem, <title>Hymens Trivmph. A Pastorall Tragicom&#230;die</title> (1623) employs a stanza in which
                        a rhyming couplet is preceded and succeeded by unrhymed lines.</note> But I rather suspect that like the Old-man &amp; his
                        ass<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the verse tale &#8216;The Old Man, his Son, and the Ass&#8217;, frequently collected in the
                        eighteenth-century as one of Aesop&#8217;s (c. 620&#8211;564 BC) fables, a father, going to market, is criticised by passers-by whether he
                        rides his donkey, lets his son ride it, or lets the donkey walk unridden. Eventually he and his son carry the donkey, only to
                        lose their grip as they cross a river and the donkey is drowned.</note> &#8211; I shall please nobody, &amp; that you &amp; every
                    body else will say this is neither one thing nor the other.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Yet it should seem reasonable rejecting rhymes as a necessary to admit it as an occasional ornament. &amp; if this
                    were done in such parts as require ornament because the circumstances are less interesting &#8211; the <del>xxxx</del> feeling less
                    empassioned &amp; the language in consequence in a lower key, I think the mark would be hit. &#8211; as I would willingly admire those
                    ornamental buildings &amp;c at Stowe<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Stowe House and Gardens near Buckingham were designed
                        for Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham (1675&#8211;1749; <title>DNB</title>), and his descendants over the eighteenth century.
                        Among the architects and landscape gardeners who worked there were Sir John Vanbrugh (1664&#8211;1726; <title>DNB</title>), William
                        Kent (1685&#8211;1748; <title>DNB</title>), Lancelot &#8216;Capability&#8217; Brown (1716&#8211;1783; <title>DNB</title>), Robert Adam (1728&#8211;1792;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and Sir John Soane (1753&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>).</note> which would be abominations by the side of
                        Derwentwater.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The lake near Southey&#8217;s home of Keswick in the Lake District.</note>
                    That this is done in this specimen I cannot pretend &#8211; for <del>xx</del> in correcting the poem I have chiefly rhymed such parts
                        <del>xx</del> &lt;as&gt; did not satisfy me before; tho perhaps this may not be altogether wide of what <del>I</del> ought to
                    be done &#8211; if <del>xxx</del> the rhyme gives such passages the finish which they wanted.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am disposed to go on thus &#8211; chiefly because I shall the more easily avoid any mannerism &#8211; any too frequent use of
                    the same phraseology or turn of syntax. &amp; because there are some parts of the story which rhyme would very much embellish
                    &amp; others which it would ruin. However your opinion of the experiment will weigh with me. Tell me if the rhyme surprizes you
                    when you find it, or if you feel at a fault when you lose it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are about 600 lines more written but uncorrected. they do not require so much alteration as this first part
                    because there is more of passion in them &amp; dramatic character. If I get thro them to my liking they will set me off. &amp; I
                    may perhaps fall to in earnest &amp; run thro the poem. You know my plan to exhibit all the fit mythologies in this form. After
                    this there will remain the Runic the old Persian. The classical &#8211; which may be considered almost as new ground so little have its
                    recondite parts been brought forward, &amp; perhaps the Japanese, the Jewish as romanceified by the Rabbis, &amp; the Catholic in
