        <p rend="indent1"> There is nothing in the inclosed worth your looking at except so[MS torn] Scraps, some of which are curious &amp;
					some quaint. I should not trouble you with this if it were not to save time &#8211; as it will arrive three days sooner than if it were
					sent by the carrier in the shape of a parcel.</p>

							<title>DNB</title>), diplomat, who was envoy-extraordinary to the elector of Saxony between April 1803 to October
						1806.</note> I look in the papers <del>x</del> with some anxiety to see if he has escaped from the wreck. As for Saxony it
					suffers &amp; can suffer no more than it deserves.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Within months of the collapse of the
						Third Coalition, the Fourth Coalition (1806&#8211;1807) against France was formed by Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Sweden, and the United
						Kingdom. However, following the battle of Jena-Auerstedt (October 1806) some of the German states, including Saxony, that had
						previously fought alongside the anti-French allies changed sides to join with France against the allies.</note> The
					annihilation of Hesse is a good thing for the Hessians<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The German principality of Hesse
						was annexed by France in 1806.</note> &#8211; &amp; I confess I do see something like righteous retribution in the troubles
					preparing in Poland for the three partitioning powers, &amp; something like vengeance in the fate of the Duke of Brunswick.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb&#252;ttel (1735&#8211;1806), a Prussian Field
						Marshal whose forces were routed at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt (14 October 1806). The Duke himself was mortally wounded and
						died two days later.</note>

							Fox</ref>.</note> I find but one feeling among the people in these parts. &#8211; &amp; that is a belief that no peace can be
					made with <del>Bonaparte</del> &lt;France&gt; while <del>he liv</del> Bonaparte lives, &#8211; that it ought not to be thought of, &amp;
					that the higher language we hold, &amp; the more openly &amp; manlily we proclaim this the better. God send that the war between
					Turkey &amp; Russia may draw us in<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Russo-Turkish war of 1806&#8211;1812.</note> &amp; induce
