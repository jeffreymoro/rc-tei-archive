        <p rend="indent1"> You are perfectly right in all your objections to the plan of Kehama, which will I dare say be utterly
                    uninteresting in its story to 999 readers out of a thousand. If I had not felt this, the poem would in all likelihood have been
                    finished seven years ago, &#8211; but this feeling I had, &#8211; it prevented me from going on with the fragment, &#8211; &amp; the fragment
                    prevented me from beginning any thing else. <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylor</ref> said as
                    you say, &#8211; let it drop. <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> was the only person who said go on; the <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">River Sharpe</ref> thought it was very extraordinary &amp; liked it, &#8211; but <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> turnd the scale in its favour. &#8211; I am half way thro, &amp; will finish it
                    if it be only for him &amp; my brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>. &#8211; Sympathy is clearly out of reach &amp;
                    out of sight &#8211; but if I do not excite astonishment, terror, &amp; sometimes delight, the fault will be in the poetry not in the
                    materials of the narrative. &#8211; That it will be published is by no means so certain. It is work of supererogation, &amp; will bring
                    my hand in for Pelayo,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> An early name for the poem which became <title>Roderick, Last of
                            the Goths</title> (1814).</note> &amp; for Robin Hood.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had begun to plan a
                        romance on this subject in 1804; it was not until 1823 that he began drafting the verse, in collaboration with Caroline
                        Bowles (1786&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>). The poem remained unfinished, and was published posthumously as a fragment in an edition by Bowles: <title>Robin Hood:

        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry for all your losses, reparable &amp; irreparable. Your neighbours I suppose will benefit by one of them, inasmuch as you will of course indict the roads in
                    due time for the future, &amp; keep them in good order. These are serious things, &amp; it is well it is no worse. &#8211; Were any of
                    the MSS. unique? It is provoking to recollect what treasures have at various times been destroyed by fire, &#8211; &amp; <del>xxxxxxxxx
                        to think</del> that <del>all</del> &lt;none of our&gt; great libraries are yet made fire-proof.</p>

                        Philip Beaver (1766&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>), naval officer, who in 1791 participated in a scheme for colonizing the island
                        of Bulama, near Sierra Leone. The scheme failed and he returned in 1794, publishing his Bulama experiences in <title>African
                            Memoranda</title> (1805). In 1806 he was appointed to the 40-gun frigate <hi rend="ital">Acasta</hi> and in her went to
                        the West Indies, where he remained until after the capture of Martinique in February 1809 (<title>DNB</title>).</note> I do
                    not remember ever to have read a work which made me so compleatly <hi rend="ital">fall in admiration</hi> with the author. I see
                    he has the Acasta frigate at present, but such a man as that ought not to be <del>up</del> cooped on ship board. &#8211; I was not
                    herald enough to detect <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> blunders, nor did I <del>think</del> pay attention
                    enough to the facts of his poem<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Marmion</title> (1808).</note> to discover the faulty chronology. The mixture of that kind of truth with fiction is
                    abominable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will shortly tell you as much as I can about the plan of Pelayo, &#8211; that you may tell me what you think of the
                    story, before <del>thi</del> I begin upon it. It will be written in blank verse, &amp; pitched, upon the whole, in rather a higher
                    key than Madoc.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
