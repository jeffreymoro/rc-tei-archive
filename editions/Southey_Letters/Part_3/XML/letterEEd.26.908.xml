                        dates the letter &#8216;Mar 6 1804&#8217; halfway through, and puts &#8216;Monday night&#8217; when it resumes. 6 March in 1804 was a
                    Tuesday.</p>

                            Santillane</title>, first appeared in French (1715&#8211;1735), claiming to be a Spanish tale. In 1805 an adaptation of the
                        French text into Spanish, by Jos&#233; Francisco de Isla, was published, entitled <title>Adventures de Gil Blas de Santillane,
                            Robadas &#225; Espa&#241;a, Adoptadas en Francia por Mons. Le Sage, Restituidas &#225; su Patria y a su Lengua Nativa, por un Espa&#241;ol

                        stolen from Spain and appropriated in France by M. Le Sage, restored to their country and their native tongue by a jealous
                        Spaniard, who will not suffer his country to be burlesqued&#8217;).</note> Yet it is very likely that the story is originally
                    Spanish, &amp; indeed if the Spaniards claim it, I am ready to believe them, they being true men, &amp; Le Sage&#8217;s being a
                    Frenchman strong reason for suspecting him to be a thief. however if he has stolen, there can be no doubt that he has tinkered old
                    metal into a better shape, &amp; I should think your time ill employed in Englishing what every body reads in French.</p>

                    selecting the best &amp; the most characteristic pieces, which last may be the worst. you may improve a piece by omissions ad

        <p>Monday night &#8211; Your letter is just arrived &#8211; so late that there is only time to notice it thus. I need not say I shall be very glad
                    to do any thing that may be pleasant &#8211; much more any thing can be useful to <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref>. your plan however is a bad one &#8211; because he must perceive that &lt;it&gt; is <hi rend="ital">contrivance</hi>.
                    The better way therefore is this &#8211; that you should encourage him in his notion of coming down, &amp; let him write to me about it
                    himself &#8211; or instruct you to do it. I will then reply what I now say to you before hand, that I shall be very glad to see him &#8211; to
                    talk with him &#8211; to walk with him, &amp;c. A bed it is not in my power to offer him &#8211; because we inhabit only part of a house &#8211;

                    room in it probably within a month &amp; perhaps much sooner. But I will procure him a lodging in the town, within five minutes
                    walk, &amp; shall be very glad if he will partake <del>xx</del> every day of such a dinner, as, tho it is not like his fathers
                    table, I shall make no apology for, being contented with it myself. His health will certainly be benefited by the journey, &amp;
                    his spirits pleased by what he will see. besides Horace is an angler, &amp; has therefore one resource for this place
                        <del>which</del> more than I possess. Let him write &#8211; or do you write &#8211; &amp; then I will say all this &amp; more than this in
                    return, &amp; the arrangement may then be had without any appearance of contrivance; &#8211; otherwise he must perceive it, &amp; would
                    in all probability be the worse for it. No time for more &#8211; farewell</p>
