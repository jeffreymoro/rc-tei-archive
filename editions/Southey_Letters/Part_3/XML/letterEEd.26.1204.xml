        <p rend="indent1"> For many days I have looked for a letter from you &#8211; the three lines announcing your arrival in England being all
                    which have yet reached me. Yesterday <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</ref>
          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Henry Herbert Southey graduated as MD from Edinburgh University on 24 June 1806.</note> &amp; I returned home
                    after a five days absence &#8211; &amp; I was disappointed at finding no tidings of you. We were two days at <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyds</ref>
          <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Lloyd lived at <ref target="places.html#LowBrathay">Low Brathay</ref>, near Ambleside.</note> &amp; have had three days mountaineering, one on
                    the way there, two on our return, thro the wildest parts of this wild country, many times wishing you had been with us. One day we
                    lost our way upon the mountains, got upon a summit where there were three precipices below us, &amp; found a way down thro a
                    fissure, like three sides of a chimney, where we could reach from side to side, &amp; help ourselves with our hands &#8211; This
                    chimney&#8211;way was higher than any house considerably, &amp; then we had an hours circuit afterwards over loose stones. Yesterday we
                    mounted Great Gabel<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Great Gable: a mountain at the head of Wasdale in the Lake
                        District.</note> &#8211; one of the highest mountains in the country, &amp; had a magnificent view of the Isle of Man, rising out of
                    a sea of light &#8211; for the water lay like a sheet of silver. This was a digression from our straight road, &amp; exceedingly
                    fatiguing it was; however after we got down we drank five quarts of milk between us, &amp; got home as fresh as larks after a walk
                    of eleven hours. You will find it harder service than walking the deck when you come here.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Our landlord</ref>, who lives in the house adjoining us, has a boat which is as much at
                    our service <del>at</del> &lt;as&gt; if it were our own; &#8211; of this we have voted you commander in chief whenever you shall arrive.
                    The Lake<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Derwentwater.</note> is about four miles in length, &amp; something between one
                    and two in breadth, &#8211; however tired you may be of salt water I do not think you will have the same objection to fresh when you see
                    the beautiful bason <del>of</del>, clear as crystal, &amp; shut in by mountains on every side, except one opening to the N. W. We
                    are very frequently upon it, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> &amp; I being both tolerably good boatmen,
                    &amp; sometimes we sit in state &amp; the women row us &#8211; a way of manning a boat which will amuse you. The only family with which
                    we are on familiar terms, live, during the summer &amp; autumn, on a little Island here &#8211; one of the loveliest spots in this wide
                        world.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#PeachyWilliam">William Peachy</ref> and his family had a house on Derwent Isle, Lake Derwent.</note>
                    They have one long room, looking on the Lake from three windows, of which I know not which is the most beautiful &#8211; &amp; in that
                    room you may have as much music &#8211; dancing &#8211; shuttle&#8211;cocking &amp;c as your heart can desire. They generally embargo us on our
                    water expeditions. I know not whether you like dining under a tree, as well as with the conveniences of chair &amp; table &amp; a
                    roof over head &#8211; which I confess please me better than a seat upon any moss however cushiony, &amp; in any shade however romantic,
                    &#8211; if however you do, here are some delightful bays at the head of the lake, in any of which we may land, &#8211; &amp; if you love
                    fishing &#8211; you may catch perch enough on the way for the boats company, &amp; perhaps a Jack<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> A pike.</note> or two into the bargain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One main advantage which this country possesses over Wales is, that there are no long tracks of desolation to cross
                    between one beautiful spot &amp; another. We are sixteen miles only from Windermere, &amp; there are other Lakes on the way to it,
                    sixteen only from Wass&#8211;water, as many from <ref target="places.html#Ullswater">Ullswater</ref>, nine from Buttermere &amp;
