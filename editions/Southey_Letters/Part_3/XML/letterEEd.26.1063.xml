                        an assistant keeper of manuscripts at the British Museum. He produced two large works on Indian religion: <title>Indian
                            Antiquities</title> (1793&#8211;1800) and <title>The History of Hindustan</title> (1795&#8211;1798). A Church of England cleric, he
                        gained the living of Cudham, Kent, in 1804.</note> &amp; of Davies Giddy<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Davies Giddy

                    design in the author than that of making himself pass for an orthodox clergyman, &#8211; in fact his whole aim has been to get
