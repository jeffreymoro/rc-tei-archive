                    getting money; &#8211; I am afraid it is as certain that my stomach will never be made up to it. &#8211; No other kind of poetry will pay me
                    for the paper. I told <ref target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir G. Beaumont</ref> who blamed me for not writing more that it
                    was very well to be content with posthumous fame, but there was no being contented with posthumous bread &amp; cheese. <ref target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir G.</ref> should have bought Thalaba<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    worth while to publish it or not, because disuse is a bad thing for a poet, &amp; that which is worth little to me will become of
                    great value by keeping. I ought to write poems for the benefit of my heirs.</p>
