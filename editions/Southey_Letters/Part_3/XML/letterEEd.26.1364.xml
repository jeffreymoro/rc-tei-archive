                        (1807).</note> knowing that you who love to read as well to sing &#8216;of Knights &amp; gentle Ladies deeds&#8217; &#8211; will not be dismayed
                    at the sight of four volumes more corpulent than volumes are wont to be in these desperate days. The Romance, tho not so good as
                        Amadis<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish romance <title>Amadis of Gaul</title>, Southey&#8217;s translation of
                        which appeared in 1803.</note> is a good romance, &amp; far superior to any other of the Spanish school that I have yet seen.
                    I know not whether you will think that part of the Preface satisfactory in which it is argued that Moraes<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Francisco Moraes Cabral (1500?&#8211;1572). Scott had not been impressed, in 1803, by Southey&#8217;s claims about the
                        authorship of <title>Amadis</title>. See Scott&#8217;s review of Southey&#8217;s translation of <title>Amadis the Gaul</title> (1803) in
                        the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 5 (October 1803), 109&#8211;136.</note> is the author. It is so to myself</p>

                    lays are probably at an end. that portion of my time which I can afford to employ in labouring for fame is given to historical
                    pursuits, &#8211; &amp; poetry will not procure for me any thing more substantial. This motive alone would not perhaps wean me from an
