        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> A ridiculous disorder, called the Mumps, has nearly gone through the house, and visited me in its way, &#8211; a thing
                    which puts one more out of humour than out of health; but my neck has now regained its elasticity, and I have left off the extra
                    swathings which yesterday buried my chin, after the fashion of fops a few years ago.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> During the half year from November to May, my time passes on with such a happy uniformity, that were it not for an
                    occasional cold, a visit from the mumps, or some other such interruption, time would glide by without anything by which it could
                    be remembered; and when summer came, I should almost be surprised at finding that winter was gone. Never, certainly, did man lead
                    a life more after his heart&#8217;s desire, than it is my good fortune to enjoy. My first volume is nearly half printed.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> was published in 1810.</note> Just

                    present plan better. A good review of the works of the dead would far exceed in value any journal of contemporary criticism; no
                    book would there be introduced which was not, in some degree, worthy of notice; there would be nothing adulatory, nothing
                    malicious, and rigid justice might be administered without any fear of hurting either the feelings or fortunes of the dead; &#8211; a
                    fear which every man who reviews the works of a living author ought to have before his eyes. I should like well to bear a part in

        <p rend="indent1"> The publication of Sir John Moore&#8217;s last letter, and the correspondence between him and <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref>, have given a deep wound to his memory, and incontestably proved him to have
                    been utterly unequal to his situation.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The diplomatist <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">John Hookham Frere</ref> was sent to Spain as minister-plenipotentiary to the
                        Central Junta on 4 October 1808 and when the French marched on Madrid he urged Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>),
                        the Commander of the British forces in northern Spain to also advance upon Madrid despite his inclination to retreat through
                        Portugal. After the disastrous retreat to Corunna, Frere was blamed for this advice and recalled by the British government.
                        After some of Frere&#8217;s and Moore&#8217;s correspondence was read out in the Commons on 27 April, Moore&#8217;s side of matters was
                        presented in James Moore (1763&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Narrative of the Campaign of the British Army in Spain,
                            Commanded by His Excellency Sir John Moore. Authenticated by Official Papers and Original Letters</title> (1809). Frere&#8217;s
                        correspondence with Moore was published in 1810 in a work entitled <title>To the British Nation is Presented by Colonel
                            Venault de Charmilly, Knight of the Royal and Military Order of St. Louis, the Narrative of his Transactions in Spain with
                            the Rt. Hon. Hookham Frere, His Britannic Majesty&#8217;s Minister Plenipotentiary, and Lt. Gen. Sir John Moore, K.B. Commander
                            of the British Forces: with the Suppressed Correspondence of Sir J. Moore: Being a Refutation of the Calumnies Invented

          <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere&#8217;s</ref> letters do him high honour. They evince a knowledge of the people, a
                    knowledge of the country, and a reliance upon what is good and permanent in human nature; in all of which Sir John Moore was
                    unhappily deficient. It is no slight satisfaction to me, to find the same opinions in these letters which I have always
                    maintained, both as to what the Spaniards will do, and what the English army should have done.</p>
