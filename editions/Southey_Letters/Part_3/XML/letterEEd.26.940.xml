                        untraced; text is taken from Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey, 6 vols (London, 1849&#8211;1850).  Previously  published:
                        Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey, 6 vols (London, 1849&#8211;1850), II, pp. 283&#8211;284 [in part].Dating note: This letter is
                        misdated either by Southey or C. C. Southey, as Southey&#8217;s letter to Edith dated 11 May 1804 (Letter 939), states that he has just arrived in Liverpool and is catching the coach to London at
                        6pm on that day. That letter is also postmarked 11 May 1804, which verifies its date. Southey states in this letter that he arrived in London yesterday evening, Sunday 13 May
                        1804, so the letter was probably written on Monday 14 May 1804.</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>

                    &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At six that evening got into the coach; slept at Warrington; breakfasted at Stone; dined at Birmingham; slept at Stratford-upon-Avon; in the dark
                    we reached that place, so that I could not see Shakspeare&#8217;s grave, but I will return that road on purpose. At five, on Sunday morning, we arrived in Oxford, and I walked through it
                    at that quiet and delightful hour, and thought of the past and the present. We did not reach London till after five last evening, so that I was forty-eight hours in the coach. I
                    landed at the White Horse Cellar; no coach was to be procured, and I stood in all the glory of my filth beside my trunk, at the
                    Cellar door, in my spencer<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A short double-breasted overcoat.</note> of the cut of 1798 (for
                    so long is it since it was made), and my dirty trowsers, while an old fellow hunted out a porter for me; for about five minutes I waited; the whole mob of Park loungers and
                    Kensington Garden buckery, male and female, were passing by in all their finery, and all looked askance on me.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The fashionable set
                        walked, rode and drove in carriages in Hyde Park and the adjoining Kensington Gardens, to see and be seen.</note> Well, off I set at last, and soon found my spencer was the
                    wonderful part of my appearance. I stopped at the top of St. James&#8217;s Street, just before a group, who all turned round to admire me, pulled it off, and gave it to my dirty porter,
                    and exhibited as genteel a black coat as ever <ref target="people.html#AikinArthur">Joe Aikin</ref> made&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;.
