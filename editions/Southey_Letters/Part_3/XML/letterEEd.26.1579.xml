          <salute>My dear Landor,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have a bill coming before Parliament.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Landor required an Act of
                        Parliament to be allowed to demolish buildings and build a house at his newly-purchased estate, the former priory at
                        Llanthony, near Abergavenny, Wales. The Act was passed later in 1809.</note> &#8211; The <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Speakers Secretary</ref> happens to be one of my very intimate friends, &amp; one of the men in the world for whom I have the
                    highest respect. It may be some convenience to you upon this occasion to know him, because he can give you every necessary
                    information respecting Parliamentary business, &amp; thus perhaps spare you some needless troubles, &#8211; &amp; there needs no other
                    introduction than knocking at his door &amp; sending up your name, with which he is well acquainted. <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> is his name, &amp; you will find it over his door, in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                    Stephens Court, New Palace Yard, &#8211; next door to <ref target="people.html#AbbotCharles">the Speakers</ref>. I will tell you what
                    kind of man he is. His outside has so little polish about it, that once having gone from Christ-Church to Pool in his own boat, he
                    was taken by the press-gang, &#8211; his robust figure, hard-working hands, &amp; hoarse voice all tending to deceive them. A little of
                    this is worn off. He is the strongest &amp; clearest headed man that I have ever known, &#8211; pondere, numero &amp; mensura is his
                        motto,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning &#8216;weigh, number and measure&#8217;.</note> &#8211; but to all things he carries the
                    same reasoning &amp; investigating intellect as to mathematical science, &amp; will find out in Homer &amp; the Bible facts
                    necessarily to be inferred from the text, &amp; which yet have as little been supposed to be there intimated, as the existence of
                    metal was suspected in potash before <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> detected it there.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1807 Davy caused a sensation by using the Voltaic pile to separate an unknown metal, potassium, from
                        potash. He also isolated sodium from common salt.</note> I have often said that I learnt how to see for the purposes of poetry
                    from Gebir,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor&#8217;</ref>s poem <title>Gebir</title> (1798).</note> &#8211; how to read for the
                    purposes of history from <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>. &#8211; His manners are stoical, they are like the husk of
                    the cocoa-nut, &amp; his inner nature is like the milk within its kernel. When I go to London I am always his guest, &#8211; he gives me
                    but half his hand when he welcomes me at the door, &#8211; but I have his whole heart; &#8211; &amp; there is not that thing in the world
                    which he thinks would serve or gratify me that he does not do for me, &#8211; unless it be something which he thinks I can as well do
                    myself. The subject which he best understands is political economy. Were there but half a dozen such men in the House of Commons,
                    there would be courage, virtue &amp; wisdom enough there to save this country from that revolution to which it is so certainly
                    approaching.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should not have written just now had it not been to mention <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>,
                    thinking that you may find it useful to know him. For I wished when writing to tell you of Kehama,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> &#8211; <del>&amp;</del> a good many interruptions
                    have occurred to delay my progress, indispositions of my own, or of the childrens, this latter the only things concerning which I
                    am anxious over much. At present <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my wife</ref> is seriously ill, &#8211; &amp; when I shall be
                    sufficiently at rest to do any thing God knows. Another heat will finish the poem</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope you will not return to Spain. What is to be done in that country must be behind stone-walls, not in the open
                    field. Moore<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish General with a long and varied military career.
