        <p rend="indent1"> Whenever the encouragement of literature is talked of again in the House. I should think a motion for letting
                    Proof-Sheets pass as franks would not be opposed, &#8211; <del>xxxxx xxxxxx xxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxx</del>, they
                    cannot produce 100 &#163; a year to the Post Office, &#8211; probably not half the sum, &#8211; but it is a tax of some weight on the few
                    individuals whom it affects &#8211; &amp; a good deal of inconvenience is occasioned to the Printers by waiting for franks, while their
                    presses stand still. Few persons have greater facilities for geting franks than myself, yet the proofs which are without them,
                    &amp; those which are over weight from being damp, or &lt;which are&gt; misdated, do not cost me less than 30/ shillings, a year.
                    &#8211; The proofs of Madoc cost me 50<hi rend="sup">s</hi> &#8211; rather too much out of five &amp; twenty pounds profit.</p>
        <p rend="indent4"> ________</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have by me Bishop Lavingtons tracts concerning the Moravians, &#8211; &amp; as I can in great part vouch for the
                    accuracy of his Catholick references there seems no reason to suspect him in <del>xxx</del> the others.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Lavington (1684&#8211;1762; <title>DNB</title>),<title> The Enthusiasm of Methodists and Papists,
                            Compar&#8217;d</title> (1749&#8211;1751) and <title>The Moravians Compared and Detected</title> (1755).</note> At first these tracts
                    left upon my mind the same impression which has been made upon yours, .. nor have I any doubt that Zinzendorff<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (1700&#8211;1760), founder of the Moravian
                        sect.</note> was altogether a designing man, &amp; that the absurdities &amp; obscenities charged upon them in their outset
                    are in the main true. But it is so in the beginning of all sects, &amp; it seems to be <del>th</del> a regular part of the process
                    of fanaticism. Devotion borrows its language from carnal love, this is natural <del>xx</del> enough, .. &amp; the consequences are
                    natural enough &lt;also&gt; when one who is more known than enthusiast begins to talk out of Solomons Song to a sister in the
                    spirit. But this sort of leaven soon purges off, &#8211; the fermentation ceases, &amp; the liquor first becomes fine, then vapid, &#8211;
                    &amp; at last you come to the dregs. Moravianism is in its second stage: its few proselytes fall silently in, led by
                        <del>conviction</del> &lt;solitary&gt; thought &amp; conviction, not hurried on by contagious feelings, &#8211; &amp; the main body
                    of its members have been born within the pale of &lt;the&gt; society. They do not live up to the rigours of their institutions in
                    England, &#8211; even here however it is certain that they are a respectable &amp; respected people: &amp; as missionaries they are
                    meritorious beyond all others. No people but the Quakers understand how to communicate Xtianity so well &amp; the Quakers are only
                    beginning, whereas the Moravians have for half a century been labouring in the vineyard. Krantz&#8217;s Hist. of <del>the</del> what

                            <title>DNB</title>), the naval captain who famously endured the mutiny on HMS <hi rend="ital">Bounty</hi> in 1789, and
                        further mutinies and acts of insubordination in 1797 and 1804, enjoyed the patronage of the powerful Sir Joseph Banks
                        (1743&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>), President of the Royal Society, who had circumnavigated the globe on the voyage of HMB <hi rend="ital">Endeavour</hi> under Captain James Cook (1728&#8211;1779; <title>DNB</title>). Banks approved of Bligh because Cook
                        had chosen him as sailing master on his third voyage round the world 1776&#8211;1780. Banks&#8217;s influence caused Bligh&#8217;s appointment,
                        in 1805, to the governorship of New South Wales; Bligh became embroiled in controversy there as he attempted to stamp out
                        corrupt practices and suffered another mutiny on 26 January 1808, being confined to a ship offshore by officers of the New
                        South Wales Corps.</note> &#8211; the only place in the world I grant you which is fit for him, &#8211; but not fit for him in the
                    capacity in which he went out. If you have not read Collins&#8217;s Book,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> David Collins

                    before the business comes on in Parliament. It is unique in its kind, .. the minute history of a colony during the first years of
                    difficulty &amp; distress. There was one man in power there precisely fit for his situation &#8211; Governor King: &amp; if it had been
                    possible to induce him to stay here, Governor he ought to have been for life, with discretionary powers.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Philip Gidley King (1758&#8211;1808; <title>DNB</title>), governor of Norfolk Island and of New South Wales

                    if there was any punishment to be inflicted for mismanagement, it ought to fall upon those who appointed him. It was as certain
                    that he would do mischief, as it is that if a spark falls among gunpowder an explosion must follow. &#8211; One thing is plain
                    respecting the colony, &amp; that is that no more convicts ought to be sent to the establishments already made. Send them to new
                    settlements, &amp; let the old ones purify, at present the strata of vice is perpetually renewed. Instead of doing this &#8211; the
                    fresh convicts should be sent at once to new points along the coast, for new settlements must necessarily consume men, &amp; these
                    are the men who are fit to be consumed.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Are you right in thinking that Sallust has the advantage in subject over Tacitus?<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> Gaius Sallustius Crispus (86&#8211;34 BC), Roman historian, author of <title>The Conspiracy of Catiline</title>

                    no good feeling, treating only of bad men in bad times, &#8211; but that the sufferings of good men in evil days form the most
                    interesting &amp; improving part of human history. I prefer Tacitus to all other historians &#8211; infinitely prefer him, because no
                    other historian inculcates so deep &amp; holy a hatred of tyranny. It is from him that I learnt my admiration of the Stoics.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> Stoicism was a school of Greek philosophy founded in Athens in the early 3rd century
                        BC. It taught that strong emotions were the result of errors in judgment, which those possessing wisdom could
