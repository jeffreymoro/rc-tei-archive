        <p rend="indent1"> Ah Grosvenor &#8211; Ahhhhhhhh &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;! If <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>  had found the
                    Butler-a-boo statute in Ben Jonson, he would have hunted about till he found out its meaning, &#8211; which does not lie very deep &#8211; for
                    statutes are to be looked for in Statute Books. I being at Dublin Castle opened the first page of the Irish Statutes &amp; there
                    the first thing which <del>appe struck</del> caught my eye was The <hi rend="ital">Butler-a-boo Statute against making
                        Comparisons</hi>, this was the phrase, &#8211; its meaning that <del>the</del> quarrels between the Ormonds (I believe) &amp;
                    Butlers in which each party <hi rend="ital">compared</hi> themselves with the other, &amp; set up their cry &amp; &lt;so&gt; made
                    a riot were declared <del>xxx</del> &lt;felony&gt;. The cry of the Butlers was Butler-a-boo &amp; thence the statute was so
                        denominated.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey briefly served in Ireland as private secretary to <ref target="people.html#CorryIsaac">Isaac Corry</ref>, Irish chancellor of the exchequer (1801&#8211;1802). He refers to a 1495 Act
                        of Parliament (10 Hen. VII. C. 20) to prohibit the words Butler-a-boo. This was the war cry (&#8216;abu&#8217; meaning up in Irish Gaelic)
                        of the Irish clan Butler, who were not enemies of the Ormonds but themselves Earls of Ormond.</note> Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedford bad comparisons being so often made both in prose &amp; verse I was not a little tickled at finding the
                    felony. And here have you &amp; <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> cut out a good thing, which they who did
                    not understand would have believed to be good by faith, &amp; they who did would have laughed at.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford and Gifford had cut this arcane literary joke from one of Southey&#8217;s reviews for the
                            <title>Quarterly Review</title>. Gifford was editing <title>The Works of Ben Jonson</title> (1816); here Southey compares
                        his editing of Jonson (1572&#8211;1637; <title>DNB</title>) favourably with that of the <title>Quarterly</title>.</note> Ahhh! &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;
                    But I will put it in again some where else by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Patrick &amp; the Holy Poker.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John Ballantyne</ref>, the quarter proprietor of the Quarterly, was here on Monday. He
                        <del>xxx</del> expressed an earnest hope that the Review would &#8216;let the D of York alone&#8217;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>), Commander in Chief of the army. In 1809
                        parliament, sitting as a Court of Inquiry, found that York had known that his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852;
                            <title>DNB</title>), was enriching herself by accepting money from army officers, in return for which he granted them
                        promotion. The ministry, fearful of incurring royal displeasure and so losing power, called in its payroll vote to ensure that
                        the Duke of York was not condemned. Southey was afraid it would also pressurise the <title>Quarterly</title> into supporting
                        the Duke. Despite minsterial pressure, sufficient MPs voted against him for his resignation to be necessary. He was
                        reappointed in 1811.</note> thereby implying a fear that it meant to defend him. &#8211; &amp; he told me with a prophetic sense of
                    the mischief such a thing would do, that <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</ref>  &amp; others talked of
                    &#8216;unmuzzling Gifford&#8217; &#8211; that <del>xxx</del> is setting up the old cry of Anti-Jacobinism. I simply told him, in either of these
                    cases I should withdraw from the journal, &#8216;being of any party rather than the Anti-Jacobine.&#8217; I might have told him that I would
                    rather be hanged without that Anti to my denomination, than perished with it. Under the rose, he complained of <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> as a bad Editor, said that he wanted activity &amp; method &amp; that <ref target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, himself no man of business, was over anxious &amp; teazed him.</p>

                        Scott</ref>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> For the letter to Scott, see Southey to Walter Scott, 11 March 1809,
                        Letter 1597.</note> He sent up a note to say he was at the Inn &amp; could wait on me when it was convenient. I, nothing
                    dreaming of business, enquired what was for dinner, &#8211; &amp; finding it was a whole joint of meat, &#8211; asked him to come up &amp; eat
                    of it; &#8211; had it been only the fragments my invitation must have been to tea, &#8211; for nothing is to be got here when it is wanted.
                    This was lucky, &amp; exceedingly glad I was it had so happened when I found that immediately after tea he set off again for
                    Penrith, <del>xxx</del> &amp; that this <del>whole</del> had been a publisher-ing not a laking visit. &#8211; The business was to talk
                    over the plan of a Review of all books except contemporary ones, &#8211; which I christened Rhadamanthus,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In Greek mythology Rhadamanthus was a wise king, who was one of the judges of the dead. Southey&#8217;s plans
                        for this periodical were never fulfilled.</note> &#8211; &amp; which he &amp; his booksellers wish me to manage. Whether it will
                    take place or not I do not know, but rather think it will. He proposed 100 per year as editor &amp; ten guineas per sheet, &#8211;
                    quarterly numbers at 5/. In toto it would bring me in from 200, to 250 a year. &amp; the temptation of getting the 100 merely for
                    writing letters, arranging articles &amp; correcting proof sheet, is the main inducement to listen to a proposal which must needs
                    in some measure withdraw me from worthier occupations; &#8211; for all the assistance within my reach will not prevent the main weight
                    of the work from resting upon my shoulders. But of this you shall hear more when things are more settled.</p>

                    wishful an eye I used to look at them in a booksellers window a few doors only from my fathers shop, I looked with a
                    bibliographers curiosity for the date, &#8211; sure enough it proved to be as old as I expected &#8211; 1772. In what old fashioned shop could
                    you have found them &#8211; There is one I think on going up to Charing Cross which seems <del>xxx</del> old enough for such an
                    antiquated stock. I liked em the better for reminding me of old times.</p>
