        <p rend="indent1"> Next to your drawing.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had asked Barker to make designs of a beaver and other animals and scenes from
                            <title>Madoc</title>; see Southey to Mary Barker, 17 February 1804 (Letter 896), 3 March 1804 (Letter 906) and 29 December 18[04] (Letter 1009).</note> it is exceedingly
                    beautiful, &amp; almost induces me to say that you who manage a pencil in so masterly, or mistressly &#8211; a way, ought never to use a brush &#8211; it is exceedingly beautiful &#8211; dont wonder
                    that I write a phrase twice which I have ejaculated about twenty times. But, &#8211; there is a fault in the drawing &#8211; with reference to its purport &#8211; which I did not discover for full
                    half an hour, &amp; that is that if large trees are introduced, the scale of proportions will reduce the poor Beaver to a very diminutive personage indeed, &#8211; in fact he will look
                    as a portrait of a man would look taken in, &amp; <hi rend="ital">taking in</hi> the inside of St Pauls. I will make something to fit this beautiful bank &#8211; &amp; you must make
                    another bank to fit the Beaver &#8211; where you may have as many reeds, flags, colts-foots, &amp; stumps of trees as you please &#8211; but no tree. And for the Beaver himself I will bring
                    you down a portrait from London. The animal is a beautiful animal, &amp; his tail so ridiculously convenient that it looks exactly as if he had bespoken it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thought to have been in London by this time, &amp; am vexed to be thus delayed in daily expectation. it keeps one on the fret or the fidgets, &amp; half unfits me
                    for doing anything.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will grieve &amp; groan for a burro here, we have fine things enough from the windows, but to get at them a long way &amp; not a pleasant one. In our direction I
                    can shorten the disagreable in a way which would not be quite so convenient for you &#8211; by doffing shoe &amp; stocking &amp; fording the Greta at the bottom of the orchard. To boat
                    it is dearer than coaching in London &amp; less convenient. however by good fortune the finest river scenery lies within two miles of the house &#8211; &amp; not a tourist has ever heard
                    of it. You will delight in the Greta, &amp; curse the <ref target="people.html#WatsonRichardBishopLlandaff">Bishop of Llandaff</ref>  for cutting down its
                    woods.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What you say of the difficulty or impossibility of getting decent design, if you bespeak them of a trade artist I know well. &#8211; &amp; that makes me the more desirous
                    to have as little to do with them as possible. If you can manage the scenery, we may trust a Londoner to insert a figure, introduced solely to exhibit dress, or armour, or arms,
                    not for any passion &#8211; or interesting part of the poem &#8211; for that would inevitably be ruined. And the scenery it is very certain you can manage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am now transcribing the first part of Madoc to take to London &amp; leave with the Printer.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poem was in fact printed

                    shall all be out of patience. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is well, bating the ventoseness which is her old grievance. I overwalked myself yesterday, &amp;
                    have a headache, so you must excuse a cheating letter &#8211; for half a letter is cheating &#8211; nor would I send it but for the supposition that if I were silent you would be uneasy. You
