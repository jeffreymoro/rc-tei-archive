        <p rend="indent1"> What you have heard of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> is true, he is about to
                    seperate from <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">his wife</ref>, &amp; as he chuses to do every thing in a way
                    different from the rest of the world, is first going with her to visit his relations where however she has long since been
                    introduced. The seperation is a good thing, &#8211; his habits are so murderous of all domestic comfort that I am only surprized <del>xx
                        xxxxx</del>
          <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Mrs C.</ref> is not rejoiced at being rid of him. He besots himself with opium, or with
                    spirits, till his eyes look like a Turks who is half reduced to idiotcy by the practise &#8211; he calls up the servants at all hours of
                    the night to prepare food for him, &#8211; he does in short <del>every</del> all things <del>just at the time when it</del> at all times
                    except the proper time, &#8211; does nothing which he ought to do, &amp; every thing which he ought not. His present scheme is to live
                    with <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> &#8211; it is from his idolatry of that family that this has begun, &#8211;
                    they have always humoured him in all his follies, &#8211; listened to his complaints of <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">his
                        wife</ref>, &#8211; &amp; when he has complained of the itch, helped him to scratch, instead of covering him with
                    brimstone ointment, &amp; shutting him up by himself. <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#WordsworthDorothy">his sister</ref>  who pride themselves upon having no selfishness, are of
                    all human beings whom I have ever known the most intensely selfish. The one thing to which <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">W.</ref> would sacrifice all others is his own reputation, concerning which
                    his anxiety is perfectly childish &#8211; like a woman of her beauty: &amp; so he can get <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> to talk his own writings over with him, &amp; critise them &amp;
                    (without amending them) teach him how to do it, &#8211; to be in fact the very rain &amp; air &amp; sunshine of his intellect, he thinks
                        <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> is very well employed &amp; this arrangement a very good one. I
                    myself, as I have told <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>, think it highly fit that the seperation
                    should take place, but by no means so that it should ever have been <del>xxxxxx</del> necessary.</p>

                        slavewoman who was captured with his mother en route to Mecca by ship. Taken to Malta, he was brought up by the Dominicans
