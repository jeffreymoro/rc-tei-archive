        <p rend="indent1"> &#8216;How shall I thank you for the pleasure &amp; delight of your excellent &amp; pretty letter&#8217;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Quotation untraced.</note> inclosing the half-quarter of my poor mutilated pension. &#8211; That pension makes
                    me disposed to swear every time it comes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have not heard from me because I have been any thing rather than at leisure either of heart or hand. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Little Emma</ref>  was no sooner recovering from an illness than <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">her Mother</ref>  was taken seriously ill, &amp; confined for above a week to her bed
                    &#8211; We were the more alarmed because there was great danger of its bringing on premature labour. Thank God she is better, &amp; that
                    danger is over.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been busy, in gutting borrowed books which were to be returned with great speed, &amp; which were like wood
                    cock all trail. They cost me three weeks of almost incessant application, &#8211; that is of all the application that I could command. I
                    waited to begin a new article for the Quarterly till the first number was published,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Though dated February, the first number of the <title>Quarterly Review</title> was published on 3 March 1809. Southey&#8217;s next
                        review was of <title>Extractos em Portuguez e em Inglez; com as Palavras Portuguezas Propriamente Accentuadas, para Facilitar
                            o Estudo d&#8217;Aquella Lingoa</title> (1808) in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 1 (May 1809), 268&#8211;292.</note> &#8211; &amp; as
                    that is so near at hand will begin tomorrow &#8211; But if <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>  likes my
                    pattern work &#8211; he should send me more cloth to cut. &#8211; he should send me Travels, which I review better than any thing else. I am
                    impatient to see the first number. &#8211; Young Lady never felt more desirous to see herself in a new ball-dress, than I do to see my
                    own performances in print, often as that gratification falls to my lot. The reason is that in the multiplicity of my employments,
                    I forget the form &amp; manner of every thing as soon as it is out of sight, &amp; they come to me like pleasant recollections of
                    what I wish to remember. Besides the thing looks differently in print. In short Mr Bedford there are a great many philosophical
                    reasons for this fancy of mine, &amp; one of the best of all reasons is that I hold it good to make every thing a pleasure which
                    it is possible to make so, &#8211; &amp; these sort of Claude spectacles<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coloured spectacles
                        rather than the treated mirror known as the Claude Glass. The tinted lenses were used by amateur artists seeking to paint
                        effects of light on the landscape.</note> are very convenient things for a man who lives in a land of rain &amp; clouds, &#8211;
                    they make an artificial sunshine for what some people would call gloomy weather.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The first number ought to have been striking &#8211; but indeed indeed I am afraid there are too many of the sons of the
                    feeble <del>xxx</del> upon your list. It is no matter how respectable the thing is if it be dull withal.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God bless you &#8211; in a few days I will create leisure for another number of Kehama.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> I have not written a line &lt;of it&gt;
                    these last two months. First I was indisposed myself, &#8211; then the children were, lastly <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my
                        wife</ref>, &amp; anxiety unfits me for any thing that requires feeling as well as thought. I can labour, I can think,
                    &#8211; thought &amp; labour will produce poetry.</p>
