          <salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your last brief letter, which relieved me from a good deal of uneasiness. I wrote to Lisbon fully
                    upon the subject. <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My uncle&#8217;s</ref> long intervals of silence would surprise me if I did
                    not know him well, and, even as it is, at times make me anxious for his health.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, by God&#8217;s blessing, gets well through her confinement, you
                    will perhaps see me in town towards the end of April, upon this business.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Southeys&#8217;
                        second child, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, was born on 30 April 1804.</note> You probably have
                    seen <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis&#8217;s</ref> &#8216;Specimens of the early English Poets.&#8217;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> George Ellis, <title>Specimens of the Early English Poets</title> (1790; 2nd edn 1801; 3rd edn 1803).</note>
                    The book has sold very successfully, and I am about to publish a supplementary or companion work. There will be a preliminary
                    essay on the state of our Literature at the Restoration, referring more particularly to poetry, as affected by that event; then,
                    upon Ellis&#8217;s plan, and beginning where he leaves off, a brief biographical notice of every English poet from that time, with the
                    best or most characteristic specimen of his works, arranging the authors chronologically, and bringing them down to the present
                    time, exclusive only of living authors. I include every poet, good, bad, and indifferent, who had any reputation, or produced any
                    effect in his day. A sort of estimate of the present state of our poetry will conclude it. And this work, with Ellis&#8217;s, will
                    contain accounts and specimens of all the English poets, so that, reckoning upon the notoriety of his book, and the market value
                    of my name, this bids fair to be a profitable speculation.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> An early reference to the
                        project that Southey undertook with <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor Charles Bedford</ref> and
                        published with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 1807 as <title>Specimens of the Later English
                            Poets</title>. Full of errors, it did not sell well.</note> My bargain is to share the mutual profits, being at no risk,
                    and advancing nothing. This is all easy work, and more matter of amusement than labour, for the copying part shall all be done by
                    some bookseller&#8217;s amanuensis. The brief biographies I shall make as full of matter as I can. The greatest part may be done here,
                    but it will cost me a journey to London to get at the forgotten books, which perhaps are only to be found in Stationers&#8217;
                        Hall.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Near Ludgate Hill, in the City of London: a repository for old books because the
                        Stationers&#8217; Company, whose headquarters it is, had a royal monopoly on book production in the sixteenth and seventeenth
                        centuries.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I informed you of my design to publish &#8216;Madoc&#8217; as soon as that design was formed, &#8211; at that time rather in
                    conformity with the advice of others than to my own opinion. I tried how far it would be advisable to adopt the mode of
                    subscription, and, after feeling the ground safely and certainly, was convinced that any public attempt would be equally unwise
                    and unsuccessful. I therefore applied to <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, and have agreed that he shall
                    publish it in quarto, with engravings, and share the profits with me.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem
                            <title>Madoc</title>, which he had written in 1797&#8211;1799 and was revising for publication. It was published in 1805.</note>
                    The vignettes are wanted to elucidate an outlandish costume and give broad hints to dull imaginations, and are therefore not mere
                    ornaments. My reasons for preferring this agreement to a prompt payment were, that they might advance the whole capital in giving
                    the book these eye-catching utilities, which are always hearty shoves to a heavy quarto; and that I might receive large interest,
                    instead of paying large discount; for, in fact, that is the clear mode of stating it. I have hopes that this volume will do well,

        <p rend="indent1"> I find reason to believe, monstrous and incredible as it may appear, that the Mendicants did at one time act with a
                    design of superseding Christ as Mohammed had done, and setting up St. Francisco<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Saint Francis of Assisi (Giovanni Francesco di Bernardone; 1181/2&#8211;1226), the founder of the Franciscan order of Catholic mendicants</note> in his stead. You know enough of his life to know
                    that he was in his lifetime averred to be the living pattern and parallel of the Redeeming God; and I know where to find proofs
                    that this blasphemy was sanctioned and abetted by the popes. The Franciscans at one time <hi rend="ital">dated</hi> from the
                    infliction of his five wounds, &#8211; in the year of our Lord and of St Francis; and it was attempted to substitute the Evangelium <hi rend="ital">Sempiternum</hi>, upon the direct principle that the old Gospels were now no longer necessary. These facts justify
                    the inference &#8211; in fact, it was palpable &#8211; that what those wretches taught was not what our Saviour taught. I think I can explain
                    how it failed through the malice of the Dominicans, who set up their founder in opposition. The Evangelium <hi rend="ital">Sempiternum</hi> was at last condemned; and I know not whether it exists in MSS., nor whether the prophecies of the Abbot
                    Joaquim are to be found;<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Introductorium in Evangelium Aeternum</title> was
                        written (c. 1250) by Fra Gherardo of Borgo San Donnino (dates unknown), a Franciscan follower of the mystic Joachim di Fiore
                        (1132&#8211;1202). Joachim di Fiore was a Cistercian abbot, mystic and interpreter of Biblical prophecy who argued that the world
                        was approaching a third epoch (superseding the Old and New Testament epochs) &#8211; the epoch of the Eternal Gospel, the Kingdom of
                        the Holy Spirit, when all would live in love, no longer needing law. The Franciscan Joachists wished to spiritualise their
                        order: they argued that Joachim&#8217;s three books (<title>Liber Concordiae Novi ac Veteris Testamenti, Expositio in
                            Apocalipsim</title>, and<title> Psalterium Decem Cordarum</title>) constituted the Eternal Gospel, replacing the Gospel of
                        Christ, for the spiritual life had ebbed from the Old and New Testaments. The existing priesthood and Bible would be
                        superseded and a kingdom of love would begin. A manuscript containing extracts from Joachim&#8217;s prophecies was in the British
