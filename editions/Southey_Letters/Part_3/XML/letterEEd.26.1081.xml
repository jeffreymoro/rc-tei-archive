          <salute>Dear Elmsley,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should have written to you in consequence of a letter received from <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> on Sunday last, if the newspaper of the same post had not acquainted me with your brother&#8217;s death. The older we
                    grow the more important these ties of relationship become, as we become more sensible of the value and comparative instability of
                    all others &#8211; so much the worse for the loss.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Autumn is a better time for visiting this country than summer, because the weather is settled, &#8211; indeed our summer
                    hardly sets in till autumn. I hope you may be able to come this year, especially as it is very possible I may not be here the
                    next. The want of my own books, which it would be folly to remove till I have a fixed residence, and the want of occasional access
                    to others are inconveniences that I feel more and more, and I have made up my mind to settle in the neighbourhood of London as
                    soon as possible. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brother</ref> has made prizes in the West Indies which, if they have
                    escaped the Toulon fleet, will be worth a thousand pounds &#8211; he will lend me a fourth of this, of which 50 will remove me and my
                    appendages and the 200 purchase furniture enough to make a house habitable.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In December
                        1804 HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and
                        cargo captured in armed conflict, but Southey was concerned that the arrival of the French Mediterranean Fleet in the West
                        Indies, which had sailed from Toulon in March 1805, would mean the loss of the vessels.</note> If my bookselling speculations
                    answer I shall be able to discharge the debt by the end of the next year, &#8211; by which time I calculate that &#8216;Madoc,&#8217;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>Madoc</title> which was published in March 1805.</note> the specimens which
                        <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> is going with at last,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The project that Southey undertook with Grosvenor Bedford and published with <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in 1807 as <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>, as a companion to George Ellis,
                            <title>Specimens of the Early English Poets</title> (1790, 2nd edn 1801, 3rd edn 1803).</note> and another scheme now in
                    hand on which I depend more than on both the others, will have sent in their first returns. This, which is at present so secret
                    that neither <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> nor Bedford have heard of it, will be published as a translation
                    from the Spanish, being Letters from England<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella: Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807).</note> &#8211; in which I am putting as many of the odd things that I have seen or heard as can be published without touching
                    upon any personalities, and as many of my own speculations as can be let loose without exciting suspicion as to the quarter from
                    which they come. My object is to make as compleat a picture of the existing state of society in England, in as lively colours as I
                    can &#8211; to the life I should have said &#8211; for some of the colours must necessarily be dark ones. I have no wish not to be known
                    ultimately as the author &#8211; but secresy at first will be serviceable, because the book certainly will attract attention, and
                    anything like mystery will help the sale.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am working up-hill, but up-hill I get, so that the labour is not hopeless. There is as much historical matter
                    lying on my shelves as ought to, and probably will, one day produce me 1,500<hi rend="ital">l</hi>.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217;, which he never completed.</note> Considering my outset in the world, I have

                        <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>, if I will write a play, to insure its reception at Covent Garden and
                    perfect secresy with regard to the author till it shall have succeeded, if succeed it should. I cannot write a good play, though
                    neither <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> nor Lewis would believe me if I said so; but it is one thing to write a
                    striking dramatic passage in a narrative form and another to tell a whole story dramatically. However, it is very likely that I
                    can write such a one as will not be damned &#8211; tho&#8217; it should die after the season &#8211; and the profits are so enormously greater than
                    any that I can look for by any other kind of literary drudgery, that I cannot in conscience refuse to try for five hundred a year
                    in a very easy way, tho&#8217; not an agreeable one.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was contemplating writing a play,
                        stimulated by an offer, sent via Wynn, from Matthew Gregory Lewis (1775&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>) to smooth its passage to the
                        stage. He contemplated a Greek drama, a dramatisation of Madoc, and a play set in the reign of Mary I (1516&#8211;1558, Queen of
                        England 1553&#8211;1558; <title>DNB</title>); see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4th series (London,
                        1849&#8211;1850), IV, pp. 190&#8211;192 and Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 12 July 1805, Letter 1083.</note> It was on this that
                    I meant to have written to you, because there is in Diodorus Siculus a circumstance mentioned of which it might perhaps be
                    possible to make a fine Grecian puppet show. It is how a young Pythoness was stolen by a Thessalian, which ought to be connected
                    with the Pythian games and the attack on Delphi by the Persians or Gauls<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Diodorus Siculus
                        (1st century AD), Greek historian, whose <title>Bilbioteki</title>, Book 16 contains the story of the Pythoness. The Pythia
                        was the title given to the priestess of Apollo at Delphi, who was famous for her prophecies, uttered under the influence of
                        vapours rising from the earth. The priestess was originally always a young virgin, but after Echecrates the Thessalian
                        kidnapped and raped the incumbent, the priestess was always chosen from among old women. Because of its wealth and influence
                        Delphi was a regular target for attack by Greece&#8217;s enemies, such as the Persians and Gauls.</note> Will you refer to Diodorus
                    for me and see if there be any names or particulars of the story? Lib. 16, p. 428 is the reference which I found &#8211; to what edition
                    was not mentioned.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The way to enter the Lake country to most advantage is from Lancaster, cross the sands to Ulverston and see <ref target="places.html#FurnessAbbey">Furness Abbey</ref>, proceed up to the head of Coniston Lake &#8211; from thence by Esthwaite Lake
                    to the ferry at Windermere &#8211; and so by boat to <ref target="places.html#LowoodInn">Lowood</ref> or <ref target="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</ref>. If you go on to Scotland it would be better to leave <ref target="places.html#Ullswater">Ullswater</ref> for your return. You might also contrive to take in the Yorkshire caves which
                    lie about Ingleton<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The Yorkshire town of Ingleton is close to the notable geological features, Ingleborough Cave and White Scar Cave.</note> and strike down thence to Lancaster; but it is of great advantage to enter in this direction, because you will
                    then see everything the right way.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have a great wish to see Edinburgh. From every description it seems to be a very sociable place of residence for
                    one who has any friends there, and who could consent that his children should be Scotchmen. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">My brother</ref> (who is now with me) has got into good society there; <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref> has been very attentive to him, so also has <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref>, the only man whom I am really desirous of seeing. It will give me great
                    pleasure to accompany you if I can. I hope our spare bed will be vacant, &#8211; if it should not there will be no difficulty in
                    procuring a bedroom in town, which will be quieter than the inns.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8216;Madoc&#8217; has sold very well considering its size, a month ago more than half were gone; by what I hear of its repute it will
                    perhaps give &#8216;Thalaba&#8217; a lift.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title> Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note> I am
                    satisfied with the poem, but not quite so with myself, &#8211; for the same labour upon a better subject would have produced great
                    things. If it [had] not been planned and the key pitched before &#8216;Thalaba&#8217; was written I should think it symptomatic of decay in
                    the author of a premature old age.</p>
