                    Boroxense, Archidiaconio et Canonico Legionense. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
                    &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
                    &#160; 1598, folio. The book is in the Red Cross Street Library.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Dr Williams&#8217;s library,
                        housed in Red Cross Street London until 1865, today in Gordon Square.</note> I read it six years ago, and sent up an account
                    of it within the last six weeks for <ref target="people.html#AikinJohn">Dr. Aikin&#8217;s</ref> Biography,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had compiled an entry for the seventh volume of Aikin&#8217;s <title>General Biography</title> (1808) on
                        the inquisitor Luiz de Paramo and his history of the Inquisition. The entry was excerpted in the review of the
                            <title>Biography</title> published in the <title>Annual Review for 1808</title>, 7 (1809), 209&#8211;212.</note> where it will
                    be in villanously bad company. You will find there that God was the first Inquisitor, and that the first Auto da F&#232; was held upon
                    Adam and Eve. You will read enough to show you that Catholic writers defend the punishment of heretics, and quite sufficient to
                    make your blood run cold. I have the History of the Portuguese Inquisition to write, and look on to the task with absolute horror.
                    I am decidedly hostile to what is called Catholic Emancipation, as I am to what is called peace.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have had a correspondence with <ref target="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</ref>
          <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> This has not been traced.</note> concerning the best mode of publishing my Brazilian history;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> was eventually published by <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> in three volumes from 1810 to 1819.</note> and what he points out as the
                    best plan is little better than the half-and-half way, and involves a great deal of trouble, and what is worse, a great deal of
                    solicitation. I am a bad trading author, and doomed always to be so, but it is not the bookseller&#8217;s fault; the public do not buy
                    poetry unless it be made fashionable; mine gets reviewed by enemies who are always more active than friends; one reviewer envies
                    me, another hates me, and a third tries his hand upon me as fair game. Thousands meantime read the books; but they borrow them,
                    even those persons who are what they call my friends, and who know that I live by these books, never buy them themselves, and then
                    wonder that they do not sell. Espriella<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> As for the booksellers, I am disposed to distinguish between <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Long<hi rend="ital">man</hi>

                    question): now Trades<hi rend="ital">man</hi> nature is very bad, but Long<hi rend="ital">man</hi> nature is a great deal better,
                    and I am inclined to believe that it will get the better of the evil principle, and that liberal dealing may even prove catching.
                    It is some proof of this that his opinion of me and conduct towards me alter not, notwithstanding the spiders spin their webs so

        <p rend="indent1"> I am strongly moved by the spirit to make an attack upon <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref>

                    have half a dozen letters. Nothing but the weary work it would be to go through his reviews for the sake of collecting the
                    blunders in them, prevents me. He, and other men who are equally besotted and blinded by party, will inevitably frighten the
                    nation into peace, the only thing which can be more mischievous and more dishonourable than our Danish expedition.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The unprovoked attack by Britain on neutral Denmark of September 1807, done to prevent the

                    to be wondered at, that we pass for a degenerated race, when those who have the spirit of our old worthies in them, let that
                    spirit fret itself away in silence!</p>
