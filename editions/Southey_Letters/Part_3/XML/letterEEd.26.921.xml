                            and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich</title>, 2 vols (London, 1843), I, pp. 493&#8211;498.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had allotted this evening to dissect old Barbablao &#8211; &amp; am sorry the second edition should have arrived before the first was so noticed. but I had no suspicion
                    that you designed to reprint it in the Iris.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Taylor had printed his poem on Bluebeard (&#8216;Barbablao&#8217;) in the newspaper he edited,
                            <title>The Iris; or, Norwich and Norfolk Weekly Advertiser</title>, on 17 March 1804. A revised edition appeared three weeks later. It was later published in the
                            <title>Monthly Magazine</title>, 38 (1814), 437&#8211;440.</note> What you say of cheap editions is still more applicable to newspaper publication. for short poems it is the best
                    possible vehicle, &amp; those which stand the test may then safely be transferred to a more permanent paper.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Lines 7 &amp; 8 in the old copy are well omitted &#8211; but I miss the following couplet, which pleasd my ear &amp; tallied well with the story as you have represented
                    it. for the future <hi rend="ital">number the lines</hi> of such poems for the benefit of us critics. &#8211; The You know he was brother &amp; &#8211; comes clumsily in like the <hi rend="ital">you-knows</hi> in the opening of our old plays which always are addrest to the audience &amp; mean you do not know. &#8211; his will was <hi rend="ital">withstood</hi>.
                    is that word accurately used? surely withstand &amp; disobey are not synonimes. &#8211; The one line of Sister Anne which follows is not pleasantly &#8211; in fact not well &#8211; expressed &#8211; &amp;
                    methinks you have made Sister Anne too cool at the discovery &#8211; the <hi rend="ital">blood</hi> upon the key should alarm her suddenly. the couplet rhyming tomb &amp; doom is in its
                    close cramped &amp; crowded. The tongue trips against it. &#8216;The key my loose powerless fingers forsook&#8217; a lame &amp; expletive way of saying I dropt the key. Now come two words
                    coupled either of which, in that place, <del>xxx xxx</del> I should have feard to use &#8211; <hi rend="ital">shy stare</hi> &#8211; &amp; both together I believe will strike every reader as
                    very uncouth &amp; disagreable. &#8216;&#8216;on a peg of black wood&#8217;&#8217;. needless for <hi rend="ital">hung up</hi> is enough, &amp; worse than merely expletive by presenting an image too
                    definite &amp; too trivial. the next lines are very good had they been related by the Poet &#8211; but <del>not</del> altogether undramatic. the word <hi rend="ital">clung</hi> I do not
                    understand &#8211; &amp; the exquisite <hi rend="ital">touch</hi> is too technical a phrase &#8211; nor could M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Bluebeard be so little terrified as to recognize any
                    likeness to the statue. Of the Heads speech I object to nothing but the way in which she expresses her decollation, which is too roundabout. The two first lines of Annes next
                    speech very clumsy. indeed the whole paragraph appears to me incorrigible. The brothers speech is again too poetical for the occasion.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I now come to some smooth sailing &#8211; <hi rend="ital">build remission</hi> being the next objectionable phrase. then they applaud the sound of the horn when they ought
                    to have dreaded it &#8211; &amp; to have turnd pale. And prattling <hi rend="ital">prolongs every gift of the fire</hi> &#8211; I can affix no meaning to this. <hi rend="ital">all</hi> &#8211; too
                    plainly for the rhyme &#8211; Bluebeard is also too loquacious &amp; too poetical in sudden passion. My decision has never been sympathys fool &#8211; this I do not like &#8211; it means he be not
                    mislead by <hi rend="ital">com</hi>passion when <hi rend="ital">passion</hi> is what the sentence requires. <hi rend="ital">framed to confine the couch</hi> &#8211; awkward. &amp; that
                    vile word <hi rend="ital">spar</hi>! which is damned <del>by</del> the slang of pugilists. Say <hi rend="ital">And</hi> Sion instead of <hi rend="ital">Even</hi> &#8211; for it more
                    rapidly combines the thought &amp; more flowingly fills the sentence. You have given too much attachment to the horse &#8211; it is impossible &#8211; you have raised him to the rank which the
                    Dog holds &#8211; &amp; I suspect there are many degrees of transmigration before the soul <del>xxxxx</del> ascends from one to the other. <hi rend="ital">parry</hi> is too <hi rend="ital">fencing</hi> a phrase. <hi rend="ital">scrape</hi> too slow a one. nor do I recollect any precedent for making them stamp like sheep who threaten &#8211; or for setting
                    the Knight swearing. His armour big gushes &amp;c &#8211; another line of lame expression.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> And now having culled the weeds I come to the story. you have hurt it by lessening the atrocity of Bluebeard, who seems, bating his dealings with the Devil, to have
                    been as good as Knight need be. There is too a most incongruous mixture of &lt;the&gt; modern <del>xxxxx</del> &amp; the legendary. Sister Anne we must have &#8211; but why Eliza &#8211; so
                    modern a name as not to be fifty years old in English? &amp; in her dress the language &amp; &#8211; also the looking glasses are all modern. This surprizes me in <del>xxx</del> you, who
                    struck the right key with so unerring a hand in Ellenore!<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> In fine you will see that in spite of all the fine lines which are not particularized &amp; in spite of the general power which pervades it the poem does not please
                    me. In all legendary tales I require the absence of all ideas &amp; phraseology which are manifestly modern &amp; force upon me the anachronism. In all dramatic writing or dialogue
                    I require brevity &amp; the breaks of passion &amp; the plainness <del>of</del>, in all, narrative rapidity &#8211; &amp; that it be so perspicacious as to be instantaneously understood.
                    &#8211; If I had given you the more recondite &amp; metaphysical feelings which make me object to the passages here noted as faulty &#8211; you would form some judgement of the care with which
                    I reject in writing. for it is a bad symptom that I am now as solicitous to wound faults as I once was to produce beauties: But again of Bluebeard &#8211; I believe a shorter line is
                    better for narration &#8211; &amp; wish you had modelled the story upon the old metrical Romances, for which I have a true veneration. &#8211; Cinderella is far better <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Taylor&#8217;s poetical version of &#8216;Cinderella&#8217;, which had initially appeared in the <title>Iris</title>, 21 January 1804, was also published in the

                        reputation for irreligious views, arrogant irritability and personal immorality. Pinkerton believed the Celts were incapable of rising to high levels of civilisation and sought
                        to prove that Scottish place names were not of Celtic origin: he wished to trace the Scottish people to the ancient Goths and to purge Scottish culture of Celticism. Pinkerton
                        criticised Sharon Turner for treating, in his <title>History of the Anglo-Saxons</title> (1799&#8211;1805), recently-published Welsh poems as historical documents detailing real
                        events of the sixth century. Pinkerton assumed them to be forgeries. Turner replied to Pinkerton&#8217;s critique in his <title>Vindication of the Genuineness of the Ancient British
