        <p rend="indent1"> How far this vile headache will let me write I know not &#8211; but I have begun in the hope that employment may at least
                    take off my attention from it. &#8211; the proofs look excellently well.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Of Southey&#8217;s and
                        Bedford&#8217;s jointly-compiled anthology <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title> (1807).</note> there is not too much
                    from any writer, &#8211; &amp; all that you &lt;have&gt; said is well-said &amp; well-thought. It will be a good book. It is so
                    impossible to draw any line of exclusion that I am clearly of opinion we should insert specimens of every rhymester, &#8211; where there
                    is no biography comeatable &#8211; say merely, &#8216;he published Poems &amp;c &#8211;&#8217; &amp; arrange them according to the date of the volume. My
                    own notices were collected from Andersons Poets, &amp; Cibbers Lives of the Poets . . the less known from Isaac Reids Biog.
                    Dramatica &amp; the European Magazine, of which a duplicate series happened to be in the house.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s sources were: Robert Anderson (1750&#8211;1830; <title>DNB</title>), ed., <title>The Works of the British
                            Poets</title>, <title>with Prefaces Biographical and Critical</title> (1792&#8211;1807); Colley Cibber (1671&#8211;1757;

                        Isaac Reed (1742&#8211;1807; <title>DNB</title>), ed., <title>Biographia Dramatica, or, a Companion to the Playhouse</title>,
                        (1782); the <title>European Magazine</title> of which Reid was proprietor.</note> the Obituary in the Gentlemans Magazine
                    would doubtless furnish matter, &#8211; so perhaps might the early volumes of the Monthly Review &#8211; at least I remember to have seen a
                    quotation in that Review from the poem of <del>an</del> a common soldier, for which they referred to one of their first volumes,
                    &amp; which I thought very beautiful.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Saturday. &#8211; I left off &amp; went to bed, sorely indisposed. the truth is that our May is like a West country
                    March. the worst month in the year. my constitution was made for a better climate, &amp; for this last fortnight I have been so
                    unwell as to be unfit for doing any thing. &#8211; These sheets I suppose are proofs &#8211; that is they were struck off before you had
                    corrected the press. this did not occur to me yesterday. I took them for corrected sheets but as the blunders thickened upon
                    inspection I see how it is. &#8211; There is another reason for inserting every body, &#8211; the more obscure names we collect, the more
                    curious will the book be for the Collectors &amp; in itself. the Specimens may be as short as you will in bad cases but if they
                    cannot be quite comprised in a single page &#8211; it is better to lengthen them a little than to leave so much <hi rend="ital">fat</hi>
                    as at P. 66. You will soon be able to regulate the length of the Specimens by the size of the volumes, which should be about 450
                    pages each &#8211; not more &#8211; to correspond with <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis&#8217;s</ref>.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Specimens</title> were modelled on George Ellis, <title>Specimens of the Early English
