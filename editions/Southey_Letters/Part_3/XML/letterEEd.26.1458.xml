          <salute>My dear Sir</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> By this <del>x</del> days post I have received a letter from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sotheby.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Sotheby (1757&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), the poet and translator, had been considering
                        renting the Peacheys&#8217; summer residence on Derwent Isle, Derwentwater.</note> The offer of so delightful a summer residence
                    tempted him, he says, hugely, &#8211; &amp; he seems to have taken a long while before he could resolve to say that circumstances forced
                    him not to avail himself of an offer so peculiarly grateful to him. Of course had I heard sooner from him, you should have heard
                    sooner from me. &#8211; I like his society well, &#8211; he is an able, very well informed, &amp; very judicious man; &#8211; but I am desired to
                    tell <ref target="people.html#PeachyEmma">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Peachy</ref> that the inhabitants of <ref target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref> are not disposed to like any faces upon the Island so well as those which they
                    have been accustomed to see there; &amp; if the Sothebys had come there, I should very often have wished for that band of dumb
                    musicians, who, in the absence of that incomparable leader <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</ref>, were
                    pleased to be under the directions of so <del>poor a per</del> &lt;<del>&amp; xxx</del> humble&gt; a performer as myself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am less inclined to pity your disappointment than that of the Officer with whom you were to have exchanged. You
                    know I am no admirer of Ireland, or rather of the Irish. And it is the last country in the world in which (according to my
                    feelings) an Englishman would like to live in <del>p</del> time of peace, or to serve during actual war. During actual war, which
                    is very likely to happen there, &#8211; if he took prisoners he would have to hang them after the battle; &#8211; &amp; if were taken himself,
                    it is likely enough that he might be served like poor Cookes of Trinity, &#8211; who was tied between two planks &amp; thrown into a
                    fire. You know my sentiments about Catholick emancipation &amp; indeed about granting any further indulgence to the Catholicks.
                    Those sentiments are not likely to make me look unfavourably upon the conduct of the present ministry towards Ireland. But I must
                    say that if they wished to insult the Irish Catholicks in the most wanton manner, &amp; to drive them into rebellion, they could
                    not have taken more effectual means <del>for xxxxx</del> than by appointing D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Duigenan<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Patrick Duigenan (1735&#8211;1816; <title>DNB</title>), Irish lawyer and politician who strongly
                        opposed Catholic emancipation.</note> Privy-counsellor.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> See what circumstantial evidence is good for in such cases as Don Manuel<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807).</note> &#8211; I never made

          <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Joanna Southcott, the self-proclaimed prophet, grew up and began her mission near Exeter, Devon, where Southey stayed, working
                        in the cathedral library in autumn 1799.</note> at Exeter, for this sufficient reason; that when I was at Exeter I had never
                    heard of her. My information was collected in Staffordshire, first, but afterwards from about fifty shillings worth of her works,
                    &#8211; a part of which you may have noticed on my shelves thus lettered on the back Quant: suff: of Joanna Southcote. The three volumes
                    however did not prove to be Quant: suff: &amp; I sent for a farther cargo. The whole rubbish will soon disappear &#8211; a friend of
                    mine near London is curious to possess the collection, &amp; as I have raked the dunghill, it is now at his service, &amp; will be
                    sent off to him in a few days.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The friend was <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Richard Duppa</ref>; see Southey to Richard Duppa, 11 July 1808, Letter 1477.</note> &#8211; Certainly if I had known any thing
                    of the woman when at Exeter I should not have been contented with mere enquiries, but would have gone to her, seen the Pythoness
                    herself, &amp; heard her oracles delivered &#8211; In London I could not visit her, after having spoken so decidedly upon the subject &#8211;
                    because one of her four &amp; twenty elders happened to be my poor old acquaintance <ref target="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">William Owen</ref>, author of the Welsh Dictionary; &amp; the great repository of all Bardic lore. All this excellent mans
                    time is given up to this crazy beldame, &#8211; I should most probably have met him at her house, &amp; had no inclination to expose
                    myself to the vituperative eloquence of one, who according to her own minutes of the conference fairly &#8216;down-argued&#8217; the Devil [MS
