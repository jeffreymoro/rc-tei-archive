        <p rend="indent1"> I have been writing an account of Methodism for the Annual Review,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey
                        reviewed William Myles (1756&#8211;1828), <title>A Chronological History of the People Called Methodists ... With an Appendix,
                            Containing Two Lists of the Itinerant Preachers ... With the Last Will and Testament of the Rev. J. Wesley</title> (1803)

                    Indeed it almost tempted me to extend the thing to a pamphlet &amp; publish it under some nom de guerre with a dedication to the
                        Archbishop of Canterbury, &amp; if <ref target="people.html#AikinArthur">A
                        Aikin</ref> should object to it as too pamphleteering for his work I have desired him to return it for that purpose. the
                    danger is of far greater extent than you are aware. they are literally &amp; precisely speaking, an Ecclesiastical Corresponding
                    Society &#8211; a set of United Methodists. they have a system of confession more fatal in its moral consequences than the Popish, &amp;
                    they have increased above 38,000 in the last ten years. I speak on the authority of one of their own writers. My aim has been to
                    blow the trumpet &amp; to turn alarmist, but if I ever enlarge upon the subject I should enter into the state of the Church
                    Establishment also, &amp; use the probe &amp; the lancet with friendly severity.</p>
