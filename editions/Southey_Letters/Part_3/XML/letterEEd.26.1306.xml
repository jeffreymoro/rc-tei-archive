                        was the title of a 1786 play by John O&#8217;Keeffe (1747&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>); see <title>The Dramatic Works of John O&#8217;Keeffe

                        Henry Fielding&#8217;s (1707&#8211;1754; <title>DNB</title>) play <title>The Lottery</title> (1732).</note> &#8211; rather the next. &#8211; One of

                    (save what comes by the grey goose quill) has been an annuity of 160 &#163; which <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>
                    has given me &#8211; &amp; which I felt no unwillingness at accepting from one with whom I became intimate before we were either of
                        <del>xx</del> us old enough to think of any disparities of rank &amp; fortune. He however is not a rich man for his situation,
                    &#8211; &amp; I am very well pleased that there is no longer a necessity for acceptance. The taxes have the conscience to take 56 (I am
                    told) from this 200, &amp; the Exchequer is slow &amp; irregular in its payments. Well &#8211; a few more grey goose quills worn to the
                    stump in the course of the year. will make amends for that &#8211; &amp; I think Brazil<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The

                    income, &#8211; which will be better than eating my way. Upon this principle I have abstained from selling copyrights, &amp; have &lt;a
                    good deal&gt; of such floating property if so it may be called. I get on little by little one year better than another, &amp; best
                    of all &#8211; I am contented.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Whatever the Tantara-raras may do I hope they will not prevent you &amp; <ref target="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> R</ref> from travelling Northward this summer. You will see many reasons why I should be
                    satisfied with this abiding place, &amp; when the books are gathered together there will be no serious objection to it. I will
                    make a biennial journey to London, &amp; establish a line of acquaintance along the road, as regularly as a Rider &#8211; that is to say
                    as a Commercial Traveller according to the improved language of these politer days.</p>

                            Inhabitants</title> (1805). In the <title>New Annual Register for 1805</title>, 26 (1806), 323, the authority of the
                        publication was questioned on the grounds that the letters were not by Davie himself, but an anonymous friend who had spent a
                        very short time in the region.</note> must be a work of home manufactory, produced in all likelihood by some one who was privy
                    to Sir H. Pophams buccaneering schemes,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> In June 1806, with Spain, the colonial master of
                        South America, under French sway and Britain&#8217;s enemy, a force under Admiral Sir Home Riggs Popham (1762&#8211;1820;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and William Carr Beresford (1768&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>), occupied Buenos Aires and held it until
                        December. On 3 February 1807 the attack was renewed when the British took Montevideo from the sea. In July a British attempt
                        to retake Buenos Aires was repulsed with great loss of life.</note> &amp; wished to prepare the public for them. This I
                    strongly suspect from <del>almost</del> certain blunders in the book. He speaks of Jews at Buenos Ayres. I am <hi rend="ital">almost</hi> certain that no Jew can exist in a Spanish colony: &amp; of this Jews daughter in a convent &#8211; which is a plain
                    &amp; palpable absurdity.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> There were in fact &#8216;conversos&#8217; or secret Jews in Buenos Aires,
                        who had emigrated there to escape the Inquisition in Spain.</note> Besides the country which he says he visited as belonging
                    to Spain, is annexed to Brazil. These I think are fatal flaws. &#8211; All the information which the book contains (except what relates
                    to political events) might be collected from the little volumes of Muratori upon the Jesuit Establishments &#8211; of which you will
                    find an English Catholick version lying at bookstalls for two shillings.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lodovico Antonio

                        (1752), translated as <title>A Relation of the Missions of Paraguay: Wrote Originally in Italian, by Mr. Muratori</title>
                        (1759).</note> The political matter rests only upon the authority of the book &#8211; &amp; of course is fabulous. This is
                    vexatious, for it would there be valuable. I bought the volume, &amp; am provoked at the trick, &amp; at the reviews for not
                    discovering it. There was a suspicion thrown out by somebody in the Annual, but not upon these grounds.</p>
