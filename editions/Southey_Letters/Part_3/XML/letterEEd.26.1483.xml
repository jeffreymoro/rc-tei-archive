                        Lake,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Derwentwater.</note> &amp; after which goes down again. Five years have I been
                    expecting this appearance, &amp; now, sure enough, it is above water. It may stay there for some weeks, &amp; some times six or
                    eight, – it may already have sunk. But <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy </ref><hi rend="ital"> ought</hi> to put himself in the first mail coach, – &amp; perhaps curiosity may induce you to expedite your
                    journey for the sake of seeing the oddest thing you are ever likely to see.</p><p rend="indent1"> How it is effected is for <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> to discover, but as much of the bottom
                    of the Lake as is equal to the area of your house, has been forced up to the surface, in <del>about</del> several pieces; – &amp;
                    in other parts you can plainly see that there are rents in the bottom where parts have sunk in, for it is not in a deep part of
                    the Lake. The gas which follows the immersion of a pole stinks. &amp; over one part of the water a thin steam was plainly
                    discernable when I was there. As no person <del>xxx</del> was present when it rose we cannot tell whether it was accompanied with
                    any great agitation of the water, or any noise, – but the noise if any, cannot have been very great, or it would have been heard
                        <del>xxxx</del> here. It is possible that the cause <del>xx</del> may have some connection with the sulphureous springs in the
                    neighbourhood, – almost certain that it is the same which occasions our bottom winds.</p><p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your explanation of <hi rend="ital">fuste</hi>, which I believe to be the true one. – Azagay which
                    you point out in Bizobequius<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> A. C. Busbequius (1522–1592), <title>Travels into Turkey

                    African word, &amp; means the true javelin, – those which were used in sport had a different name. My notes are drawing to a
                    close, – I could have lengthened them to almost any extent, &amp; am always tempted to make as many again as can be used, – this
                    is the idlest of all kinds of industry, &amp; the most amusing. You see I have traced our title of Commodore to its origin,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> On p. 403 of his edition of the <title>Chroncile of the Cid</title> (London, 1808), Southey
                        cites a passage giving an early derivation from medieval Catalan law, from Pere Tomich, <title>Historias e conquestas dels
                            excellentissims e Catholics Reys de Arago: e de lurs antecessors los Comtes de Barçelona</title> (Barcelona, 1534), c.
                        32, ff. 24.</note> if not to its meaning, &amp; given a good guess at the uncouth word Pentes Laares which has puzzled the
                        glossarists.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> On p. 415 of his edition of the <title>Cid</title>, Southey notes the use
                        of this term in fourteenth century Portugal and writes ‘<hi rend="ital">Pentes Laares</hi> is probably a barbarous compound of
                        the two words Penates and Lares. If it be remembered how many Roman superstitions were still in full use, it will not appear
                        improbable that some family idols were preserved as amulets; .. or perhaps the corrupted Pagan names applied to some of those
                        objects of Catholic idolatry which have supplied their place’.</note> The fact is that many Pagan superstitions prevailed till
                    a very late age in Portugal, – some were prohibited so late as 1383, &amp; I dare say some are to be found still in existence.</p><p rend="indent1"> A Portugueze sermon has just helped me to a discovery which will amuse you. Who was the first man that doubled the
                    Cape of Good Hope! – The prophet Jonah, – examine his track in the Whale &amp; this proves to be the case: &amp; you will observe
                    that this magnifies the miracle prodigiously, for what a passage he had from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulph!</p><p rend="indent1"> It appears from my books about Brazil that from 1620 or thereabout for many years the English made pertinacious
                    &amp; resolute attempts to establish themselves upon the River Amazon. – or more properly the River Orellana, as I mean to call
                    it. These were just after the time of Purchas,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Purchas (1575?-1626;
                            <title>DNB</title>), compiler of voyage and travel narratives, published <title>Purchas, his Pilgrimage; or, Relations of
                            the World and the Religions observed in all Ages</title> (1613) and <title>Purchas, his Pilgrim. Microcosmus, or the
                            histories of Man. Relating the wonders of his Generation, vanities in his Degeneration, Necessity of his
                            Regeneration</title> (1619). He is thought to have died in a debtor’s prison.</note> &amp; he poor fellow was too ill
                    rewarded for his labours to find a successor. From the Portugueze account little more than this general fact be collected, they
                    tell you of their own success, &amp; now &amp; then give you the name of an Englishman, which sometimes can be guessed at thro
                    their orthography &amp; sometimes not.</p><p rend="indent1"> My friends the Spaniards &amp; Port. are justifying the character which I have long given them, to the astonishment
                    of those who heard me. Bonaparte will I suppose pour in upon them with his whole force, – so let him. You know how little respect
                    I have for what is called the spirit of history, or the philosophy of history, by those people who want to have every thing given
                    them in extracts &amp; essences. – but the truth of the present history is that a great military despotism in its youth &amp; full
                    vigour like that of France will &amp; must beat down corrupt establishments &amp; worn-out governments, – but that it cannot beat
                    down a true love of liberty &amp; a true spirit of patriotism, – unless there be an overwhelming superiority of physical force,
                    which is not the case here. Bonaparte has one benefit more to confer upon the Spaniards – to put both their King &amp; their
                    Prince out of the way, – which I doubt not he will do. His work of destruction is not quite completed, I hoped &amp; expected to
                    have seen him destroy the House of Austria &amp; the Turkish Empire. two great evils which cumber the earth. He may perhaps turn
                    upon these as an excuse for leaving Spain alone, – but in Spain the fire has <del>broken</del> burst out which will consume. –
                    Well done my friend William Bryan the Prophet, you certainly did prophecy to me in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Stephen Court concerning
                        Spain,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had clearly met his old acquaintance the copperplate engraver and
                        religious visionary William Bryan (dates unknown) at Rickman’s home in St Stephen’s Court, Westminster, perhaps when visiting
                        in March 1808; Bryan was to send him an annotated copy of <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella.
                            Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807), which included sections on Bryan’s visit to the Société des Illuminés
                        d’Avignon, and on his subsequent relationship with the self-proclaimed prophet Richard Brothers (1757–1824;
