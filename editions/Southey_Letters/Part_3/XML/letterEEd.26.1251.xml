                        1552 was captured by the Tupinamb&#225; people of Brazil. Escaping to Europe in 1555, Staden published a German account of his
                        travels in 1557, claiming to have witnessed cannibalism. His narrative was translated into Latin and in 1593 was incorporated
                        in Theodor de Bry (1528&#8211;1598), <title>Collectiones peregrinatiorum in Indiam orientalem et Indiam occidentalem</title>

                    his name to have been) throws great light upon what had been done in the country. the state of the colonists, &amp; of the French

                    &amp; seperating this from the main narration, giving me plumbs &amp; suet &amp; flour seperately instead of a plumb pudding. At
                    the end of all these shall be a philosophical chapter concerning the nation. After Hans&#8217;s dismal history immediately the Jesuits
                    enter, &amp; the French are expelled, &amp; I see straight on to the entrance &amp; expulsion of the Dutch. After that the order
                    will be more difficult &#8211; but the clue will unravel when I get there then will be the Jesuit system to develope &#8211; extending to
                    Paraguay, the commercial growth of the country &#8211; the Mamalukes &amp; the discovery of the mines &amp; of the interior.</p>
