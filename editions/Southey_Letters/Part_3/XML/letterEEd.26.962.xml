        <p>Huntington
                        Library, HM 4875 .  Previously  published: John Warden Robberds (ed.), A Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Late
                            William Taylor of Norwich, 2 vols (London, 1843), I, pp. 515&#8211;518.Dating note: The letter is dated by
                        Robberds. The letter from Taylor to which Southey is replying is dated 6 July 1804, so Southey&#8217;s letter must have been written
                        after that date. Southey states here that Henry Southey &#8216;has made his appearance&#8217; and in his letter dated 30 July 1804 to
                        Thomas Southey, reports that &#8216;Harry is here &amp; has been here about three weeks&#8217;.</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>

                        after that date. Southey states here that Henry Southey &#8216;has made his appearance&#8217; and in his letter dated 30 July 1804 to
                        Thomas Southey, reports that &#8216;Harry is here &amp; has been here about three weeks&#8217;.</note>

                        Taylor, supports Southey&#8217;s thesis that the original author was Vasco de Lobeira (d. 1403) a troubador knighted after the

                        Scottish antiquarian and cartographer whose many publications earned him a reputation for irreligious views, arrogant
                        irritability and personal immorality. Pinkerton believed the Celts were incapable of rising to high levels of civilisation and
                        sought to prove that Scottish place names were not of Celtic origin: he wished to trace the Scottish people to the ancient
                        Goths and to purge Scottish culture of Celticism. Turner replied to Pinkerton&#8217;s critique in 1803, in his <title>Vindication of
