                        Wordsworth&#8217;s ship was sunk on 5 February 1805. Southey says in his letter to Wynn dated &#8216;Saturday&#8217; [9 February 1805] that he
                        has just heard &#8216;this evening&#8217; about the shipwreck, so this letter must have been written shortly after that date, when Southey
                        had heard that Wordsworth knew of the tragedy. Wordsworth replied to Southey&#8217;s letter on 12 February 1805, inviting him to
                        come to his house.</note>

                        wounded. Southey had suspected that Thomas was among the dead, having read in the newspapers that the first lieutenant had
                        been killed. Thomas had been placed under arrest, and was subsequently court-martialled. Lieutenant Charles Hayman (d. 1804),
