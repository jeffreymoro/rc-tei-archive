                    much I thought it best to do &#8211; so I have sent off 64 &#189; yards &#8211; being 13 &#189; more than my commission, &#8211; but this I know be enough for
                    the wing bed-room, &#8211;- or you may now carpet the parlour &amp; cut up the study-carpet for yours &amp; the spare-room, &#8211; just as

                    knife. Will you believe it &#8211; I can neither get nine pins nor map of England here! &#8211; these however I have no doubt of finding at

                        reviewed this work in the <title>Annual Review for 1808</title>, 7 (1809), 224&#8211;235. Zouch married his second wife, Margaret
                        Brooke (1743&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), in 1808.</note> with whom we dined yesterday, was a bride last year after a courtship
                    of five &amp; forty years, &#8211; &amp; she talked to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">Mary</ref> about the awkwardness
