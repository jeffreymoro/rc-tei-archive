                        disputes with Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh and 2nd Marquess of Londonderry (1769&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>) led to a
                        plan to expel Castlereagh from the War Office, and when Castlereagh discovered the plan he challenged Canning to a duel. This
                        took place on 21 September 1809, and though both men survived, but there was much public outrage over their behaviour.</note>
