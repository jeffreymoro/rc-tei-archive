                    necessity for writing such things &#8211; there was also a great fitness &#8211; inasmuch as by so doing a facility &amp; variety of style was

                    Europeans were to be found in the East. for the Neguz was never without some straggler or other. Still more that <del>the Eu</del>
                    in Europe<del>an</del> such idle dreams about Ethiopia should prevail when Abyssinians so often found their way to Rome. The
