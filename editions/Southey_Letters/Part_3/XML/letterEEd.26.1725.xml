                        he fled to New England and died there under an assumed name. Southey was sufficiently expressed by Goffe&#8217;s story to make it
                        the basis of his unfinished colonial epic <title>Oliver Newman</title>, which he bagan drafting in 1814. It was published

                        Elliott&#8217;s unrealised plan for a poem on the British conquest of Canada in 1759&#8211;1763. Southey had previously expressed his
                        interest in this project; see Southey to Ebenezer Elliott, 13 October 1808 (Letter 1519) and 22 November 1809 (Letter 1711).
                        See also Southey to Ebenezer Elliott, 9 February 1810 (Letter 1743) and 1 August 1810 (Letter 1796), <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>.</note> In
                    the first place it will not sell. Depend upon it that unless a poem has the good luck to become fashionable (upon which the writer
                    has no more reason to calculate than <del>x</del> upon a prize in the lottery) &#8211; there are not twenty copies which sell out of the
                    circle of the authors immediate friends, &amp; very few even of those become purchasers. Of the many volumes of poetry which are
                    published every year there is not one in a score which pays the printers bill. Unless you get a bookseller to take the risk of the
                    work (which it is not likely that you will do) you must lay your account at losing seven eighths of what the publication will
                    cost. This is not all. If the Reviews do not treat you with insolence, they will with neglect; &#8211; it is the <del>x</del> humour of
                    these evil days. You will be dismissed with half a dozen contemptuous lines in the monthly catalogue, &#8211; or if they make you of
                    more consequence, it will only be for the malicious purpose<del>s</del> of displaying their talent at sarcasm. In either case your
                    feelings will be wounded, &amp; perhaps, which is far worse, your heart discouraged. These will be the present inconveniences,
                    &amp; hereafter, even if you escaped from these, you will regret the publication as premature. For I am firmly persuaded that you
                    will accomplish things so much better than the Soldiers Love that you yourself will one day be the last person to acknowledge the
                    merit which it displays. &#8211; so strongly will you perceive its defects. I am advising you from my own experience, &amp; that of
                        <del>xxxx</del> other persons with whose literary history I am well acquainted, &#8211; &amp; this is the uniform &amp; unavoidable
                    consequence of premature publication.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Madoc is perhaps too severely written. Your nature leads you to a more ambitious style &amp; you will do well to
                    follow it, &#8211; but beware of amplifying too much. &amp; do not let the path of your narration be hid by the flowers which you
                    scatter as you go on. Always remember too that whenever your subject reaches the height of passion &#8211; all thoughts of ornamenting
                    it must be laid aside. You must then trust to the passion itself, &#8211; as painters when they want to express exertion delineate the
                    naked <del>xxxxx</del> muscles.</p>
