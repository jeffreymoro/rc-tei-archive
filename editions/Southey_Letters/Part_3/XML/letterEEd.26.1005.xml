                        of the Speaker of the House of Commons, <ref target="people.html#AbbotCharles">Charles Abbott</ref>, which Rickman was able,
                    as a civil servant in the Speaker&#8217;s office, to use on Southey&#8217;s behalf. Southey referred to Abbott jokily as &#8216;Emperor of the Franks&#8217;, hence here the reference to the &#8216;Frank imperial&#8217;.</note> reached me last night at the same time with a
                    letter from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> of rather a vexatious nature. He has been tried by a Court Martial for
                    disobedience of orders, neglect of duty &amp; insolence to his Captain.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Captain (later

                    were not proved, the last was. that is it was proved by a Black Servant who overheard the conversation from the Quarter Gallery
                    unseen by my brother, that when the Captain accused him of being off deck &amp;c he replied &#8216;I beg your pardon Sir I must
                    contradict you&#8217;. &#8211; for this he is sentenced to be dismissed the Ship. &#8211; He writes from Barbadoes having that morning breakfasted
                    with Commodore Hood,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Commodore (later Vice-Admiral) Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet
                        (1762&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), in command of the fleet in which Thomas Southey served.</note> to whom he had applied for an
                    appointment. The Commodore very properly replied, &#8216;He could not do that till he had seen the Minutes of the Trial which had not
                    reached him only the sentence having arrived, &amp; he must not prejudge the case. If however he chose to wait till the Minutes
                    came he would let him know.&#8217; &#8211; This was unlucky as the Emerald frigate sailed for England next day, &amp; no other Kings ship will
                    offer till April. However <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> could not but stay, for the Minutes will be far more in
                    his favour than the sentence, &#8211; &amp; the Commodore knows that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> was a favourite of
                    his brothers, &amp; in the action with him when he fell.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Captain Alexander Hood
                        (1758&#8211;1798): on 2 April Hood died of a wound to the thigh sustained when his ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Mars</hi> engaged the
                        French ship <hi rend="ital">Hercule</hi> off the coast of Brittany. Nearly 400 men, and both captains, died in the fight;
                        Thomas, on board the <hi rend="ital">Mars</hi>, was wounded.</note> When he wrote he was worth 200 dollars which with economy
                    would last him six weeks &#8211; so enormously dear is every thing there &#8211; &amp; before that the Minutes would arrive. his letter is
                        <del>eight</del> 9 weeks old &#8211; so that he is either penniless or provided for. I wrote of course directly telling him to draw
                    on me thro <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> for thirty pounds. little as that is it may rub off a debt &amp;
                    set him fairly afloat if he gets another ship. &#8211;That he has been in the right I have little doubt. &amp; as little doubt that his
                    fortunes will suffer for it. However there is no evil without some good. he being under arrest could not go in the boats, &amp;
                    the Lieutenant who did go received the ball which might else have borne a billet for him.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Thomas Southey&#8217;s ship, HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi>, a fifth-rate 32-gun frigate, had, on 14 August 1804, made an
                        unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer <hi rend="ital">General Ernouf</hi> (formerly the British sloop of war
                            <hi rend="ital">Lilly</hi>) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission 65 were killed or
