                        Charles Danvers, 28 July 1807, Letter 1347.</note> The Mars I can get framed here, &#8211; but the other can only be varnished in a
                    large town like Bristol. It should by waggon in a case made on purpose. &#8211; I wish Danvers I could think all this was <hi rend="ital">chearfully</hi> done by you; &#8211; that belief would make my pen flow more pleasantly. Yet <hi rend="ital">I
                        think</hi> you must have seen the weight of the reasons which induce me to stay here. As for the Coleridges, &#8211; (if it be a
                    secret at Bristol as perhaps it may &#8211; you will still keep it so &#8211;) <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> is
                    going to take the two boys<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    &amp; if they settle in this country &#8211; so long as they stay there <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
                        C</ref> with <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara</ref> will remain in this house &#8211; to which &#8211; <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</ref> being got rid of (who is by no means an amiable child) I have no objection
                    weighty enough to counterbalance the infinite desirableness of such an arrangement for her. If I had not remained here <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> has so little regard to common decency of appearances that he would have
                    brought the Wordsworths here, &amp; his wife must have removed; &#8211; that is if <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> (who tho <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C</ref> does not know of it, abominates that family
                    for their systematic selfishness) would <del>xxx</del> have permitted it, which he says flatly to me he would not. This affair is
                    not in consequence of any disagreement, <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> has been brooding over it during
                    his absence, &amp; for the three months that he went visiting about before he came home, &#8211; &amp; this was the purpose with which
                    he returned to his family. For her it is a very happy thing, for not only his habits are destructive to all comfort, &#8211; but &#8211; what
                    I should once never have thought possible, his temper has become so too: &amp; as the thing is done with systematic civility,
                    &amp; they are to continue the best friends in the world &#8211; I think it the wisest thing they can do <del>xxx xxx</del> things being
                    as they are, tho that they are as they are, I consider, as I have told him, as his own fault. I hope it will prevent him from
                    declaring every where in favour of easy divorces in the mischievous way he does, which has grievously provoked <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>. When men of such mighty powers always shift their systems to <del>their</del>
                    suit their own individual inclinations the mischief they do is very great; &#8211; &amp; perhaps <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</ref> will be sensible when he has &lt;openly&gt; divorced himself, that every
                    person must feel this to be his case.</p>
