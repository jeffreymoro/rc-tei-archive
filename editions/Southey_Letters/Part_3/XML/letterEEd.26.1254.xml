                        Herbert Hill&#8217;s request, to begin a history of Brazil, using papers sent him by Hill and stored by Rickman; see Southey to John
                        Rickman, 23 December 1806, Letter 1247. Southey had asked Wynn to use his position as Under Secretary of State in the Home
                        Office to ascertain whether the government might provide him support during the preparation of a work likely to provide it
                        with useful information in the new political situation.</note> I am very glad that Government does not require any previous
                    summary &#8211; as it would have interrupted me. &#8211; a good deal however of what those papers contain will be found to have a very
                    important relation to the Spanish as well as Portugueze <del>domains</del> territories.</p>
