                        Barker From 1800 to 1826&#8217; (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 151&#8211;154.<lb />Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.),

        <p rend="indent1"> If I do not answer a letter as soon as it is received &#8211; it is likely to remain long unanswered &#8211; &amp; that is the
                    history of my long silence. Just as the thing is fresh there is a disposition to talk in reply, &#8211; but if this be suffered to go
                    off &#8211; the whole evaporates like the life of a glass of bottled ale &#8211; Besides be pleased always to take it for granted when you do
                    not hear from us that all is going on well, &amp; just as usual. Any calamity &#8211; any good fortune &#8211; if an earthquake were to shake
                    down the house &#8211; or the sky were to fall &#8211; the tidings would reach you quite soon enough.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have [three line deletion] it came into my head to say this because [three line deletion].</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Should <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my little girl</ref> live, which God knows is of all dreams the
                    one which I least venture to indulge &#8211; I mean that she shall be taught to draw &#8211; chiefly I hope by your Senhoraship &#8211; as soon as
                    she can hold a pencil. &amp; I mean to make it subservient to useful purposes. for instance I will have the whole history of a
                    tree in a series of drawings. &#8211; the first appearance of the seed above ground &#8211; &amp; so on thru all its stages &#8211; the various
                    appearances of its foliage from the first bud to the fall &#8211; its flower &#8211; fruit &amp;c &#8211; &amp; thus thro all the English trees. &#8211;
                    But I will talk of something else &#8211; for to lay up hopes is to lay up evil for oneself if they be frustrated.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My great book<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Madoc</title>, which was published in a luxury quarto, costing 2 guineas, in April 1805.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> tells me is almost as universally admired as he could wish, &amp; that he says
                    so is as much as I can desire. The great admirers of Thalaba<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem,
                            <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title>, published in 1801.</note> will probably prefer Thalaba, &#8211; the difference is as
                    between the Tempest &amp; the Coriolanus or the Timon.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Plays by Shakespeare: <title>The
                            Tempest</title>, <title>Coriolanus</title> and <title>Timon of Athens</title>.</note> The one poem relates to fancy; the
                    other to human character. I have just been saying in another letter that Madoc looks as if I were grown old before my time &#8211; the
                    tone of thought &amp; feeling is so sober, &amp; the whole colouring so like that of an evening sunshine. but the whole character
                    was given it before Thalaba was written, &#8211; it was <hi rend="ital">pitched</hi> seven years ago.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> On the protracted genesis and rewriting of <title>Madoc</title> see <title>Robert Southey: Poetical Works

                    may, my monument is made. Senhora that I shall one day have a monument in St Pauls<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> There

                    say to every body &#8211; but it was a strange feeling which I had when I was last in St Pauls &amp; thought so. How think you shall I
                    look in marble? they will wrap me I suppose in some outlandish dress &#8211; such as <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
                    would not let me wear, &amp; indeed such as I should not chuse to wear in this cold climate. but if my own opinion may be taken I
                    beg leave to inform posterity that I am at this present drest in corderoy pantaloons &#8211; a waistcoat after the fashion of the year
                    of our Lord 1804. &amp; a brown jacket &#8211; which once was a brown coat. all which I should like better than a fancy dress &#8211; tho
                    perhaps trousers which I wear quite as often are better than tighter cloathing. I am never for sacrificing <hi rend="ital">costume</hi> to <hi rend="ital">beauty</hi>. Whoever should paint Queen Elizabeth<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
