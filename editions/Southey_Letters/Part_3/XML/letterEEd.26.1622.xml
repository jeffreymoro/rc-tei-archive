                    &#8211; but he is still in a state to make me very anxious, &#8211; pale with loss of blood, his neck blistered, &#8211; &amp; fevered by the
                    fretfulness the blister occasions. The poor child has been so used to have me for his play fellow, &#8211; that he will have me for his
                    nurse, &#8211; &amp; you may imagine with what feelings I endeavour to amuse him. But thank God he is living &amp; likely to live &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Almost the only wish I ever gave utterance to is that the next hundred years were over. It is not that the uses of

                    lot. &#8211; my paths are paths of pleasantness. I am living happily &amp; to the best of my belief fulfilling as far I am able the
                    purpose for which I was created. Still the instability of human happiness is ever before my eyes, &#8211; I long for the certain &amp;
                    the permanent &amp; perhaps my happiest moments are those when I am looking on to another state of being, in which there shall be
                    no other change than that of progression in knowledge &amp; thereby in power &amp; enjoyment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have suffered some sorrow in my time &amp; expect to suffer much more, &#8211; but looking at my own heart, I do not

                    are <hi rend="ital">dezy</hi> naughty &#8211; when I hold his hands while his neck is drest &#8211; I have as deep a conviction that whatever
                    affliction I have ever endured, or yet have to endure is dispensed to me in mercy &amp; in love, &#8211; as he will have of my motives
                    for inflicting pain upon him now &#8211; if it should please God that he should live to understand them.</p>

                        Commander in Chief of the army. He held the post from 1798&#8211;1809, but was forced to resign in the wake of allegations that he
                        had profited by allowing his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>), to accept money from army
                        officers, in return for which promotion was arranged. In May 1811 the Prince Regent reinstated his brother as
                        Commander-in-Chief of the army, a post which he held for the rest of his life.</note> I do not believe it. I think ill enough
                    of both to believe that they have no principle which would stand in the way, &#8211; but heartily as I despise their talents, I do not
                    think them quite so weak as to take that step.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is three months before the third Quarterly will appear, &amp; by that time present topics will have become
                    stale, &#8211; but I wish you would let <ref target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> know that if the subject is not out of
                    time &amp; it be thought fit to <del>do</del> &lt;notice&gt; it I will right zealously &amp; sincerely undertake a justification
                    of <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Freres</ref> conduct, which we in this part of the country do entirely approve.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The diplomat John Hookham Frere was sent to Spain as minister-plenipotentiary to the Central
                        Junta on 4 October 1808 and when the French marched on Madrid he urged Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), the
                        Commander of the British forces in northern Spain to also advance upon Madrid, despite his inclination to retreat through
                        Portugal. After the disastrous retreat to Corunna, Frere was blamed for this advice and recalled by the British government.
                        After some of Frere&#8217;s and Moore&#8217;s correspondence was read out in the Commons on 27 April, Moore&#8217;s side of matters was
                        presented in James Moore (1763&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Narrative of the Campaign of the British Army in Spain,
                            Commanded by His Excellency Sir John Moore. Authenticated by Official Papers and Original Letters</title> (1809). Frere&#8217;s
                        correspondence with Moore was published in 1810 in a work entitled <title>To the British Nation is Presented by Colonel
                            Venault de Charmilly, Knight of the Royal and Military Order of St. Louis, the Narrative of his Transactions in Spain with
                            the Rt. Hon. Hookham Frere, His Britannic Majesty&#8217;s Minister Plenipotentiary, and Lt. Gen. Sir John Moore, K.B. Commander
                            of the British Forces: with the Suppressed Correspondence of Sir J. Moore: Being a Refutation of the Calumnies Invented
                            Against Him, and Proving that He was Never Acquainted with General Morla</title>.</note> I need not tell you this is not
