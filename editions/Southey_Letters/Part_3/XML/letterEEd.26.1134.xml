                            <title>DNB</title>), banker and head of the successful company Coutts &amp; Co.</note> by this post. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We have had miserably cold weather here. I have been groaning for Portuguese sunshine &amp; rejoicing to think that
                    I am likely to enjoy it next December.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s projected visit to Portugal never took
                        place.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My notes when they are not of sober complection, are made in the quaintness of my heart &amp; what I call quaint
                    may doubtless by others be called pert or impertinent. The only question is whether they offend more persons than they please &#8211;
                    for certain it is that what pleases one offends another. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> used to
                    beseech me not to put them at the bottom of the page, for he said he could not help laughing. But to say this was to praise the
                    notes, &amp; by putting them at the end I thought all objection obviated. However it is a thing to be considered. I had designed
                    to give a statement of the evidence with <ref target="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">Owens</ref> help in the next edition.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>Madoc</title> (1805), for which he had already sought the assistance
                        of the Welsh antiquarian, William Owen Pughe.</note> The notes were very much abridged on account of the size of the book &#8211; in
                    reprinting there will be no objection &#8211; if any passage occur to you which would be the better for elucidation just mention them, &#8211;
                    a whole bundle of notes which were never used are on my shelf.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We are in daily &amp; anxious expectation of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref>
                        arrival.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coleridge had been acting as Public Secretary to the British Civil
                        Commissioner in Malta. Though due to return home, he did not arrive in England until August 1806.</note> He is coming over
                    land from Naples &#8211; &amp; would be at Vienna about the same time as the French. &#8211; so that I am more uneasy than I chuse to let <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C</ref>. know.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have not interest enough with London printers to get large paper copies for my own use. It was a privilege of
                    special favour from a country printer <del>x</del> to whom my business was of <del>xxxx</del> importance. In London they would
                    charge as much for striking off one copy in that size as for 250. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A Gentleman of the long robe in old times received forty broad pieces with a brief &#8211; he counted them over &amp; saw

                    then &#8211; pugnabo fiftiter &#8211; I find this in Sir Roger L&#8217;Estrange.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The anecdote, with its
                        Latin/English pun, appears in Roger L&#8217;Estrange (1616&#8211;1704; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Fables Of Aesop And Other Eminent

        <p rend="indent1"> To improve Madoc I ought to read Giraldus &#8211; as well the <del>xxxx</del> MSS as the printed works.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Giraldus Cambrensis (c. 1146&#8211; c. 1223; <title>DNB</title>), or Gerald of Wales, produced poems,
                        letters, lives of the saints, polemical works and treatises, amounting to about ten volumes in modern printed editions. The
                        works Southey was most interested in for writing <title>Madoc</title> were: <title>Itinerarium Cambriae</title> (c.1191), and
                            <title>Descriptio Cambriae</title> (c.1194).</note> You Welshmen ought to give us a compleat edition with the old

                    these days &#8211; but Heaven knows when. &#8211; The great fault in the poem is the transfer of interest in the last part from Madoc to
                    Yuhidthiton. Would this be a better conclusion? <del>Tez</del> Tezozomoc encourages the kings idea of emigrating. he plots with
                    Thalala to cut off Madoc &amp; his chiefs at a conference, &#8211; meaning to kill Yuhidthiton also &#8211; but of this Thalala is ignorant.
                    The meeting takes place in an Islet on the Lake, so that <del>xxx</del> the people are spectators in boats &amp; can take no part.
                    At the moment when they are about to execute their design the King perceives it &amp; alarms Madoc &#8211; &amp; takes his side &#8211;
                    Thalala also saves the King &#8211; but Madoc is wounded in the arm, &amp; Tezozomac dying himself tells him exultingly that he must die
                    &#8211; for the weapon is poisoned. Madoc immediately heats his sword red hot upon the altar which has been prepared for the Aztecan
                    rites &#8211; &amp; cauterizes the wound. They then part in friendship &#8211; &amp; the immediate catastrophe remains the same &#8211; only Thalala
                    instead of finding his wife in Aztlan delivers her himself to Madoc.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> The poem ends with
                        Yuhidthiton, the remaining leader of the defeated and chastened Aztecas, leading his people into exile, rather than with
                        Madoc, the Welsh colonist, presiding over a new American civilisation. None of these proposed amendments were adopted in later
                        editions. On the history of the poem&#8217;s drafting and revision, see the editor&#8217;s introduction to volume II of <title>Robert

                            been sent to the disease-ridden Leeward Islands station, died on 6 August 1804 at Surinam, from yellow fever. Wynn had
