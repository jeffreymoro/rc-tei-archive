                    create. besides the legend is not Welsh &amp; will not coalesce with Welsh tradition &amp; Bardic philosophy. &#8211; I am afraid there

                        romance on this subject, but it was not until 1823 that he began drafting the verse, in collaboration with Caroline Bowles.
                        The poem remained unfinished, and was published posthumously as a fragment in an edition by Bowles: <title>Robin Hood: a
