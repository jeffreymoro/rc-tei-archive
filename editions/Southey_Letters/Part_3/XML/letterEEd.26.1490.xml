                    the whole materials before me as written to my brother at the time, or entered in my own memorandum books, they may certainly be
                    ready for the press in a few weeks, &amp; if printed in a small size, two volumes may be going on at once.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the event Longmans did not publish an entirely new work on Portugal, but, later in 1808, an updated

                    with prints, I thought that form the most profitable. You must know best, &amp; certainly, in other respects, the cheaper any work
