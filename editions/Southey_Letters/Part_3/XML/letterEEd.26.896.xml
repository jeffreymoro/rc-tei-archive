        <p rend="indent1">What think you of the capabilities here? When you come here I will get some Cumberland views from my neighbours that
                    will suit with little alteration my American landscapes, &amp; will procure books of natural history that you may get the right
                    trees. For tail pieces the natural history will suit admirably. I have a hermit-beaver in one part of the poem &#8211; &amp; you may
                    make a study for his nest in the river bank at Congreve &#8211; the great colts-foot on that bank &amp; the reeds will suit admirably. I
                    have a tame Elk for another &#8211; &amp; for a third a huge snake, coil within coil, a fellow ten feet long, sitting at the entrance of
                    a cavern temple sunning himself, &amp; waiting for his breakfast &#8211; a young child &#8211; to be brought him. humming birds &amp; fire
                    flies are out of the engravers reach. for another I would have the Cross planted upon a rock<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> The &#8216;tailpiece&#8217; designs were to have been taken from various scenes in <title>Madoc</title> (1805): the
                        Beaver, Part 1, Book 12; the Snake, Part 2, Book 3; the Cross, Part 2, Book 8. The engraving of the snake, over the title page
                        of Part 2, &#8216;Madoc in Aztlan&#8217;, was misplaced in the first edition.</note> &#8211; something as you remember it by the Cork

                        walls, at Cintra in 1800.</note> &amp; if you can devise any emblem of faith hope or truth to accompany it, so much the
                    better. plant a Palm by it for victory. Oh I wish you were here! it is slow work to talk with the pen, &amp; there is no
                    explaining what is not clearly expressed. You must come as soon as our holloboloo is over, which will be in less than two months.
                    &#8211; God willing &#8211; to a Christening &#8211; for you see I must be brought to bed of this poem at last after fifteen years labour! I shall
                    feel strangely when it is done &#8211; &amp; indeed if I could afford to lose the sale, would far rather leave it for publication after
                    my death, than lose the pleasurable object of thoughts which it would always be to me so only as it remained my own &amp; only my
                    own.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will be glad to hear me report progress. the first part (about 3600) lines is clean corrected &amp; fit to be
