        <p>It is clear to me that what the people are hungering for at this time is not what I am preparing for them. They want such
                    information as is <del>of</del> immediately applicable to commercial speculations, &#8211; I said in my last<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> For this, see Southey to Herbert Hill, 2 January 1808, Letter 1409.</note> that there would be ample materials
                    for a volume of this &lt;kind&gt; which could not make part of an historical work in any other shape than that of supplement or
                    appendix: &amp; certainly there is no reason why it should not appear first. Such an account of the Country as you could give,
                    with your Maps &amp;c I heartily wish you had ready &#8211; the booksellers would gladly give 500 &#163; for such a work, &amp; very probably
                    as much again might be got by it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have collected &lt;seperately&gt; nothing commercial, &#8211; commercial facts as they occurred have been arranged in
                    their place. Except going thro Rocha Pitta my reading goes only a few days before hand with my work, experience having taught me
                    that such fore-reading is time lost. &#8211; The Noticias do Brazil contain an account of the rivers on the coast, as far as was then
                    colonized, minute enough to persuade me of its accuracy. This I can abstract <del>xxxxx</del> in two or three mornings if you

                        This book was no. 3798 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Anchieta (1534&#8211;1597), was a missionary to Brazil.</note> &#8211;
