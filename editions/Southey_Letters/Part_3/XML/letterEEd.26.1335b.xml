                        State in the Home Office, had broken up in March 1807. Before he left office, Wynn had succeeded in arranging that the pension
                        he paid Southey from his personal funds was replaced by a government pension. Bedford was a civil servant in the

        <p rend="indent1">I am very busy. Today I had a repairer mending the carpet in my study; I had this same repair-man (whose name is
                    Johnny Cockbaine, assuredly the best &#8211; Prince-King-Emperor &#8211; most worthy mender of all menders. He is worth seeing, and he is
                    worth painting. If you are able to form in your mind an abstract idea of the perfect mender, it will certainly be of this short
                    little Johnny Cockbaine. From head to foot, he is all mender: whatever he does, whatever he thinks is about mending. This little
                    Johnnykins carries as his device a Lion rampant on his buckles. This is a very long parenthesis: now to the matter at hand) I had
                    this same repair-man making new curtains for the study; he had a painter painting the door. I had a bell-hanger hanging a bell. I
                    had a wagon with two packages of books to be reviewed. May the devil take the books. May the devil take the reviewing. I do not
                    like reviewing. I had a fisherman here with a jack [pike] weighing four pounds. The jacks of this lake are very good. I love jack,
                    not roasted but boiled. Boiled jack is better. Roasted is dry. Tell <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref>
                    this because Horace loves fish. I had another time a jack of twenty-two pounds. O beautiful Apollo! This was Jackus, this was
                    Johannes. This was Johannes Magnus [1488&#8211;1544, the last Catholic bishop in Sweden] as truly as the Archbishop of Uppsala, but
                    certainly that Archbishop would not have been so good boiled. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">Where is <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Peter the Great</ref>?  Would that this Peter were an
                    Archbishop, then I should dine with an Archbishop. I should very much like to dine with an Archbishop. This whopping Peter wrote
                    me about some books, which was very kind &#8211; but did he buy those books? Ask this greatest of all Peters, in the name of the least
                    and the thinnest of all Roberts.</p>
