        <p rend="indent1"> I have been induced by very liberal terms to undertake the historical department of an Edinburgh Annual Register,
                    which the Ballantynes<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJohn">John</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BallantyneJames">James Ballantyne</ref>.</note> are about to start, beginning with last year. Their
                    application to me has been unseasonably late, &#8211; owing to their having previously engaged some other person whose sample
                    disappointed them,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Either the poet and translator William Steward Rose (1775&#8211;1843;
                            <title>DNB</title>) or his brother the diplomatist George Henry Rose (1770&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>). Their father was the
                        Pittite loyalist MP George Rose (1744&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; &amp; would I believe have ruined their work: but in
                    consequence of receiving this late notice I come to the task without any previous collection of materials. Under these
                    circumstances it has occurred to me to apply to you. Have you any French or Spanish papers of the last or present year? &amp; can
                    you assist me by any arrangement for transferring them to me for the future, after they have served your purpose? &#8211; For tho I have
                    promised only to perform this office for the first year, it is most likely that I shall continue it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> From 1810 to 1812 Southey contributed to the &#8216;History of Europe&#8217; for 1808&#8211;1810 in James Ballantyne&#8217;s

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My view of things will differ from yours in only two points, &#8211; in disapproving the Copenhagen business,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the summer of 1807 the British, believing that France would gain possession of Denmark and its
                        fleet, amassed ships and troops and on 2 September launched a pre-emptive attack on Copenhagen, causing the deaths of over two
                        thousand townspeople.</note> &amp; in giving <ref target="people.html#Burdett">Sir Francis Burdett</ref> credit for good
                        intentions.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809 Burdett presented a comprehensive motion for parliamentary reform
                        to the House of Commons calling for a franchise for all ratepayers, shorter parliaments, equal electoral districts, and
                        single-day elections, but this was defeated. In April 1810 he was found guilty of breach of privilege by the House of Commons
                        and shortly after arrested and imprisoned, leading to a surge in popularity for him among the people of London
                            (<title>DNB</title>).</note> Upon all other points there is hardly a shade of difference between us. Without speaking
                    acrimoniously of Sir John Moore<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish
                        General with a long and varied military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention
                        of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the
                        Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809.</note> I shall describe his retreat as what it was, &#8211; a disorderly &amp; disgraceful
                    flight, &#8211; the most disgraceful upon record. It was my earnest wish to have taken up this subject in the Quarterly Review, but it
                    was thought better by <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Freres</ref> friends to entrust it to <ref target="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</ref>, who has had of course whatever documents <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> could supply. I am now glad that my offer was declined, inasmuch as I have now an opportunity of doing the same
                    thing more efficaciously &amp; less invidiously, by a full &amp; faithful narration, written with a perfect knowledge of the
                    ground over which he retreated (for I have travelled it on foot) &amp; with the spirit &amp; feeling of an Englishman.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> For Southey&#8217;s account, see the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810),
                        442&#8211;459. Although he praised many of Moore&#8217;s personal qualities, Southey suggested that he was not &#8216;equal to the difficulties
                        of his situation&#8217; (458).</note>

                    The Captain of a vessel which we have just detained &amp; sent in, says that they are marching every man they can find in the
                    country into Spain: they march them with their hands tied behind.&#8217; &#8211; It was impossible not to acquit Ld Gambier as he was
                    acquitted, &#8211; but without Cochrane nothing would have been attempted, &amp; had he had the sole management more would have been
                        done.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Admiral James Gambier, Baron Gambier (1756&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), was given
                        a peerage as a reward for commanding the September 1807 expedition that bombarded neutral Copenhagen until the Danish
                        surrendered its fleet into British hands. He attracted controversy again over the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809.
                        Although it achieved some success, the British fleet failed to destroy the French navy completely. Captain Thomas Cochrane,
                        later 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of
                        the battle, accused Gambier, his commanding officer, of being reluctant to pursue the attack and thus achieve a complete
                        victory. Cochrane was also an MP with a reputation for exposing abuses of office, and, in the weeks after the battle, he
                        pursued his campaign against Gambier via parliamentary speeches. Gambier demanded a court-martial at which he was exonerated
                        and, by implication, Cochrane was blamed for libelling a superior officer. Whilst Gambier received public thanks from
                        parliament for his actions in the battle, Cochrane was not permitted to rejoin his ship for a few months. When he received new
                        orders to serve in the Mediterranean, Cochrane refused and went on half-pay, devoting his time to exposing abuses in the
                        Admiralty. For Southey&#8217;s account, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 364&#8211;379.</note>

                        alliance with Britain against France in 1809; Napoleon then advanced into Austria where he suffered a significant defeat at
                        the battle of Aspern-Essling (22 May 1809). The Austrians failed to follow up this victory, which allowed Napoleon to seize
                        the capital, Vienna, in early July. The Austrians were then defeated by the French at the battle of Wagram on 5&#8211;6 July 1809,
                        after which they sued for peace.</note> &#8211; Vessels sail from France with English licenses under any colours except French &amp;

        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry to see that experience seems to be of no use either to the Spaniards or their allies. There is no want
                    of spirit in the people &#8211; Zaragoza &amp; Gerona are immortal proofs of their patriotism,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The Spanish city of Zaragoza had been besieged in 1808 and 1809 when, after an heroic defence, it fell to the French after an
                        outbreak of disease. For Southey&#8217;s accounts of the sieges, see <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</title>, 1.1 (1810),
                        306&#8211;321; and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 508&#8211;527. The Spanish city of Gerona had been
                        under siege by the French since 6 May 1809. After nearly seven months it finally fell on 11 December 1809.</note> &#8211; but they
                    are paralyzed in field because they suspect their officers. In the commencement of all such wars this has ever been the case, &#8211;
                    the misfortune is that in this they have to deal <del>xx</del> &lt;with an&gt; enemy who never loses time. It is folly to send a
                    mere auxiliary army, &#8211; the Spaniards should be left to fight in their own way, which Romana<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Spanish general Pedro Caro y Sureda, 3rd Marquis of la Romana (1761&#8211;1811) pioneered guerilla war

I have no apprehensions for <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Ld Wellington</ref> as yet: he has <ref target="people.html#WellesleyMarquis">his brother</ref> at Seville,<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> In 1809 Wellesley was appointed Ambassador to Spain
                        and arrived in Seville in August to negotiate with the embattled Supreme Central Junta. Here, he found himself once again in
                        the same theatre of military and diplomatic activity as his brother Sir Arthur Wellesley (Duke of Wellington), his main aim
                        being to support his brother&#8217;s army in the Peninsula. The Junta&#8217;s unwillingness to organise supplies for the British Army
                        while urging a policy of attack led Wellesley (and Southey) to suspect some of the Junta of co-operating with the
                        French.</note> so that something may be expected from thence, &amp; he can wait for reinforcements; &#8211; but unless we send a
                    great army the history of last winter will be repeated, &#8211; except that when he is compelled to make for the coast, he will retreat,
                    &amp; not run away. &#8211; <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> I believe would act vigorously if he were not
