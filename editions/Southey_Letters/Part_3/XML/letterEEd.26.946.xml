        <p rend="indent1"> The box came safe &#8211; but has made me rather uneasy, inasmuch as I find two sets of books imperfect, one volume of a

                        in 1798 and bound in red morocco. It was included in the 1844 sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, lacking one volume.</note>
                    if they were not packed up in the other box which came at the same time when both were opened at the Custom House, they must have
                    been lost there, &amp; the loss of the last would ruin a set worth four guineas.</p>

                        event, the poem was published with only two of the intended engravings, one of which, that of a serpent, was misplaced. For
