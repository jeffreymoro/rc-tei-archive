        <p rend="indent1"> In spite of the information your letter contains it is the most welcome one that I have received for many a long
                    month. it has this minute reached me &#8211; plague on the length of time that has elapsed &#8211; &amp; must elapse before you can receive
                    the answer. I write but these few lines &#8211; for we have company whom I expect every instant &#8211; to tell you to draw on <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> for thirty pounds if you want it &#8211; which you will needs do unless you very
                    speedily get an appointment. I wish to God I could say for a larger sum but you know how the world stands with me. &amp; this will
                    stop a gap till something better may turn up.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been in much distress about you owing to the affair of the Lilly.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey&#8217;s ship, HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi>, a fifth-rate 32-gun frigate, had, on 14 August 1804, made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the
                    French privateer <hi rend="ital">General Ernouf</hi> (formerly the British sloop of war <hi rend="ital">Lilly</hi>) lying at
                    the Saintes near Guadeloupe. 65 of the 90 men sent on the mission were killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that his
                    brother was among them because the first lieutenant had been reported as dead, but he was absent from the raid because he had
                    been placed under arrest.</note> it was said in the Whitehaven paper<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Cumberland Pacquet and Ware&#8217;s Whitehaven Advertiser</title>.</note> that the first Lieutenant was killed &#8211; I am
                    never in the habit of overhastily believing tidings whether evil or good &#8211; the paragraph stated that the Lieutenant of Marines,
                    the Master, Surgeon &amp; thirty men fell also.  Hall I thought would have been with you, but it seemed an absurdity to imagine that the
                    Master &amp; the Surgeon should be in the boats.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Hall (first name and dates unknown) was
                        the Lieutenant of Marines on board HMS <hi rend="ital">Galatea</hi>.</note> I got <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to inquire at Admiralty, &amp; found that some Lieutenant &#8211; who I
                    now suppose may have stept into your place &#8211; was also in your place when the ball came which might else have borne a billet for
                        you.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles Hayman (d. 1804) was made first lieutenant in place of Thomas and he died
                        in the attack.</note> God be praised! all is for the best. If Commodore Hood<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Commodore
                        (later Vice-Admiral) Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet (1762&#8211;1814; <title>DNB</title>), in command of the fleet in which Thomas
                        Southey served.</note> should not appoint you come to Keswick. One of the new Lords of the Admiralty was a schoolfellow of
                    mine,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Dickinson (1771&#8211;1837), a pupil at Westminster School, who later went on to Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1793, MA 1795) and was Civil Lord of the Admiralty, 1804&#8211;1806.</note> who, tho
                    we have no intercourse with one another, would I believe willingly do me a kindness if it came in his way. &amp; I have little
                    doubt that thro him I could get you an appointment. He it was who gave that rascal <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> a birth, who after costing my Uncle 150 &#163;, runs up a bill in my name at a brothel &#8211; goes begging of his poor
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> &#8211; &amp; is now I believe at Bristol dashing away, in his uniforms.
                    Whether he ever went on board, or was turned out God knows &#8211; to the gallows he must come &amp; I only wish it was over. Dont fret
                    about him &#8211; he does not deserve it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> They are not yet come so that I have time to ask you if Michael Birbeck fell in the affair of the Lilly?<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Michael Birbeck (dates unknown) was killed in the action, according to William James (d. 1827),
                            <title>The Naval History of Great Britain</title>, 5 vols (London, 1822&#8211;1824), III, pp. 274&#8211;276.</note> his father lives
                    at Whitehaven &amp; has reason to hope the account of his death is not true by what the Admiralty says. the paragraph which
                    mentioned your death was particularly about him, calling him Master &#8211; but I &amp; the printer, who have had some communication in
                        consequence<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> This correspondence has not survived.</note> fear he was only Masters Mate
                    &#8211; &amp; if so we may have raised the old mans hopes only to make him suffer more severely at last. &#8211; You now see why I have not
                    written by the last mail. &#8211; moreover the accounts of the hurricane said at first that a frigate was lost at Dominica, &amp; that
