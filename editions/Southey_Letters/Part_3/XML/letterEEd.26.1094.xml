It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and
                        cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize money was withheld because the ships were captured before war was
                        officially declared. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated. It was presumably Southey’s influence
