                        were a few exceptions written by Taylor, which included a review of Southey&#8217;s <title>Madoc</title> (1805). This appeared in
                        the <title>Monthly Magazine</title>, 19 (July 1805), 656&#8211;658. See David Chandler, &#8216;&#8220;A Sort of Bird&#8217;s Eye View of the British

        <p rend="indent1"> I assent to about half of what you say, &#8211; to the sink of interest where there ought to have been a swell, &#8211; &amp;
                    to the want of ornamental patches. I dissent from the charge of levelness of manner, which seems to be less applicable to Madoc
                    than to any <del>poem</del> long poem that ever was written. In my judgement the manner always accommodates itself to the matter,
                    rising &amp; falling with the subject.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The alterations which I feel disposed to make are these. to give all the odes in lyrical measures. to make Erillyab
                    put Amalahta to death with her own hand, &amp; so get rid of <del>that</del> the last part of that attack upon the women which is

                    will give up the Lake, because it too forcibly reminds the reader of Mexico &amp; Cortes.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                        its precedent in accounts of the attack by Hern&#225;n Cort&#233;s de Monroy y Pizarro, 1st Marquis of the Oaxaca Valley (1485&#8211;1547) on
                        Mexico-Tenochtitl&#225;n (New Mexico) during the Spanish conquest of America. Southey&#8217;s proposed alterations to the poem were
                        not carried out.</note> The subject will always be a bad one, but still the poem is worth any pains that I can bestow upon
                    it.</p>

                            <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and
                        cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize money was withheld because the ships were captured before war was
                        officially declared. Southey took up his brother&#8217;s cause to have his share reinstated. It was presumably Southey&#8217;s influence
                        that caused <title>The Courier</title> to publish a paragraph supporting the sailors&#8217; claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24
