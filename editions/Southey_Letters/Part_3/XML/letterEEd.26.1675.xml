                    find leisure. Meantime send me all the thoughts which occur to you, &amp; all the anecdotes which you collect either of past or

                    late ministry, as much for their base feelings towards Spain, now manifested in all newspapers, as for their former misdeeds, –

                        landed at Walcheren on 30 July 1809. There was little fighting but the army sustained heavy losses from sickness, and in

                        Austria where he suffered a significant defeat at the battle of Aspern-Essling (22 May 1809). The Austrians failed to follow
                        up this victory, which allowed Napoleon to seize the capital, Vienna, in early July. The Austrians were then defeated by the
                        French at the battle of Wagram on 5–6 July 1809. Francis II (1768–1835), the last Holy Roman Emperor (1792–1806) and from
