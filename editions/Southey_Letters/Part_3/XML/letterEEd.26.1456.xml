          <salute>My dear Danvers</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of our journey homeward, safe arrival, &amp; finding all well &amp; as it should be, you have heard from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>. Since he wrote I have been in a state of happy confusion, occasioned by the arrival
                    of my books &#8211; two and twenty packages. Here they are at last, after so many years <del>xxx</del> &lt;that&gt; I have been wanting
                    them, wishing for them, &amp; yet never able to get them together, here they are gathered under together under one roof. It was
                    only yesterday that we got them stowed away, &#8211; I have had a range of shelves &lt;run up&gt; along one side of the passage which
                    connects the two houses, &#8211; from the floor to the ceiling, &#8211; that holds about 1350 volumes, &amp; is denominated Duck Row,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey named his more dilapidated books &#8216;ducks&#8217;.</note> &#8211; tho there is only the dark
                    end to which that name can properly be applied, those which are in the light being Drakes. There must be yet a small stand of
                    shelves on the upper landing place, to hold about 200 which are still kicking to windward, &#8211; &amp; to receive droppers-in. I have
                    seven stands upon brackets in my study, which support the parchmentarians,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> That is,
                        Southey&#8217;s valuable manuscripts.</note> &amp; the carpenter is making three more, to go over the three doors in the passage, &#8211;
                    that is, the study door, our own bed-room, &amp; that wherein you slept. Heartily do we wish you were coming to us this summer;
                    you would delight to see me in my glory, with all my riches round me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">My son</ref>  walks barefoot, &amp; will I think tread evenly enough on his
                    feet; &#8211; the want of shoes will be some inconvenience <del>xxx</del> &#8211; but that cannot be helped. He is a beautiful boy, terribly
                    violent, &amp; almost unmanageable. All this he will outgrow, if it please God that he lives. I am in great favour with him, &amp;
                    when he &amp; I have the book of the birds &amp; beasts before us, I teaching him the language of all &amp; he repeating them
                    after me, I verily believe such a concert hath not been heard since Noah &amp; his live stock came out of the Ark. What you hear
                    at Exeter Change<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> A menagerie on the Strand, London.</note> is nothing to it. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Emma</ref> is the quietest of infants: there is scarcely any trouble with her, &#8211;an agreeable
                    variety this from all her predecessors. She will be like neither brother nor sister, for her eyes are dark grey. I hear her voice
                    so seldom &amp; see so little of her (our nurse not having yet been called away) that I hardly think of her as one of the family,
                    &amp; forget her existence till she makes her appearance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> suffered little inconvenience on the journey &#8211; still I believe he will have reason
                    to repent his obstinacy in running away from <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> so soon. The parts do not gather
                    strength, &amp; he is plagued with a procidentia,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> A prolapsed rectum.</note> which on
                    the day that he walked much was painful, &#8211; &amp; will no doubt become a serious complaint one day or other; &#8211; unless he stops at
                    Bristol long enough to have it thoroughly remedied, before he goes to another ship. &#8211; I hope <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> has received the book; if it be not yet come it will soon.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope also &amp; trust that by this time <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> has perceived the villainy
                    of that portrait,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Perhaps the portrait made by James Sharples (1751&#8211;1811) in 1795,
                        which shows Southey in profile, hair short, plainly dressed, as if about to address someone.</note> &amp; thrown it behind the
                    fire. It looks like a sneaking, sawneying methodist parson, &#8211; the one thing in the world which is most unlike me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> copied out for all that is fairly written of Kehama,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    &amp; if any thing were to induce me to finish the poem, it would be because such an offer had been made me by such a man; tho of
                    course, it is what I should not accept. If he likes it I shall make an effort to go thro the story, by writing before breakfast as

                    another amusement which not quite so well, that of throwing things <del>out the x</del> overboard. One of his stockings went,
                    &amp; it required good watching to save his leathern-cap from following it.</p>
