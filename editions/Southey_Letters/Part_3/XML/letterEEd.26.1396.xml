                            <title>The Courier</title> of 20 November 1807, probably at Coleridge&#8217;s instigation, appeared an extract from
                            <title>Letters from England</title>, Letter 38, concerning the exploitation of the poor in the new commercial and
                        manufacturing towns. On 17 November an extract from Letter 36 criticising Birmingham had been published.</note> &#8211; &amp; if any

                    faults, &#8211; &amp; yet am I exceedingly desirous it should go off, for the sake of showing how good a one it may be made. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Here is something which I do not wish to be talked about. &#8211; Overtures were made me to bear a part in the Edinburgh
                    Review &#8216;chusing my own books, &amp; expressing my own opinions.&#8217; The pay is now ten guineas per sheet &amp; soon to be greatly
                    increased, &#8211; &amp; I was assured that I might thus add one or two hundred a year to my income. &#8211; I have returned a decided

                    made thro <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> who will probably be sufficiently surprized at the reply, tho
                    especial care was taken to make it as courteous as it was decisive. The Annual pays only seven pounds &#8211; not equal to five Scotch
                    measure: the advantage to have been gained from the civility which would have been insured to my future publications was still
                    greater than the increase of immediate pay &#8211; but it was impossible for me to coalesce with a man whom I consider as &#8216;a bad
                    politician, a worse moralist, &amp; a critic in all matter of taste equally incompetent &amp; unjust.&#8217; These were the words I
