        <p rend="indent1"> I reached home last night, the whole round of my journey had been free from hurt hindrance &amp; inconvenience,
                    &amp; every thing here was to my hearts desire. Knowing by experience <del>xx xxxxx xxx</del> &lt;so many of &gt; the accidents of
                    life, I am thankful for this happy return.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> came back with me &#8211; he had been eased at Bristol of his emeroids, (Bible
                    orthography against the surgeons) but he ought to have remained under able hands till the parts had recovered their strength.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas had gone to Bristol to see <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">John King</ref> who
                        had treated him for haemorrhoids.</note> Southey-nature hath a touch of the mule in it, &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom&#8217;s</ref> mule is not so well broken in as mine. I think he will repent his hasty departure
                    from <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref>, &amp; I am sure he deserves to repent it: however I shall be glad to find that
                    he escapes his deserts. &#8211; We stopt at <ref target="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</ref> just to speak to <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> from the chaise window. my only purpose in this being to learn later
                    news from home than could have reached the south. I found him beginning to be uneasy about his eldest child, &amp; upon asking a
                    few questions clearly, perceived that there was every symptom of hydrocephalus &amp; that those symptoms had been blindly
                    neglected. Among other things I mentioned to him a mode of practice which <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref>
                    &amp; <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref> have often found successful, that of bleeding in the jugular vein, &#8211; &amp;
                    promised him to make search for a letter of <ref target="people.html#KingJohn">Kings</ref>, wherein he had described the operation
                    so minutely that he wished me if <del>ever</del> a country practitioner hesitated (&amp; the case required it) to operate
                        myself<del>x</del> by the directions. My meaning was to alarm <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>,
                    &amp; <del>it</del> in this I so far succeeded, that he immediately began to look for some account of the disease &amp; that
                    account so increased his alarm that he dispatched a messenger at midnight, who called me up <del>xxx</del> &lt;before&gt; four in
                    the morning to look for the letter in question &#8211; If the child is saved, as probably it may, he will owe his life entirely to this.
