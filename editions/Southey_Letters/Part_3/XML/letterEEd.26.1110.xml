          <salute>Dear Rickman</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will wonder at my long silence. the fact is that I have been either living out of doors, or in a crowd of
                    company for the last three months. This morning I set out with <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> for Edinburgh,
                    within three weeks I shall return, &amp; shut myself up for the winter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Ask <ref target="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</ref> for me whether bones burnt under ground in quick-lime are as
                    good a manure as pounded bones, or if they lose any thing by being so consumed. You will perceive that if the mechanical labour
                    can be thus saved, it would be of much consequence. I shall be glad to receive an answer to this query, that I may transmit it
                    into Devonshire to the querist.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Probably Southey&#8217;s recent correspondent Robert Hurrell
                        Froude (1770/71&#8211;1859; <title>DNB</title>), Church of England clergyman of Dartington, South Devon, and later Archdeacon of
                        Totnes.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have written in the Courier about the prize money, &amp; the Courier now says that I have been misinformed, for
                    the sailors are to have the same share as in all former cases. Misinformed I certainly was not. can you tell me whether the
                    measure has been really given up, for if not I will renew the attack.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> In December 1804, the naval ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig <hi rend="ital">Isabella</hi> and
                        the ship <hi rend="ital">Conception</hi>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <hi rend="ital">Commerce</hi>, laden
                        with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed
                        conflict, but in this case the prize money was contested because the ships were captured before war was officially declared.
                        Southey took up his brother&#8217;s cause to have his share reinstated in <title>The Courier</title> which published a paragraph
                        supporting the sailors&#8217; claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their
                        position in <title>The Courier</title> on 31 August 1805 under the title &#8216;Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants&#8217;. A &#8216;reply from a
                        Spanish merchant&#8217; appeared in <title>The Courier</title> for 6 September 1805. Southey&#8217;s response, that the prize money was
                        being withheld from the sailors in a measure that was &#8216;impolitic, ungenerous and unjust&#8217; was published in <title>The
                            Courier</title> of 25 September 1805, p. 2. This was refuted by an editorial article in <title>The Courier</title> of 28
                        September 1805, where it was stated that there was no truth in Southey&#8217;s assertion.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have in consequence of <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref> advice determined to return to
                    Portugal in the spring. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> seems unwilling to accompany me, &amp; must do as she
                    pleases. tho it is my wish to take her &amp; remain abroad three years &#8211; or for an time indefinitely longer.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not make his intended trip to Portugal as Edith did not wish to go and he did not
                        want to be separated from her; see Southey to Edith Southey, 14 October 1805, Letter 1112.</note> But at any rate I go,
                    meaning to visit the Northern provinces, to collect the Statistics of the country, &amp; compleat my historical materials.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was working on a &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217; which was never completed.</note> It will
                    employ me five months to review <del>my last</del> &lt;<del>xxx</del>&gt; for the last time, &amp; to get Espriella
                        published.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella:
                            Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807).</note> As soon as these jobs are done I shall move, take London in my way to
                    Bristol. &amp; embark from thence in a Portugueze vessel, which now carries papers at about half the packet price.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Story of my Lectureship is all nonsense.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> During 1805 <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Richard Sharp</ref> was involved in planning the London Institution for the Improvement
                        of Science and Literature (established 1806); it was here that it was rumoured Southey would be a lecturer.</note> you may be
                    assured that I shall never accept of any such office, if it were offered to me. I have some knowledge of <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</ref>, who is one of the leading men, &amp; thro him may perhaps set them upon doing
                    some good hereafter.</p>
