          <salute>Dear Senhouse</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Let me congratulate you on the birth of a son,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Senhouse&#8217;s son, also called
                        Humphrey, was born on 16 April 1809.</note> &amp; also that he was born in the birth-place of his fathers. Men are not like
                    potatoes the better for changing soil; &#8211; as far as my observation extends the finest people in England both morally &amp;
                    physically, are those whose forefathers have lived upon the same spot from time immemorial; &#8211; they are born to a rich inheritance
                    of good works, fair <del>respect</del> reputation &amp; kindly feelings, &amp; have as it were a relationship to the very earth
                    they tread on, which in time of need would make them its best defenders. It seems to be supposed that man is not injured by
                    transplanting, because he is locomotive, &#8211; as if the heart &amp; the affections did not strike root. A Humphrey Senhouse would
                    have lost much had he been born anywhere but at <ref target="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</ref>. I hate an overgrown
                    aristocracy; &#8211; the land-Leviathans who overspread whole counties are the bane of England, but in proportion as I abominate them do
                    I wish to see the old English feelings of family dignity &amp; character preserved, as the best counteracting principle.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I spent two days at Workington Hall last week.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Workington Hall in Cumbria
                        was owned by John Christian Curwen (1756&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>), politician and agriculturist, where he embarked on an
                        improvement programme that had a profound impact on local agriculture in the first half of the nineteenth century.</note> Once
                    before I had declined going, &amp; could not repeat the refusal without incivility, &#8211; but I do not like M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                    Curwen, except as a member of Parliament; &#8211; his manners are compleatly artificial, &amp; the more I have seen of him the less
                    respectfully do I estimate his powers of mind. <ref target="people.html#Burdett">Sir Francis Burdett</ref> was not exactly right
                    in what he said about the gentleman-agriculturists, &#8211; neither was he altogether wrong. They are doing that in person which they
                    should do by proxy, &#8211; &amp; they are attempting to unite characters which are not in themselves compatible. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                    Curwen sells flour at his farm, fourpence (I think) a stone cheaper than it can be bought at the shops, so he has a board over the
                    fire-place of his shop &#8211; (or counter or whatever it may be called) with this inscription &#8216;We do not give, but expect thanks from
                    our customers.&#8217; Now this is a bad thing. People who pay for what they want, expect to be thanked for their custom, &#8211; &amp; it is
                    better they should pay an additional fourpence a stone to some poor shop-keeper, no richer than themselves, who would thank them
                    for it, than be told that they are obliged to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Curwen for taking their money, &amp; that if they do not
                    chuse to thank him they may go somewhere else. A farthing upon a pound of flour is well paid for mutual civility &amp; the
                    wholesome feeling of mutual obligation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The system of stall-feeding milch cows succeeds admirably in calculation, I both hope &amp; trust it will not
                    succeed in any other way, for if it should country cows hereafter will be as miserable as London cows, &amp; instead of seeing
                    them every where at pasture, we must look for them in cow-houses yoked by the neck to a wooden post, &amp; feeding out of a
                    trough. The milkmaid will have to enter a sty instead of carrying her pail into the field &amp; Heaven help the poets &amp;
                    painters! But the thing is too unnatural to continue long. I learnt from somebody else that these cows had a sort of itch, &#8211; &amp;
                    that they caught cold if were let out &amp; happened to get wet thro! &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have never yet seen any thorough gentleman-agriculturist who was the better for his pursuit, &amp; sure I am that
                    very many of them are the worse for it. To be perpetually <del>think</del> conversant with farmers, graziers, &amp; butchers,
                        <del>x</del> thinking from morning till night about manure, consulting about tups &amp; bulls, what sheep are to be sent to
                    market, &amp; when the calf&#8217;s throat is to be cut, are not the best means of improving either the imagination or the
                    understanding. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Curwen has a room full of agricultural books, &#8211; yet he said enough to prove that he was
                    utterly ignorant of the physiology of plants, &amp; I could not discover that he had paid the slightest attention to any other
                    branch of knowledge, &#8211; except the mere subjects of the day.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> He told me it was his opinion that the D of York would soon be reinstated by Lords Grey<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey (1764&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1830&#8211;1834 and leading Whig.</note>

                        forced to resign in the wake of allegations that he had profited by allowing his mistress, Mary Anne Clarke (c. 1776&#8211;1852;
                            <title>DNB</title>), to accept money from army officers, in return for which promotion was arranged. In May 1811 the <ref target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">Prince Regent</ref> reinstated his brother as Commander-in-Chief of the army, a

                    be more difficult for Whigs &amp; Tories, with the General Officers to help them, to force the Duke of York into power, than they
                    are aware of, found guilty as he has been by the people of England. I believe that we are in more danger from him than from
                    Bonaparte, but my apprehensions of either are not very great.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Sir Johns Moores<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish
                    General with a long and varied military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention of
                    Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle
                    of Corunna on 16 January 1809. Moore&#8217;s actions were posthumously defended by his brother, James Moore (1763&#8211;1860;
                    <title>DNB</title>), in <title>A Narrative of the Campaign of the British Army in Spain, Commanded by His Excellency Sir John Moore. Authenticated by Official Papers and Original Letters</title> (1809).</note> reputation has burst like a bubble. His letters prove him to have quite unequal to his situation,
                    &#8211; he was manifestly afraid, &amp; yet more afraid that the people should think him so. So he advanced against his own judgement
                    when it was too late, &amp; then ran away, &#8211; for never was there a more scandalous flight. <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Freres</ref> part of the correspondence does him great credit, &#8211; the worst thing I know
                    of him is his connection with <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>, &#8211; the only good thing of <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>, his friendship for <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref>.
                    Never was there a time when such a blow might be struck against Bonaparte as at the present moment. An English army might
                    extirpate the French from Spain, &amp; then leave the Spaniards to cross the Pyrenees &amp; recall Bonaparte from Germany, while
                    our men came back again. But there are the battles of corruption to fight at home &amp; nothing else will be thought of than how
                    to prevent Reform, which yet must come sooner or later.</p>
