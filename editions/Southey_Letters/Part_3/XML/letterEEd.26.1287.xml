        <p rend="indent1"> You have had ere this my unhappy specimens,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s and Grosvenor
                        Bedford&#8217;s <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title> (1807).</note> &#8211; hurried at last into the world, after three
                    years delay, in such haste that the sheets were never sent to me for revisal, &amp; so the cancels are to be made after the book
                    is published. It is needless to say how much I am provoked with the printer<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> The book was printed by S. Hollingsworth (first name and
                        dates unknown) of Crane Court, Fleet Street.</note> for his intolerable blunders, how much with <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> for his manifold offences both of omission &amp; commission, &amp;
                    how much more with myself for trusting any thing to either the one or the other. If ever the book should reach a second edition
                    (for which in my conscience I am afraid it is too bad) it shall assume a very different appearance.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> A second edition was not called for.</note> One half the Specimens shall be omitted to make room for the
                    numberless authors now left out, I will insert what he has unaccountably thought proper to strike out,
                    &amp; strike out what he has with as little propriety inserted, &#8211; for if he had not undone much which I had done, &amp; done much
                    which I designed to leave undone, the book would have been far better than it is. I never intended that he should be Inquisitorial
                    Censor over me. This however is only said to you, that you may not suppose me more in fault than is really the case. The book must
                    take its chance in the world, as if all its sins rested upon my head.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should not have written to you about this, &#8211; but having occasion to write, the subject was uppermost, &amp; so
                    out it came. I write to ask if you have Thevets <hi rend="ital">France Antarticque</hi>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Andr&#233; Thevet (1516?-1592), <title>Singularitez de la France antarctique</title> (1557).</note> Lery<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean de L&#233;ry (1536&#8211;1613), <title>Historia Navigationis in Brasiliam, quae et America Dicitur</title>
                        (1578).</note> says he was a Liar, &amp; Thuanus<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jacques Auguste de Thou (Thuanus)
                        (1553&#8211;1617), author of <title>Historia sui temporis</title> (1620) and <title>Memoires</title> (1620).</note> that he was a
                    scoundrel, but notwithstanding this I am at present in great want of his book. You may perhaps have heard that it is my intention,
                    in consquence of political circumstances, to publish that part of my Opus Magnum first which relates to South America, &amp; which
                    I shall probably entitle Brazil &amp; Paraguay, &#8211; for concerning the latter I shall have necessarily so much to say,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> appeared in three volumes from 1810 to 1819. The
                        remainder of his &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217; was never completed.</note> that it will be most convenient to give the whole history
                    of the countries between the Rivers Plata &amp; Maranham.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Mara&#241;&#243;n River, which begins
                        northeast of Lima in Peru and is one of the headwaters of the Amazon river, was perceived to be the source of the Amazon in the
                        nineteenth century.</note> My MS. materials are very numerous &amp; very important.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> All your books shall be returned as soon as Palmerin is finished.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Palmerin of England; by Francisco de Moraes. Corrected by Robert Southey from the Original Portugueze</title>
                        (1807).</note> I soon devoured Esplandian,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    well repaid my time, &amp; I earnestly wish I could get at the whole series. Beyond a doubt Palmerin is the best of the Spanish
                    Romances, except Amadis; &#8211; it is indeed a book of great merit &#8211; I shall be glad when my task is <del>xx</del> compleated, as the
                    labour was very unexpected &#8211; thus it is not to look before leaping; &#8211; however as it was to be done, I was resolved it should be
                    done thoroughly, &amp; the printers copy will convince you (in spite of the Specimens) that it is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> my way
