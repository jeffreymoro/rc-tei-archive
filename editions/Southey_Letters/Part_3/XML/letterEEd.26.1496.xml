                    has found two Englishmen to go with him. A noble fellow this is something like the days of old as we poets &amp; romancers
                    represent them, something like the best part of chivalry, &#8211; old honours, old generosity, old heroism are reviving, &#8211; &amp; the
                    career of that cursed monkey nation is stopt, I believe &amp; fully trust, now &amp; for ever. A man like <ref target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> cannot long remain without command, &#8211; &amp; of all things in this world I

                        elder brother of Napoleon, who made him King of Naples and Sicily (1806&#8211;1808), and King of Spain and the Indies as Joseph I of
                        Spain (1808&#8211;1813).</note> has fallen into his hands: &#8211; he would infallibly hang him upon the nearest tree, first as a
                    Bonaparte by blood, secondly as a Frenchman by adoption, thirdly as a King by trade.</p>

                    finished, &amp; I am 50 lines on in the next, &#8211; in all 1933 &#8211; an increase of something more like 1000 since the poem has been
                    resumed. I am about the Enchantress who helps Arvalan to his travelling air-car, for which in my conscience I think I deserve a
                    patent, the invention being wholly my own. In the course of a week I hope to rib him in ice at the North Pole, &amp; then I shall

        <p>Another Island came up on Saturday last which I shall visit the first fine day, probably with <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> &amp; Jonathan Ottley,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jonathan

                    of the gas, &#8211; Jonathan being as you know our <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> philosopher. We are having a spell of

        <p rend="indent1"> We have got the prettiest kitten you ever saw, &#8211; a dark tabby, &amp; we have christened her by the heathenish name
                    of Dido. You would be very much diverted to see her hunt <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> all round the
                    kitchen, playing with his little bare feet, which she just pricks at every pat, &amp; the faster he moves back, the more she paws
                    them, while he squealls &amp; fights, &amp; cries naughty Dido, &amp; points to his feet &amp; says hurt &#8211; hurt &#8211; naughty Dido, &#8211;
                    presently he feeds her with poppin bits, which Dido plays with awhile, but soon returns to her old game. You have lost the amusing
                    part of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herberts</ref> childhood, &#8211; just when he is trying to talk, &amp; endeavouring to
                    say every thing.</p>

          <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> is making a bathing-house down there at the bottom of the orchard, &#8211; which
                    I suppose nobody will ever use. I have been in the water very seldom since you went, &#8211; but the last time I accomplished the great
                    job of fairly swimming on my back, &#8211; which is a step equal to that of getting ones first commission. We drank tea out a few nights
                    ago with the Wolseleys,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Reverend Robert Wolseley (d. 1815), son of William Wolseley, 6th Baronet (1740&#8211;1817). The family seat was at Wolseley Park, Rugeley in Staffordshire.</note> &#8211; &amp;
                    they were so well pleased with it that we shall probably take them again when the weather permits.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I boggle at your third section of Kehama, because that must be turned into rhyme. the two first are transcribed, &#8211;
                    the first with many alterations, &amp; I have written (by this post) to <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> For this, see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 16 August 1808,

                    not begin upon it till I come to a stop in Kehama. You will not perhaps be surprized to hear that two of my old dreams are likely
                    to be introduced with powerful effect in this poem: &#8211; good proof that it was well worth while to keep even the imperfect register
                    which I have. The fact is that what happens to Nebuchadnezzar is perpetually happening to me, &#8211; I forget my dreams, &amp; have no
                    Daniel to help out my recollection;<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> In the Book of Daniel 2, Daniel is alone able to

                    down, the impression passes away, almost as lightly as the dream itself. &#8211; Do you remember the story of Mickle the Poet<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Mickle (1735&#8211;1788; <title>DNB</title>), poet and translator from the Portuguese of

                    so infinitely superior to any thing which he produced in his waking hours. &#8211; One morning he awoke, &amp; repeated the lamentation
                    over his unhappy fortune, that he should compose such sublime poetry &#8211; &amp; yet lose it for ever! &#8211; what, said his wife, who
                    happened to be awake, &#8211; were you writing poetry? &#8211; yes, <del>said</del> he &lt;replied&gt;, &#8211; &amp; such poetry that I should give
                    the world to remember it. Well then, <del>xx</del> said she, I <del>xx</del> did luckily hear the last lines, &amp; I am sure I
