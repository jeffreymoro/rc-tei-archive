          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford&#8217;s surviving brother, his other brother, <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref>, having just died.</note> letter I have been in great uneasiness concerning you, for by the same post <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> told me he supposed you were by that time here.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford had been visiting Wynn at his <ref target="places.html#Wynnstay">estate</ref>  in
                        Wales.</note> This evening your letters from Acton have brought the first intelligence of you, which has been delayed some
                    days by a blunder of the post in carrying it to Birmingham. Now that you are in London, &amp; the shock of meeting is over, I am
                    glad you are there. had you come on I should have endeavoured to detain you as long as possible.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What shall I say <del>you</del> to you? &#8211; this is the first heavy loss which you have ever experienced, &#8211; hereafter
                    the bitterness of the cup will have past away, &amp; you will then perceive its wholesomeness. This world is all to us till we
                    suffer some such loss, &amp; every such loss is a transfer of so much of our hearts &amp; hopes to the next, &#8211; <del>xx xxxxx xxx
                        xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx</del> &amp; they who live long enough to see most of their friends go before them, feel that they have more
                    to recover by death than to lose by it. This is not the mere speculation of a mind at ease. Almost all who were about me in my
                    childhood have been removed. I have brothers, sisters, friends, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">father</ref>, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">mother</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">child</ref> in another state of existence, &#8211; &amp;
                    assuredly I regard death with very different feelings than I should have done if none of my affections were fixed beyond the grave
                    &#8211; To dwell upon the circumstances which in this case lessen the evil of separation, would be idle; &#8211; at present you acknowledge,
                    &amp; in time you will feel them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Pray let me hear from you. I am very anxious about your own state of health.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Grosvenor Bedford had been suffering from a liver complaint; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 2 January 1807,
