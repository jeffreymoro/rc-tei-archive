        <p rend="indent1"> I was very unwell in London with cold &amp; cough; the air half poisoned me, &#8211; my lungs were never so sensibly
                    affected before. for ten days I abstained from animal food &amp; drank only water; by this means &amp; by keeping very early
                    hours, avoiding all fatigue, &amp; talking very little I got better, but the cough was sufficient to show me that six months in
                    London would be my death. Fox glove operated so strongly upon me as a diuretic that I could not take it. On my return I have
                    picked up another cold, which will soon go off. Oh what a comfort it is to be at home! &amp; yet it is not possible to more be
