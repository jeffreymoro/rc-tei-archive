          <ref target="people.html#AikinArthur">A. Aikin</ref> had need send me certain complimentary sugar-plums; he has cut out some of my
                    bitterest and best sentences, and has rejected my reviewal of his father&#8217;s Letters on the English Poets, to make room for
                    something as <ref target="people.html#BarbauldAnnaLetitia">Bare-bald</ref> as the book itself.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Aikin, <title>Letters to a Young Lady on a Course of English Poetry</title> (1804). Southey&#8217;s implication
                        is that &#8216;Bare-bald&#8217;, his jokey name for Anna Letitia Barbauld, will write the review instead.</note> However, no wonder; there
                    must be a commander-in-chief, and the Annual Review has at least as good, or better, than either army, navy, or government in

                    know, was predetermined; but my waistcoat was <hi rend="ital">shameful</hi>. I yielded; and yielded also to a calico
                    under-waistcoat, to give the <hi rend="ital">genteel fulness</hi> which was requisite. This was not all. Hyde pressed me further;
                    delicate patterns for pantaloons, &#8211; they make gaiters of the same; it would not soil, and it would wash. I yielded, and am
                    tomorrow to be completely hyded in coat, waistcoat, under-waistcoat, pantaloons, and gaiters; and shall go forth, like &#8211;&#8211;&#8211;,
