          <salute>Dear Duppa,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The thought of writing to you, &#8211; or, rather, the thought that I had not written, &#8211; has very often risen in my
                    conscience heavily. <ref target="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna Southcote</ref> has been the cause. Her books, with Sharp&#8217;s
                    dirty treasure,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> William Sharp (1749&#8211;1824; <title>DNB</title>), the engraver who became a
                        disciple of Southcott, engraved her portrait and wrote <title>An Answer to the World</title> (1806) in her defence &#8211; his
                        &#8216;dirty treasure&#8217;. Southey was sending Duppa materials on Southcott which he had used in writing <title>Letters from England by
                            Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807); see Southey to William Peachy, 15 May 1808,
                        Letter 1458.</note> are now on their way to London. It is so much better to say I <hi rend="ital">have done</hi> a thing than
                    I <hi rend="ital">will do</hi> it, that I really have deferred writing for the sake of saying these books were actually gone.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> For the last three weeks I have suffered from a blinding and excoriating catarrh; always with me a very obstinate
                    disease, and more violent than I have ever seen it in any person except one of my own family. Diseases are the worst things a man
                    can inherit, and I am never likely to inherit anything else. That <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">father&#8217;s brother of
                        mine</ref> in Somersetshire &#8211; whom I would so gladly sell at half price received me as cordially as was in his nature last
                    April, and gave me 25<hi rend="ital">1</hi>., &#8211; an act of great generosity in a man of 1200<hi rend="ital">l</hi>. a year, and
                    remarkable as being all I ever have had, or ever shall have, from him, for he has now turned <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">his sister</ref> out of doors, and desired never to see any of the family again. Duppa, my breeches&#8217; pockets will never be so
                    full as to make me stick in Heaven&#8217;s gate. Three lines of that fellows pen will cut me off from more than all the pens I shall
                    ever wear to the stump will gain for me, and yet I hope many is the goose egg yet unlaid which is to produce quills for my
                    service.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Lakers are coming in shoals, and some of them find their way here. Among others, I have had the satisfaction of
                    seeing Joanna Baillie:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> (1762&#8211;1851; <title>DNB</title>), the Scottish dramatist, friend of
                        the <ref target="people.html#AikinArthur">Aikins</ref> and of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>.</note> she
                    drank tea with us, and very much pleased we were with her, &#8211; as good-natured, unaffected, and sensible a woman as I have ever
                    seen.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A month ago you might, perhaps, have been gratified by knowing what were my thoughts of the state of Spain; now, I
                    suppose, everybody thinks alike. But I have always said that, if the deliverance of Europe were to take place in our days, there
                    was no country in which it was so likely to begin as Spain; and this opinion, whenever I expressed it, was received with wonder,
                    if not with incredulity. But there is a spirit of patriotism, a glowing and proud remembrance of the past, a generous shame for
                    the present, and a living hope for the future, both in the Spaniards and Portuguese, which convinced me that the heart of the
                    country was sound, and that those nations are likely to rise in the scale, perhaps, Duppa, when we are sunk. Not that England will
                    sink yet, but there is more public virtue in Spain than in any other country under Heaven. I have no fears nor doubts concerning
                    that country; the spirit of liberty is not to be extinguished: nothing but that spirit could possibly check the progress of
                    Bonaparte; this will check, and, it is my firm conviction, eventually destroy him. William Bryan<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had clearly met his old acquaintance the copperplate engraver and religious visionary William Bryan
