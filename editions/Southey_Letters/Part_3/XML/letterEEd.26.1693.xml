                        1878), 82-83 [in part; dated 14 October].</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wrote you a Letter which has to travel into Wales on its way, &amp; will not reach you much before this.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Matilda Mary Betham, 10 October [1809], Letter 1690.</note> And I now
                    write in haste, merely to reply about the frames.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had commissioned frames for
                        miniatures painted by Betham during her visit in August-September 1809 of Southey himself and of <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref> and <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>; see Southey to Mary Barker, 8 September 1809, Letter 1679.</note> My
                    secret calculation was about five &amp; twenty shillings for each frame, - &amp; I would not have them less handsome &amp; less
                    suitable to their contents for the sake of saving eight or ten shillings upon each. In things which occur so seldom oeconomy is no
                    object. So let them be by all means square, - &amp; if they cost six seven or eight &amp; twenty I shall not think it too much. &#8211;
                    Do not hurry yourself &#8211; but keep them till every body has seen them to whom you wish them to be shown.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Why do you make any sort of apologies for what can stand in need of none? - You know me by this time well enough to
                    know that I am a plain speaker, &amp; you ought to believe me when I say that we were very sorry to part with you, - &amp; shall
                    be right heartily glad to see you again. If any apologies were needful they would be on our part, that we did not amuse you better
                    &amp; show you more of the country. When next you come <del>you</del> we will hope for better weather, - &amp; when my fortune
                    improves I may [MS torn] one day afford to keep a <hi rend="ital">cart</hi>. As for my hesitation or slowness at professions, - do
                    you &lt;not&gt; know how I hate <hi rend="ital">professors</hi> of fine feeling, &amp; how I suspect all sentimentalists?
                        <del>xxx</del>
          <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">Mary</ref> I dare say will write to you when she comes home from <ref target="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</ref>. I dare not promise as much for <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, - it is her incurable fault that she scarcely on any possible occasion can be induced to write to any person
                    except her sisters, - &amp; me. The Cart&#8217;s tail might perhaps have remedied this some years ago, - &amp; you know I could find
                    employment for a Cart in this way, as well as in jaunting about the Lakes. - I perfectly understand why she dislikes letter
                    writing, and how exceedingly foolish her dislike is, but <del>it is something</del> of what use is it, like a Physician, to
                    understand the nature of what you know you cannot cure?</p>
