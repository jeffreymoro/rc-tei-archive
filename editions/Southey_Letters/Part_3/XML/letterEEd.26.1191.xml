        <p rend="indent1"> I have received since my last the very welcome intelligence from my brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> that he &amp; his ship return to England with the May convoy. what time he may be expected is doubtful, because
                    just at the same time I learnt from a <ref target="people.html#BedfordHenry">brother of Bedfords</ref>, who is in the Admiralty
                    that the Amelia was coming home with the June convoy.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Southey&#8217;s ship HMS <hi rend="ital">Amelia</hi> was a 38-gun H&#233;b&#233;-class frigate of the French navy captured in 1796 and commissioned into the
                        navy. He was currently serving in the West Indies as part of the British campaign to achieve naval dominance in the Caribbean
                        during the Napoleonic wars.</note> the difference in these accounts may perhaps be reconciled by supposing that in the West
                    Indies it is called the May convoy because it sails in May, &amp; in England the June one, because it is expected to arrive in
                    June. Tom thinks the frigate must go into dock to receive a thorough repair, &amp; in that case, hopes to get a months leave of
                    absence.</p>

                    now needs wait some days longer in Scotland than would else be needful, before you can reach him with a remittance. The reason is,
                    that <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> &amp; I &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">your

                    He knew my intended movements, &amp; as he did not recollect them when he directed his letter, must abide the inconvenience as a
                    necessary &amp; not unfit consequence of forgetfulness.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been looking long for a letter from you, &#8211; perhaps there may be one lingering on the way from <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, or I may find one there on my return.

                    dispossess the old curate at Midsummer, &amp; thinks it better to delay writing till then when he may tell me the thing is
