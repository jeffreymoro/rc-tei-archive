                    unfitness, in your falling by &lt;the&gt; hand of a fool that I have no apprehensions upon that score. This wretch too will turn

                        believed that these words, uttered by Charles Stuart, Baron Stuart de Rothesay (1779&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), British envoy
                        to the Spanish juntas in French-occupied Spain, had referred to his offer of financial aid for Spanish soldiers. Believing
                        that he had been insulted, he intended to challenge Stuart to a duel. Stuart and other witnesses declared that the words

        <p rend="indent1"> In the height of our indignation here at the infamy in Portugal, one of our first thoughts was what yours would be.
                    We in England had the consolation to see that the country redeemed itself by the general outcry which burst out. Never was any
                    feeling within my recollection so general. I did not meet a man who was not boiling-over with shame &amp; rage. I am sure that for
                    the first week after the news arrived had Sir Hew D.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s exasperation was caused by
                        the Convention of Cintra, signed on 30 August, whereby the French army commanded by Jean-Andoche Junot (1771&#8211;1813) and
                        defeated by Anglo-Portuguese forces under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington) (1769&#8211;1852;
                            <title>DNB</title>) at Vimeiro on 21 August, was allowed to retreat intact, with its weapons, from Portugal. Wellesley,
                        who did not sign the Convention, had been superseded in command by two veteran generals, just arrived in Iberia, who were
                        content to make peace: Sir Harry Burrard (1755&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>) and Sir Hew Dalrymple (1750&#8211;1830;<title>
                        DNB</title>). Public outcry led to an inquiry, after which Burrard and Dalrymple never again took command.</note> appeared in
                    any part of England he would have been torn to pieces. My cry was break the terms &amp; deliver up the wretch who signed them to
                    the French, with a rope round his neck, &amp; this is what Oliver Cromwell would have done. Oh Christ &#8211; this England, this noble
                    country, &#8211; that hands so mighty &amp; a heart so sound should have a face all leprosy, &amp; a head fit for nothing but the vermin
                    that burrow in it!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wrote to you in Spain, immediately on hearing you were gone there, &amp; having occasion to write to <ref target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> inclosed to him the letter,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Neither

                        <del>by some</del> with the dispatches. The letter I rather think has not reached you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Spaniards <hi rend="ital">will</hi> be victorious. I am prepared to hear of many reverses, but this has from
                    the beginning been as much a faith as an opinion with me, &#8211; &amp; you who <del>xxx</del> know the Spaniards will understand on
                    what ground it has been formed. I am glad you know them, &amp; their country &amp; their language, which in spite of your
                    Romanized ears, becomes a man&#8217;s mouth better than any other in present use, except perhaps our own. Come &amp; see me when you
                    have nothing to call you elsewhere &amp; the wind of inclination may set in this way, &#8211; &amp; we will talk about Spain, &amp;
                    retravel your route, a part of which I remember as vividly as I do my fathers house.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Find out a woman who you can esteem, &amp; love will grow more surely out of esteem, than esteem will out of love.
                    Your soul would then find anchorage. There are fountain springs of delight in the heart of man, which gush forth at the sight of
