                        already.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> A reference to Southey’s note, inserted at the top of the letter: ‘
                        Especially as you chiefly <del>read</del> (I may say exclusively) read those from whom least was to be got – which is also
                        another sin of the age.’</note> Your letter contains the usual blunders which the ignorance of the age is continually making,
                    &amp; upon which &amp; nothing else rests the whole point at issue between such critics as Gog<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Gog and Magog were a pair of legendary giants, who, according to London legend, were captured and chained
                        to the gates of the palace of the mythical first king of Britain, on the site of which the Guildhall stands. Carvings of the
                        giants are kept at the Guildhall and used in the Lord Mayor’s show each year.</note><ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</ref> &amp; myself – you couple Homer &amp; Virgil under the general term of
                    classics, &amp; suppose that both are to be admired upon the same grounds. A century ago this was better understood, – the critics
                    of that age did read what they <del>had</del> wrote about, &amp; understand what they read, &amp; they knew that whoever thought
                    the one of these writers a good poet must upon that very principle then hold the other to be a bad one. Greek &amp; Latin poetry
                    Grosvenor are as opposite as French &amp; English, (– excepting always Lucretius &amp; Catullus), &amp; you may &lt;as well&gt;
                    suppose it possible for a man equally to admire Shakespere &amp; Racine, as Homer &amp; Virgil – that is, provided he knows why
                    &amp; wherefore he admires either. <ref target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> will tell you this – &amp; I suppose you
                    will admit him to be authority upon this subject. </p><p rend="indent1"> You ask me about the Catholick question. I am against admitting them to power of any kind, because the immediate
                    use which would be made of it would be to make proselytes for which Catholicism is of all religions best adapted. Every ship which
                    had a Catholic Captain would have a Catholick chaplain, &amp; in no very long time a Catholick crew: so on in the army, – just as
                    every rich Catholick in England at this time has his mansion surrounded by converts fairly purchased – the Jerningham family in
                        Norfolk<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> The family of Sir William Jerningham, 6th Baronet (1736–1809) and his wife,
                        Frances Lady Jerningham, and of Sir George Jerningham, 7th Baronet (1771–1851) and Frances, Lady Jerningham, lived at Cossy
                        Hall, Norfolk.</note> for instance. – I object to any concessions, because no concessions can possibly satisfy them; &amp; I
                    think it palpable folly to talk or think of tolerating any sect (beyond what <del>xxx</del> they already enjoy) whose first
                    principle is that their Church is infallible, &amp; therefore bound to persecute all others. This is the principle of Catholicism
                    every where; &amp; when they can they avow it &amp; act upon it. </p><p rend="indent1"> If our statesmen (God forgive me for degrading the word!) – if our traders in politics – the <hi rend="ital">Tantara-rara’s</hi><note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey’s disparaging term for the noisy MPs in the House of

                        <title>DNB</title>); see <title>The Dramatic Works of John O’Keeffe Esq.</title>, 4 vols (London, 1798), III, pp. 349–90.
                        ‘Tantara-rara, Fools All Fools All’ was also a popular song from Henry Fielding’s (1707–1754; <title>DNB</title>) play The
                        Lottery (1732).</note> had better information of how things are going on abroad – they would not talk of the distinction
                    between Catholicks &amp; Protestants as political parties being extinct. But for that distinction Prussia could not have retained
                        <del>xxxxx</del> its conquests from Austria, – &amp; that distinction Bonaparte is at this time endeavouring to profit by.
                    There is a regular conspiracy or system carrying on to propagate Popery in the North of Germany, – of which Coleridge could
                    communicate much if he would, he knowing the main directors of this new Propaganda at Rome. The mode of doing it is curious – they
                        <del>teach</del> bring the people first to believe in Jacob Behmen,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jakob Böhme
                        (1575–1624), the German mystic, shoemaker and author of <title>Aurora</title> (1612), admired by German intellectuals and
                        Catholic converts including Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829) and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling
                        (1775–1854).</note> &amp; then they may believe in any thing else. All fanaticism tends to this point – You will see something
                    which bears upon this subject in Espriella<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Fanatics of various sects in England are
                        discussed in Letters 68–70 of <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the Spanish</title>

                    country than any body could possibly suspect, who has not, as I have done, cast a searching eye into the holes &amp; corners of
                    society, &amp; watched it under-currents, – which carry more water than the upperstream –</p><p rend="indent1"> A Catholick Sea Captain would soon have a Catholick crew. Irishmen would enter with him, – &amp; a crew of which
                    the majority should be Irish Catholicks would very soon find their way to Brest. I could say a great deal upon this subject, &amp;
                    tell you some curious facts – if you really wanted to enter into the matter but it takes up time to write these things, &amp; when
                    I write letters, it is either because I have something to say, or in mere idleness – as an excuse for laying aside something else
                    of which I have grown tired, &amp; yet cannot conscientiously long put by without some such apology for so doing.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have a favour to ask of <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</ref>, which is that be will do me
                    the favour to send me the titles of such Portugueze manuscripts as are in the Museum.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        The British Museum.</note> There cannot be so many as to make this a thing of much trouble, – &amp; there are some of great

                    most acceptable service, which it would most highly gratify me to do, &amp; for which I should receive very essential services in
                    return. There are I believe in particular, some papers of Jeronimo Lobo’s<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jerónimo Lobo
                        (1593–1678) travelled to Ethiopia and to Goa; papers concerning his journey were found, in the twentieth century, in the
                        library of the Duke of Palmela, and in the Ajuda library at Lisbon.</note> concerning Abyssinia, &amp; a MSS. of which Vincent
                    has made some use.– I am particularly desirous of effecting this, not merely <del>from the</del> because I could do nothing which
                    would be more essentially useful to my own views there, but also because of the true &amp; zealous love which I feel for
                    Portugueze literature, in which I am now as well skilled as in that of my own country, &amp; into which, whenever the reign of
                    priestcraft is at an end, I trust to be one day adopted. – You perhaps have little conception how infinitely important the subject
                    of my History – or series of Histories is &amp; what a range of information it necessarily takes in. Whenever you can find your
                    way here you shall see good proof of my labour.</p><p rend="indent1"> I pray you remember that what I think upon the Catholick question by no means disposes me in favour of the new
                    ministry – of whom those that are not fools are thorough rascals, &amp; pledged to that question deep enough for damnation. I Mr
                    Bedford am – as you know – a Court Pensioner &amp; have as you know well deserved to be so – for my great &amp; devoted attachment
                    to the person of his majesty &amp; the measures of his government – Nevertheless Mr. Bedford his ministers are men of tried &amp;
                    convicted incapacity, – they have <hi rend="ital">always</hi> been the contempt of Europe, whether they can be more despised than
                    their predecessors have uniformly &amp; deservedly been, I know not; – I cannot tell how far below nothing the political barometer
                    can sink till it has been tried. There is one Paull<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> James Paull (1770–1808;

                        (1760–1842; <title>DNB</title>) to account for misgovernment in India.</note> – a simple man, but right honest; – &amp; there
