        <p rend="indent1"> You would have heard from me a fortnight ago if I had not been disappointed &#8211; the <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">young one</ref>  has proved a girl &#8211; &amp; I believe my main reason for
                    being sorry is that I have lost the pleasure of calling a boy by your name. A few days after her delivery <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> became very unwell, with a return of the same dysenteric symptoms which she had
                    had two months before. she is however now well recovered, &amp; has this evening for the first time, drank tea out of her
                    room.</p>
        <p rend="indent5"> ____</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Seven weeks have past away since the few lines above were written, &amp; in time we have had our share of
                    suffering. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> has had the croup &amp; been saved from it, &#8211; but last night we
                    lost <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Emma</ref> by a violent bilious attack. &#8211; We are as well as can be expected after such
                    a shock, &#8211; for nothing could be more unexpected. &#8211; I had indeed oftentimes suspected there was something wrong in the childs
                    inside &amp; were we at Bristol, that should have been now ascertained. Enough of this. These losses are but for a time, &#8211; this is
                    not the first that we have sustained, &amp; probably will not be the last. Neither I nor my children seem made of very lasting
                    materials, &#8211; in fact it is very unlikely that my children should be. It is not altogether a fanciful analogy between a man who
                    cultivates his mental faculties exclusively, &amp; <del>flowers</del> &lt;plants&gt; which are improved by culture in an
                    artificial soil; &#8211; they bring forth fine flowers, &#8211; but either they do not seed at all, &#8211; or the seedlings wither away. I often
                    think of what D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Jarrold has said of pointers, &#8211; the finest of the breed hardly ever grow up.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas Jarrold (1770&#8211;1853; <title>DNB</title>), a physician who authored <title>Anthropologia

                    nature &amp; such I acknowledge it to be, severely as I am likely to suffer by it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am daily expecting to hear of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Sir Dominies</ref> 
                    marriage, which was to take place this month. He will do well at Durham, &amp; has every reason hitherto to think himself a
                    fortunate man.</p>

                    these sad interruptions of sickness, &#8211; of which we have had four serious ones since the beginning of the year. As it is I am in
                    the last section but one, &#8211; &amp; as soon I can recover heart to set to it again, a very few days will compleat it. Indeed I
                        <del>have</del> expected to have concluded it this week, little thinking how my hand was to be palsied. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I can hardly tell you how eagerly we expect your coming, &#8211; tho at the same time I hardly dare expect any thing,
                    such is my ever-present feeling of the uncertainty of all our hopes &amp; prospects. Yet if it please God that we should meet &#8211;

                    sweeten, as soon as we hear you &amp; <ref target="people.html#JardineDavid">David</ref>  are at Liverpool on your way. &#8211;
                    I wish we were nearer each other, &amp; half repent that we are not so, yet I have rather <hi rend="ital">sunk</hi> here, than
                    cast anchor by choice, for I never had funds that enabled me to look about, &amp; chuse a resting place. Whether I may ever remove
                    is very doubtful. if I do &#8211; it will be to Bath in preference to any other place. But I have now broken ground in yonder church
                    yard, &#8211; &amp; to a man who has no other freehold &#8211; even a family grave is something like a tie.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God bless you Danvers. Do not suppose me more cast down than I really am, I am more sad than sorrowful &amp; more
                    thoughtful than sad.</p>
