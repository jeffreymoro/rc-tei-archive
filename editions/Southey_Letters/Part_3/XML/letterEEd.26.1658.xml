                        it was considered unsuitable for him; see Southey to Walter Scott, 8 August 1809 (Letter 1666) and Southey to Grosvenor

                        Lonsdale</ref>, whose countenance is of such consequence, that the thing (like every thing indeed in these
                    two counties) may be considered as in his gift. I can apply to him thro two channels &amp; both I believe good ones, &#8211; but it is
                    likely that a letter from Lord Bute<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Stuart, 4th Earl of Bute (1744&#8211;1814;
                            <title>DNB</title>).</note> would be of service. Will you ask him to write to Lord Lonsdale upon this subject &#8211; it will be
                    less unpleasant for you than for me, &#8211; nevertheless if you think the application would come better from myself &#8211; which I do not, I
                    will make it. The facts to be stated are. . that there is a disposition on the part of <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> to serve me, &#8211; that this is a suitable thing because I am on the spot, &amp; that if it be thought too good for
                    me, as probably it may, tho I do not know its value, the Cumberland may be divided from the Northumberland Estates, &amp; two
                    persons provided for instead of one. A word from Lord Lonsdale will command this or any thing else. <del>xxxx</del>
