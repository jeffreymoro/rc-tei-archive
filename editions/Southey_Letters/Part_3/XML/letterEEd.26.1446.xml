          <salute>My dear Scott</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter followed me to London, &#8211; the hope which it held out that we might meet there, &amp; the endless round
                    of occupations in which I was involved during the whole nine weeks of my absence prevented me from thanking you for Marmion,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Scott&#8217;s new poem (1808).</note> so soon as I ought, &amp; should otherwise have done.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Half the poem I had read at <ref target="people.html#HeberRichard">Hebers</ref> before my own copy arrived. I went
                    punctually to breakfast with him, &amp; he was long enough dressing <del>for me to</del> &lt;to let me&gt; devour so much of it. &#8211;
                    The story is made of better materials than the Lay,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</title> (1805).</note> yet they are not so well fitted together. <del>On</del> As a whole
                    it has not pleased me <del>well</del> &lt;so much&gt;, in parts it has pleased me more. There is nothing so finely conceived in
                    your former poem as the death of Marmion, &#8211; there is nothing finer in its conception any where.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The introductory epistles I did not wish away, because as poems they gave me great pleasure, but I wished them at
                    the end of the volume, or at the beginning, anywhere except where they were. My taste is perhaps peculiar in disliking all
                    interruptions in narrative poetry. When the poet<del>s</del> lets his story sleep &amp; talks <del>of</del> in his own person it
                    has to me the same sort of unpleasant effect that is produced at the end of an Act; <del>when</del> you are alive to know what
                    follows, &amp; lo &#8211; down comes the curtain &amp; the fiddlers begin with their abominations. The general opinion is with me in
                    this particular instance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am highly gratified by <del>your</del> the manner in which you speak of <ref target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke Whites</ref> Remains.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Remains of Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham</title> (1807), which were edited by Southey.</note> That book has been
                    received to my hearts desire. The edition (750) sold in less than three months, &amp; there is every probability that it will
                    obtain a steady sale, so as to produce something considerable to his mother &amp; sisters.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Henry Kirke White&#8217;s mother, Mary (d. 1833) and sisters Hannah (bap. 1799&#8211;1813), Frances Moria (1791&#8211;1854) and Catherine Bailey
                        (1794&#8211;1889).</note> I asked <ref target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</ref> to befriend this poor boy when he was
                    living, by noticing his little volume, &amp; he told me he would look for it: perhaps he forgot it, &#8211; perhaps he thought it was
                    befriending him to let him pass unmolested.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to Neville White, 9 March 1807,
                        Letter 1284.</note> It is not very likely that he will &#8216;spit his venom in a dead-mans ear&#8217; nor is it of much consequence. The
                    main sale of the book will lie among the religious public, &amp; the Edinburgh review is in their Index Expurgatorius.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning a list of books to be censored before they can be read by Roman Catholics, but applied
                        here to all the &#8216;religious public&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I saw Frere<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> J. H. Frere (1769&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>): poet, diplomat,
                        Hispanist, Frere had parodied Southey&#8217;s radical ballads in &#8216;The Friend of Humanity and the Knife-grinder&#8217; in the
                            <title>Antijacobin</title> (1797). Three of Frere&#8217;s translations from the <title>Poema del Cid</title> were appended to
                        Southey&#8217;s edition of the <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (1808).</note> in London, &amp; he has promised to let me print
                    his translations from the Poema del Cid. They are admirably done, indeed I never saw any thing so difficult to do, &amp; done so
                    excellently, except your supplement to Sir Tristram.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had praised Scott&#8217;s

                    versification than myself, &amp; yet this task of giving a specimen of that wonderful Poem I shrank from, fearing the difficulty.
                    At present I am putting together the materials of my introduction, which with the supplementary notes will take about three months
                    in <del>preparing &amp;</del> printing, &#8211; at least it will be as long before the book can be published. The price of paper stops

                    is a little like what Nourjahad used to find after one of his long naps.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> The protagonist

                    held the same feelings with me, &#8211; &amp; yet it should seem that they have been sleeping [MS torn] the great events of these latter
                    years, not I. There is a base &amp; cowardly feeling abroad, which would humble this country at the feet of France. This feeling I
                    have every where been combating with vehemence, but as at the same time I have execrated with equal vehemence the business of
                        Copenhagen.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> In September 1807, British forces had bombarded Copenhagen, then neutral,

                    &amp; the endless debates upon the subject which have no other meaning &amp; can have no other end than that of harrassing the

                    &amp; as the bite of the tarantula has no cure but dancing, so will there be none but singing for this. Great poets have no envy;
                    &#8211; little ones are full of it. I doubt whether any man ever criticised a good poem maliciously, unless he had written a bad one
