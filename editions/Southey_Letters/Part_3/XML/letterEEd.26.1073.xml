                        Bible.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Field (dates unknown) printed a pocket-sized edition of the Bible, known
                        as the &#8216;Pearl Bible&#8217; due to its diminutive size, but also referred to as &#8216;Field&#8217;s Bible of 10,000 Errors&#8217; (1653) due to the
                        amount of misprints in it. One of the most famous errors was in 1 Corinthians 6.9: &#8216;Know ye not that the unrighteous [instead
                        of &#8216;righteous&#8217;] shall inherit the kingdom of God?&#8217; Field was rumoured to have accepted a bribe from the Presbyterians to alter
                        Acts 6.3 to read &#8216;Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,
                        whom we [instead of &#8216;ye&#8217;] may appoint over this business&#8217;, so that it confirmed men&#8217;s right to choose their own
                        priests.</note> I have a use for the story, &amp; do not tell anybody that I have asked you for it &#8211; for a reason which if you
                    come to the mountains to Garagantuafy,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey refers to the working up of the amusing
                        miscellany entitled &#8216;the Butler&#8217; in the manner of <title>La Vie de Gargantua et de Pantagruel</title> (1532&#8211;1552) by Fran&#231;ois
                        Rabelais (c. 1494&#8211;1553). This was not written and Southey&#8217;s miscellany/ novel, <title>The Doctor</title> (1834&#8211;1847)
                        superseded it.</note> you will find worth knowing.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey included information about
                        misprinting the Bible in Letter 54 of his <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the
                            Spanish</title> (1807), but there is no reference to Field&#8217;s Bible.</note>

                        to his and Bedford&#8217;s jointly edited anthology, <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title> (1807), which did not
                        include anonymous poems.</note> &#8211; introducing a half or whole sheet between Hopkins &amp; Dryden as the first of the

                    this be done you have among the papers which I gave you a ballad upon one of P. Eugenes victories over the Turks &#8211; copied from the
                    Europ. Magazine, which should go in as a good specimen of the ballads of that time &#8211; indeed I transcribed it for that
                        purpose.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The German ballad of Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663&#8211;1736), celebrating his
