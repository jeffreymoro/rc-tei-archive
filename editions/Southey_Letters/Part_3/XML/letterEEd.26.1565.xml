                        appears that Thomas Rees was contributing material on South America and the Pacific to the <title>Cyclopedia, or, An Universal

                        expanded edition, updated by Thomas Rees&#8217;s friend, Abraham Rees (1743&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), was published from 1778&#8211;1788;
                        Abraham Rees was then commissioned by its publishers, Longman and Rees, to edit a new version, which became known as Rees&#8217;s

                    facsimiles of these in the Cyclop&#230;dia, they would be the most curious things there, as specimens of the art in its most savage

                    the pride of our fine literature, but rejecting all the indifferent pieces even of the <del>best</del> &lt;greatest&gt; writers,
                    &amp; giving only the very best of all the secondary &amp; inferior ones. I would so far improve upon the Italian plan as to
                        <del>give</del> prefix such an account of every author as would in fact be a review of his whole works, &amp; thus introduce

                            <title>DNB</title>); Samuel Daniel (1562/3&#8211;1619; <title>DNB</title>); the brothers Phineas Fletcher (1582&#8211;1650;
                            <title>DNB</title>) and Giles Fletcher (1585/6&#8211;1623; <title>DNB</title>); Abraham Cowley (1618&#8211;1667; <title>DNB</title>),
                            <title>Davideis: A Sacred Poem of The Troubles of David</title> (1656).</note> &amp;c &#8211; so that the various introductions
                    should form a connected &amp; complete History of English Poetry without any thing like antiquarian pedantry, or any bibliological
                    rubbish, &#8211; but &lt;exhibiting&gt; in as readable &amp; interesting a form as possible, all the results of antiquarian &amp;
                    bibliological research, so far as they are of any importance to the philosophy of literary history. The probable extent of such a
                    work would be about <del>as</del> the same as the current editions of Johnsons Collection,<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Johnson (1709&#8211;1784; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets: With Critical
                            Observations on their Works</title> (1779&#8211;1781).</note> because the elder &amp; later writers whom it would be proper to
                    admit would be equal in bulk to that quantity of trash which would be discarded. &#8211; As this would be the best Collection that has
                    ever yet appeared, so might it be made the most beautiful at no greater expence than is generally wasted in those &#8216;embellishments&#8217;
                    which are in reality no embellishments at all. I would have portraits, &amp; views of those places which are rendered interesting
                    by their connection either with the author or his works. &#8211; The house in which a Poet was born, or where he lived, &#8211; the scenes
                    which he has delighted to paint, &#8211; in short what are technically called <hi rend="ital">illustrations</hi>. And under each
                    portrait whenever it was possible, the authors name should be a facsimile of his handwriting. &#8211; This would be a great undertaking,
                    but I am confident that it could not fail of success. The mere circumstance of ridding the collection of all impurities would
                    alone &lt;be enough to&gt; recommend it in this age of Eclectic Reviews Family Shakesperes &amp; Evangelical Monday Newspapers. If
                    this plan is thought worthy of attention, I will write more fully upon the subject, for there are few things which I should like
                    better than to gird my loins for such a task. The only things which I could not do would be the correcting the press, as that
                    would occasion a delay incompatible with periodical publication.</p>
