                    Bedford here, &amp; let him give me earnest &lt;how&gt; of the visit he is to pay next year. My beds are full &#8211; for Tom is here,
                    on leave of absence to recover his health &#8211; this however is of little matter when the town is so near. You would see me not indeed
                    in all my glory, but still in great glory &#8211; all my books from Bristol have arrived,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    own, &amp; by the time you can arrive, the shelves will be finished &amp; filled with them. Among other things for your inspection
                    is a small collection of coins, where you will find demi letters &amp; semi-demi-letters, &amp; demi-semi-demi-letters enough for
                    half a days delight. There are some very fine ones among them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Bedford sent me a blank receipt to sign for my pension some three weeks ago. I signed it &#8211; but who received the
                    money Heaven knows. He told me little was to be expected, &amp; none has arrived.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> This
                        was sent with Southey to John Rickman, 8 August 1807, Letter 1351.</note>

                    quarto edition of 50 will be from 130 to 150 &#163;. I would have sold the edition &#8211; the Longmen object to this, &amp; offer advances
                    instead. They write very civilly &#8211; indeed friendlily, &#8211; still all this is proof that my books have not the sale which they ought
                    to have. In all probability I shall agree with them to edite Don Quixote &#8211; which they talk of printing, somewhat splendidly with

                        (1612&#8211;1620). In his 25 August letter to Longman, Southey advised that the &#8216;old edition of Don Quixote, if carefully collated
                        and corrected, will, I believe, be very superior to any other&#8217;; see Southey to Longmans, 25 August 1807, Letter 1354.</note>

                        departments.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey did not edit a Catalogue Raisonn&#233; of current literature. For
                        his reply to Longman, see Southey to Longmans, 20 September 1807, Letter 1360.</note> These things are work of over hours
