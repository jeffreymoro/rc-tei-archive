                        in Warter, Letters of Southey (1856); MS gives no year, but Curry, &#8216;Misdated letters and missing names&#8217;, notes
                        correct date is 28 July [1805] (which corroborates Southey&#8217;s dating &#8216;Sunday&#8217;).</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I was uneasy till your letter arrived &#8211; because <ref target="people.html#BunburyHenryWilliam">Bunbury</ref> here
                    had heard that your brother was dangerously ill with a white swelling, &amp; I had attributed your silence to that cause. It is
                    however clear that nothing is the matter, as you mention nothing; &#8211; probably the gout has been converted by some blunder into the
                    worse disease. &#8211; I see alas by the non-contents of your letter that you have forgotten what I am reminded of by an empty
                    exchequer. &#8211;</p>

                    whose Nature <del>did</del> does not seem to have designed for a gentleman, &amp; whom the company of graziers &amp; butchers has
                    &lt;certainly&gt; not improved. He took no notice of the connection between us, if so it may be called. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You are right about the necessity of Anglicizing my scene &#8211; &amp; have set me right about it: for my ideas are so
                    accustomed to run in narrative that I have everything to learn for the drama. I have a love of foreign costume, &amp; had not
                    thought that what was excellent in a poem would be faulty in a play.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey was
                        contemplating writing a play, stimulated by an offer, sent via Wynn, from Matthew Gregory Lewis (1775&#8211;1818;
