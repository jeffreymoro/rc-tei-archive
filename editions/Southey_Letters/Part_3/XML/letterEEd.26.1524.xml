                    pursue this work of supererogation) I am once more getting on, &amp; shall soon be in the very heart of the story.</p>

                    of Thalaba is gone at last, &amp; that I expect in the course of a week or ten days to receive the first proof of the new one from

                    know but one historical character which is portrayed with equal vividness of truth, &#8211; &amp; that is the Ras Michael of Bruce.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Ras Michael was the adviser to the King of Ethiopia, and the country&#8217;s <hi rend="ital">de
