        <p rend="indent1"> You are perfectly right in supposing I meant a <hi rend="ital">sandwich tray</hi>. 36/<hi rend="sup">s</hi> was

                    the difference of price therefore surprizes me. However we have no friend whom we can trouble at Liverpool, &amp; perhaps <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref>  speaks of what <hi rend="ital">was</hi>
                    the price there three years ago.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You are right too in concluding that if I had received any letters from <ref target="people.html#SmithThomas">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smith</ref> I should have answered them. One letter he wrote to me let me know his sister had arrived at
                    Lisbon, &amp; no other has ever reached me, &#8211; her return I learnt only from you, &amp; accidentally from Edinburgh by way of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref>. this, on my part, I also thought odd, when I thought about it &#8211; but now
                    the mystery is explained, &amp; I will without delay write to him.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to

                    contrive to go to Bownham together, &#8211; that I shall make my journey is as certain as any thing can be, for my next book (the Cid)
                        .<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s edition <title>Chronicle of the Cid, from the Spanish</title> was

                        Southey wanted to preserve his anonymity as the author, because he believed negative reviews of his work by his enemies
                        affected their sales.</note> when that has been effected I shall acknowledge it: but if it be talked of in any private circle,
                    these things soon get wind. I am so little known in prose, except by my immediate friends, that there seems little reason to think
                    that the book will be imputed to me. I have just corrected the eleventh sheet of the last volume; &#8211; four, or five more at farthest
                    compleat it. Your copy shall be sent. I wish it were published, &amp; wish also it may have a good sale, not only for a
                    substantial reason which need not be explained, but also because three volumes do not hold half of what I had to say, &amp; I
                    should be very glad to have encouragement to say it all. <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, who sees the proofs,

                    only because this is such a little island that we who count distance by miles, think it a long way between Bristol &amp; <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. nearly 300 miles has a long sound &#8211; call it 70 leagues &amp; it does not appear so
