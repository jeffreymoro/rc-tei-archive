                        8 February 1804. The crew (including Lieutenant Edward Barker (d. 1810), who was probably a cousin of Mary Barker) made their way to
                        shore in open boats and became prisoners of war in France.</note> you can have no accounts before the admiralty, &amp; must
                    therefore make yourself easy till those accounts arrive. Moreover shipwrecks of that kind are more disagreeable than dangerous,
                    the crew of a frigate know how to bestir themselves &amp; are enough to help themselves. fatal wrecks usually happen from wants of
                    hands &#8211; that is they become fatal, because the men cannot help themselves.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I do not like your sketch<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had commissioned Barker to create
                        illustrations for <title>Madoc</title> (1805). In the end the proposed vignettes were not carried out, as the poem was
                        published with only two engravings.</note> &#8211; because I abhor the allegorical in painting, &amp; think it ought for ever to

                        the legendary prince Madoc, hero of Southey&#8217;s poem, which begins with the strife that followed Owain&#8217;s death. No engraving of

        <p rend="indent1"> The more I think of these prints the less am I disposed to tolerate anything that would interfere with the province
                    of poetry. Therefore I will have no striking part of the poem represented &#8211; because the artist must either exceed or weaken the
                    idea. The vignettes must all be to elucidate. For the first I wish to get a view of Holyhead<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> The principal harbour of Anglesey, North Wales.</note> from the water. Then the ship of Madoc, copied from
