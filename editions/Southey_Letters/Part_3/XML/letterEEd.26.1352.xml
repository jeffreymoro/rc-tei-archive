                        decided to stay at <ref target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref>, Southey had sent for his books and other belongings

                    full &amp; proper sense of your very kind &amp; very friendly attention to him. Towards women I suspect that his attachments are
                    not very lasting; – his friendships, as they are better founded seem to me more durable. I had good opportunity of seeing him
                    thoroughly in the course of the three summers &amp; autumns which he past, at <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. A
                    little too much inclination for pleasure, a little too high a value for worldly fortune, are his obvious faults, &amp; as far as I
                    could perceive, his only ones. Of the first time will cure him. the second lies deeper, &amp; tho this might contribute under
                    favourable circumstances to make <del>his</del> a shining character, it <del>would I fear prevent him from becoming</del>
                    &lt;never can exist in&gt; a great one. I recognised in him many parts of my own natural character, – a quickness of perception
                    which makes a man speak rapidly &amp; listen impatiently, – &amp; a reluctance to continuous study, which I have rather
                    compromised than cured, by contriving to do many things at once, &amp; so finding variety in going from one to the other.</p><p rend="indent1"> The Polish <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> is as you suspect the same person who so very
                    unwarrantably applied to you on the score of his acquaintance with me and <ref target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylor</ref>. His history is not a very sane one since that time, &amp; not a very fortunate one. He is at this

                        was not completed.</note> What will become of him Heaven knows. He would take to no other trade but Authorship, &amp; there is
                    a perpetual struggle between his indolence &amp; his vanity in that. His history would make a curious narrative &amp; by no means
                    an uninstructive one.</p><p rend="indent1"> By this time you will have received Espriella.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Letters from

                        whose captain from 1807 was George Miller (dates unknown).</note> partly occasioned by the very severe duty which fell upon
                    him during the winter &amp; spring. The ship was badly manned, &amp; the men she had on board were almost all landsmen; he thought
                    it more than probable that she would be lost for want of hands. There was no master – one of the Lieutenants was ill, &amp; the
                    other &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> were obliged to watch &amp; watch. This incessant labour &amp; still
                    more the incessant anxiety with which it was accompanied, every thing falling upon him as first Lieutenant, with the help of
                    wintry weather &amp; incessant gales fairly knocked him up, he having been broken in to a tropical climate. His old complaint
                    (hæmorrhoids) came on him with great violence, &amp; he has been obliged to declare himself unfit for service at present, &amp; to
                    require the Captain to order his state of health to be examined; – for the Captain would have worked him to death without remorse,
                    being one of the very worst men in the navy. Ill as <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> was this fellow abused the
                    surgeon for putting him on the sick list, &amp; declared that if the surgeon had said he was capable of duty he would have made
                    him do it. However there are some limits to this sort of tyranny. he could not refuse what <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> demanded. the Physician of the fleet, &amp; the Hospital Surgeons have declared it necessary for him to go to the
                    country to recruit, &amp; by this I <del>expect</del> suppose he is at Taunton, where he will rest awhile before he proceeds here.
                    All this is very important: we must not however overlook the good in it. had the Captain been sensible of the value of such an
                    Officer, &amp; paid him that respect to which he is entitled, &amp; has been accustomed, I have no doubt that he would have gone
                    on, till perhaps no rest could have been of any avail.</p><p rend="indent1"> We are in the midst of hurry &amp; confusion. Mine &amp; <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref>
