        <p rend="indent1"> I am just now enabled to give you some intelligence concerning my self. In this topsey-turveying of ministers <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> was very anxious as he says &#8216;to pick something out of the fire&#8217; for me. The
                    Registership of the Vice Admiralty Court in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lucie<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Caribbean
                        island of St Lucia.</note> was offered &#8211; worth about 600 &#163; a year &#8211; he wrote to me offering this &#8211; or as an alternative (the
                    only one in his power) a pension of 200 &#163;, &#8211; but before my answer<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> For this letter, see
                        Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 27 March 1807, Letter 1300.</note> could arrive it was necessary that he should chuse
                    for me, &amp; he judged rightly in taking the latter. Fees &amp; taxes will reduce this to 160 &#163; &#8211; the precise sum for which I
                    have hitherto been indebted to him &#8211; so that I remain with just the same income as before; &#8211; the different source from which it is
                    derived is however as you may suppose sufficiently grateful &#8211; for tho <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> could,
                    till now, well afford this, &amp; I had no reluctance in accepting it from one who is the oldest friend I have in the world
                        (<del>for</del> we have <del>xxx</del> been intimate for 19 years) &#8211; he has now nearly doubled his expenditure by marrying,
                    &amp; his wifes fortune could have been very little. This I suppose is asked for, &amp; granted to me as a man of letters &#8211; in
                    which character I feel myself fully &amp; fairly entitled to receive it, &#8211; &amp; you know me too well to suppose that it can make
                    me lose one jot of that freedom both of opinion &amp; of speech, without which I should think myself unworthy &#8211; not of this poor
                        <del>xxxx</del> earthly pittance alone &#8211; but of Gods air &amp; sunshine, &amp; my inheritance in heaven. </p>
