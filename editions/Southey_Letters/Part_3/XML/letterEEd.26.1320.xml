        <p>MS untraced; text is taken from The Autobiography,
                            Times, Opinions, and Contemporaries of Sir Egerton Brydges, 2 vols (London, 1834).  Previously  published:
                            The Autobiography, Times, Opinions, and Contemporaries of Sir Egerton Brydges, 2 vols (London, 1834), II,
                        pp. 257&#8211;261.Dating note: This letter is misdated 1809. From the internal evidence of the letter which relates to
                        Southey&#8217;s sending of Kirke White&#8217;s poems to Brydges that were published in 1807, the letter has been redated to that
                        year.</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I hold myself greatly indebted to you, not only for the list of authors, but for the very gratifying manner in
                    which you have introduced my name in the &#8216;Censura Literaria.&#8217;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey is described as
                        being &#8216;one of the most beautiful writers perhaps, which this nation ever produced&#8217; in Egerton Brydges, ed.,<title> Censura
                            Literaria: Containing Titles, Abstracts, and Opinions of Old English Books, with Original Disquisitions, Articles of
                            Biography, and other Literary Antiquities</title>, 10 vols (1805&#8211;1809), IV, p. 95. Brydges also wrote an article on the
                        poet John Codrington Warwick Bampfylde (1754&#8211;1796; <title>DNB</title>) after Southey published three of Bampfylde&#8217;s sonnets
                        and his ode &#8216;To the River Teign&#8217; in <title>Specimens of the Later English Poets</title>, 3 vols (London, 1807), III, pp.
                        434&#8211;437. The article, including two of Bampfylde&#8217;s poems, appeared in <title>Censura Literaria</title>, IV, pp. 301&#8211;303 A
                        subsequent article discusses William Jackson (1730&#8211;1803; <title>DNB</title>), musician, painter, and author, whose
                        relationship with Bampfylde is recounted in this letter. See <title> Censura Literaria</title>, IV, pp. 303&#8211;307. These
                        articles are presumably what prompted Southey to write to Brydges concerning Bampfylde, including material that he had
                        recounted to <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> previously; see <title>The Collected Letters of

                    immediately afterwards, when the impression which they made upon me was warm.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> He was the brother of Sir Charles,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir Charles Warwick Bampfylde, 5th
                        Baronet (1753&#8211;1823).</note> as you say. At the time when Jackson became intimate with him, he was just in his prime, and had
                    no other wish than to live in solitude, and amuse himself with poetry and music. He lodged in a farm-house near Chudleigh, and
                    would oftentimes come to Exeter in a winter morning, ungloved and open-breasted, before Jackson was up, (though he was an early
                    riser,) with a pocket full of music or poems, to know how he liked them. His relations thought this was a sad life for a man of
                    family, and forced him to London. The tears ran down Jackson&#8217;s cheeks when he told me the story. &#8216;Poor fellow,&#8217; said he, &#8216;there
                    did not live a purer creature, and, if they would have let him alone, he might have been alive now.&#8217;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When he was in London, his feelings having been forced out of their proper channel took a wrong direction, and he
                    soon began to suffer the punishment of debauchery. The Miss Palmer, to whom he dedicated his &#8216;Sonnets,&#8217;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title> Sixteen Sonnets</title> (1778).</note> (afterwards, and perhaps still, Lady Inchiquin,) was niece to
                    Sir Joshua Reynolds.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The niece of Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723&#8211;1792) was Mary Palmer
                        (1750&#8211;1820) who inherited most of his fortune. In 1792 she married Murrough O&#8217;Brien, 5th Earl of Inchiquin, later 1st Marquess
                        of Thomond (1726&#8211;1808).</note> Whether Sir Joshua objected to his addresses on account of his irregularities in London, or on
                    other grounds, I know not: but this was the commencement of his madness. He was refused admittance into the house: upon this, in a
                    fit of half-anger and half-derangement, he broke the windows, and was (little to Sir Joshua&#8217;s honour) sent to Newgate. Some weeks
                    after this had happened, Jackson went to London, and one of his first inquiries was for Bampfylde. Lady Bampfylde,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors"> Lady Jane Bampfylde (n&#233;e Codrington; 1720&#8211;1789) wife of Sir Richard Warwick Bampfylde, 4th
                        Baronet (1722&#8211;1776).</note> his mother, said she knew little or nothing about him; that she had got him out of Newgate, and he
                    was now in some beggarly place. &#8216;Where?&#8217; &#8216;In King Street, Holborn, she believed, but she did not know the number of the house.&#8217;
                    Away went Jackson, and knocked at every door till he found the right. It was a truly miserable place: the woman of the house was
                    one of the worst class of women in London. She knew that Bampfylde had no money, and that at that time he had been three days
                    without food. When Jackson saw him, there was all the levity of madness in his manners; his shirt was ragged, and black as a
                    coal-heaver&#8217;s, and his beard of a two months&#8217; growth. Jackson sent out for food, and said he was come to breakfast with him; and
                    he turned aside to a harpsichord in the room, literally, he said, to let him gorge himself without being noticed. He removed him
                    from hence, and, after giving his mother a severe lecture, obtained for him a decent allowance, and left him, when he himself
                    quitted town, in decent lodgings, earnestly begging him to write.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But he never wrote: the next news was that he was in a private madhouse, and Jackson never saw him more.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bampfylde spent the last twenty years of his life in an asylum.</note> Almost the last
                    time they met, he showed him several poems, among others a &#8216;Ballad on the Murder of David Rizzio.&#8217;<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> David Rizzio (1533&#8211;1566; <title>DNB</title>), an Italian courtier of Mary Stuart (1542&#8211;1587; Queen of Scotland
                        1542&#8211;1567; <title>DNB</title>). He was stabbed to death in the Queen&#8217;s presence at Holyroodhouse Palace, Edinburgh.</note>
                    &#8216;Such a ballad!&#8217; said he. He came that day to dine with Jackson, and was asked for copies. &#8216;I burned them,&#8217; was the reply. &#8216;I
                    wrote them to please you; you did not seem to like them, so I threw them in the fire.&#8217; After twenty years&#8217; confinement he
                    recovered his senses, but not till he was dying of consumption. The apothecary urged him to leave Sloane Street, (where he had
                    always been as kindly treated as he could be,) and go into his own country, saying that his friends in Devonshire would be very
                    glad to see him. But he hid his face, and answered, &#8216;No, Sir; they who knew me what I was, shall never see me what I am.&#8217; Some of
                    these facts I should have inserted in the specimens, had not <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref>
                    mislaid the letter in which I had written them down, and it was not found till too late </p>

                    music, and even made it intelligible to me, who am no musician. He knew nothing of the science; but would sit down to the
                    harpsichord, and produce combinations so wild that no composer would have ventured to think of, and yet so beautiful in their
                    effect that Jackson (an enthusiast concerning music) spoke of them, after the lapse of twenty years, with astonishment and
                    tears.</p>

                    Philip Sydney&#8217;s &#8216;Zelmane,&#8217; and Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8216;Florizel.&#8217;<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had borrowed from <ref target="people.html#HeberRichard">Heber</ref>, Feliciano de Silva (1491&#8211;1554), <title>Noveno libro de Amad&#237;s de Gaula,
