                        First Lord of the Admiralty from 1804. From 1802&#8211;1805 Melville&#8217;s use of public funds when Treasurer of the Admiralty
                        (1782&#8211;1800), was investigated by a Royal Commission. Melville, it was found, had allowed the diversion of government funds to
                        his personal accounts. On 9 April 1805 Melville was censured in the House of Commons for allowing the misuse of public funds.
                        He resigned and impeachment proceedings were commenced against him, but he was cleared of nearly all the charges in June
                        1806.</note> We on this side the border are of a very different opinion, &amp; I hear it loudly lamented that the House of
                    Lords should have taken the thing up as a party matter, in contempt &amp; defiance of the plain matter of fact. I have been asked
                    if I have any interest in getting a prisoner exchanged. Whether this can be done or no I know not, &#8211; but if there be any kind of

                        near Brest on 8 February 1804. British officers taken prisoner in the Napoleonic wars were often exchanged for French captives
                        and so returned to their home countries, where they remained on parole. Barker may have been a cousin of <ref target="people.hmtl#BarkerMary">Mary Barker</ref>, hence Southey&#8217;s efforts to mobilise assistance for him.</note> home,

                    visits about once in a month or six weeks as long as I was at Bristol. He is below the level of his Peers in society as to
                    information, neither speaking nor writing grammatically, but in every respect a better man to deal with than his brother, whose
                    humour amounted to insanity, in the strict &#8211; but not the legal sense of the term. I am on as good terms with him as I can be, &#8211;

                    should turn aside to inn at his house. The best circumstance is that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">his sister</ref> will
                    now live with him, who lived with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref> during the whole of my childhood,
                    &amp; who indeed is the only one of his family for whom I have any thing like a real family feeling. She I believe loves me well. </p>
