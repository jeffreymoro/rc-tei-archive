                    would be ridiculous – it is impossible that I should feel or think at one &amp; thirty as I did at nineteen, when the character
                    was moulded. the conception therefore such as it is must remain unaltered. I can only weed out the vicious language &amp;
                    feebleness which occur perpetually, &amp; sometimes rewrite a paragraph. but this is laborious work – weary, stale, flat &amp;

                    change. for probably before the year be out I shall get into a humour for poetry, &amp; this has the earliest claim of all my
                    projects. There is in the story abundant matter for magnificent &amp; for terrific parts, – the difficulty will be to excite a
                    sufficient human interest, – for Laderlad is out of reach of any human sympathy. I must therefore <del>make</del> keep Kalyal
                    always in the foreground.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> In <title>The Curse of Kehama</title>, Southey’s protagonist,
                        Ladurlad, kills the son of Kehama, while trying to protect his daughter, Kalyal, from rape. In revenge Kehama places a
                        powerful curse upon him which he has to endure for the rest of his life.</note> – My notion of the metre is only to rhyme it
                    in parts, either to increase the bustle – or to give ornament to what in itself is least interesting, the greater part remaining
                    unrhymed.</p><p rend="indent1"> If you could dramatize Thalaba, certainly he would be very much obliged to you, &amp; his poet also.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Bedford did not create a dramatised version of the poem.</note> I see grand pantomime scenes –
                    but know not how they are to be brought together. The poem itself has two shoots which might grow each into a separate existence
                    &amp; form preliminary poems – the stories of Okba, &amp; of Othatha. Shall I omit the story of the garden of Irem?<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ‘garden of Irem’ is described in <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), Book 1.</note>
                    – to which I am greatly inclined, in that case I should represent Zeinab as <hi rend="ital">wounded</hi> &amp; dying in the
                    desert, but this would be too painful a picture perhaps – &amp; the warning of the Angel ‘Remember Destiny has marked thee from
                        mankind<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), Book 1, line 669.</note> – is essential to the poem. Other alterations are to be
                    the end of the ninth book – all that poison story to come out – &amp; <hi rend="ital">not</hi> to kill Lobaba in Book 4. it will
                    make a better finish to leave Thalaba alone in the desert.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ‘poison story’ was
                        eliminated from the second edition of the poem (1809); the other alterations envisaged here were not made</note>. There are
                    350 copies still unsold. I expect that Madoc will give them a lift, &amp; that they will be gone in two years.</p><p rend="indent1"> Dream away upon the Butleric hint – my life on it it is worth something.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    may be made of his transactions among the Constellations! I have conception of one or two beings admirably calculated to figure in

                    pick a pocket across the Atlantic. The Butler should like Robin Hood enlist all extraordinary persons into his service. It should
                    have all that is odd &amp; grotesque in sublimity, puns by the wholesale – chapters of rhymes &amp; plenty of the unintelligible.
