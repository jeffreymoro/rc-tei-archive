How Jack travelled and travelled till he came to the Straits. How the giant sent word to Jack he would eat him up. How Jack bade him kiss his ----. 3. How the giant brought all the world to fight against little Jack. 4. 5. How Jack's men fought with the giant's men; but neither Jack nor the giant did any thing. 6. 7. How prince Prettyman fell in love, and how Miss Airy killed herself for the man she never spoke to. 8. 9.
