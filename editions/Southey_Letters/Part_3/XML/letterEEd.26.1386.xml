          <salute>My dear Wynn</salute>

        <p rend="indent1"> Here is a piece of trickery inclosed which I will beg you to frank up to <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>, &amp; desire him to dispose of it according to direction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your notions respecting the Criminal Laws seem to me very just &amp; sensible: yet I should be sorry to see less
                    use made of transportation, which as you say, does not deter criminals, but is certainly the best means of employing them. Wise
                    &amp; extensive plans of colonization would be, I am fully persuaded, the best means of preventing not only petty offences, but
                    &lt;also&gt; imminent danger to society; &#8211; the huge steam engine of the body politic needs such safety valves. Enlighten the poor,
                    &amp; find employment for all who want it, <del>&#8211; that</del> these are the preventatives. &#8211; I am inclined to think the punishment
                    of death might in cases be best dispensed with; not from any horror at the thought of sending a criminal into eternity with all
                    his unrepented sins upon him, &#8211; for if the man would have repented had life been granted him I cannot but suppose the will will be
                    accepted for the deed, &#8211; but because I think imprisonment for life more terrible than death, &#8211; &amp; the reverence for life which
                    it would exhibit in the law would tend to produce <del>&amp;</del> or strengthen the same reverence in the people. The
                        <del>only</del> main objection seems to be that <del>a</del> criminals are thus made burthensome to the state as long as they
                        live<del>d</del>: &#8211; this might be obviated by making them do prison work, &#8211; there are enough zealous clergymen of every
                    persuasion who would look after their spiritual concerns, &amp; I am mistaken in all my views of human nature, if the spectacle of
                    one true penitent for such a crime as murder would not have more effect than fifty executions, &#8211; he might be made a spectacle by
                    having the prison &lt;church&gt; service public.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The malice in the Critical comes from a man whose name is Le Grice, a school fellow of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref>; he hates him &amp; therefore abuses me.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Madoc</title> was negatively reviewed in the <title>Critical Review</title>, ns 7 (1806), 72&#8211;83, by Charles Valentine
                        Le Grice (1773&#8211;1858; <title>DNB</title>). Southey also believed that Le Grice reviewed Wordsworth&#8217;s <title>Poems in Two
                            Volumes</title> in the <title>Critical Review</title>, ns 11 (August 1807), 399&#8211;403, though he later changed his mind
                        about this; see Southey to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 9 December 1807, Letter 1393. On the authorship of this review, see
                        William Wordsworth: <title>The Critical Heritage. Volume 1 1793&#8211;1820</title>, ed. Robert Woof (London and New York,
                        2001), pp. 170&#8211;171.</note> I am however promised &#8216;ample justice&#8217; for the future, for a reason equally valid.

                    happened it will be shorter work to tell you when we meet than to explain now.</p>

                    quarters. Our Cumberland Packet<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Cumberland Pacquet and Ware&#8217;s Whitehaven Advertiser</title>.</note> last week had a quotation from this &#8216;ingenious
                    foreigner&#8217; &#8211; of no use in the way of advertisement as it did not name him, &#8211; but it showed that somebody had read the book &amp;
                    liked it, &amp; which I have sent you, you will think a very pretty piece of roguery. <hi rend="ital">it</hi> is an invention of
                    my own &amp; a very ingenious invention it is. That book wants only a hearty shove to get it into a sale which would be very
                    agreabell to its author I think. I shall make &#8216;a Clergyman of the Established Church&#8217; quote him in the Gentleman&#8217;s Mag. against
                    the Catholicks. &#8211; </p>
