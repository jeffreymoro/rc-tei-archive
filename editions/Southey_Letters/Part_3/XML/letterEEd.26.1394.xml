                    I have ever known) wrote to me a few days ago, saying, he had great pleasure in telling me that the Critical Review had gone out
                    of its way to do me justice<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The <title>Critical Review</title>, 12 (November 1807)
                        recanted its former criticisms of <title>Madoc</title> and praised Southey&#8217;s originality on pp. 238&#8211;239 of its review of James
                        Hogg, <title>The Mountain Bard</title> (pp. 237&#8211;244)<title>. Palmerin of England; by Francisco de Moraes. Corrected by Robert
                            Southey from the Original Portugueze (1807), Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the

                    it is &#8211; the Eagle enjoys sunshine as much as the poor butterfly who cannot live without it. The compliment which Fellowes<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Fellowes (1771&#8211;1847), editor of the <title>Critical</title> from 1807&#8211;1814.</note>

                    it is not possible to over-rate, &amp; who will stand in the first rank of poets. It is the vice of his intellect to be always
                    upon the stretch &amp; strain &#8211; to look at pileworts &amp; daffydowndillies thro the same telescope which he applies to the Moon
