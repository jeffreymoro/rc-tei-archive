                    Lancaster &amp; the next to Liverpool. there I purchase &amp; send off a stock of writing paper, &amp; there I mean to see the

                    not make my entry into London before Sunday night, or Monday morning. it is a tremendous journey! look at your map &amp; see what
                    a figure it makes there!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will be (God willing &amp; if all go on well) with you at <ref target="places.html#Congreve">Congreve</ref> about
                    the 4th of June. you must tell me what coach will convey me from London to the nearest town that is the most convenient, for as I
                    shall be on my return encumbered with nothing but a knapsack a twenty miles walk will go for nothing in the account. direct to me
