                        Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that his brother was among the
                        dead. The first lieutenant had been reported as dead, but Thomas was absent from the raid because he had been placed under
                        arrest. Charles Hayman (d. 1804) was made first lieutenant in his stead and died in the attack.</note> the probabilities look

                        a name given by me to a little Pig who followed me in the Gardens of my Father like a Dog. Southey saw him eat some <hi rend="ital">Pine apple</hi> after Dinner in our garden dining-room, &amp; was much amused – as well as with the other
                        gentlemanly habitudes of <hi rend="ital">Peter</hi> – so different from common pigs, that I hoped to have preserved him during
                        many years – But, after an absence of some days – one of the first things I saw, in an inspection of my Father’s House, was a
                        Tub full of very very fat, fine, <hi rend="ital">newly salted Bacon</hi>. Alas! it was, <hi rend="ital">Peter</hi>!!! My rage
                        was inutile and the only effect from it was that I could not eat any bacon for twelve months afterwards. Mary Slade – née
                        Barker’.</note> &amp; I have a dismal story to give you in return my Ass John – is a John Ass, &amp; he has taken it in his head at
                    present as Adam had before him in Paradise that it is not good for him to be alone. So that being most heroically in love with
                    some unknown she Ass, like a Prince in the Persian Tales, – he set off today in search of her. Now it fell out that when John was
                    engaged in this search there came over the bridge a man riding upon an Ass. John beheld him, gallopped after him in the middle of
                    the town, attacked the rider for the love of the Ass, &amp; fairly knocked him off into the dirt.</p><p rend="indent1"> What is to be done in this case? had John been a Catholic Ass he might have been initiated in one of the monastic
                    orders, like many of his bretheren, &amp; been saved by his vows. Or had he been an Italian, been taught to bray in treble – but
                    being an English &amp; a Protestant Ass – what can I do for him?</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> A Dios.</salute><signed rend="indent2"> RS.</signed></closer><postscript><p><date when="1804-12-10">Monday. 10 Dec.</date></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
