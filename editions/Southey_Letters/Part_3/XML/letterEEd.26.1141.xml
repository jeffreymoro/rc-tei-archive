                    scour the seas effectually, to take all we can, &amp; keep all we take, professing that such is our intention, &amp; that we are

                    Sicily &amp; Egypt. If France chuse to have the mainland the Islands should be ours. I suppose we shall go upon some such plan: as

                    or thirty years. He will have disabled Austria it is true, but all the other powers will be strengthened, &amp; a new state
                    created in Italy, which did not exist before. These will be under French direction, &#8211; but still not French. the difference of
                    language effectually prevents that. Bonaparte will not be a long-lived man, &#8211; he cannot be in the ordinary course of nature. there
                    has been &amp; will be too much wear &amp; tear of him. his successor, if the succession go regularly on as I suppose it will,
                    will certainly not inherit his talents, &amp; the first born Emperor, will have all the benefits of imperial education, which is
                    quite sure to make him upon a level with all other Sovereign Princes. By that time the French Generals will have died off, &amp;
                    we must not forget that it is the Revolution which made these men Generals, &amp; that men no longer rise according to their
