                        with a long and varied military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention of
                        Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the
                        Battle of Corunna. In December 1804 he was sent to review the practicability of defending Portugal from a French invasion. His
                        favourable report was widely leaked to the press, e.g. <title>Aberdeen Journal</title>, 9 January 1805. Moore was part of a
                        large and well-known family that included his younger brothers, Dr James Moore (1763&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>) and the Royal
                        Navy officer Graham Moore (1764&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &amp; also by another channel &#8211; so that he will hear of me
