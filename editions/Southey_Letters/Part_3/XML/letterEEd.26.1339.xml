                        time as Danvers in summer 1809.</note> I should think may hire any thing he wants at Lancaster, which is, as you know, a
                    considerable town. He should come from thence over the sands to Ulverstone, – up Coniston Lake, &amp; from thence strike down to
                    the ferry at Windermere. then from <ref target="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</ref> here, &amp; after he has seen the Lakes to
                    the S. W. of us, go to Penrith &amp; back to Ambleside by way of Ulswater &amp; over Kirkstone. He will thus see every thing the
                    right way. You will of course say that I shall be very glad to see him. And if you will send me <ref target="people.html#EstlinJohnPrior">Estlins</ref> direction at Edinburgh I will write to him there, &amp; press him to return
                    this way.</p><p rend="indent1"> We shall meet oftener than you believe. I shall as a regular thing go every other year to London, &amp; if you
                    cannot contrive to meet me there, will come home by way of Bristol. In that direction it would not be very difficult establish a
                    line of acquaintance along the road. This place is a good one for me, because it is cheap: &amp; I would certainly rather keep a
                    boat here than a coach any where else – Besides I could not move. All my life long I have labouring to get a sum large enough to
                    enable me to settle &amp; get my things about me, &amp; it has been labour in vain. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> tells you that I am cheated. If he has any reasons for thinking so
                    he should explain them to me: perhaps I may learn them from <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> when he
                    returns to <ref target="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</ref>. at any rate I may derive <del>x</del> some instructions from W.
                    upon the art of driving a bargain – as I know no man likely to make a better for himself. I have no reason to think ill of my
                    publishers, – none whatever. They have me at their mercy, as they must every person for whom they publish, – there neither is nor
                    can be any check upon them: they may be rogues if they will, but their fair profits are so enormous that there can be no excuse
                    for them if they are.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am out of all patience with the printer. There are but two sheets of Espriella in his hands, &amp; I wait day

                    often observed how much better his letters are than his conversation, &amp; have never I think, given him credit for the balance
                    of talent in his favour. His real place is between what he thinks himself to be, &amp; what <del>xxx</del> every body else thinks
                    him. I am in good hope that he is likely to become a thriving author. He is coming here on a touring project, in which I shall
