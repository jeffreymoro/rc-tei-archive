                        in about 1791, but remained unpublished for many years until its appearance in the <title>Iris</title>, the weekly Norwich
                        newspaper edited by Taylor, on 29 October 1803. Taylor declined Southey&#8217;s offer to publish his poem, and &#8216;A Tale of Wonder&#8217;
