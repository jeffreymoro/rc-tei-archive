        <p rend="indent1"> Heaven knows in what humour the inclosed<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had received from <ref target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">William Godwin</ref>, and now enclosed to Rickman, the following letter: <p rend="indent1">
              <hi rend="ital">To Robert Southey, 15 May 1805</hi>
            </p>
            <p rend="indent1">Sir</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> I have just been led by mere accident to look into the Annual Review for 1803. Two or three articles in
                            that volume, in which I am treated with a low &amp; despicable scurrility worthy of the times of bishop Gardiner &amp;
                            bishop Bonner, I recognise for yours. I know not well to what feelings the mind of the man who penned them is accessible,
                            but I would willingly carry some feelings of moral compunction &amp; moral confusion home to that mind.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> There were several reasons why you ought not to have written those articles.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> 1.You must be conscious of the intellectual abilities of the man against whom you have thus written,
                            however in these articles you bely that consciousness. Several parts of my Enquiry concerning Political Justice have been
                            praised for uncommon acuteness &amp; depth of reasoning by the most determined enemies of its doctrines; you cannot be
                            blind to these qualities in that book. To the novel of Caleb Williams vigour of conception &amp; strength of delineation
                            have never been denied; I do not believe that you differ from all the world in these admissions. If you differ from me in
                            some of my opinions, if you think that, being both of us engaged in one cause (as you profess in these articles), &amp; I
                            at least engaged in it with no common ardour, I have failed to serve it judiciously, that can be no reason for your
                            affirming of a man, whom you know to be of uncommon powers of mind, that he is a blockhead. No cause that is worth
                            serving, can be served by such falshoods. </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> 2.You are not less fully convinced of my integrity, than of my intellectual powers. My private life, my
                            conduct to my wife, my children, &amp; my connections, is beyond exception. You feel, more deeply than most men, the
                            sincere devotedness of heart with which, however you may suppose me to be mistaken, I gave myself up to the cause of truth
                            &amp; public interest. If ability, united with integrity, do not demand the respect of every one who sets up the slightest
                            pretensions to either, I am then at a loss to conceive what foundations for respect can exist in the world.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> 3.You were, at the first appearance of the Enquiry concerning Political Justice, the most devoted advocate
                            of the doctrines of the book. If you have since seen reason to alter your opinion, or if I have forfeited your approbation
                            by what you may deem my injudicious management of th[e] controversy since, still you owed something to your former good
                            opinion. An apostate, who immediately becomes the bitter &amp; scurrilous enemy of the party he has deserted, is a
                            character which the common sense of mankind has agreed to reprobate. </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> 4.You were my personal acquaintance. Some decency, by all the laws of civilised society, was due to this
                            circumstance. A few weeks after the publication of this volume, we dined together at the house of a common friend. With
                            what sensations, if you were accessible to any ingenuous feelings, must you have sat down with a man, against whom you had
                            asserted such gross falshoods, whose character, the result of honest &amp; unwearied exertions in what he conceived to be
                            the public cause, you had endeavoured to destroy, whose family you had done your best to starve, &amp; against whose
                            indignant eye you had no protection except the cloak of anonymous publication you had assumed? </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> 5.You must have known that the scribblers of reviewers &amp; periodical pamphlets had entered into a
                            combination by the silliest &amp; most impudent misrepresentations to write me down. You must have seen how the leaders of
                            the church, &amp; the fawning slaves of priestcraft &amp; tyranny, w[ere] united against me. We were engaged by your own
                            statement in one cause, the cause of human improveableness, of liberty, equality &amp; mankind. What ought you to have
                            thought of yourself, when you joined the vulgar &amp; artful cry of the enemies of this cause against me? While no one as
                            yet openly opposed my work, while it &amp; its author appeared to possess an extensive popularity, you were its friend.
                            When the refuse of every tyrannical &amp; aristocratical party joined against me, &amp; gave my book the appearance of
                            being hunted out of the world, then you thought it prudent, &amp; you thought it magnanim[ous], to stand up against me, to
                            repeat the words of these hirelings, &amp; to echo their sentences. I have too much singleness of heart, to endeavour to
                            form to myself a party, or by the ordinary &amp; accustomed means to curry favour with the drudges of literature, &amp; to
                            this is owing the proceedings of a crew, in the train of which you are the last volunteer. </p>
            <p rend="indent1"> It may seem strange that, in writing this letter, I pay you an attention which I never dreamed of paying to
                            your brother reviewers &amp; magazine-writers. But I have heard you so repeatedly represented by men of honour as an
                            honourable man, that, against all hope &amp; argument I cling to the idea; &amp;, though I am satisfied that the writer of
                            these articles, can have neither honesty nor worth, I render this oblation to your departed good name.</p>
            <p rend="indent1"> It is in vain for you to answer this letter. Between me &amp; the person I address there can be nothing
                            reciprocal. I address you as a judge addresses himself to a convicted criminal. If you think you can prove that you are
                            not the author of these articles, we have common friends, <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

                            possibility of overturning the evidence I possess, I shall listen to every thing they can allege with patience &amp;

                        erect &#8211; It was called a Panopticon &#8211; or some such heathenish name.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> The Panopticon
                            prison scheme of Jeremy Bentham (1748&#8211;1832; <title>DNB</title>) was discussed in parliament and a bill was passed in 1794
                            providing for the building of a penitentiary at Battersea, London. In 1798, with the building delayed, a committee of the
                            House of Commons issued a favourable report on Bentham&#8217;s scheme. The discussions are reported in the <title>Journals of
