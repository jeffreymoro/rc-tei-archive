        <p rend="indent1"> I ought to have written sooner, &#8211; but sometimes other orders of the evening have <del>made</del> put it out of my
                    power, &amp; sometimes perhaps when it was in my power it has been out of mind. We have been considering concerning my journey to
                    Durham, &#8211; it is cruel weather, &#8211; either too cold to move, or too wet for travelling. About the latter end of March <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> expects to be confined,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha Southey</ref> was born on 27 March 1809.</note> &#8211; there is no time when a man
                    can be so conveniently from home as upon such occasions as this, &#8211; I have resolved therefore to defer my journey to Durham till
                    this more convenient season. As soon as she shall be safe in bed God willing I shall start, &amp; probably make first for
                    Edinburgh, if <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> be there, to have a weeks work at the Advocates Library. Till then
                    I pray thee have me, excused.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To days news has <del>blown</del> brought a cloud over me which it is not easy to shake off. We have lost our
                    <del>two</del> best General<del>s</del>
          <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish General
                        with a long and varied military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. Sir David Baird, 1st
                        Baronet (1757&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>). Unlike Moore, Baird was not killed, but at the battle of Corruna his left arm was
                        shattered. He never took command in the field again.</note> (<del>for Baird is dead also, this my letters tell me</del>) &#8211; The
                    evil arising from <del>this</del> &lt;his&gt; loss is that it makes a showy story for a Bulletin, &#8211; &amp; that it prevents enquiry
                    into the conduct of the retreat. On the other hand the superiority of our men whenever they have met the enemy has been decidedly
                    established &amp; puts us out of all fear of the consequences of invasion.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our conduct from first to last has been one series of blunders, &#8211; in which Moore himself has borne a part. I do not
                    despair of Spain, but this I perceive that nothing effectual for Spain will be done by this country, &amp; that no good is to be
                    hoped for till we have thoroughly regenerated ourselves. I know not where our political Saviour is to be looked for, but the Signs
                    of the Times are full. All parties are so despicable that party-spirit in the nation has died a natural death, &amp; there is a
                    wholesomer feeling in the people of England, than perhaps there ever has been at any former <del>time</del> period.</p>
