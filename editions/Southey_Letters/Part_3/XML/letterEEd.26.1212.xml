                        journey to Avignon in 1788. Southey had met Bryan in Bristol or Bath in 1794; he would meet him again at <ref target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman&#8217;s</ref> home in St Stephen&#8217;s Court, Westminster, perhaps when visiting in March

                    for sale Field will be the publisher, and when you call at the shop you may see enough of them to give me a sufficient account,

                        Appointed</title>.</note> There is a boy, by name Joseph Prescott, who has visions &#8211; I suspect this to be the lad you once spoke of as
                    making prophetic drawings; there has been a volume of his visions published, and be they what they may I will risk a half crown
                    commission for them.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> The visions of Joseph Prescott (dates unknown), of Bermondsey,
                        London, from 1793&#8211;1803 were published in <title>A Word in Season to a Sinking Kingdom. The Continuation of the Prophecies of
                            Joanna Southcott</title> (1803) and <title>A Second Book of Visions. The Continuation of Joseph Prescott&#8217;s Visions</title>
                        (1803). Prescott was suspected of basing his visions on drawings taken from a captured French ship.</note>

                    one minute, I will give another half-crown for old acquaintance sake. Now, that you may have some inducement on your own account
                    to go upon this curious errand, I must inform you that this said bookseller in High Holborn, Elias Jameson Field, is no less a
                    person than one of the Four &amp; Twenty Elders. I should like to know whether the brass letters upon his forehead be knave or
                    fool.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will by this see what I am about, but of no fewer than nineteen of <ref target="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna Southcott&#8217;s</ref> pamphletts have I extracted about half a sheet of Espriellaism,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> An account of Southcott is given in Letter 70 of <title>Letters from England: by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella.

                    what I have been requesting you to look for to be perfect in the subject.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for two good letters, of which I shall make three, by expanding the Literary Fund part into a separate
                    one. The Exhibition must now be for 1803, because that of the preceding year has been long closed, it needs only to omit the notes
                    of the particular pictures, or to particularize others in their stead, which perhaps is not needful.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors"> Neither the Literary Fund nor the exhibition of pictures at the Royal Academy of Arts were described in

                    can, You have not, I see, yet learnt that rule in arithmetic which may be called Booksellers&#8217; Division of Money, and which would
                    teach to subtract from the gross receipts 28 per cent &#8211; the modest commission which those gentlemen require for vending a poor a
                    author&#8217;s wares. 30 per cent is what &#8216;Madoc&#8217; is sold for to the trade. Whenever I can afford it I shall certainly print my own
                    books, and fix my own price upon them, but when that will be Heaven knows! </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must probably pass thro&#8217; London before I leave England, but it will not be till the spring. The papers talk
                    strangely about Portugal, and not altogether improbably. I wish their speculations may be true, and should enjoy a legation to
                    Brazil, in spite of the voyage.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> On 29 November 1807, as the French invaded Portugal, a
                        British squadron under the command of Sir William Sidney Smith (1764&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>) escorted the Portuguese Prince
                        Regent, John VI (the Duke of Braganza) (1767&#8211;1826), and the Queen, his mother, across the Atlantic. The Portuguese monarchy
                        then ruled from Brazil.</note>
