                    off before them, &#8211; they were running away from the Savages. &#8211; &amp; they reached Para, not knowing where they were, nor how they
                    had got there, such was their fright &amp; fatigue. How should they get to Para by following the stream &#8211; if the maps be right? I
                    believe the I de Joanes is &lt;made&gt; four times as big as it ought to be, &amp; that the space which is filled with this
                    exaggeration should be full of small islands &amp; labyrinthine channels, the main stream flowing by Para. &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> While I was writing your letter arrived. I accede to your argument for placing the map in the first volume, &#8211;
                    expence is of no consequence &#8211; Whatever the map costs will be considered in the price of the book, &amp; my only concern in it is
                    as a halver of eventual profit.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> This plan was not adopted.</note> I would therefore have
                    as fine a map as can be made. Paraguay is the only part of the Spanish possessions which should have all its places marked, &#8211; for
                    the rest then should be only the chief places, &amp; the rivers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This stoppage of proofs rather alarms me. By a blunder of <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> my

        <p rend="indent1"> I live in hopes of a journey to Falmouth. The present spirit of reform look to nothing but paltry savings of
                    expenditure, &#8211; yet I do not think it can help according to better things, &amp; believe that it will not be long before Parliament
                    must be reformed, or the Crown made absolute. In the one case England will be what I would willingly part with a few limbs to

                    blessing if I am to live under a Despotism it shall not be at home. But I have no heart for the ultimate result. There is a
                    dolorous lack of talents among the Rogues on both sides, &amp; if there be any <del>xxx</del> truth in the classical adage Jupiter
                    certainly designs to destroy them.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> &#8216;Quem Jupiter vult perdere, dementat prius&#8217;, an

        <p rend="indent1"> I have had a week of great anxiety. Poor <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref> has had the croupe,
                    &#8211; &amp; is now like a little Lazarus from the effects of blistering his throat. This bitter weather delays his recovery by
                    confining him still to the house. Thank God he has escaped <del>the xxxx</del> from the disease &#8211; but six ounces of blood taken
                    from the jugular vein &#8211; then blisters &#8211; &amp; the eruption which it has occasioned on his face, &#8211; have made him a melancholy
                    object, &#8211; instead of the beautiful creature he was ten days ago. Still God be thanked he is recovered, &amp; a few weeks of fine
                    weather will enable him to cast his slough.</p>
