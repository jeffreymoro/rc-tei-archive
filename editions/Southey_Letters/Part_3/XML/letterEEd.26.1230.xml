        <p rend="indent1"> On my return from a five days absence I find your letter enclosing <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry&#8217;s</ref>  remittance of 25 &#163;, which I thus with due punctuality acknowledge. &#8211; I thought my last had told
                    you that he &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>  were with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Thomas Southey</ref>  in Somersetshire. Tom wrote to the Admiralty before he
                    set off from hence. You will be glad to hear that <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has recommended him to <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">his Uncle</ref> (T. Grenville) for promotion &amp; employment. he cannot flatter us, he
                    says, with hopes of early success, &#8211; but I trust succeed it will in time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have this evening received a third letter by way of bottle &amp; sea.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Southey often asked his brother <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</ref> to send letters to him in bottles from the
                        ships he was serving on. For an account of these, see Southey to the Editor of the <title>Athenaeum</title>, [April 1807],
                        Letter 1314.</note> it was thrown on the W. coast of Ireland after a three months cruise, &lt;in which it&gt; <del>&amp;</del>
                    followed precisely the track which according to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pierre<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
                        Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737&#8211;1814), <title>Paul et Virginie</title> (1787) had given Southey the idea for the
                        bottle experiment.</note> it ought to have done.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We are in momently expectation of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref> arrival &#8211; who in
                    the whole course of his irregular life has never done any thing more unaccountably strange than loitering away nearly three months
                    since he reached England<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coleridge had travelled abroad to Malta for his health in
                        1804, taking up a temporary post there as Public Secretary to the British Civil Commissioner. He arrived back in England in
                        August 1806 and though he returned to <ref target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> at the end of October, he did not stay
                        to live there.</note> &#8211; instead of posting home to his family as fast as he could. The few letters which he has written us are
                    in the very worst mood of despondency, as if he never wrote till he had exhausted his whole stock of spirits in conversation. I
                    expect to see him better than these letters would lead a stranger to expect in bodily health, but miserably hypochondriacal. He is
                    to lecture this winter at the Royal Institution.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coleridge was to lecture &#8216;at the Royal
                        Institution upon the Principles common to the Fine Arts&#8217;; see Southey to Charles Danvers, 18 October 1806, Letter 1229. He did
                        not in fact lecture there until 1808, on the subjects of the Principles of Poetry, Shakespeare and Milton.</note>
