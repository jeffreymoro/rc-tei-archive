                    longer – as my guide once told me in Portugal – we are got half way for we have come two short leagues, &amp; have two long ones
                    to go, – &amp; upon his calculation I am half into the poem.</p><p rend="indent1"> The other day our Lake presented the most visionary &amp; <del>xxx</del> unnatural sight I ever yet beheld. it was
                    a fine day, the sun shining &amp; a few white clouds hanging <del>xxx</del> motionless in the sky. we had walked down to the
                    water-side. there was not a breath of wind stirring – so that the Lake being perfectly still became like a great mirror, &amp;
                    represented the shores mountains sky &amp; clouds so vividly that there was not the slightest appearance of water. it is
                    impossible to make you conceive the wonderful effect this produced unless you could conceive what the banks of Derwentwater are.
                    in one part the mountains form an arch reversed the lower half of a vast circle,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> A drawing
                        of the lower half of a circle is included here.</note> &amp; thro that magnificent &lt;opening&gt; a long vale is seen
                        <del>between</del> &lt;between&gt; mountains, &amp; bounded by mountain behind mountain. all this was in the water – the
                    distance perfect as in the actual thing, the single houses far in the vale &amp; the smoke from their chimneys, – the shadow &amp;
                    the substance joining at their bases so that the eye could not tell where each ended – &amp; as I stood on the shore heaven &amp;
                    the clouds &amp; the sun seemed lying under me – I was looking down into the sky, &amp; the range of mountains having one line of
                    summit under my feet, &amp; another above me seemed to be suspended between two firmaments. My fancy never pictured any scenery so
                    unnaturally beautiful, for it was beautiful &amp; enchanting as eye could see or heart desire.</p><p rend="indent1"> Of my own goings on, I know not that there is any thing which can be said. imagine me in this great study of mine
                    from breakfast till dinner, from dinner till tea, &amp; from tea till supper, in my old black coat, my corderoys alternately with
                    the long worsted pantaloons &amp; gaiters in one, &amp; the green shade – sitting at my desk – &amp; you have my picture &amp; my
                    history. When I go to the House appointed to all who are living, in the orchard I play with Dapper the dog, who loves me as much

                    upstairs plays with me, for Puss finding my room the quietest in the house, has thought proper to share it with me. Our weather
                    has been so wet, that I have not got out of doors &lt;for a walk&gt; once in a month. Now &amp; then I get down to the river which
                    runs at the bottom of the orchard &amp; throw stones till my arms ache – &amp; then saunter back again. James Lawson the
