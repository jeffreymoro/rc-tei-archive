                        interesting,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> The diplomatist John Hookham Frere was sent to Spain as
                        minister-plenipotentiary to the Central Junta on 4 October 1808 and when the French marched on Madrid he urged Sir John Moore
                        (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), the Commander of the British forces in northern Spain to also advance upon Madrid, despite
                        his inclination to retreat through Portugal. After the disastrous retreat to Corunna, Frere was blamed for this advice and
                        recalled by the British government. After some of Frere&#8217;s and Moore&#8217;s correspondence was read out in the Commons on 27 April,
                        Moore&#8217;s side of matters was presented in James Moore (1763&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Narrative of the Campaign of

                    have done, which I maintained at the time. This country as usual is letting tide &amp; time pass, when one vigorous effort would
                    give Bonaparte his mortal blow &#8211; but my confidence in the Spaniards &amp; in their eventual emancipation remains unshaken. <ref target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Wellesley</ref> will have a second battle to fight for Lisbon, &amp; will take
