        <p rend="indent1"> If I had not taken it for granted that you were long ere this beyond the reach of these wet winds, you should of
                    course have heard from me. so strongly was I convinced of this that I have been twice on the point of writing to Barbadoes, when
                    some other letters that required reply have come in &amp; prevented me &#8211; &amp; I had now vowed a vow unto the Lord not to let the
                    week pass without doing it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> From this uttermost end of the North it will not be easy, or indeed possible to send any thing to the West Indies
                    except what will go in compass of a letter &#8211; else you should have the Irises<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    books to venture, he shall buy, beg, borrow or steal newspapers to accompany them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My plan for Madoc stands thus at present, that <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> shall risque
                    all expences &amp; share the eventual profit, printing it in quarto &amp; with engravings &#8211; for I am sure the book will sell the
                    better for being made expensive. <ref target="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</ref> will make the drawings, which will be
                    chiefly designed to set the dresses, weapons &amp; other unusualities more vividly before his eyes than probably his own

                    that the sole object of Bonaparte is to exhaust our finances, booby! not remembering that a national bankruptcy, while it ruins
                    individuals makes the state rich. One person in twenty (take a very large proportion by guess) would be affected &amp; perhaps one
