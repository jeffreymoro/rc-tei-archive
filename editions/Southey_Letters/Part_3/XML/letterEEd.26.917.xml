I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and have to regret that
                    it has not more frequently been in my power to practise the defensive virtue of smuggling. The duty upon bound books is sixpence
                    per pound weight: and his Majesty has received above seventy pounds for what I and <ref target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my
                        Uncle</ref> have brought into his Dominions, so expensive a luxury have our wise rulers resolved to make literature!</p><p rend="indent1"> Should any alarm take place in your neighbourhood consign as many of your family as you please to my care, and we
                    will house as many as we can and find house room for the rest. I do not myself apprehend any danger. London is indeed threatened
                    by its own rabble, and in all overgrown cities the same evil exists, and the same consequences may possibly result. But an
                    invading army must perish. I hope they will attempt invasion and lose enough by sea to fatten the channel crabs, and enough on
                    shore to furnish bones for a monument on Dover Cliffs to be seen from Calais. We also deserve to suffer something, and when both
                    nations have smarted, Europe will be at peace, and not till then.</p><p rend="indent1"> The Coalition is indeed monstrous, they justify it upon the plea of uniting against a common enemy, but if

                    keep them out. First were for a pure despotism – and now they are for an oligarchy. The struggle will end in neither. We must
