                    I had persuaded myself it was my duty to do.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> In July 1809, Southey was informed by <ref target="people.html#SharpRichard">Richard Sharp</ref> that the stewardship of the Derwentwater Estates (which were owned
                        by Greenwich Hospital) would soon become vacant on the death of the incumbent. Southey asked several friends to intercede on
                        his behalf, including <ref target="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">George Beaumont</ref>, but in the end the position was
                        considered unsuitable for him. In his most recent letter to Beaumont he had asked him to assist in getting his brother, <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</ref>  promoted. For this, see Southey to Sir George Beaumont, 12 October
                        1809, Letter 1692.</note> A sense of humiliation hung upon me, as if I had taken advantage of one favour to press for another,
                    and as if the motives which justified me to myself might not be sufficient to justify me to you. Notwithstanding the kindness with
                    which you have replied, something of this feeling still remains, and I confess it, not merely as the only apology which it is in
                    my power to offer, but as a proof also how earnestly I must have desired to succeed in the application before I could resolve to
                    make it.</p><p rend="indent1"> I had understood that with good interest it was not more difficult to obtain two steps than one; and in this error
                        <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> confirmed me by mentioning the highest rank when he urged me to apply to
                        <ref target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Mr. Canning</ref>. It would however be a great thing to obtain one step, and if that could
                    be gained it would give me a deeper feeling of joy than any other circumstance of my life. My very slight knowledge of <ref target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref>  could not authorise me in applying to him. I also
                    know that he has many applications of a like nature upon the score of county and borough connections, which must necessarily be
                    paramount to him. If Lord Melville were at the Admiralty, <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> would use his
                    influence for me. From <ref target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Mr. Grenville</ref> I had a distant promise, and an assurance when
                    he went out of office that if he had made any further promotions than that of merely filling up vacancies at that time <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref>  should have been included. It was some compliment to say so, but
                    otherwise there was very little satisfaction in that preter-perfect-sense potential. At present this is the only channel through
                    which I can apply. Had you been with me when you were at Keswick fewer excuses on my part would have been necessary than I feel
                    now the wish, rather than the power, to offer. You would have seen a man with all the best parts of a sailor’s character, and
                    equally qualified to do honour to his profession at sea or on shore.</p><p rend="indent1"> Poor <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> is at rest. His property he has bequeathed to a
                        brother,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Reverend Joseph Jackson (dates unknown).</note> who has a living near
                    Thrapston, in Northamptonshire, and is much patronised by Lord Sackville,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles
                        Sackville-Germain, 5th Duke of Dorset, 2nd Viscount Sackville (1767–1843).</note> who at this time pays his expenses as a
                    fellow-commoner at Cambridge, that he may qualify himself by taking a degree to hold another benefice. He is here at present, and
                    I have never seen a more thoroughly respectable man, nor one whose appearance spoke more strongly in his favour.</p><p rend="indent1"> The real reason why the last <hi rend="ital">Friend</hi> was delayed is a curious one.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Coleridge’s periodical, <title>The Friend</title>, was published in 26 instalments from 1 June 1809–15
                        March 1810.</note> The manuscript was in due time in the printers’ hands, and the rats ate up the motto the night before it
                    should have been set up. It was a whole page of Hooker,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Richard Hooker (1554–1600;
                            <title>DNB</title>), theologian and philosopher. The motto, from Richard Hooker (1554–1600; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Of
                            the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Politie</title> (1593–1662), appeared at the start of the ninth number dated 12 October 1809.
                        See Coleridge, <title>The Friend; A Literary, Moral, and Political Weekly Paper</title> (London, 1809), p. 129. The text is
                        given in S. T. Coleridge, <title>The Friend</title>, ed. Barbara E. Rooke, 2 vols (London and Princeton NJ, 1969), II, p.
                        122.</note> and as those vermin are to be classed among the Independents, they must certainly have found it hard of
                    digestion.</p><p rend="indent1"> We beg to be remembered to <ref target="people.html#BeaumontLadyMary">Lady Beaumont</ref>. – Believe me, my dear

                            Southey’s poem, <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810).</note> It is in rhyme as irregular as that of <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref>, but pitched in a higher key. The rhythm and freedom of blank verse are
                        preserved, and the rhyme thrown in in every part of the line. The matter is as original as the manner, and both too much so to
                        please any person except the score or two whose opinions in fine literature should be regarded like those of the twelve judges
                        in law.</p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
