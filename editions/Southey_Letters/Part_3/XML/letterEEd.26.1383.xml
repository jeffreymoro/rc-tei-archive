                        the late 1790s to Stuart&#8217;s previous publication, the <title>Morning Post</title>. In Southey's letter to Wynn, dated [March
                        1807], Letter 1437, he states that he had declined Stuart's offer.</note> My occupations are now so many that I could not
                    stipulate to furnish regularly even the <del>xxxx</del> small quotium of verse which you require. The habit of versifying &amp; of
                    catching all things in a poets point of view has gone from me thro long disuse.<del> xxxx</del> Weeks would pass on, &amp; tho few
                    men are more willing or better able to gird themselves up for the labour of the day, I fear <del>any</del> the thought that I
                    ought to be writing for you, &amp; the feeling that I was not in the mood for it, would fret my spirit, &amp; end in abortive
                    attempts. There is however another way which may tempt me to recover the habit. Tho I cannot work by time, I can by the piece, &#8211;
                    when I can get a sheet full it shall be sent, &#8211; &amp; the verses may be rated like oysters by the hundred, or like bricks by the
                    thousand.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have mistaken the mention of the Mutineers in the Spaniards letters<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

                    relates to those poor fellows who were hung just before Governor Wall, <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Joseph Wall
                        (1737&#8211;1802; <title>DNB</title>) had in 1782, while governor of Goree, an island off Gambia, had several soldiers flogged to
                        death by black slaves, without having convened a trial, on the grounds that they had mutinied. Wall was arrested on returning
                        to England, but escaped and lived in Europe until in 1801 he surrendered himself for trial, in the hope of clearing his name
                        and enabling himself to inherit a legacy. He was found guilty, amid public revulsion at his brutality, and hanged on 28
                        January 1802. The matter is discussed in <title>Letters from England</title>, Letter 9.</note> &amp; who mutinied because they
                    were ordered to the West Indies, just when peace was made &amp; they expected their discharge.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> In November 1801 sailors on HMS <hi rend="ital">Temeraire</hi>, expecting to be allowed leave in England, were
                        ordered to the West Indies. They mutinied on 1 December; on 6 January 1802 fourteen of them were convicted and hanged.</note>
                    &#8211; I believe more suffered upon this than on the former occasion. &#8211; You may remember that the plea of insanity was set up for

                        previously been &#8216;at times in a state of insanity&#8217; (Portsmouth Gazette, 26 June 1797; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; it was
                    properly enough set aside, but there was a madness in his family. I saw his sister in Dr Fox&#8217;s madhouse <del>at</del> near

                    differ is this, that you abominate one party, &amp; that I have the most rooted contempt for all, &amp; a strong conviction that
                    between them they wll ruin the country, as far it is possible for <del>xxxx</del> any <del>per</del> politicians to ruin it. At

                    former work.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors"> A follow up volume was not published.</note> &#8211; I shall be very much obliged
                    to you for any anecdotes &amp; any hints that you will have the goodness to send me. My object is to give as compleat a picture of
                    the present state of society in England, as my observation &amp; information enable me to do; &#8211; &amp; it is impossible that I can
                    have a tithe of your knowledge of the political &amp; the great world. &#8211; I am straitened enough in circumstances for profit to be
                    a matter of <del>some consequence</del> importance to me. &#8211; this book seems likely to be more productive than any former attempt:
                    it wants initials, asterisks &amp; personalities to make it greatly so. I think however if the object in view be at all
                    accomplished that the book will have some thing more than a temporary value.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is one subject on which I have much to say, &amp; that, as it appears to me, of considerable importance. It
                    is the navy; but tho God knows it would be in the spirit of a true Englishman, &amp; would tend to prevent much danger &amp; much
                    evil, I am afraid to do it, least it should injure my <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref>, to whom of course the
                    matter would be imputed immediately that it should be known to be mine. Yet I am certain that I could point &lt;out&gt; easy

        <p rend="indent1"> Your account of the cotton mill at Glasgow contains an important fact in confirmation of the opinion which I have
                    formed upon the manufacturing system, as at present existing. I do not believe that letter which you inserted in the Courier
                    contains a syllable of exaggeration, &#8211; there is however an oversight in it, where I have said that the price of labour remains the
                    same as what it formerly was.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey makes this comment in Letter 38 of <title>Letters
                            from England</title>. The account of manufacturing in his letter was also published, with some omissions, in <title>The
                            Courier</title> dated 20 November 1807. In the editorial section before Southey's letter, Stuart comments on the positive
                        example of 'The Lanark Mills' near Glasgow, which 'are an exception, health, morals and education being there particularly
                        attended to&#8217;.</note> I know not how this escaped me, &amp; am very sorry it is there, &#8211; for any mistatement of this kind
                    materially weakens the effect of argument; &#8211; exciting a just suspicion of unfair play. This I shall of course correct in the next
                    edition, which is likely soon to be called for. In the subsequent volumes I have many important subjects to consider &#8211; the East
                    India Company &#8211; Ireland &#8211; the state of public morals, &#8211; the want of public virtue, &#8211; &amp;c &#8211; with plenty of lighter matter to
                    carry this off, not forgetting M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Malthus, &amp; the Society for the Suppression of Vice.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey viewed both Malthus&#8217;s and the Society&#8217;s efforts as hypocritical attempts to coerce the
                        poor into a morality that the rich were not asked to practise. See his review of Thomas Jarrold (1770&#8211;1853;
