        <p rend="indent1"> I have been prepared to hear of the recoronation at Madrid &#8211; &amp; the utter destruction of Zaragoza.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Joseph-Napol&#233;on Bonaparte (1768&#8211;1844), the elder brother of Napoleon, was made King of Naples and
                        Sicily (1806&#8211;1808), and, in August 1808, King Joseph I of Spain (1808&#8211;1813). Joseph was forced by a revolt to abandon Madrid
                        and did not return until January 1809, after French reinforcements retook the city. From December the town of Zaragoza was
                        besieged (for the second time that year) by the French. The siege involved ferocious street fighting, in which the Spanish
                        civilians took full part. When the French finally succeeded in February, 54000 people had died.</note> Had Bairds<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet (1757&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>), landed his army at Corunna in
                        October and marched through the mountains to support Moore&#8217;s troops. After the French recapture of Madrid, Baird retreated to
                        Corunna where, with the remnants of Moore&#8217;s force, his soldiers fought a defensive battle in January 1809. Baird lost his left

                    things badly. If the French were to be met in the field, our army &lt;force&gt; should have been 100,000 men, &#8211; not in one army &#8211;
                    but in f<del>xx</del> four or perhaps five &#8211; The end will yet be well. It is before walld towns that the <del>xxxx</del> strength
                    of the French will be baffled. I have not much apprehension from Sir John Moore<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John
                        Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish General with a long and varied military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna.</note> &#8211; if the junta be formd, he will beat twice his
                    number of French, &amp; if it be necessary to retreat there is the <del>xxxx</del> frontier of Portugal at hand. &amp; he will
                    divide his men among the frontier towns, &#8211; many of them are very strong, &#8211; Elvas, or rather Fort Le Lippe &#8211; nearly
