                    course see my way plainly before me. Two questions now arise, how to publish this poem, &#8211; &amp; in what metre to write the next.

                    could not get two hundred, &#8211; &amp; then it is not worth the trouble. But on my visit to Edinburgh I shall hear <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scotts</ref> opinion about the best mode of publishing, he drives his pigs to a good market,
                    &amp; may perhaps put me on the way of driving mine to a better than I have yet found out.</p>
