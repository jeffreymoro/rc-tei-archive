        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Ministry &#8211; by this time, perhaps, no longer a Ministry &#8211; have made a very pretty kettle of fish of it; which
                    phrase, by the by, would look well in literal translation into any other language. Perhaps you will be surprised to hear that on
                    the Catholic Question I am as stiffly against them as his Majesty himself.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The so-called
                        Ministry of All the Talents, of which Wynn was a member, fell in March 1807 because the King would not accede to its plan to
                        introduce an act emancipating Catholics from the civil penalties and restrictions placed upon them.</note> Of all my friends
                        <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> is perhaps the only one who thinks with me upon this subject;
                    but I am clear in my own mind. I am, however, sorry for the business, &#8211; more to think what a rabble must come in, than for any
                    respect for those who are going out &#8211; though the <hi rend="ital">Limited Service</hi> and the Abolishment of the Slave Trade are
                    great things.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> By the first of these measures the government of which <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> was a member limited the term for which soldiers could enlist; the second
                        was passed into law in March 1807.</note> As for any effect upon my own possible fortunes, you need not be told how little any
                    such <hi rend="ital">possibilities</hi> ever enter into my feelings: they have entered into my calculations just enough to keep me
                    unsettled, and nothing more. And here I am now planting garden-enclosures, rose-bushes, currants, gooseberries, and resolute to
                    become a mountaineer &#8211; perhaps for ever &#8211; unless I should remove for final settlement at Lisbon. My study is to be finished &#8211; my
                    books gathered together; and if you do not come down again, the very first summer you are not otherwise engaged, why &#8211; you may
                    stay and be smoke-dried in London for your good-for-nothingness. I have a man called Willy, who is my Juniper in this
                        business.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Juniper (dates unknown), a Bristol carpenter who built book cases for
                        Southey. Willy is unidentified.</note> We are going to have laburnums and <hi rend="ital">lilacs</hi>, seringas, barberry
                    bushes, and a pear-tree to grow up by your window against the wall, and <hi rend="ital">white</hi> curtains in my library, and to
                    dye the old ones in the parlour blue, and to put fringe to them, Mr. Duppa, and to paper the room, Mr. Duppa, and I am to have a
                    carpet in my study, Mr. Duppa, and the chairs are to be new bottomed, and we are to buy some fenders at the sale of the General&#8217;s
                    things, and we have bought a new hearth-rug. And then the outside of the house is to be rough-cast, as soon as the season will
                    permit, and there is a border made under the windows, and there is to be a gravel walk there, and turf under the trees beyond <hi rend="ital">that</hi>, and beyond <hi rend="ital">that</hi> such peas and beans! Oh! Mr. Duppa, how you will like them when
                    you come down, and how fine we shall be, if all this does not ruin me!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The reason of all this is, that some arrangements of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge&#8217;s</ref> made it necessary that I should either resolve upon removing speedily, or remaining in <ref target="places.html#GretaHall">the house</ref>. The one I could not do, and was, not unwillingly, forced to the other. Indeed,
                    the sense of being unsettled was the only uneasiness I had; and these little arrangements for future comfort give me, I am sure,
                    more solid satisfaction and true enjoyment than his great Howickship<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Charles, Viscount
                        Howick, later the second Earl Grey (1764&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1806 and, from
                        September 1807, Foreign Secretary.</note> can possibly have felt upon getting into that Downing Street, from whence he will so
                    reluctantly get out, &#8211; like a dog on a wet day out of the kitchen, growling as he goes, with his tail between his legs, and
                    showing the teeth with which he dares not bite. <ref target="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Jackson</ref> &#8211; God bless him &#8211; is as
                    well pleased about it as I am; and that excellent good woman, <ref target="people.html#WilsonMrs">Mrs. Wilson</ref>, is rejoiced
                    at heart to think that we are likely to remain here for the remainder of her days.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Sir, it would surprise you to see how I dig in the garden. I am going to buy the &#8216;Complete Gardener;&#8217;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Samuel Cooke, <title>The Compleat English Gardener: or, Gardening Made Perfectly Easy: Containing,
                        Full and Plain Directions for the Proper Management of the Flower, Fruit and Kitchen Gardens</title> (many editions from 1780).</note> and we do hope to attain one day to the luxuries of currant wine, and such like
                    things, which I hope will meet your approbation, after you and I have been up Causey Pike<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> I shall miss <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> this summer, &#8211; an excellent boatman, and a
                    companion whose good spirits and good humour never failed. If T. Grenville<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"> Thomas
                        Grenville (1755&#8211;1846), First Lord of the Admiralty, after Howick&#8217;s resignation, from 1806 to 1807.</note> would make <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> a Captain, and send him down to grass for the summer, he would do a better thing
                    than he has done yet since he went to the Admiralty. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> did mention my brother to
                    him; but we had no borough interest to back us, and fourteen years&#8217; hard service go for nothing, with wounds, blowing up,
                    honourable mention, and excellent good conduct. Still I have a sort of faith (God willing) that he will be an Admiral yet.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am hurrying my printer with Espriella,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Letters from England by Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. Translated from the Spanish</title> (1807). It was being printed
                        by Richard Taylor (1781&#8211;1858; <title>DNB</title>).</note> for fear another translation should appear before mine, which, you
                    know, would be very unlucky. Ten sheets of the second volume are done. I much wish it were out, having better hopes of its sale
                    than the fate of better books will perhaps warrant. But this is a good book in its way, and its way ought to be, in book-selling
