                        vampire &#8211; a creature new to most Britons, Southey having been one of the first to introduce it to English culture in his 1801
                        poem <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title>. For Southey&#8217;s earlier letter to Rickman regarding the error; see Southey to John
