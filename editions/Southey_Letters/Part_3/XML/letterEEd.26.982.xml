        <p>MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, &#8216;The Letters of Robert Southey to Mary Barker From
                        1800 to 1826&#8217; (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 126&#8211;128..  Previously  published: John Wood Warter (ed.),
                            Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey, 4 vols (London, 1856), I, pp. 334&#8211;335. Dating note:
                        [Kirkpatrick&#8217;s note on the manuscript] In the pencilled data at the top of the MS., the &#8216;5&#8217; has been written over with a
                        larger &#8216;4&#8217;. However, in Selections the date is incorrectly given as 1805. The reference to the sale of Greta
                        Hall established the date as October 1804. See Kenneth Curry (ed.), New Letters of Robert Southey, 2 vols
                        (London and New York, 1965), I, pp. 361&#8211;362. In his letter dated 15 October 1804 Southey states that George Dyer has gone, and
                        in this letter Edith Southey reports that &#8216;George Dyer left us this morning&#8217;. Southey dates the letter &#8216;Sunday&#8217;, so this is
                        presumably Sunday 14 October 1804. (The first dated reference to Greta Hall being sold is on 11 October 1804.)</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>

                        1800 to 1826&#8217; (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 126&#8211;128.<lb />Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.),

                        [Kirkpatrick&#8217;s note on the manuscript] In the pencilled data at the top of the MS., the &#8216;5&#8217; has been written over with a
                        larger &#8216;4&#8217;. However, in <title>Selections</title> the date is incorrectly given as 1805. The reference to the sale of Greta
                        Hall established the date as October 1804. See Kenneth Curry (ed.), <title>New Letters of Robert Southey</title>, 2 vols
                        (London and New York, 1965), I, pp. 361&#8211;362. In his letter dated 15 October 1804 Southey states that George Dyer has gone, and
                        in this letter Edith Southey reports that &#8216;George Dyer left us this morning&#8217;. Southey dates the letter &#8216;Sunday&#8217;, so this is
                        presumably Sunday 14 October 1804. (The first dated reference to Greta Hall being sold is on 11 October 1804.)</note>
