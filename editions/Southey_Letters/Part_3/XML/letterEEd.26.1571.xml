                    proves more &amp; more the superiority of our men, &amp; makes us groan for a fair field where we might once meet the enemy on
                    equal terms. Moore<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish General with a long and varied
                        military career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784&#8211;1790. After the controversial Convention of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809.</note> must have been a very able man, or he could not have obtained such a reputation, having so often been
                    unfortunate. I fear the worst consequence will be that this army, coming home dispirited &amp; exhausted as it needs must be, will
                    be full of complaints of the Spaniards, &amp; contribute still more to indispose the nation towards the only allies on whom any
                    well founded reliance can ever be placed, &#8211; allies from whom every thing is to be expected &#8211; except the one thing which we did
                    expect, &#8211; that they should at once be able to resist such armies as the French in the field. We have done far too much unless we
                    had done more, &#8211; &amp; more ought to have been done. It is in Spain that we may fight our own battle as effectually as on our
                    ground &#8211; &amp; with this mighty difference that victory there would be decisive, but defeat would not. Had there been, as there
                    should have been, a reinforcement of 20,000 men at Coru&#241;a, &#8211; what a blow might they have struck &#8211; a blow which would have been
                    felt at Madrid, &#8211; &amp; <del>ha</del> might have given an immediate turn to the war. &#8211; It seems to me that our ships have been our
                    bane in this business, &#8211; that had there been no embarkation to look to, we should have kept the mountains, &#8211; or fallen back upon
                    the strong frontier of Portugal, where there is a double line of fortified towns, the Spanish &amp; Portugueze. All will yet be
                    well if England acts with vigour, &#8211; but alas where are we to look for vigour? &#8211; not in the ministry, &#8211; &amp; still less in the
                    opposition, who never open their mouths but to show that wretchedly as the ministry have managed the business, they would
                        <del>have</del> be ten times worse. Still I do not abate one jot of heart or hope. The Spaniards are slow, but they are
                    persevering, &#8211; they must be beaten with soldiers, or then there will be no beating them out of it.</p>
