            <l rend="indent3"> Came with our guide, the venerable man</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With more especial welcome greeted us,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Deeming us children of another race</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Mightier than they, he led us to the Queen.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The fate of war had robbed her of her realm,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Yet with affection &amp; habitual awe,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And old remembrances that gave their love</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A deeper &amp; religious character,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Fallen as she was &amp; humbled as they were,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Her faithful people still in all they could</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Obeyed Erilyab, she too in her mind</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Those recollections cherished, &amp; such thoughts</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> As tho no hope tempered their bitterness,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Gave to her eye a spirit &amp; a strength</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And pride to features, which had borne belike,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Had they been fashioned to a happier fate,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Meaning more gentle &amp; more womanly,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Yet not more worthy of esteem &amp; love</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> She sate upon the threshold of her hut,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> For in the palace where her sires had reigned</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The conqueror dwelt, her son was at her side</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A boy now near to manhood, by the door.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Stript of its bark, the head &amp; branches lopt</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Stood a young tree with many a weapon hung,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Her husbands war-pole &amp; his monument.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> These had his quiver mouldered, his stone axe</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Had there grown green with moss his bow-string there</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Sung as it cut the wind.</l>
            <l rend="indent6"> She welcomed us</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> With a proud sorrow in her mien; fresh fruits</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Were spread before us, &amp; her gestures said</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> That when he lived whose hand was wont to wield</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Those weapons &#8211; that in better days, &#8211; that ere </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> She let the tresses of her widowhood</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Grow wild, she could have given to guests like us</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A worthier welcome, soon a man approached</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Hooded with sable &amp; his half bare limbs</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Smeared black; the people at his sight drew round,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The women waild &amp; wept, the children turnd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And hid their faces on their mothers knees</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Of different sexes, but of age alike</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Some six years each, they at his touch shriekd out &#8211;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> But then Lincoya rose &amp; to my feet</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Led them, &amp; told me that the conquerors claimd</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> These innocents for tribute, that the Priest</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Would lay them on the altar of his God,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Tear out their little hearts in sacrifice,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Yea with more cursed wickedness, himself </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Feed on their flesh! .. I shuddered &amp; my hand</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Instinctively unsheathd the holy sword,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> He with most passionate &amp; eloquent signs,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Eye-speaking earnestness &amp; quivering lips</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Besought me to preserve himself, &amp; those</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Who now fell suppliant round me, youths &amp; maids,</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Like boundless ocean from a hill-top seen.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A beautiful &amp; populous plain it was,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Fair woods were there &amp; fertilizing streams,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And pastures spreading wide, &amp; villages</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> In fruitful groves embowred, &amp; stately towns, </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And many a single dwelling specking it,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> As though for many a year the land had been</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> A broad blue lake extended far &amp; wide</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Its waters, dark beneath the light of noon,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> There Aztlan stood upon the farther shore;</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Amid the shade of trees its dwellings rose,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Their level roofs with turrets set around</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And battlements all burnished white, that shone</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Like silver in the sunshine. I beheld </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> The imperial city, her far-circling walls,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Her garden groves &amp; stately palaces,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Her temples mountain-size, her thousand roofs,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And when I saw her might &amp; majesty</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> My mind misgave me then.</l>
            <l rend="indent6"> We reachd the shore</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> A floating Islet waited for me there,</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Upon green-growing herbs &amp; flowers, &amp; sate</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Embowered in odorous shrubs; four long light boats</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Yoked to the garden, with accordant song</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And dip &amp; dash of oar in harmony,</l>

            <l rend="indent6"> Then in a car</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Aloft by human bearers was I borne,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And thro the city-gate, &amp; thro long lines</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Of marshalled multitudes who throng&#8217;d the way,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> We reached the palace court; four Priests were there,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Each held a burning censor in his hand,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And strewed the precious gum as I drew nigh,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And held the steaming fragrance forth to me</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> As I had been a God, they led me in,</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> In truth I felt my weakness, &amp; the view</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> Was more than natural courage, twas a trust</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> In more than mortal strength, a faith in God,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> An inspiration from the Almighty One</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Whose Champion then I seemd to be. I cried </l>
            <l rend="indent3"> Not tho ten cities ten times obeyed</l>

            <l rend="indent3"> The court, no word Coanoctozin spake.</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> And I too went in silent thoughtfulness,</l>
            <l rend="indent3"> But then, when save Lincoya, there was no one</l>
