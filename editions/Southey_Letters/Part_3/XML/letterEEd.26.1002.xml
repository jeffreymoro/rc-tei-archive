                    good for him to be alone. So that being most heroically in love with some unknown asinine fair one, he set off this morning in
                    quest of her, like a Prince in the Persian Tales. Now it fell out that at this unhappy time there came a man over the bridge
                    riding upon just such a beast as the adventurer was seeking. John beheld her, galloped after into the middle of the town, &amp;
                    there attacked the rider, – Amor vincit omnia<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Meaning ‘love conquers all’, Virgil (70

                    can prove &amp; in their conflict John unassed his enemy &amp; fairly threw him in the dirt. A great uproar arose, the beholders
                    did not behave as by all the feelings &amp; laws of chivalry they were bound to do; they were neither moved by the valour of John,
                    nor by his generosity for he scorned to tread upon the fallen, but they were prepared to take vengeance for their fellow—when like

                        unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer <hi rend="ital">General Ernouf</hi> (formerly the British sloop of war
                            <hi rend="ital">Lilly</hi>) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or
                        wounded, and Southey suspected that his brother was among the dead. The first lieutenant had been reported as dead, but Thomas
                        was absent from the raid because he had been placed under arrest. Charles Hayman (d. 1804) was made first lieutenant in his
