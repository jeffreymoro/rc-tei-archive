        <p rend="indent1"> Whether Grosvenor you will ascribe it to the cut of my nose, I cannot tell, nor whether it be a proof of the natural
               wickedness of the heart, but so it is that I am less disposed to be very much obliged to the Treasury for giving me 200 a year, than I
               am to swear at the Taxes for having the impudence to take 56 of it back again. And if it were a pull Devil pull Baker<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> An old English proverb meaning they are both as bad as each other.</note> between that loyalty which,
               as you know has always been so predominant in my heart, &amp; that jacobinism of which you know how vilely I have been suspected, I am
               afraid the fifty six would give a stronger pull on the Bakers side than the 144 on the Devils. Look you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bedford
               of the Exchequer it is out of all conscience. Ten in the hundred has always in all Christian states been thought damnable usury, &amp;
               to say that a man took ten in the hundred was the same as saying that he would go to the Devil &#8211; but this is <del>three</del> eight

        <p rend="indent1"> I am a little surprized to find you speak so contemptuously of modem poetry, &#8211; because it shows how very little you
               must have read, or how little you can have considered the subject. The improvement during the present reign has been to the full as
               great in poetry as it has in the experimental sciences, or in the art of raising money by taxation. What can you have been thinking of
               when you wrote that sentence? had you forgotten Burns<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Burns (1759&#8211;1796;

               good one, &amp; having no principle of judgement in your own mind, you praise &amp; blame almost at hap-hazard, according to the humour
               you are in. Indeed to speak plainly I think you want that tact or peculiar frame of mind &#8211; be it what it may, without which it is
               impossible ever really to understand in what the essence of poetry consists, or to distinguish between what is gold &amp; what is only
