          <salute>My dear Cottle,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> On opening a box today the contents of which I had not seen since the winter of 1799, your picture made its
                    appearance. Of all Robert Hancocks performances it is infinitely the best.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Robert Hancock
                        (1730&#8211;1817) made portraits of Southey, Coleridge and Cottle in 1796.</note> I cannot conceive a happier likeness. I have been
                    thinking of you &amp; of old times ever since it came to light. I have been reading your Fall of Cambria<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Cottle&#8217;s <title>The Fall of Cambria, a Poem</title> (1808), dealt with the conquest of Wales by King Edward I
                        (1239&#8211;1307; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &amp; in the little <del>time</del> &lt;interval&gt; that remains before supper, must
                    talk to you in reply to your letter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What you say of my copyrights affected me very much. Dear Cottle set your heart at rest upon that subject, it ought
                    to be at rest. They were yours: &#8211; fairly bought &amp; fairly sold; you bought them upon the chance of their success, &#8211; which no
                    London bookseller would have done; &amp; had they not been bought they could not have been published at all; &#8211; nay, if you had not
                        <del>bought</del> &lt;purchased&gt; Joan of Arc<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s poem <title>Joan of
                            Arc</title>, published by Cottle in 1796.</note>
          <del>xxx</del> the poem <del>xxx</del> never would have existed nor should I in all probability ever have obtained that reputation
                    which is the capital on which I subsist, <del>&amp;</del> &lt;nor&gt; that power which enables me to support it. But this is not
                    all. Do you suppose Cottle that I <del>am</del> have forgotten those true &amp; most essential acts of friendship which you showed
                    me when I stood most in need of them? Your house was my house when I had no other; the very money with which I bought my
                    marriage-ring &amp; paid my marriage fees was supplied by you; it was with your sister that I left <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> during my six months absence, &#8211; &amp; for the six months after my return it was
                    from you that I received week by week the little on which we lived, &#8211; till I was enabled to live by other means. It is not the
                    settling of our cash-account that can cancel obligations like this. &#8211; You are in the habit of preserving your letters, &amp; if
                    you were not I would entreat you to preserve this &#8211; that it may be seen hereafter. <del>It is my</del> Sure am I that there never
                    was a more generous or kinder heart than yours, &amp; you will believe me when I add that there does not live that man upon earth
                    whom I remember with more gratitude &amp; more affection.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My head throbs &amp; my eyes burn with these recollections. Good night my dear old friend &amp; benefactor.</p>
        <p rend="indent5"> ____</p>
        <p>Thursday.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have read thro nineteen books of the Fall of Cambria &amp; shall finish the poem tomorrow. Of the <del>p</del>
                    story therefore I am not at present able to speak. It seems to me that you would write <del>x</del> a long narrative poem far
                    better in rhyme than in blank verse &#8211; &amp; if you attempt another I should earnestly advise you to use either a regular rhymed
                    stanza, &#8211; or that irregular form which <ref target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> has made so popular, &#8211; indeed any mode of
                    rhyming except the monotonous common couplet. The facility of writing which you possess tempts you to dilate too much, &amp; this
                    temptation is more easily yielded to in blank verse. Rhyme would also lead you to lessen the quantity of dialogue &amp; the length
                    of the speeches. It would have another important advantage &#8211; there is so much danger of sacrificing sense to sound in rhyming,
                    that one is always upon the watch against it: &#8211; your feelings carry you away &#8211; you find words which seem at first to express them
                    &amp; <hi rend="ital">do</hi> give them vent. but it is not always possible for another to make out a precise &amp; definite
                    meaning, for what you conceived strongly, but vaguely. In many instances I, who can enter into the mind of a poet, see when you
                    have had a true poetic feeling, &#8211; &amp; yet have failed <del>t</del> &lt;in&gt; bringing it fairly to light.</p>

                    there is a strange inconsistency of character in the Knight &amp; Squire who betray Gloucester: &#8211; you first describe them as men
                    of high honour &#8211; then make them traitors.</p>
