                    the best medicine in such cases it is not always so &#8211; &amp; I know one instance (that of <ref target="people.html#ClarksonCatherine">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Clarkson</ref>) wherein by immediately proscribing it &amp;
                    prescribing something else, <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref> checked the disease, &amp; saved the patient.
                    For Gods sake Grosvenor if you do not certainly feel yourself recovering by this ordinary mode of practise state your case to <ref target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</ref>, a man who never tries experiments except when ordinary methods would fail,
                    &amp; who in liver cases is eminently successful. This is not said from any personal liking to the man &#8211; I do not like him, &#8211; but
                    I have the highest respect for his professional talents, &amp; would in any case of illness resign myself into his hand with the
                    most perfect confidence that he would do for me whatever could be done by medical skill.</p>

                    subject to my style. Sometimes it shall be a stile, &amp; sometimes a <del>xxx</del> turnstile, &amp; sometimes a five barred

                        which the Guildhall stands. Carvings of the giants are kept at the Guildhall and used in the Lord Mayor&#8217;s show each

                        appeared in the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 7 (October 1805), 1&#8211;29.</note> I said to him that the stile of Pope was
                    excellent for satire, &amp; perhaps if I wrote satire I should imitate it. That&#8217;s a great concession, said he. &#8211; No Sir, rejoined
                    I, &#8211; for if it be the fit style for satire, how can it be <del>xxx</del> fit <del>xx</del> for narration? &#8212;</p>
