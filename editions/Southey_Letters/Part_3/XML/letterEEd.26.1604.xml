        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The reviewal will answer its purpose exceedingly well<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey had asked
                        Bedford to write a review of his <title>Chronicle of the Cid</title> (1808) for the <title>Monthly Review</title>; see Southey
                        to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 28 February 1809, Letter 1590. The book was reviewed in complimentary terms in the
                            <title>Monthly Review</title>, 63 (1810), 131&#8211;144.</note> &#8211; I have pointed out the only error which it contains. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Respecting the Hebraisms you have gone a little too far. &#8211; The resemblance to our Biblical language which is most
                    apparent is <del>the</del> in the continually beginning the sentence with some superfluous particle. &#8211; This is <del>literal
                        in</del> the case in all the oldest Chronicles of Spain &amp; Portugal, <del>&amp;</del> in Geoffroy de Ville-Hardouyn<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"> Geoffrey of Villehardouin (1160-c. 1212) was a knight who took part in the Fourth
                        Crusade, which invaded and conquered the city of Constantinople. He wrote an eyewitness account of the event in <title>De la
                            Conqu&#234;te de Constantinople</title> (written c. 1207).</note> it is also to be remarked tho not so uniformly, &#8211; I have not
                    the original of Joinville<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"> Jean de Joinville (1224&#8211;1317), <title>Chronica y Vida del Rey
                            Sant Luys de Francia ... Traduzida de Lengua Francera en Castellana ... por J. Lidel</title> (1557).</note> to refer to,
                    &amp; know not whether it be the same there also, &#8211; but there is a stage of intellect in which this is the natural mode of
                    narration, it is the critical &#8216;&amp; so&#8217; of children &amp; uneducated persons in our own times. &#8211; I imitated the Bible no more in
                    the Cid than in Amadis,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey&#8217;s translation of the Spanish romance <title>Amadis of
                            Gaul</title> (1803).</note> I always rendered the original as literally as possible, knowing that the very idioms of
                    distant nations or ages throw light upon their history.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is as much resemblance between <del>my</del> &lt;this&gt; Chronicle &amp; the historical Books of the Bible
                    in matter as in manners, &amp; hence the similarity of manner is more perceptible, <del>&amp; more to be for</del>. The Spaniards
                    then were just as barbarous as the Jews under their Judges, &#8211; &amp; the <del>xxx</del> Moors were their Canaanites, with this
                    difference that they were the invaders, not the invaded but there was on this account a more righteous hatred, with the same
                    religious contempt. Hebrew poetry partakes in some degree of the figurativeness of Oriental style tho except in Solomons Song it
                    rarely or never runs into absurdities, but Hebrew narration has nothing of this character. The books of Joshua Judges &amp; Samuel
                    resemble the Chronicle of the Cid in matter &amp; manner just as much as the Death Song of an American Indian resembles that of
                    Regner Lodbrog<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> Regnar Lodbrog was an 8th-century Danish legendary king, whose
                        death-song was the subject of an Old Norse poem entitled &#8216;The Dying Ode of Regner Lodbrog&#8217;, in Thomas Percy&#8217;s (1729&#8211;1811;
                            <title>DNB</title>), <title>Five Pieces of Runic Poetry Translated from the Islandic Language</title> (1763).</note>
                    &lt;&amp; for the same reason&gt;, &#8211; the circumstances under which they were composed <del>both being</del> &lt;were&gt; the same,
                    they were written by men in <del>the sa</del> a similar state of society, who related what they had heard or seen, faithfully,
                    vividly, &amp; in that language which most readily presented itself, never going out of their way for ornaments of style, nor
                    stopping to round a period, but telling their story straight forward.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Now Grosvenor to have told the story of the Cid in modern style would &amp; must have been to write a book instead
                    of translating one; &#8211; for it is every where translation, &#8211; or at least the connecting patches &lt;of new stuff&gt; are too few to
                    be worth mentioning.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your reviewal will bear two or three pages more of extract, which perhaps it will be best to give <add>xxxxx</add>
                    from the Introduction, because <del>that</del> &lt;it&gt; will show that when writing in my own character I write so much in the
                    language of my own contemporaries as a man can do who does not write in defiance of sense &amp; <del>x</del> syntax.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Concerning the next Quarterly I am desired to postpone the South Sea Mission,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"> Southey reviewed <title>Transactions of the Missionary Society in the South Sea Islands</title> for the second number of
