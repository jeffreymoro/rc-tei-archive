                  </div> &amp; now receive from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">M<sup>r</sup> Charles Lloyd</a> so very flattering a proof of it. No man can be more indifferent to the censure of

                  score of ignorance <span class="strikethrough">is</span> &lt;or&gt; malevolence, the other I take as earnest of what posterity will give me, &amp; if
                  this be not the most impartial way of considering the case, it is certainly the most
                  convenient. But whenever they who censure &amp; they who praise <span class="strikethrough">have been</span> &lt;are&gt; known, – I <span class="strikethrough">have</span> am justified in it, &amp; in no instance more than in the present.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The applause which you give me is more than I deserve. – It was at one time my intention
                  to have stated in the preface my own sense of the imperfections of the poem<span class="strikethrough">s</span>. I was <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxxx</span> This was what I should have said, after relating how long the poem had been in hand,
                  how often interrupted, &amp; how often corrected. ‘Perhaps at a more advanced age I might
                  have chosen a story which could have been carried on in one unbroken &amp; continuous
                  narrative; I might have framed a better &amp; more coherent fable; I might have made my
                  own country the theatre of action that the scenery might have been that which I understood,
                  &amp; the manners those to which my earliest studies had familiarized my imagination.
                  Nor have the early choice of subject &amp; predestination of story been the only disadvantages
                  arising from the slow growth of the poem. Unsparingly as I have endeavoured to weed
                  out the defects of early composition, many must inevitably have escaped. I fear I
                  have yet to discover barbarisms of language, false ornaments, &amp; passages feeble or
                  superfluous, which have still deceived me by reviving the associations with which
                  they were originally accompanied. Perhaps no author ever sent into the world a production
                  with so humiliating a sense of its imperfection. When my first poem was published
                  I had too much confidence, &amp; too little knowledge, to feel any distrust or diffidence
                  of its merit; &amp; in Thalaba

                  </div> all which had been promised to myself was certainly &amp; satisfactorily performed. But
                  I had ever considered both as only preludes to this greater work, – as exercises which
                  were to strengthen &amp; prepare me for this serious effort. I looked to this as the monument
                  which was to perpetuate my memory; the proof that should justify the determination
                  with which I had abandoned all common pursuits of fortune to devote myself to literature.
                  – However I may disappoint the reader he may be assured that I have disappointed myself
                  far<span class="strikethrough">x</span> more. His expectations can have been raised only by what I have already done; but
                  I compare what is executed with what was designed; remembering the hopes which have
                  made many an hour of labour delightful; &amp; feeling, imperfect as this poem is, there
                  is little likelihood that I shall ever produce a better.’</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Our world, Miss Seward, is so little accustomed to this sort of plain speaking &amp; serious
               feeling, which I have acquired, or rather preserved, by living out of it, – that this
               would have been put down to the sense of affected humility. I send it you, as being
               precisely what I feel concerning Madoc, which I begun in 1789 at the age of fifteen.
               Since it was published I have written no poetry: disuse has now generated disinclination,
               &amp; perhaps in a little time my hand may lose its cunning.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There are many causes for this. I have been long employed in historical composition,
                  &amp; think it so certain that I shall stand in the first rank of historians, that this
                  hope goads me on. Half my Ways &amp; Means must be raised from the Booksellers, &amp; half
                  my time is employed in raising them. I am far from complaining of this. Any other
                  profession would have exacted from me the whole, – except that of divinity from which
                  my religious opinions deterred me: &amp; tho’ time employed in writing for money is unworthily
                  employed, yet as man must live &amp; that not by bread alone, there is no other way by
                  which I could have lived so congruous to my own inclinations &amp; pursuits. – I have
                  therefore no leisure for poetry, for that is not a marketable article; – this mischief
                  a reviewer can do me. My profits upon Madoc after a years sale amounted to 3. 17.
                  1. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Mr Jeffray</a> the Edinburgh Advocate, <span class="strikethrough">I</span> a gentleman who is up to my elbow in stature, &amp; in intellectual stature, as far as
                  regards all matters of taste, up to my ancle, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Mr Jeffray</a> had said in his Review ‘if Mr Southey will continue to write in this manner, really
                  we cannot help it!’

                  </div> – This was very true. But if it had so happened that I had been a friend of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Mr Jeffrays</a>, &amp; it had pleased him to say I was a great poet, the book-buying world (who are a
                  different world from the book-reading one) would have believed him, &amp; I should have
                  been enabled to have produced something better than Madoc, &amp; more answerable to that

                  might be assigned in support of this heresy, which if they did not win your belief
                  – might at least moderate your censure. Your letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> has not been without some effect; – it roused me – as the cry of &lt;the&gt; hounds would

                  in harness at the inn door; he thinks of the chase, – till crack goes the whip over

                  as a year for each would have been time sufficient. For a work of higher proof I am
