            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When my last letter to you was past recall, I felt for the first time in my life dissatisfied
                  for having done what I had persuaded myself it was my duty to do.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In July 1809, Southey was informed by Richard Sharp that the stewardship of the Derwentwater
                           Estates (which were owned by Greenwich Hospital) would soon become vacant on the death
                           of the incumbent. Southey asked several friends to intercede on his behalf, including
                           George Beaumont, but in the end the position was considered unsuitable for him. In
                           his most recent letter to Beaumont he had asked him to assist in getting his brother,
                           Thomas promoted. For this, see Southey to Sir George Beaumont, 12 October 1809, Letter
                           1692.</span></div>
                  </div> A sense of humiliation hung upon me, as if I had taken advantage of one favour to
                  press for another, and as if the motives which justified me to myself might not be
                  sufficient to justify me to you. Notwithstanding the kindness with which you have
                  replied, something of this feeling still remains, and I confess it, not merely as
                  the only apology which it is in my power to offer, but as a proof also how earnestly
                  I must have desired to succeed in the application before I could resolve to make it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I had understood that with good interest it was not more difficult to obtain two steps
               than one; and in this error <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> confirmed me by mentioning the highest rank when he urged me to apply to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Mr. Canning</a>. It would however be a great thing to obtain one step, and if that could be gained
               it would give me a deeper feeling of joy than any other circumstance of my life. My
               very slight knowledge of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</a> could not authorise me in applying to him. I also know that he has many applications
               of a like nature upon the score of county and borough connections, which must necessarily
               be paramount to him. If Lord Melville were at the Admiralty, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a> would use his influence for me. From <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Mr. Grenville</a> I had a distant promise, and an assurance when he went out of office that if he had
               made any further promotions than that of merely filling up vacancies at that time
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> should have been included. It was some compliment to say so, but otherwise there
               was very little satisfaction in that preter-perfect-sense potential. At present this
               is the only channel through which I can apply. Had you been with me when you were
               at Keswick fewer excuses on my part would have been necessary than I feel now the
               wish, rather than the power, to offer. You would have seen a man with all the best
               parts of a sailor’s character, and equally qualified to do honour to his profession
               at sea or on shore.</p>
