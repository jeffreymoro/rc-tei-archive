                  to procure materials: but that is impossible, as Rome is probably the only place in
                  Europe where they could be found. This document with which you have obliged me is

                  history in existence; &amp; it contains some extracts from a Poem, certainly not less
                  than six, &amp; probably seven hundred years old, translated by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">M<sup>r</sup> Frere</a> (our late Embassador at Madrid) with a fidelity &amp; skill which I have<span class="strikethrough">n</span> never seen equalled.
