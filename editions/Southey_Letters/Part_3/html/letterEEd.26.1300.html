                           1807.</span></div>
                  </div> – &amp; a letter will be no trespass on your time. – That I am against any indulgence
                  to the Catholicks you know, – but I am not on that account (&amp; setting all personal
                  considerations aside) the less sorry for this mischievous change of ministry. I cannot
                  persuade myself that the ostensible cause can be the real one; it may have been used
                  as a pretext by those who influence the King, or he may have made it a pretext himself
                  to gratify his resentment against for the Abolition of the Slave T &amp; for the projected
                  reforms. What a precedent – a ministry changed without any wish for the change having
                  been expressed either by the parliament or the country; but who on the contrary were
                  strong almost beyond example in both; – from the mere exertion of the prerogative,
                  the mere will of &amp; pleasure of the Sovereign, who chuses to put in their place men
                  of tried &amp; convicted incapacity, with an old woman at their head!

                  </div> – Such a ministry cannot long support itself – I doubt whether it can command a majority,
                  &amp; if it dissolves parliament doubt whether it can form a new one in its interests.</p>

                           in 1806. He then sailed his squadron across the Atlantic and occupied Buenos Aires—an
                           occupation Britain proved unable to maintain, despite sending a second, reinforcing
                           expedition, against the hostility of the inhabitants. Popham was reprimanded for acting

                  </div> in which it seems to me you were decidedly right. His conduct has been very mischievous.
                  The more I know of South America the more I am convinced that our policy is to seperate
                  it from Spain, but not to attempt its conquest. Any such attempt can only end eventually
                  in defeat – &amp; shame, – tho it may send home dollars at first. &amp; give the existing
                  ministry that patronage which is the game they play for. This subject will occupy
                  the concluding chapter of my Brazil &amp; Paraguay.

                  There was something ungracious in the way of receiving the intelligence that the Cape

                           evacuation of the Portuguese royal family to Brazil in the event of Portugal’s invasion
                           by Napoleonic forces, and to discuss British aid.</span></div>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My mind has been made up to a settled residence in this place. It became necessary
                  from some arrangements of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a>, that I should either quit <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GretaHall">the house</a> soon, or resolve upon abiding in it: &amp; having neither inclination nor means for a
                  … removal I resolved to stay. Accordingly, after living three years &amp; a half in a
                  house half-finished &amp; half furnished, we are now endeavouring to get as many comforts
                  about us as are within our reach. I have sent for my books which are to come by sea:
                  stocked the garden with currant bushes &amp; such like fruits, &amp; am about to plant a hedge
                  round it, put in a few shrubs &amp; flowers – &amp; make the whole as ornamental &amp; as convenient
                  as I can. And unless I ever go to settle in Lisbon, few things could excite a wish
                  in me ever to remove from hence. once in two years I purpose visiting London. – The
                  distance is an evil but not a material one – especially if I <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> have any friends to halt with on the way. – The main objection to this place will
                  be removed when my books arrive, which are a very respectable collection. – the greater
                  part being <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a>. Society I do not want – of this I can speak from experience, &amp; sure I am that I
                  should be less happy with a coach &amp; four in London than I am when rowing my own boat
                  upon Derwentwater. And when you have it in your power again, let the one thing which
                  you seek for me be the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> title of Historiographer
