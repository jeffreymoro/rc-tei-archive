               <div class="l">Leaving such guard alone as need required</div>
               <div class="l">To join us arm’d for battle, let me give them</div>
               <div class="l">The praise they well deserve; right gallant men</div>
               <div class="l">Were they, &amp; tho upon the playful deep</div>
               <div class="l">The tyranny of terror conquered them,</div>
               <div class="l">Save only then, I ever found them serve me</div>
               <div class="l">With true affection, patient of their toil,</div>
               <div class="l">Fearless in every danger.</div>
               <div class="l">I the while</div>
               <div class="l">Took counsel with Cadwallon &amp; his sire,</div>

               <div class="l">And what advantage from the mountain straits</div>
               <div class="l">I thought, us in the Saxon wars, to win,</div>
               <div class="l">Thou sawest their weapons, then, Cadwallon said,</div>
               <div class="l">Are they like these rude works of ignorance</div>
               <div class="l">Bone-headed shafts, &amp; spears of wood &amp; shields</div>
               <div class="l">Strong only for such strife?</div>
               <div class="l">We had to cope</div>
               <div class="l">With wiser enemies &amp; abler arm’d</div>
               <div class="l">What for the sword wielded was a stave</div>
               <div class="l">Set thick with stones across: you would have judged</div>
               <div class="l">That uncouth shape was cumberous, but a hand</div>
               <div class="l">Expert &amp; practised to its use, could drive</div>
               <div class="l">The heavy edge with deadly impulse down,</div>
               <div class="l">Their mail, if mail it may be called, was woven</div>
               <div class="l">Of vegetable down, seeming like flax</div>
               <div class="l">Bleached to the whiteness of the new-fallen snow,</div>
               <div class="l">To every bend &amp; motion flexible,</div>
               <div class="l">Light as a warriors summer garb in peace,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet in that lightest softest habergeon</div>
               <div class="l">Harmless the sharp stone-arrow-head would hang.</div>
               <div class="l">Others of higher office were array’d</div>
               <div class="l">In feathery breast plates, of more gorgeous hue</div>
               <div class="l">Then the gay plumage of the mountain cock,</div>

               <div class="l">Or what this gold hauberk, when opposed </div>
               <div class="l">To arms like ours in battle? What the mail</div>

               <div class="l">Against our northern spears, or battle axe</div>
               <div class="l">Or good sword wielded in a British hand?</div><br><div class="l">Then, quoth Cadwallon, ‘at the wooden helm</div>
               <div class="l">Of these weak arms the weakest, let the sword</div>

               <div class="l">We will not trust in battle. from the heights </div>
               <div class="l">They with their arrows may annoy the foe,</div>
               <div class="l">And when our closer strife has won the fray,</div>
               <div class="l">Then let them loose for havoc.’</div>
               <div class="l">‘O my son!’</div>
               <div class="l">Exclaim’d the blind old man, thou counsellest ill.</div>
               <div class="l">Blood will have blood, revenge begat revenge</div>
               <div class="l">Evil must come of evil! we shall win</div>
               <div class="l">Certes a cheap &amp; easy victory</div>
               <div class="l">In the first field, their arrows from our arms</div>
               <div class="l">Will fall, &amp; on the hauberk &amp; the helm</div>
               <div class="l">The stone edge blunt &amp; break; whole thro their limbs</div>
               <div class="l">Naked, or vainly fenced, the grinding steel</div>
               <div class="l">Shall sheer its mortal way. But what are we</div>
               <div class="l">Against a nation? other hosts will rise</div>
               <div class="l">In endless warfare, with perpetual fights</div>
               <div class="l">Dwindling our all-too-few, or multitudes</div>
               <div class="l">Will wear &amp; weary us till we sink subdued</div>
               <div class="l">By the very toil of conquest. Ye are brave,</div>
               <div class="l">But he who puts his trust in mortal strength,</div>
               <div class="l">Leans on a broken reed! first prove your power</div>
               <div class="l">Be in the battle terrible, but spare </div>
               <div class="l">The fallen &amp; follow not the flying foe,</div>
               <div class="l">Then may ye win a nobler victory,</div>
               <div class="l">So dealing with the captives as to fill</div>
               <div class="l">Their hearts with wonder, gratitude &amp; awe,</div>
               <div class="l">That love shall mingle with their fear, &amp; fear</div>
               <div class="l">Stablish the love else wavering. Let them see</div>
               <div class="l">That as more pure &amp; gentle is your faith,</div>
               <div class="l">Your-selves are gentler, purer, ye shall be</div>
               <div class="l">As Gods among them, if ye thus obey</div>
               <div class="l">Gods precepts.’</div>
               <div class="l">Soon the mountain-tribes in arms</div>
               <div class="l">Rose at Lincoyas call a numerous host,</div>
               <div class="l">More than in numbers, in the memory</div>
               <div class="l">Of long oppression &amp; revengeful hope</div>
               <div class="l">A formidable foe. I stationed them</div>
               <div class="l">Where at the entrance of the rocky straits</div>
               <div class="l">Secure themselves their arrows might command</div>
               <div class="l">The coming army. on the level ground</div>
               <div class="l">We took our stand, between the mountain base</div>
               <div class="l">And the green margin of the waters. Soon</div>
               <div class="l">Their long array came on. Oh what a pomp</div>
               <div class="l">And pride &amp; pageantry of war was there!</div>
               <div class="l">Not half so gorgeous for their may day mirth</div>
               <div class="l">All wreath’d &amp; ribbanded our youth &amp; maids </div>
               <div class="l">As these stern Aztecas in war-attire!</div>
               <div class="l">The golden glitterance, &amp; the feather mail</div>
               <div class="l">More gay than glittering gold, &amp; round the helm </div>
               <div class="l">A coronal of high upstanding plumes,</div>
               <div class="l">Green as the spring grass in a sunny shower,</div>
               <div class="l">Or scarlet-bright, as in the wintry wood</div>
               <div class="l">The clustered holly, or of purple tint.</div>
               <div class="l">Whereto shall that be likened … to what gem</div>
               <div class="l">Indiademd, what flower, what insects wing?</div>
               <div class="l">With war songs &amp; wild music they came on </div>
               <div class="l">We the while kneeling raised with one accord</div>
               <div class="l">The hymn of supplication.</div>
               <div class="l">Front to front</div>
               <div class="l">And now the embattled armies stood, a band</div>
               <div class="l">Of priests all sable-garmented advanced, </div>
               <div class="l">They piled a heap of sedge before our host</div>
               <div class="l">And warn’d us ... ‘sons of Ocean, from the land</div>
               <div class="l">Of Aztlan, while ye may, depart in peace!</div>
               <div class="l">Before this fire shall be extinguished, hence!</div>
               <div class="l">Or even as yon dry sedge amid the flame,</div>
               <div class="l">So, ye shall be consumed .. the arid heap</div>
               <div class="l">They kindled, &amp; the rapid flame ran up </div>
               <div class="l">And blazed &amp; died away, then from his bow</div>
               <div class="l">With steady hand their chosen archer loosed </div>
               <div class="l">The arrow of the Omen, to its mark</div>
               <div class="l">The shaft of divination fled; it smote</div>
               <div class="l">Cadwallons plated breast, the brittle point</div>
               <div class="l">Rebounded; he contemptuous of their faith</div>
               <div class="l">Stoopt for the shaft, &amp; while with zealous speed</div>
               <div class="l">To the rescue they rushd onward, snapping it</div>
               <div class="l">Asunder cast the fragments back in scorn.</div><br><div class="l">Fierce was their onset, never in the field</div>
               <div class="l">Encountered I with braver enemies,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor marvel ye – nor think it to their shame</div>
               <div class="l">If soon they staggered, &amp; gave way, &amp; fled,</div>
               <div class="l">So many from so few; they saw their darts</div>
               <div class="l">Recoil, their lances shiver, &amp; their swords</div>
               <div class="l">Fall ineffectual, blunted with the blow</div>
               <div class="l">Think ye no shame of Aztlan that they fled</div>
               <div class="l">When the bowyers of Deheubarth plied so well</div>
               <div class="l">Their shafts with fatal aim, thro the thin gold</div>
               <div class="l">Or feather mail while Gwyneths deep-driven spears</div>
               <div class="l">Pierced to the bone &amp; vitals, when they saw</div>
               <div class="l">The falchion, flashing late so lightning like,</div>
               <div class="l">Quenched in their own life blood, our mountaineers</div>
               <div class="l">Showered from the heights meantime an arrowy storm</div>
               <div class="l">Themselves secure, &amp; we who bore the brunt</div>
               <div class="l">Of battle, iron men, impassible,</div>
               <div class="l">Stood in our strength unbroken, marvel not</div>
               <div class="l">If then the brave felt fear, already impressd</div>
               <div class="l">That day with ominous thoughts to fear akin,</div>
               <div class="l">For it so chanced, high heaven ordaining so,</div>
               <div class="l">The King who should have led his people forth,</div>
               <div class="l">At the army-head, as they began their march</div>
               <div class="l">Was with sore sickness stricken, &amp; the stroke,</div>
               <div class="l">Came like the act &amp; arm of very God,</div>
               <div class="l">So suddenly, &amp; in that point of time.</div>
               <div class="l">A gallant man was he who in his stead</div>
               <div class="l">That day commanded Aztlan; his long hair</div>
               <div class="l">Tufted with many a cotton lock, proclaimed </div>
               <div class="l">Of princely prowess many a feat atchieved</div>
               <div class="l">In many a field of fame. oft had he led </div>
               <div class="l">The Aztecas with happy fortune forth,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet could not now Yuhidthiton inspire</div>
               <div class="l">His host with hope, he, not the less, that day</div>
               <div class="l">True to his old renown, &amp; in the hour</div>
               <div class="l">Of rout &amp; ruin with collected mind,</div>
               <div class="l">Sounded his signals shrill, &amp; in the voice</div>
               <div class="l">Of loud reproach, &amp; anger, &amp; brave shame</div>
               <div class="l">Calld on the people; .. but when nought availd </div>
               <div class="l">Seizing the standard from the timid hand</div>
               <div class="l">That held it in dismay, alone he turnd</div>
               <div class="l">For honourable death resolved, &amp; praise</div>
               <div class="l">That would not die. at that the braver chiefs</div>
               <div class="l">Rallied, anew their signals rung around,</div>
               <div class="l">And Aztlan seeing how we spared her flight</div>
               <div class="l">Took heart, &amp; rolld the tide of battle back</div>
               <div class="l">But when Cadwallon from the chieftains grasp</div>
               <div class="l">Had cut the standard-staff away, &amp; stunnd</div>
               <div class="l">And stretched him at his mercy on the field,</div>
               <div class="l">Then fled the enemy in utter rout,</div>
               <div class="l">Broken &amp; quelled at heart. Of chief alone</div>
               <div class="l">Bestrode the body of Yuhidthiton;</div>
               <div class="l">Bare headed did young Malinal bestride</div>
               <div class="l">His brothers body, wiping from his brow</div>
               <div class="l">With the shield-hand the blinding blood away</div>
               <div class="l">And dealing frantically with broken sword </div>
               <div class="l">Obstinate wrath, the last resisting foe,</div>
               <div class="l">Him in his own despite we seized &amp; saved</div><br><div class="l">Then in the moment of our victory</div>
               <div class="l">We purified our hands from blood, &amp; knealt</div>
               <div class="l">And pourd to Heaven the grateful prayer of praise</div>
               <div class="l">And raised the choral psalm – Triumphant thus</div>
               <div class="l">To the hills we went our way, the mountaineers</div>
               <div class="l">With joy &amp; dissonant song &amp; antic dance,</div>
               <div class="l">The captives sullenly deeming that they went</div>
               <div class="l">To meet the certain death of sacrifice</div>
               <div class="l">Yet stern &amp; undismayed. we bade them know</div>
               <div class="l">Ours was a law of mercy &amp; of love.</div>
               <div class="l">We healed their wounds, &amp; set the prisoners free</div>
               <div class="l">‘Bear yea,’ quoth I my bidding to your King,</div>
               <div class="l">Say to him, did the Stranger speak to thee</div>
               <div class="l">The words of truth, &amp; hath he proved his power</div>
               <div class="l">Thus saith the Lord of Ocean, in the name </div>

                  we are got half way for we have come two short leagues, &amp; have two long ones to go,

                  of wind stirring – so that the Lake being perfectly still became like a great mirror,
                  &amp; represented the shores mountains sky &amp; clouds so vividly that there was not the
                  slightest appearance of water. it is impossible to make you conceive the wonderful
                  effect this produced unless you could conceive what the banks of Derwentwater are.

                  the range of mountains having one line of summit under my feet, &amp; another above me
                  seemed to be suspended between two firmaments. My fancy never pictured any scenery
