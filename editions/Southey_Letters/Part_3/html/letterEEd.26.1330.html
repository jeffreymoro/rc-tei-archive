               <p>I will review the books as soon as they arrive, and as well as I can, but I cannot
                  do them better for an Edinburgh Review than for an Annual one. There are many articles
                  which are valued precisely in proportion to the time and labour bestowed upon them,
                  and which therefore can be accurately fixed accordingly; these articles are not of
                  that description. The worst reviewals you have ever had from me have cost me more
                  time and labour than the best. When the subject is good, and I am acquainted with
                  it, the pen flows freely; otherwise it is tilling an ungrateful soil. I can promise
                  you a better review of Clavigero
