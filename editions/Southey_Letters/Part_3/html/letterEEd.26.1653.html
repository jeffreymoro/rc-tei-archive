            <div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">When the broad Ocean on Ladurlad’s head,</div>
               <div class="l">Had closed &amp; arch’d him oer,</div>
               <div class="l">With steady tread he held his way</div>
               <div class="l">Adown the sloping shore.</div>
               <div class="l">The dark-green waves with emerald hue</div>
               <div class="l">Imbue the beams of day;</div>
               <div class="l">And on the wrinkled sand below.</div>
               <div class="l">Rolling their mazy network to &amp; fro,</div>
               <div class="l">Light shadows shift &amp; play.</div>
               <div class="l">The hungry shark at scent of prey</div>
               <div class="l">Toward Ladurlad darted,</div>
               <div class="l">Beholding then that human form erect,</div>
               <div class="l">How like a God the depths he trod</div>
               <div class="l">Appalld the sea-wolf started</div>
               <div class="l">And in his fear departed</div>
               <div class="l">Onward Ladurlad went with heart elate</div>
               <div class="l">And now hath reachd the ancient Citys gate</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Wondering awhile he stood to gaze</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the works of elder days.</div>
               <div class="l">The brazen portals open stood</div>
               <div class="l">Even as the fearful multitude </div>
               <div class="l">Had left them when they fled</div>
               <div class="l">Before the rising flood.</div>
               <div class="l">High overhead sublime</div>
               <div class="l">The mighty arch its storied vault outspread</div>
               <div class="l">Which dwarfd the puny piles of younger time.</div>
               <div class="l">With the deeds of days of yore</div>
               <div class="l">The ample arch was sculpturd oer</div>
               <div class="l">And many a godlike form there met his eye,</div>
               <div class="l">And many an emblem dark of mystery.</div>
               <div class="l">Thro these wide portals oft had Bali rode</div>
               <div class="l">Triumphant from his proud abode,</div>
               <div class="l">When in his greatness he bestrode</div>
               <div class="l">The Aullay, hugest of four-footed kind,</div>
               <div class="l">The Aullay-horse that in his force</div>
               <div class="l">With elephantine trunk could bind</div>
               <div class="l">And lift the elephant, &amp; on the wind</div>
               <div class="l">Whirl him away, with sway &amp; swing</div>
               <div class="l">Even like a pebble from the practised sling.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Those streets which never since the days of yore</div>
               <div class="l">By human footstep had been visited,</div>
               <div class="l">These streets which never more</div>
               <div class="l">A human foot shall tread,</div>
               <div class="l">Ladurlad trod. In sunlight &amp; sea-green</div>
               <div class="l">The thousand palaces were seen</div>
               <div class="l">Of that proud city whose superb abodes</div>
               <div class="l">Seemd reard by Giants for the immortal Gods.</div>
               <div class="l">How silent &amp; how beautiful they stand</div>
               <div class="l">Like Kings of Nature, – the eternal rocks</div>
               <div class="l">Themselves not firmer. Neither hath the sand</div>
               <div class="l">Drifted within their gates &amp; choakd their doors,</div>
               <div class="l">Nor slime defild their pavements &amp; their floors</div>
               <div class="l">Did then the Ocean wage</div>
               <div class="l">His war for love &amp; envy, not in rage</div>
               <div class="l">O thou fair City, that he spares thee thus?</div>
               <div class="l">Art thou Varounins capital &amp; Court</div>
               <div class="l">Where all the Sea-Gods for delight resort,</div>
               <div class="l">A place too godlike to be held by us</div>
               <div class="l">The poor degenerate children of the earth?</div>
               <div class="l">A feeble wretched race of dwarfish birth.</div>
               <div class="l">So thought Ladurlad, &amp; he lookd around,</div>
               <div class="l">Weening to hear the sound</div>
               <div class="l">Of mermaids shell, &amp; song</div>
               <div class="l">Of choral throng, from some imperial hall</div>
               <div class="l">Wherein the Immortal Powers at festival</div>
               <div class="l">Their high carousals keep.</div>
               <div class="l">But all is silence dread,</div>
               <div class="l">Silence profound &amp; dead</div>
               <div class="l">The everlasting stillness of the deep.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Thro many a solitary street</div>
               <div class="l">And silent market-place &amp; lonely square,</div>
               <div class="l">Armd with the mighty curse, behold him fare.</div>
               <div class="l">And now his feet attain the imperial fane</div>
               <div class="l">Where Bali held of old his aweful reign</div>
               <div class="l">What once had been the Garden spread around,</div>
               <div class="l">Fair Gardens, once which wore perpetual green</div>
               <div class="l">Where all sweet flowers thro all the year were found</div>
               <div class="l">And all fair fruits were thro all seasons seen</div>
               <div class="l">A place of Paradise where each device</div>
               <div class="l">Of emulous Art with Nature sought to vie,</div>
               <div class="l">And Nature on her part</div>
               <div class="l">Displayd new powers wherewith to vanquish Art</div>
               <div class="l">The Swerga-God himself with envious eye</div>
               <div class="l">Surveyd those peerless Gardens in their prime</div>
               <div class="l">Nor ever did the Lord of Light</div>
               <div class="l">Who circles Earth &amp; Heaven upon his way</div>
               <div class="l">Behold from eldest time a goodlier sight</div>
               <div class="l">Than where the groves which Bali in his might</div>
               <div class="l">Made for his chosen palace of solace &amp; delight</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">It was a Garden still beyond all price</div>
               <div class="l">Even yet it was a place of Paradise</div>
               <div class="l">For where the mighty Ocean could not spare</div>
               <div class="l">There had he with his own creation</div>
               <div class="l">Sought to repair his work of devastation</div>
               <div class="l">And here were coral bowers</div>
               <div class="l">And grots of madrepores,</div>
               <div class="l">And beds of sponge as soft &amp; fair</div>
               <div class="l">As moss which erst grew there.</div>
               <div class="l">And here were living flowers</div>
               <div class="l">Which like a bud compacted</div>
               <div class="l">Their purple cups contracted</div>
               <div class="l">And now in open blossom spread.</div>
               <div class="l">Stretched like green anthers many a seeking head</div>
               <div class="l">And arborets of jointed stone were there,</div>
               <div class="l">And plants of fibres fine as silkworms thread</div>
               <div class="l">Yea beautiful as mermaids golden hair</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the waves dispread;</div>
               <div class="l">Others that like the broad banana growing</div>
               <div class="l">Raisd their long wrinkled leaves of purple hue</div>
               <div class="l">Like streamers wide out-flowing.</div>
               <div class="l">And whatsoeer the depths of Ocean hide</div>
               <div class="l">From human eyes, Ladurlad there espied,</div>
               <div class="l">Trees of the deep, &amp; shrubs &amp; fruits, &amp; flowers</div>
               <div class="l">As fair as ours</div>
               <div class="l">Wherewith the Sea-Nymphs love their locks to braid,</div>
               <div class="l">When to their Fathers hall at festival</div>
               <div class="l">Repairing, they in emulous array</div>
               <div class="l">Their charms display</div>
               <div class="l">To grace the banquet &amp; the solemn day.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">The golden fountains had not ceasd to flow,</div>
               <div class="l">And where they mingled with the briny sea,</div>
               <div class="l">There was a sight of wonder &amp; delight</div>
               <div class="l">To see the fish, like birds in air</div>
               <div class="l">Above Ladurlad flying.</div>
               <div class="l">Round those strange waters they repair;</div>
               <div class="l">Their scarlet fins outspread &amp; flying</div>
               <div class="l">They float with gentle motion there;</div>
               <div class="l">And now upon those little wings,</div>
               <div class="l">As if to dare forbidden things</div>
               <div class="l">With <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> wilful purpose bent,</div>
               <div class="l">Swift as an arrow from a bow</div>
               <div class="l">They dart across, &amp; to &amp; fro</div>
               <div class="l">In rapid glance like lightning go</div>
               <div class="l">Thro that unwonted element.</div>
               <div class="l">Almost at scenes so wonderous fair</div>
               <div class="l">Ladurlad had forgot</div>
               <div class="l">The mighty cause which led him there;</div>
               <div class="l">His busy eye was every where,</div>
               <div class="l">His mind had lost all thought,</div>
               <div class="l">His heart surrendered to the joys</div>
               <div class="l">Of sight was happy as a boys.</div>
               <div class="l">But soon the awakening thought recurs</div>
               <div class="l">Of him who in the sepulchres</div>
               <div class="l">Hopeless of human aid in chains is laid,</div>
               <div class="l">And her who on the shore</div>
               <div class="l">By night &amp; day her weary watch will keep</div>
               <div class="l">Till she shall see them issue from the deep.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Now hath Ladurlad reached the Court</div>
               <div class="l">Of the Great Palace of the King; its floor</div>
               <div class="l">Was of the solid rock, &amp; there before</div>
               <div class="l">The imperial door</div>
               <div class="l">A mighty Image on the steps was laid,</div>
               <div class="l">Of stature huge, of countenance serene;</div>
               <div class="l">A crown &amp; sceptre at his feet were laid;</div>
               <div class="l">One hand a scroll displayd,</div>

               <div class="l">Descending steps which in the living stone</div>
               <div class="l">Were hewn, a spacious way</div>

               <div class="l">But where the slant reflection ended</div>
               <div class="l">Another light was seen</div>
               <div class="l">Of red &amp; fiery hue,</div>
               <div class="l">That with the water blended</div>

               <div class="l">From whence across the scene of endless night</div>
               <div class="l">A carbuncle diffused its everlasting light</div>

               because he said booksellers repaid themselves by selling off shares of the copy-right,
               – more persons were thus interested in the success of the book, &amp; consequently greater
               efforts were made to sell it. This may be true, but it is a truth which is not applicable
               to my case, for it is utterly impossible that the Poem should become popular now,
               – the copy right therefore is worth little or nothing at present, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">my</span> yet if it be as good as I believe it to be, there will come a time when it has its
               reward. The better way I think will be to print it in a pocket volume, &amp; let it take
               its chance. 200 pages will hold the poem &amp; about 150 more the notes.</p>
