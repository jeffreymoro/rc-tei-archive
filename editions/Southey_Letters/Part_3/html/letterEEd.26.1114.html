               in the second volume of <em>Poems</em> (1799) – printed at the end of the poem. Pieces brought into the 1806 edition of
               <em>Poems</em> to make up for the removal of the ‘Vision’ were, ‘Translation of a Greek Ode on Astronomy,
               written for the prize at Cambridge, 1793’ (pp. 3–9); ‘The Retrospect’ (pp. 13–22);
               ‘To Hymen’ (pp. 25–39); ‘Remembrance’ (pp. 40–43); ‘To Recovery’ (pp. 49–51); ‘Youth
               and Age’ (pp. 52–53); ‘The Traveller’s Return’ (pp. 54–55); ‘Autumn’ (pp. 56–58);
               ‘The Destruction of Jerusalem’ (pp. 59–62); ‘The Spanish Armada’ (pp. 63–66); ‘St

               (more familiarly known as ‘The Old Woman of Berkeley’) was published in <em>Poems</em>, 2 vols (Bristol, 1799), II, pp. [143]–160. In his letter to Southey of 23 December
               1798, Taylor had revealed that he had also written a poem on the theme of the ‘Old
               Woman of Berkeley’ (J. W. Robberds (ed.), <em>A Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich</em>, 2 vols (London, 1843), I, p. 235). This was written in about 1791, but remained
               unpublished for many years until its appearance in the <em>Iris</em>, the weekly Norwich newspaper edited by Taylor, on 29 October 1803. Taylor declined
               Southey’s offer to publish his poem, and ‘A Tale of Wonder’ was published in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> 34 (1812), 234–236. See David Chandler, ‘Southey’s “German Sublimity” and Coleridge’s
