            <p class="indent1">They tell me the duty upon foreign books is not worth collecting, &amp; that it might
               be repealed if any member thought it worth while to take up the matter. If this be
               the case – I pray you to take into consideration the case of your petitioner. There
               is now a room full of books lying for me at Lisbon. – all of use to me, yet literally
               &amp; truly such the major part, that were they to be sold in England they would not yield
               the expence of the duty. I cannot smuggle them all in to my sorrow, being obliged
               to get over only a box at a time of such smuggleable size that a man can easily carry
               it, &amp; this I cannot do at London where I wish to have them. What <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> has sent over &amp; fairly paid for have cost above 100 £ freight &amp; duty, the freight
               <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> far the smaller part. – Now if this barbarous tax can be repealed, whoever effects
               its repeal certainly deserves to be esteemed a benefactor to literature &amp; it may also
               be taken into the account that you would save me from the sin of smuggling, which
               also assuredly I have not virtue enough to resist. Seriously if the thing could be
               done it would be some pride to me as well as some profit that you should be the man

                  hours day light – enough to show you what my present ideas are upon the subject in
