            <p class="indent1">Is it not a discovery of mine that the old metrical Romances were not a whit more
               marvellous to their auditors than our novels to their readers? for all the miracles
               were supposed to be either naturally or preternaturally possible &amp; such as were occurring.
               I am making, as occasion offers, a catalogue of wonderful wells &amp; lakes, which are
               stated to be in existence in old books of natural history, to prove this, for magical
               fountains are the most common things in romances, next to them come gems – &amp; you know
               what a science was made of their mystical virtues.</p>
