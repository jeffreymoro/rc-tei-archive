                           instigation, appeared an extract from Letters from England, Letter 38, concerning
                           the exploitation of the poor in the new commercial and manufacturing towns. On 17
                           November an extract from Letter 36 criticising Birmingham had been published. An advertisement
                           for the book appeared on 1 December. The references in the Morning Post have not been
