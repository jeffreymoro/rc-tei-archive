                        of The Friend and to write a letter ‘in a lively style’ on the obscurity of the material

                  appear easy of comprehension, he made things which were easy in themselves difficult
                  &lt;to be comprehended&gt; by the manner in which he presented them, evolving their causes

Southey
               is writing in reply to a letter from Coleridge dated 20 October 1809, in which he
               requested him to ‘look over the eight numbers’ of <em>The Friend</em> and to write a letter ‘in a lively style’ on the obscurity of the material within
               them. See Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), III, pp. 259–260 [in part]. The first letter Southey
               wrote in answer to this request is Letter 1702 (dated Thursday 26 [October 1809])
               in which he says he will write on ‘Saturday’, the day Southey gives at the bottom
               of this letter.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
