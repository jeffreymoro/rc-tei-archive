                  a great danger that the illness would bring on premature labour; – that danger however
                  is past. In about six weeks I look to have another child.

                  </div> in opposition to ordinary notions &amp; the purblind prudence of these selfish times I
                  am persuaded that it is still a blessing to have a large family, notwithstanding modern
                  policy contrives to unite an overcrowded state of society with a scanty population.
                  Brothers &amp; sisters help one another thro the world, – &amp; die when I may it will be
                  without any fears for the well doing of those whom I leave behind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your draft was put in circulation. – I believe Kehama would never have been resumed
                  had it <span class="strikethrough">been</span> not been for you.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s poem The Curse of Kehama was published in 1810.</span></div>
                  </div> It had lain untouched for five years &amp; so it probably would have remained. You stung
                  me to the resolution of going on, &amp; I am not sure whether the more pleasure which
                  I have felt in proceeding has not been the anticipation of addressing it to you &amp;
                  saying so. – It is announced thro the customary channel of Magazines as in forwardness.
                  I am going to Edinburgh in May for the purpose of hunting in the Advocates Library
                  for any books which may relate to South America. While thus employed (a week or ten
                  days at the utmost) I shall be <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scotts</a> guest. Kehama will then (God willing) be compleated: &amp; I think Scott will enable me
                  to ascertain in what manner it may most advantageously be published. I sold the first
                  edition of Thalaba to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a> for 115 £. they printed 1000, – that edition is just now exhausted, &amp; a second about
                  to come forth

                  </div> – But this has been a slow sale, – &amp; when seven years ago I offered them another poem
                  on the same terms (meaning to have finished Kehama for the purpose) they demurred
                  &amp; offered only the 100.

                  </div> Just to the amount of defraying all expences my name commands a sale, every thing
                  beyond that depends upon the caprice of a public, who have any better motive than
                  caprice either for their censure or their approbation. Kehama however has cost me
                  no expence of time, – I have fairly won it, as Lincolnshire speculators win estates
                  from the sea;

                  </div> – my daily work has been done just as if no such composition was in my thoughts, without
                  the slightest interruption. If therefore nothing be got by its sale, it has not made
                  me the poorer, – I am so much the happier for having written it, – so much the richer
                  as a Poet, &amp; in fact have received from you half as much as the profits of an edition
                  would be, when shared by a publisher. Its success (I speak solely of its <span class="ital">market</span> success) will only thus far influence me, that a good sale would make me afford more
                  time for other such poems, which I should then publish as fast as they were written,
                  – its still-birth (which I entirely expect) will merely make me write others as this
                  is written, in the early morning hours, which I shall continue to do as long as the
                  unabated power is in me, &amp; leave them behind as post-obits for my children, in perfect
                  confidence that such manuscripts will prove good &amp; secure property hereafter. At Edinburgh
                  I shall feel my way about the publication</p>
