                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have retired to my library to thank
                  you for the most splendid set of books it contains. I thank you for them, Neville,
                  truly and heartily; but do not let it hurt you if I say, that so costly a present
                  gives me some pain as well as pleasure. Were you a rich man, you could not give me
                  more books than I would joyfully accept, for I delight in accumulating such treasures
                  as much as a miser does in keeping together gold; but, as things are at present, no
                  proof was needed of your generous spirit, and, from the little you have to spare,
                  I cannot but feel you are giving me too much. You will not be offended at my expressing
                  this feeling, nor will you impute it to any unjust pride, which, blessed be God, I
                  am too poor a man, and too wise a one, to be guilty of in any, even the smallest degree.
                  Be assured that I shall ever value the books far more than if they had come from a
                  wealthier donor, and that I write the donor’s name in them with true respect and esteem.
                  You will be pleased to hear they are books – of immediate use – to me. Seven years
                  ago I began a long poem which Sir William Jones, had he been living, would have liked
                  to see, because it has the system of Hindoo mythology for its basis.

                  </div> I believe you heard me mention it at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillThomas">Mr. Hill’s</a>. I have been stimulated by the approbation of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">one of the few men living whose approbation could stimulate me</a>, to go on with this poem, and am winning time for it by rising earlier than was my
                  custom, because I will not allow any other part of the day to an employment less important
                  than writing history, and far less profitable than that of writing any thing else,
                  how humble or how worthless soever. In the hours thus fairly won for the purpose I
                  get on steadily and well. Now, though I had long ago gone through those works of Sir
                  William, and made from them such extracts as were necessary for my purpose, it was
                  still very desirable that I should have them at hand. Lord Teignmouth’s Life also
                  is new to me.</p>
