            <p>Address: To/ C W Williams Wynn Esq<sup>r</sup> M. P./ Wynnstay/ Wrexham<br>Stamped: KESWICK/ 298<br>MS: National Library of Wales, MS 4813D<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: Southey says that he received ‘a blank receipt’ to sign for his pension
               from Grosvenor Charles Bedford ‘some three weeks ago’. This was returned in his letter
               to Rickman on 8 August, which suggests this letter probably dates from the end of
               the month.</p>

               <p>I wish instead of falling foul upon the partridges in any other way than that of eating
                  them, you would drive Bedford here, &amp; let him give me earnest &lt;how&gt; of the visit he
                  is to pay next year. My beds are full – for Tom is here, on leave of absence to recover
                  his health – this however is of little matter when the town is so near. You would
                  see me not indeed in all my glory, but still in great glory – all my books from Bristol
                  have arrived,

                  sold the edition – the Longmen object to this, &amp; offer advances instead. They write
                  very civilly – indeed friendlily, – still all this is proof that my books have not
                  the sale which they ought to have. In all probability I shall agree with them to edite
                  Don Quixote – which they talk of printing, somewhat splendidly with prints from Smirke.
