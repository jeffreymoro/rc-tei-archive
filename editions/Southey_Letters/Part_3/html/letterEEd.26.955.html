            <p class="indent1">I begin to feel like myself again. in London the perpetual bustle &amp; stir &amp; walking
               &amp; talking, had almost worn me out – &amp; in addition I had a cruel cold which affected
               head &amp; chest, eyes &amp; nose. here I am at last thank God, safe &amp; sound, &amp; refreshed,
               tho I still think that it would be but right &amp; proper to take out in afternoon naps
               the ninety nine hours of sleep lost upon the journey, &amp; by late hours in town.</p>

                           the thirteenth centuries, collected in fourteenth-century Welsh manuscripts and known
                           as the Mabinogi. Some of these were published in the journal edited by William Owen
                           Pughe, The Cambrian Register (1796, 1799), where they are entitled The Mabinogion,
                           or Juvenile Amusements, being Ancient Welsh Romances.</span></div>
                  </div><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">Owen</a> has translated them admirably, in so Welsh a syntax &amp; idiom that they convey the full
                  manner of the original. The tales themselves resemble the Arabian Nights in the character
                  of their fictions most remarkably. It is perfectly unaccountable to me whence this
                  resemblance can have originated. If the others be at all equal to these – which there
                  should seem no reason to doubt, you Celts will be able to produce a specimen of far
                  greater genius than we Goths have been willing to give you credit for. Yet it is idle
                  in an Englishman to call him self Goth – we are a mongrel breed, &amp; all the better
                  for the various crosses. I suspect that all dark hair, dark eyes &amp; dark complections
                  indicate a southern origin – that is in general a Roman one. for the Cimbric race
