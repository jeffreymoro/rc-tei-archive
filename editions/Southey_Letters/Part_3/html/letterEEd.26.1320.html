                  prime, and had no other wish than to live in solitude, and amuse himself with poetry
                  and music. He lodged in a farm-house near Chudleigh, and would oftentimes come to
                  Exeter in a winter morning, ungloved and open-breasted, before Jackson was up, (though
                  he was an early riser,) with a pocket full of music or poems, to know how he liked
                  them. His relations thought this was a sad life for a man of family, and forced him
                  to London. The tears ran down Jackson’s cheeks when he told me the story. ‘Poor fellow,’
                  said he, ‘there did not live a purer creature, and, if they would have let him alone,
                  he might have been alive now.’</p>

                  she believed, but she did not know the number of the house.’ Away went Jackson, and
                  knocked at every door till he found the right. It was a truly miserable place: the
                  woman of the house was one of the worst class of women in London. She knew that Bampfylde
                  had no money, and that at that time he had been three days without food. When Jackson
                  saw him, there was all the levity of madness in his manners; his shirt was ragged,
                  and black as a coal-heaver’s, and his beard of a two months’ growth. Jackson sent
                  out for food, and said he was come to breakfast with him; and he turned aside to a
                  harpsichord in the room, literally, he said, to let him gorge himself without being
                  noticed. He removed him from hence, and, after giving his mother a severe lecture,
                  obtained for him a decent allowance, and left him, when he himself quitted town, in
                  decent lodgings, earnestly begging him to write.</p>

                  with Original Disquisitions, Articles of Biography, and other Literary Antiquities</em>, 10 vols (1805–1809), IV, p. 95. Brydges also wrote an article on the poet John Codrington
               Warwick Bampfylde (1754–1796; <em>DNB</em>) after Southey published three of Bampfylde’s sonnets and his ode ‘To the River Teign’
               in <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em>, 3 vols (London, 1807), III, pp. 434–437. The article, including two of Bampfylde’s
               poems, appeared in <em>Censura Literaria</em>, IV, pp. 301–303 A subsequent article discusses William Jackson (1730–1803; <em>DNB</em>), musician, painter, and author, whose relationship with Bampfylde is recounted in
               this letter. See <em>Censura Literaria</em>, IV, pp. 303–307. These articles are presumably what prompted Southey to write to
               Brydges concerning Bampfylde, including material that he had recounted to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> previously; see <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.
