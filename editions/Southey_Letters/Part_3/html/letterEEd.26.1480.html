            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> was sorely disappointed in not finding you at Bristol when he fled thro on his way
               to Plymouth. I supposed you were gone to London on no pleasant business. – &amp; the Gazette
               has since shown me that my fears were right. – You ask me where <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> is, that you may write to him &amp; remind him of his debt: – I have heard nothing from
               him since he left this house, nor <span class="ital">of</span> him except what came from you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">In the course of the last ten weeks I have met with some unpleasant interruptions
               in my ordinary business – first from a bilious fever which attacked <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">little Edith</a>; afterwards seized on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a>, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">made him</span> alarmed us a good deal for many days. And now for the last month I have been plagued
               with one of my abominable catarrhs, – such as you saw me with when you were here.
               Tomorrow it will be a month old, &amp; after a dozen variations from worse to better &amp;
               better to worse, it is now as bad as ever it was. I generally calculate upon a six
               weeks spell when it begins, &amp; in this instance am not likely to be disappointed. It
               is a comfort that the complaint is altogether confined to the head, &amp; not accompanied
               with any general indisposition, but it has affected my eyes, &amp; made me lose many days
               work. –</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I told you I should proceed with Kehama,

                  of view, as is very likely, there might be no loss of time, the time being fairly
                  won from sleep.

                  </div> These hindrances have sadly kept me back, still however good progress has been made.
                  When I returned home 910 lines were the sum of total of what was written, &amp; it now
                  amounts to 1560. I am in the vein, &amp; as soon as this troublesome cold will allow me
                  time for any thing besides sneezing &amp; flourishing my own trumpet, my progress will
                  in all probability be a rapid one – All my old dreams of poetry are rising, as it
                  were, from the dead. I am planning a blank-verse poem upon Pelayo, the Restorer of
                  Spain,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Pelagius/Pelayo (c. 685–737), founder of the Kingdom of Asturias. Through his victory
                           at the Battle of Covadonga, he is credited with beginning the Christian reconquest
                           of the Iberian peninsula from the Moors. The planned poem became Roderick, Last of
                           the Goths (1814).</span></div>
                  </div> – an old subject taken up with new interest just at this time. As soon as the plan
                  is perfected I shall begin to write it, in those intervals when Kehama is at a stand,
                  – for <span class="strikethrough">such</span> intervals <span class="strikethrough">must</span> &lt;there&gt; occasionally <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;will be&gt;, when tho the whole story is made, the immediate manner of passing from
                  one part to another does not occur; – &amp; therefore time <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> &lt;is&gt; saved by having two upon the stocks at <span class="strikethrough">x</span> once. My plan of operations will be a very simple, &amp; as it appears to me, by no means
                  an imprudent one. If Kehama does not pay me the fair trade price of the time bestowed
                  upon it, I publish no more poetry; – there is not much doubt but that this will be
                  the case; &amp; if it be so, it then becomes me to think something of posthumous profit,
                  as well as posthumous fame, &amp; to secure copy rights to my children, after my death; <span class="strikethrough">when</span> for our wise laws of Literary Property would throw them open just when they became
                  valuable. So I will write on strenuously, &amp; go thro the whole series which was projected
                  so many years ago; &amp; as many more, if I have life &amp; health for it: dedicating to this
                  sole employment the hours gained by rising at a reasonable hour, – not a very early
                  one, because that would be hurtful – but as soon as after six may be. And these poems
                  shall be left behind me, they will then fetch their value, as good drafts upon posterity.
                  This scheme pleases me a good deal. There will be a great pleasure &amp; satisfaction
                  in accumulating property in this form; &amp; if it prove a vain &amp; fallacious one, I shall
                  not have the mortification of seeing it so. But this is not likely. Poets like woodcocks
                  are not ranked till they are dead, &amp; then their very trail is food for the most fastidious
                  palate.</p>

               <p>This is a grand struggle which the Spaniards have begun. It is to be expected that
                  they will meet with many disasters, – they will often be defeated, often betrayed,
                  – they will commit some excesses &amp; some errors, but of their eventual success I do
                  not entertain a doubt. The principle of Patriotism which is in them, – the remembrance
                  of what their fathers have been, &amp; the thought of what their children are to be, will
                  bear them thro. You will see in this volume of the Annual what were my <span class="strikethrough">tho</span> opinions concerning Spain twelve months ago, – in the reviewal of Semples Travels.
