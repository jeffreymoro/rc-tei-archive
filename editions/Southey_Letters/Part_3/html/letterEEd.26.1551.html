                  </div> to be sent to you, relying upon me to write to you on the subject. He manages things
                  badly – a letter from me on the blank side of one prospectus would have done without
                  packing off to you a bundle of papers too stiff for any ordinary purpose, – &amp; a few
                  advertisements in newspapers &amp; magazines would have done better than any prospectus
                  at all. – The thing however is done, &amp; that with so little deliberation, tho not till
                  after much delay, – that some of it requires undoing: for should he have many subscribers
                  in the country there will be no mode of regular delivery other than by post, – in
                  that case the numbers must be stamped, &amp; stamps cover only a single sheet. Smaller
                  type &amp; Larger paper will bring it to the same quantity of contents, &amp; the same market
                  value.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Will he go on with this undertaking, – will be your first question. He can do it with
               little more trouble than that of arranging &amp; putting together fragments already in
               existence, &amp; yet I will own <span class="ital">to you</span> that I have great doubts &amp; misgivings. – I do not like the Prospectus. It is too
               much like what it pretends to be, too fit for a letter, to be proper for the public.
               There is an injudicious adulation, as it may almost be called, of his friends, &amp; an
               overdone <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span>abasement of himself, – on the whole a want of manliness which I cannot away with.
               But assuredly if he carries it into effect great things will be done; – sounder criticism
               &amp; sounder philosophy established as well as addressed, than modern ages have seen;
               great truths upholden, &amp; the axe laid at the root of those great errors which have
               been for the last century held <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxx</span>to be the very name &amp; thirty articles of philosophical faith.</p>

                  of words, as well as to hunt out their primary meaning. I am almost pleased that you
                  persevere so steadily in this collection, which will form a very valuable book in
                  itself, &amp; be of signal utility to the compilers of a national dictionary, whenever

                  The Moravian Missionaries make no difficulty about the matter, – they let a convert
