                  </div> would make me think it was yours, but the whole paper leads me to a different conclusion.
                  Can you tell me which are <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Goochs</a> articles? The journal is very well done, but there is a twang of Edinburgh insolence
                  about it, which will make enemies, which can do no good, &amp; of which the writers when
                  they are a little older will be sorry &amp; ashamed. Severity may often be right, insolence
                  is always wrong. Generous minds &amp; tempers, Domine, are mellowed like wine as they
                  grow older, – You may repent a sarcasm, – you never can repent having forborne one.
                  I like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoochDrRobert">Gooch</a> so much, &amp; was so thoroughly pleased with all I saw of him, that this character which
                  he has given to his review surprizes me. It is not his nature, &amp; why in Gods name
