                  a chicken &amp; no more beauty than a young dodo. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> went to sleep at four after dinner. rose uneasy at half after five. retired to her
                  room at half after eight, &amp; before ten she &amp; her child were two. They are doing well
                  thank God. but the young one is very very ugly. so ugly that if I did not remember
                  tales of my own deformity, how both <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">mother</a> &amp; grandmother cried out against me – notwithstanding my present pulchritude, – I should

                  months I may begin to like her. &amp; by &amp; by I suppose shall love her – but it shall
                  be with a reasonable love that will hang loosely upon me – like all second loves.
