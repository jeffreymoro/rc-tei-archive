         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">11.. </span><span class="noteBody">In December 1804, the naval ship HMS <span class="ital">Amelia</span>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig <span class="ital">Isabella</span> and the ship <span class="ital">Conception</span>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <span class="ital">Commerce</span>, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of
               the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize
               money was withheld because the ships were captured before war was officially declared.
               Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated. It was presumably
               Southey’s influence that caused <em>The Courier</em> to publish a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday
               24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
