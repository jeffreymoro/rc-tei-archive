               <div class="l">Hast thou not heard the history </div>
               <div class="l">How to the throne that he might rise,</div>

               <div class="l">How often he met thee &amp; put thee to flight,</div>
               <div class="l">And plundered thy country for many a day,</div>
               <div class="l">And how many Moors he has slain in the strife,</div>
               <div class="l">And how many more carried captive away?</div>
               <div class="l">How he came to show friendship, – &amp; thou didst believe him?</div>
               <div class="l">How he ravished thy sister – &amp; wouldst thou forgive him?</div>
               <div class="l">And hast thou forgotten that I am his Wife,</div>
               <div class="l">And that now by thy side I lie like a bride,</div>
               <div class="l">The worst shame that can ever a Xtian betide?</div>
               <div class="l">And cruel it were, when you see his despair,</div>
               <div class="l">To refuse him the boon he comes hither to crave,</div>
               <div class="l">For no other way his poor soul can he save,</div>
               <div class="l">Than by doing the penance his Confessor gave</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">As Queen Aldonza thus replies,</div>
               <div class="l">The Moor upon her fixed his eyes.</div>
               <div class="l">And he said in his heart, unhappy is he</div>
               <div class="l">Who putteth his trust in a woman.</div>
               <div class="l">Thou art King Ramiros wedded wife</div>
               <div class="l">And thus thou wouldst take away his life!</div>
               <div class="l">What cause have I to confide in thee?</div>
               <div class="l">I will put this woman away from me.</div>
               <div class="l">These were the thoughts that past in his breast,</div>
               <div class="l">But he calld to mind Ramiros might,</div>
               <div class="l">And he feard to meet him hereafter in fight,</div>
               <div class="l">And he granted the Kings request.</div>
               <div class="l">So he gave him a roasted capon first,</div>

               <div class="l">Oh then his horn Ramiro wound, – </div>
               <div class="l">The walls rebound the pealing sound</div>
               <div class="l">That far &amp; wide rings echoing round.</div>
               <div class="l">Louder &amp; louder Ramiro blows,</div>
               <div class="l">Farther &amp; farther the blast it goes,</div>
               <div class="l">It reaches the gallies where they lie close </div>
               <div class="l">Under the Alders by S<sup>t</sup> Joam de Foz,</div>
               <div class="l">It rousd his Knights from their repose,</div>

               <div class="l">They burst at once the city gate,</div>

               <div class="l">Then his good sword Ramiro drew,</div>
               <div class="l">Upon the Moorish King he flew,</div>
               <div class="l">And he gave him one blow, for there needed not two,</div>
               <div class="l">They killd his sons &amp; his daughters too,</div>
               <div class="l">Every Moorish soul they slew,</div>

               <div class="l">Neither old, nor young, nor babe, nor mother,</div>

               <div class="l">They carried the wicked Queen abroad</div>
