               <p>. . . . It will be well to print the Melancholy Hours, and some other of the prose
                  compositions. They mark the character, as well as the powers, of your brother’s mind,
                  and should, therefore, be preserved.

                           Kirke White, whose work he had brought to public notice, a posthumous edition. This
                           was published as Remains of Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham, 2 vols (London, 1807).

                  </div> The No. 10. which you mention is, I believe, that criticism upon Thalaba the Destroyer,
                  of which I spoke in a former letter.

                           White’s comments on Thalaba formed part of his article ‘Melancholy Hours, V’, in The
                           Monthly Mirror, 16 (1803), 20–24.</span></div>
                  </div> I may be permitted to expunge from it, or to soften, a few epithets, of which it gratifies
                  me that your brother should have thought me worthy, but which it is not decent that
                  I should edit myself. . . . Believe me, sir, if I were not now proving the high respect
                  which I feel for your brother, it would give me pain to think what value he assigned
                  to the mere expression of it. How deeply I regret that the little intercourse we ever
                  had should have ended where it did, it is needless now to say. I should have begged
                  him to have visited me here, but for this reason: when he told me he was going to
                  Cambridge, there were some circumstances which made me believe he was under the patronage
                  of Mr. Henry Thornton,

                           White, and chairman of the Sierra Leone company, in which capacity he clashed with,
                           and in 1793 dismissed as colonial governor, Thomas Clarkson’s brother John (1764–1828;
                           DNB).</span></div>
                  </div> or of some other persons of similar views; that his opinions had taken what is called
                  an evangelical turn, and that he was designed for that particular ministry. My own
                  religious opinions are not less zealous and not less sincere, but they are totally
                  opposite. I would not run the risk of disturbing his sentiments, and therefore delayed
                  forming that personal friendship with him, to which I looked on with pleasure, till
                  his mind should have outgrown opinions through which it was well that it should pass.</p>

               <p>In reading and re-reading the poems, I have filled up a few of the gaps with conjectural
                  words of correction, which shall be printed in italics, and to which, therefore, there
                  can be no objection. The more I read them, the more is my admiration; they are as
                  it should be – of very various merit, and show the whole progress of his mind. Many
                  of them are excellently good – so good that it is impossible they could be better,
                  and all together certainly exceed the productions of any other young poet whatsoever.

                  (in which they would probably be inserted, or after it) will run; but as soon as this
                  is ascertained, the volumes may be divided and the second go to press. Will you have

               laboured, and that heavenly immortality of which he was worthy. I say this with tears,
               but they are tears of admiration as well as of human regret. If you knew me, sir,
               and how little prone I am to let such feelings as these appear upon the surface, you
               would understand these words in their literal sense, and in their full meaning.</p>
