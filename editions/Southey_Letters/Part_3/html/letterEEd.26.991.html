            <p class="indent1">Your prize question seems oddly worded for in the common acceptation of civilization
               Hindostan is a highly civilized country. Who proposes the question? &amp; to whom is it
               proposed? if to men of only your standing, it will be your own fault if you do not
               win it. – Send me the official language of the question – the more I think of it the
               less intelligible does it appear. if it means how are the Hindoos to be brought to
               the standard of European civilization, that is, how are they to be converted, I can
               furnish you with some valuable facts on such a subject, &amp; shall probably in the necessary
               course of my reading meet with more. The Hindoos can never advance till the system
               of Casts be destroyed, &amp; that system can only be destroyed by introducing a new religion
               – in other words by converting them. You should first describe the system &amp; its consequences,
               then show that the common opinion of the unconvertability of this people is ill founded,
               because they have heretofore been converted in great numbers, &amp; lastly enquire what
               is the best method of attempting it. the more of anecdote you can introduce the better,
               &amp; I can supply some of exceeding importance which it is not likely any of your competition

                           (formerly the British sloop of war Lilly) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of
                           the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that
