               tell you that he is married, tho he says in all probability you will have heard it
               before. You will I suppose be not a little surprized that he should have got the start
               of you. If he has chosen well, (for which he may be trusted) he has done wisely: he
               had been too much accustomed to society to pass the remainder of his days alone in
               a country parsonage.</p>

                  hold in especial good liking, both for his poetry &amp; his politicks.

               As for thinking of this new relation as an Aunt, that is out of the question, it seems
               more like the marriage of an elder brother than an Uncle – &amp; the cousins, if any there
               should be, will seem like nephews &amp; nieces – for cousinship implies contemporaneousness,
               &amp; this loss of a whole generation will spoil all chronology of connection. – Well
               Sir, I shall be heartily glad when you have followed his example, but tho I look carefully
               at the <span class="strikethrough">newsp</span> deaths in the newspapers, &amp; the obituary in the Magazines, I do not perceive any
