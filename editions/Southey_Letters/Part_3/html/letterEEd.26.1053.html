         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">8.. </span><span class="noteBody">The third edition of <em>Joan of Arc</em> was published in 1806. The ‘Vision of the Maid of Orleans’, originally published
               in the second volume of <em>Poems</em> (1799) was printed at the end of the poem. In the new 1806 edition of the second
               volume of <em>Poems</em> (1799), Southey included two poems first published in Southey’s and Robert Lovell’s
               joint collection of <em>Poems</em> (1795), ‘The Retrospect’ and ‘To Hymen’. Other poems brought into the 1806 edition
               of <em>Poems</em> to make up for the removal of the ‘Vision’ were, ‘Translation of a Greek Ode on Astronomy,
               written for the prize at Cambridge, 1793’ (pp. 3–9); ‘To Hymen’ (pp. 25–39); ‘Remembrance’
               (pp. 40–43); ‘To Recovery’ (pp. 49–51); ‘Youth and Age’ (pp. 52–53); ‘The Traveller’s
               Return’ (pp. 54–55); ‘Autumn’ (pp. 56–58); ‘The Destruction of Jerusalem’ (pp. 59–62);
               ‘The Spanish Armada’ (pp. 63–66); ‘St Bartholomew’s Day’ (pp. 67–69); ‘To a Bee’ (pp.
               74–75); ‘Metrical Letter’, pp. 76–79.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
