               <p>I had begun to write in enquiry what was become of you, when your letter arrived,
                  nearly three weeks after its date: − mine probably would have been finished &amp; dispatched
                  before that time, −− had it not been for a growing uneasiness respecting the Dutchess
                  of Gordon,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           a voyage to Ceylon and Bengal, having been last sighted off the coast of Mauritius
                           in March 1809. Betham’s brother Edward (dates unknown) was among the drowned.</span></div>
                  </div> − which made me put it off from day to day, in daily hope that the next paper might
                  enable me to congratulate you upon good news. There is this good &amp; substantial ground
                  of hope that so many ships are missing: their number rendering it less likely that
                  they should be lost, &amp; more likely that they should be captured. This I think is to
                  be expected, − &amp; the evil in this case will have some mitigation, because prisoners
                  taken in the E or W Indies are exchanged.</p>

            <p class="indent1">We missed you when you left us. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> has not yet <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> ceased to ask where is Miss Betham gone? &amp; why did she go? − to which he adds frequent
               enquiries concerning his boy – what is to be done to him, &amp; when he is to be put.
               We were dreadfully alarmed about him on Thursday last – When <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">his mother</a> went up as usual, the last thing at night, to look at him. – she heard the croup
               sound in his throat. − &amp; you may conceive the agitation into which it threw us. But
               it seems that the disease wears itself out when it does not prove fatal at first,
               &amp; it appears to be got under, God be praised, without the necessity of <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> recurring to those remedies which so greatly tormented &amp; reduced him before. Poor
               fellow, − I have so deep &amp; ever-present a sense of the precariousness of an infants
               life, − that had you talked of taking his picture before me, I believe I should have
               tried to invent some excuse <span class="strikethrough">for</span> why it should not be done, − when the real reason would have been – a secret dread
               lest it should ever become to me an object of pain. He will not be persuaded that
               his father loves him too much, − but his father is very well convinced of it himself.</p>

                  go because they are unwell, &amp; a great many because they are idle: &amp; there she is at

               for you. It was very much my wish that you would have planned a poem here, when I
               might have scrutinized its defects with the severest sincerity; − five minutes may
               alter that in a plan, which when executed becomes unalterable, − I did not press this
               upon you − as I would have done at any other time, because I was aware that then you
               were more uneasy respecting your brother than you expressed yourself to be, − &amp; this
