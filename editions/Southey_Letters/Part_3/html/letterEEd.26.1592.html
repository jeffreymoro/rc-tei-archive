                  </div> because I am desirous of such approbation; and it will gratify me if it should be
                  generally approved, because I wrote from a deep and strong conviction of the importance
                  of the subject. With respect to any alterations in this or any future communication,
                  I am perfectly sensible that absolute authority must always be vested in the editor.
                  The printer has done some mischief by misplacing a paragraph in p. 225., which ought
                  to have followed the quotation in the preceding page. The beginning of the last paragraph
                  is made unintelligible by this dislocation; and indeed you have omitted the sarcasm,
                  which it was designed to justify. I could have wished that this Review had less resembled

                  I think I could have told her so in such a spirit, that she herself would have believed
                  me, and might have profited by the censure. The same quantity of rain which would
                  clear a flower of its blights, will, if it falls heavier and harder, wash the roots
                  bare, and beat the blossoms to the ground. I have been in the habit of reviewing more
                  than eleven years, for the lucre of gain, and not, God knows, from any liking to the
                  occupation; and of all my literary misdeeds, the only ones of which I have repented
                  have been those reviewals which were written with undue asperity, so as to give unnecessary
                  pain. I propose to continue the subject of the Missions through two other articles,
                  neither of which will probably be half so long as the first; one respecting the South
                  Sea Islands, the other South Africa.
