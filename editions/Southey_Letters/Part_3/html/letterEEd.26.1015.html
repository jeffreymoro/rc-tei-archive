            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The main reason of so long a silence on my part has been that having some tidings
                  of my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> to communicate, &amp; being daily in expectation of a letter from him – I waited in hope
                  of receiving it. – The boats of the Galatea attempted to cut out a sloop called the
                  Lilly from Guadaloupe, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> the attempt proved very disastrous, &amp; so has never been gazetted. We heard this from
                  London – in consequence I made enquiry by a friend at the Admiralty who saw a private
                  letter from one who had been in the action &amp; fairly inferred that as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</a> name was not mentioned in it, he was safe. Shortly after, a paragraph appeared in
                  our Whitehaven paper
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> stating the death of the Master of the Galatea who was a native of that town. he was
                  killed in this affair – &amp; the paragraph <span class="strikethrough">stated</span> &lt;added&gt; that the First Lieutenant fell also. I read this myself – &amp; you may guess
                  how it went thro me like an electric shock however it is never my custom to accredit
                  things lightly. it was mentioned that the Surgeon was killed – I argued that neither
                  Surgeon nor Master could be in the boats – consequently the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> paragraph was erroneous in part &amp; possibly in the whole – so I wrote again to London
                  – tho I confess persuaded in my heart that my brother had fallen, knowing that he
                  would be foremost in any attempt which required exertion &amp; could lead to promotion.
                  the answer was that a Lieutenant was slain – but of a different name – for the official
                  account had arrived. In a few days came a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> to tell me that he had been brought to a Court Martial for disobedience of orders,
                  neglect of duty &amp; contempt of his Captain.

                  I must contradict you. Mark the providence – I do not use the word superstitiously
                  – but such things induce an aweful sort of feeling – being thus under arrest he could
                  not go in the boats, &amp; the Lieutenant who went in his stead fell.

                           65 were killed or wounded. Southey suspected that his brother was among the dead.

         <div class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">11.. </span><span class="noteBody">Sir William Jones (1746–1794; <em>DNB</em>), the Orientalist scholar whose <em>Institutes of Hindu Law, or, The Ordinances of Menu</em> appeared in 1794. In his 1771 <em>Lettre à Monsieur A*** du P***</em>, Jones criticised Abraham-Hyacinthe Anquetil Du Perron (1731–1805), the French Orientalist
               who in 1771 translated the <em>Avesta</em> from Persian into French and thus introduced Zoroastrianism to Europe. ‘Stung to
               patriotic anger by the Frenchman’s criticisms of Oxford scholarship’ (<em>DNB</em>), Jones suggested Du Perron had been fooled with forgeries by the Parsi priests on
               whom he had relied for his Persian texts. In Bengal, Jones collaborated with Sir Charles
               Wilkins (1749–1836; <em>DNB</em>); together the two men helped establish the Asiatick Society of Bengal in 1784. Wilkins
               translated the <em>Bhagvat-geeta, or Dialogues of Kreeshna and Arjoon</em> (1785). Southey’s remark about Jones’s competitiveness with Wilkins, scarcely warranted,
               was probably based on Jones’s ‘Preface’ to his translation of <em>Sacontalá</em>: ‘I think it proper to say, that I have already translated four or five other books,
               and among them the Hitópadésa, which I undertook merely as an exercise in learning
               Sanscrit, three years before I knew that Mr. Wilkins, without whose aid I should never
               have learned it [Sanskrit], had any thought of giving the same work to the publick’
