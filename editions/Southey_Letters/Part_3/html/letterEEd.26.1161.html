               <p>The intelligence in your letter has given me more pleasure than I have often felt.
                  In spite of modern metaphysico-politico-Philosophicide I do not believe that God Almighty’s
                  first commandment is an obsolete statute yet

                  </div> May God bless you in both relationships.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I shall be in London about the time when you are leaving it, &amp; remain there a just
                  month – so that you will probably be there the latter end of the time. It is long
                  since we have met, &amp; now that I certainly am going abroad again in the autumn, &amp; have
                  some reason for hoping I may stay there,

                           position there. These plans did not materialise and Southey’s history was never completed.</span></div>
                  </div> I should be sorry to lose one of those opportunities of which life does not allow
                  very many. It will be nearly two years since you were here, &amp; if our after meetings
                  are to be at at long intervals – there are not many to look on to. Many things make
                  me feel old, – ten years of marriage – the sort of fatherly situation in which I have
                  stood towards my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> now a man himself – the premature age at which I commenced author – the death of all
                  who were about me in childhood – a body not made of lasting materials – &amp; some wear
                  &amp; tear of mind. You once remarked to me how time strengthened family affections &amp;
                  indeed all early ones – One’s feelings seem to be weary of travelling, &amp; like to rest
                  at home. I had a proof the other night in my sleep how the mere lapse of time changes
                  one’s disposition – I thought of all men in the world Forester called upon me, &amp; that
                  we were heartily glad to see each other.

                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>William Forester (d. 1794), a fellow pupil of Southey’s at Westminster School (admitted
                           1782). He later entered the army, dying of yellow fever during the St Domingo expedition
                           of 1794. Southey did not like Forester, accusing him of bullying and of forcing him
                           to write Latin verses on his behalf.</span></div>
                  </div> They who tell us that men grow hard hearted as they grow older have but a very limited
                  view of this world of ours. It is true with those whose views &amp; hopes are merely &amp;
                  vulgarly worldly. But where human nature is not perverted time strengthens our kindly
                  feelings &amp; abates our angry ones.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">After this next meeting God knows when we shall see each other again, for I shall
               certainly go in the Autumn. However reasonable my expectations may be they ought not
               to influence my plans, nor ought I to wait &amp; wait for a better opportunity of doing
               that – in doing which no opportunity &amp; no time should be lost. So Fortune may find
               me at Lisbon, if she please to favour me – but I will not delay my voyage in the hope
               of her company. There is however a cloud hanging over Lisbon. If any attempt is made
               against Gibraltar that port must previously be shut against us, &amp; if there be not
               Bonaparte may chuse to do it just to show his power. The terrible means of resentment
               in our power might deter a cooler man, but cannot be calculated upon as preventatives
               in this case. We might take Brazil, &amp; famish Lisbon: – he would not care so he could
               say that the English should drink no more port wine till they chose to ask his leave.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Where is your house? When marriage does not estrange a man from his friends it introduces
               an order into his abode &amp; a certain set of arrangements <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> of which the benefit extends to them. You have a way of having your breakfast in
               a tray, which is something more than uncomfortable; it is even anti-comfortable. I
               look upon it as one of the good effects of this change of administration that that
               tray will be discarded.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>God bless you. I believe I might venture to whisper some family news in your ear,
                  but one does not like to be disappointed in these things – &amp; my hopes may be premature.
