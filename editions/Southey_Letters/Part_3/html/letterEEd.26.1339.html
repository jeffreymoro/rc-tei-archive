            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You have done quite right in keeping back the bedstead &amp; I dare say in every thing
               else. The MS.S. I hope have been found &amp; sent in the box by the waggon; they are of
               very great value, &amp; if lost would be irreplaceable.</p>

                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>James Rickards (dates unknown) visited the Lakes at the same time as Danvers in summer
                           1809.</span></div>
                  </div> I should think may hire any thing he wants at Lancaster, which is, as you know, a
                  considerable town. He should come from thence over the sands to Ulverstone, – up Coniston
                  Lake, &amp; from thence strike down to the ferry at Windermere. then from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a> here, &amp; after he has seen the Lakes to the S. W. of us, go to Penrith &amp; back to Ambleside
                  by way of Ulswater &amp; over Kirkstone. He will thus see every thing the right way. You
                  will of course say that I shall be very glad to see him. And if you will send me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EstlinJohnPrior">Estlins</a> direction at Edinburgh I will write to him there, &amp; press him to return this way.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">We shall meet oftener than you believe. I shall as a regular thing go every other
               year to London, &amp; if you cannot contrive to meet me there, will come home by way of
               Bristol. In that direction it would not be very difficult establish a line of acquaintance
               along the road. This place is a good one for me, because it is cheap: &amp; I would certainly
               rather keep a boat here than a coach any where else – Besides I could not move. All
               my life long I have labouring to get a sum large enough to enable me to settle &amp; get
               my things about me, &amp; it has been labour in vain. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> tells you that I am cheated. If he has any reasons for thinking so he should explain
               them to me: perhaps I may learn them from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> when he returns to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a>. at any rate I may derive <span class="strikethrough">x</span> some instructions from W. upon the art of driving a bargain – as I know no man likely
               to make a better for himself. I have no reason to think ill of my publishers, – none
               whatever. They have me at their mercy, as they must every person for whom they publish,
               – there neither is nor can be any check upon them: they may be rogues if they will,
               but their fair profits are so enormous that there can be no excuse for them if they
               are.</p>
