            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My silence has been longer than yours, – occasioned by that want of leisure which
               always is the consequence of loss of time. Fine weather &amp; the wish of showing the
               country to my friends, &amp; moreover the sad necessity of working the legs to keep the
               kidney quiet, have been so many motives for morning exercise. business of course accumulated
               for the evening, &amp; letter writing as the least important has always been the most
               readily postponed. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> is now gone, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge">George I</a> is gone, our only neighbours whom we care about go tomorrow also – I shall then shut
               myself up for the winter tho not like the bee to rest, or feed upon my summer gatherings,

                  I have made up my mind to the fitness of his being hung, &amp; am therefore prepared to
                  think any thing short of the gallows will be good luck for him. Of course I pay none
                  of his alehouse debts, &amp; give him up as utterly irreclaimable. The whole current of
                  politics public &amp; private is set in against me. A war with Spain will renew all the
                  alarm at Lisbon &amp; prevent me from taking a family there – &amp; even if this blow over;
                  I should think it more advisable for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> to remove from the neighbourhood of that accursed yellow fever than for me to approach
                  it. for to Lisbon it will get sooner or later, beyond a doubt. So that about going
