            <p>Feb<sup>y</sup> 11. As this letter was not finished at a heat – it has lain two or three weeks –
               to own the truth fairly <span class="strikethrough">because</span> I had such a fear about me of the yellow fever, because you mentioned indisposition
               on the night preceding the date of your last – that I had not heart to go on with
               it. Once I received a letter from a poor fellow three months after he was dead, –
               it excited a most painful feeling, &amp; it is little less unpleasant to <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> address one to a person who <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> you fear may not be among the living. However yours of Dec. 4. has just come to hand.
               You do not tell me whether the fever is out of the ship – but I conclude that it must
               almost have done its work, &amp; will go out like a fire when it no longer finds any thing
               that it can destroy. I have a sort of theory about such diseases which I do not understand
               myself – but somebody or other will one of these days. They are so far analogous to
               vegetables as that they take root – grow – ripen &amp; decay. Those which are eruptive
               blossom – &amp; seed – for the pustule of the small pox &amp;c is to all intents &amp; purposes
               the flower of the disease, or the fructification by which it is perpetuated. Now these
               diseases like vegetables chuse their own soil – as some plants like clay – others
               sand – others chalk, so the yellow fever will not take root in a negro – nor the yaws
               in a white man, &amp;c. There is a noble hint for a new theory – <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> you will <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> see the truth of the analogy at once – &amp; I can no more explain it than you can. but
