               <p>What you say of my copyrights affected me very much. Dear Cottle set your heart at
                  rest upon that subject, it ought to be at rest. They were yours: – fairly bought &amp;
                  fairly sold; you bought them upon the chance of their success, – which no London bookseller
                  would have done; &amp; had they not been bought they could not have been published at

                  </div> <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> the poem <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> never would have existed nor should I in all probability ever have obtained that reputation
                  which is the capital on which I subsist, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> &lt;nor&gt; that power which enables me to support it. But this is not all. Do you suppose

                  when I stood most in need of them? Your house was my house when I had no other; the
                  very money with which I bought my marriage-ring &amp; paid my marriage fees was supplied
                  by you; it was with your sister that I left <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> during my six months absence, – &amp; for the six months after my return it was from you
                  that I received week by week the little on which we lived, – till I was enabled to
                  live by other means. It is not the settling of our cash-account that can cancel obligations
                  like this. – You are in the habit of preserving your letters, &amp; if you were not I
                  would entreat you to preserve this – that it may be seen hereafter. <span class="strikethrough">It is my</span> Sure am I that there never was a more generous or kinder heart than yours, &amp; you will
                  believe me when I add that there does not live that man upon earth whom I remember
                  with more gratitude &amp; more affection.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My head throbs &amp; my eyes burn with these recollections. Good night my dear old friend
               &amp; benefactor.</p>
            <p class="indent5">____</p>
            <p>Thursday.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have read thro nineteen books of the Fall of Cambria &amp; shall finish the poem tomorrow.
               Of the <span class="strikethrough">p</span> story therefore I am not at present able to speak. It seems to me that you would
               write <span class="strikethrough">x</span> a long narrative poem far better in rhyme than in blank verse – &amp; if you attempt
               another I should earnestly advise you to use either a regular rhymed stanza, – or
               that irregular form which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> has made so popular, – indeed any mode of rhyming except the monotonous common couplet.
               The facility of writing which you possess tempts you to dilate too much, &amp; this temptation
               is more easily yielded to in blank verse. Rhyme would also lead you to lessen the
               quantity of dialogue &amp; the length of the speeches. It would have another important
               advantage – there is so much danger of sacrificing sense to sound in rhyming, that
               one is always upon the watch against it: – your feelings carry you away – you find
               words which seem at first to express them &amp; <span class="ital">do</span> give them vent. but it is not always possible for another to make out a precise &amp;
               definite meaning, for what you conceived strongly, but vaguely. In many instances
               I, who can enter into the mind of a poet, see when you have had a true poetic feeling,
               – &amp; yet have failed <span class="strikethrough">t</span> &lt;in&gt; bringing it fairly to light.</p>
