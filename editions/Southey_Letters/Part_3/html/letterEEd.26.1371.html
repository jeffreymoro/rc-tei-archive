                  Among them is a famous catalogue of all existing languages, by Hervas, originally
                  published by him in Italian in 1784, but now greatly enlarged &amp; extended in Spanish,

                  in some of the islands off their coast the language is Spanish adapted to the Araucan
                  grammar. – The Mexicans &amp; Peruvians (like the Romans) spread their language with their
                  arms, &amp; consequently each extended over a prodigious extent of country, – thus greatly
                  facilitating the conquests of the Spaniards. But the Jesuits found it better to learn
                  the savage dialects of the different tribes than to teach them Spanish, – for this
                  obvious reason, that thus they kept them to themselves. This Paraguay hist. will be
