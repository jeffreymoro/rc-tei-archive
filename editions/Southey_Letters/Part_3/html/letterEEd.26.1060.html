               <p>I have received yours with its inclosure on my return from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</a> where I have been since Monday. – the stories that his brother was overcome by his
                  situation are wholly unfounded. No man ever behaved better or more calmly – his last
                  words were when the ship was known to be sinking, &amp; a cry was set up – silence my
                  lads! Silence! – Could the ship have been kept afloat only a quarter of an hour longer
                  not a life would have been lost – they were within a mile of such shoal water that
                  the bottom would have touched &amp; rested. I could tell you much of this miserable affair
                  &amp; much of John Wordsworth <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> who was a truly admirable man.

               not. It is a beautiful book but I repent having printed it in quarto. By its high
               price one half the edition is condemned to be furniture in expensive libraries – &amp;
               the other to <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxxxx &amp;</span> collect cobwebs in the publishers warehouses. I foresee that I shall get no solid
               pudding by it. The loss on the first edition will eat up the profits of a second –
               if the publishers, as I suppose they will, should print a second while the quarto
               hangs upon hand. However after sixteen years it is something pleasant – as well as
               something melancholy – to see it as I now do, for the first time in the shape of a
               book. Many persons will read the book with pleasure – probably no one with more than
               you, for whatever worth it may have you will feel that had it not been for you it
               could never possibly have existed. It is easy to quit the pursuit of fortune for fame
               – but had I been obliged to work for the necessary comforts – <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxx xx</span> instead of the superfluities of life – I must have sunk as others have before me
               – Interrupted – when I did not wish it – for it is twilight – just enough to see that
               the pen travels straight &amp; I am tired with my walk from Grasmere – &amp; was in a mood
               for letter writing – but here is a gentleman from Malta with letters from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>.</p>

               Wynn endorsed it May 16 then altered it to April. Unfortunately there is no postmark
               to clarify the confusion. Internal evidence suggests a date after Southey’s last letter
               to Wynn (11 April 1805), as this states he has not seen a copy of <em>Madoc</em> yet but this letter reports that ‘Madoc has reached Keswick’. The date of the endorsement
               (and C. C. Southey’s dating) has therefore been retained.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
