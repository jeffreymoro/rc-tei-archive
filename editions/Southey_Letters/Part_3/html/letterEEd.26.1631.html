               <p>Ah Grosvenor – Ahhhhhhhh –––! If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> had found the Butler-a-boo statute in Ben Jonson, he would have hunted about till
                  he found out its meaning, – which does not lie very deep – for statutes are to be
                  looked for in Statute Books. I being at Dublin Castle opened the first page of the
                  Irish Statutes &amp; there the first thing which <span class="strikethrough">appe struck</span> caught my eye was The <span class="ital">Butler-a-boo Statute against making Comparisons</span>, this was the phrase, – its meaning that <span class="strikethrough">the</span> quarrels between the Ormonds (I believe) &amp; Butlers in which each party <span class="ital">compared</span> themselves with the other, &amp; set up their cry &amp; &lt;so&gt; made a riot were declared <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;felony&gt;. The cry of the Butlers was Butler-a-boo &amp; thence the statute was so denominated.
