               now showery weather, – by no means unpleasant, – rather that is best for this sort
               of scenery. But till within this week we have had from the first day of May the finest
               season ever remembered in this county – day after day of uninterrupted sunshine &amp;
               beauty. How often did we regret that you were not here, &amp; that this should be the
               only summer in which our house was without a guest. If Sir E. comes I should say come
               soon, – the chance of weather is pretty much the same, &amp; it is best to come before
               the days shorten too much. Six weeks ago had been better than now, now is better than
               six weeks hence.</p>

               <p>Your dreams of my golden fortunes to come make me smile. The world I believe will
                  always keep me lean &amp; hungry, like a grey hound, – as if abundance would spoil me,
