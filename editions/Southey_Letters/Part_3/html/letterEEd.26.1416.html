                  himself the greater idiot of the two in this business,) just so will he be obliged
                  to open a free trade with England – circumstances compel him to it. With respect to
                  the natives, I am of opinion that it would require two or three generations of civilization
                  or taming, before intermarriages could be productive of good. The mixed breed or Mamalucos
                  as they were called were desperately bad, – even the Jesuits pronounced them irreclaimable.
                  I have not yet learnt what proportion of the Brazilian tribes still exist upon the
                  sea coast, – probably a very small one. They must have been pretty well used up by
                  a villainous sort of slave trade, against which the Jesuits never could prevail, till
                  it was too late. Nor can I tell you what is the present state of the missions, – they
                  have probably diminished since the dissolution of that wonderful Society which was
                  destroyd just when it had ceased to be mischievious, &amp; was doing nothing but good.
