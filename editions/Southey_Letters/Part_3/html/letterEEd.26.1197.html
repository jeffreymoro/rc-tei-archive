               <p>‘The Curse’ wants force and appropriate dignity, and suits a witch better than the
                  man-almighty who is to endanger the Trimourtee and drag the gods of the Sorgon through
                  Hell (Padalon) at his chariot-wheels.

                  </div> Encourage me if you can. I suspect that by rhyming only occasionally I shall please
                  nobody, and in truth there is no reason why the rhyme should be used in one place
                  and not in another. You, however, know how little I care for present effect. Try your
                  own ear, and give your opinion as a representative of those who are to read it some
                  centuries hence. You shall have another sheet of ‘Kehama’ as soon as I can get it
                  copied, for which I have not time myself. I shall very likely finish it this winter,
                  instead of reviewing. God bless you! I had more to say, but must wait another opportunity
                  and a clear sheet of paper.</p>
