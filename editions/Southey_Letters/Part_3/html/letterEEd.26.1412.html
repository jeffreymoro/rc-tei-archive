            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am sorry to hear so bad an account of your health. To me who in the South of England
               am called a West-countryman it seems strange that any one should think of removing
               into Cumberland for the sake of climate. Yet certainly it must be a great change from
               the bleak Edinburgh winds which I remember with a sort of shivering antipathy to the
               long cheerless streets of your new town. Do you suffer most from cold, or from damp
               weather? We have more rain than they have at Penrith – but are much warmer; our mountains
               stop the clouds which come from the coast &amp; manufacture plenty of their own – but
               they also screen us from bitter East winds, &amp; our side of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> is green for many weeks before that which looks towards Carlisle has lost its winter
               covering. In our neighbourhood there is no house of the description that would suit
               you. I am making enquiry round about, – the neighbourhood of Cockermouth would suit
               you best in point of climate, as neither too near the sea, nor the mountains; – but
               any place on that side the mountains will be preferable to the Penrith side. Heartily
               glad shall I be to have you within such a distance that you may often see <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> Lake, &amp; receive ocular proof that there are times when neither pen nor pencil can
               convey ought but a faint idea of its awefulness.</p>

                  </div> is so generally ascribed to me that I must console myself by the persuasion that the
                  public had no good reason for suspecting me, unknown as I am to them in any other
                  character than that of a poet. Nothing renders England more remarkable to a Spaniard
                  than the variety of religious sects which it contains: &amp; few subjects appeal to me
                  more worthy of attention than the aberrations of human intellect upon the most momentous
                  object which can ever employ it. You &amp; I seem to hold different opinions upon that
                  subject – &amp; our points of difference probably appear to me of less importance than
                  they do to you. I regard those letters as some of the most curious in the whole work.
                  there is more research in them than you would imagine, &amp; if I am not mistaken some
                  valuable observations. As to my own faith I am what would have been called a Seeker
                  in former times; – belonging to no flock yet not without a shepherd. I incline to
                  Quakerism, &amp; if the present Quakers abstained from insisting on articles of faith,
                  &amp; left those points which are not explained in the Gospel, untouched, with the same
                  reverence as their fathers did – I should perhaps call myself a Quaker. But I have
                  no Quaker superstitions, &amp; can see their errors with a strong eye. All sects appear
                  to think unworthily of man &amp; his maker. You may recognise their opinions thro the
                  assumed character of a thorough Papist. – As for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna Southcote</a> surely that such a woman can find believers is an extraordinary fact in the history
                  of the present times. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">William Owen</a> the Welsh Scolar is one of her four and twenty elders! Bedlam is the place for such
                  half lunatic half-imposters because they infect others. I have seen instances of the
                  mischief Brothers did in making tradesmen leave their business &amp; their families, all
                  that relates to him &amp; Bryan

                  </div> is written from personal knowledge. I knew Bryan &amp; heard the whole system from his
                  own mouth, &amp; he it was who went with the knife to stab Brothers &amp; told me the fact
                  himself. The main value of the book is its thorough veracity. To the best of my knowledge
                  I have good authority for every single thing which it asserts.</p>
