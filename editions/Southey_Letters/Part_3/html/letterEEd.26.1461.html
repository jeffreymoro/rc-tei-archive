                  the whole poem, – he buries his story in his circumstances, just as ladies of old
                  used to be lost under the load of their full dress. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> is too passionately the Antiquarian, – a painter who has to paint Knights in armour
                  has no need of any anatomical knowledge, – &amp; if he keeps their bevers closed it is
                  of no consequence whether he can even paint a human face, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> has done wilfully what such a painter might do to hide his ignorance, – he has cased <span class="strikethrough">all</span> every thing in costume, &amp; made that the essence of his writings which ought only to
                  be their ornament. – He never narrates perspicuouly, &amp; it is necessary to read slowly,
                  or to read twice before the thread of his story can be comprehended. His language
                  has the unpardonable fault of belonging to no age or country – sometimes rust, sometimes
                  tinsel; – &amp; he spells &amp; accents the same word either in the new fashion or &lt;the&gt; old,
                  &amp; writes Scotch or English, just as happens to be convenient. With all this <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> is a poet of great powers &amp; great originality; when I was in town it fell to my lot
                  more frequently to defend Marmion than to speak of its faults, &amp; I did it more willingly.
                  The story of this poem would be excellent if he had only developed it well, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; not</span> given himself time to mature it, &amp; not hurried it up to be in time for the season,
                  – as green geese are fattened for the London market: – yet I would rather have two
                  such poems as Marmion, than one on which he <span class="strikethrough">had</span> should bestow twice the time, because the sum total of beauty &amp; of delight would be
                  greater, – &amp; the defects are not worth mentioning in the general estimate.</p>
