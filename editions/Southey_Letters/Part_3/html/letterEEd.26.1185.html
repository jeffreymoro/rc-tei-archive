               <p>The papers say nothing about Portugal. – their alarms come and go like ague fits,
                  &amp; this is one of the intervals. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> seems to think that some mischief is going on – my opinion, he says, is that we shall
                  not have any Envoy Consul or Chaplain here many months longer. I am much of the same
                  opinion, but if the question were put out of doubt, it would relieve me from a not
                  very comfortable state of indecision. A little time will show: if the country be not

                  &amp; that this was done in his case, tho he did not avail himself of it, having previously

               <p>I am working as hard as this fine weather will let me, for there is a perpetual temptation
                  to be in the open air, at D Manuel first, running a race as usual with the printer;
                  &amp; secondly at the Chronicle of the Cid – so I design to call it.

                  </div> You will I think be much pleased with this. I give the whole story at full in Chronicle
                  language, with all its fabulous ornaments, compiled from the original Chronicle, the
                  metrical romances &lt;or history&gt; which was probably the foundation of that, the Ballads,

                  respective authorities will be stated step by step, &amp; appreciated in the notes, wherein
                  also I shall point out, as far as possible, what is true, &amp; what fictitious, where
                  that needs to be done: insert the more curious passages from the different poems,
                  &amp; be as learned &amp; as amusing as I can. The whole will give a striking picture of what
                  may be called the heroic age of Spain, &amp; thus shall I dispose of much matter collected
                  for any historical preliminaries, but for which there will be there no room. It is
                  not unlikely that while thus employed I may yield unto temptation &amp; make more ballads
