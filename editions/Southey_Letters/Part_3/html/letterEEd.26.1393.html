                  the objections which weigh with me against bearing any part in the Journal are these.
                  I have scarcely one opinion in common with it upon any subject. Jeffrey is for peace,
                  &amp; is endeavouring to frighten the people into it. I am for war as long as Bonaparte

                  would be to introduce an Irish Priest into every ship in the navy. My feelings are
                  still less in unison with him than my opinions. On subjects of moral or political
                  importance no man is more apt to speak in the very gall of bitterness that I am; &amp;
                  this habit is likely to go with me to the grave. But that sort of bitterness in which
                  he indulges, which tends directly &amp; purposely to wound a man in his feelings, &amp; injure
                  him in his fame &amp; fortune (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</a> is a case in point
