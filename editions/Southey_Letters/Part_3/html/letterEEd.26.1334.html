            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A good deal depends upon seeing this country the right way. Your best plan will be
               to cross the sands from Lancaster to Ulverstone, – from whence you will see <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#FurnessAbbey">Furness Abbey</a>. Proceed up Coniston Lake, &amp; then strike across to the Ferry on Winandermere, – cross
               there &amp; go along the opposite bank to Ambleside. Ryedale, Grasmere &amp; Thirlmere lie
               on the road to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>. From Keswick you will visit the Lakes which lie to the W. &amp; S.W of us, Crummock
               &amp; Buttermere, &amp; Ennerdale &amp; Was-water, the two last are seldom visited by tourists,
               tho they are remarkably fine. Ulswater should be taken on your return to Ambleside.
               This is the only plan by which every lake can be approached, in the proper manner,
               &amp; you need not be told how the effect of such scenery is impaired by entering from
               the head instead of the foot. There is a good deal to be seen about Ambleside as well
               as about Keswick, but you had better practise mountaineering in the neighbourhood
               first, &amp; when you return to Ambleside I will take care to meet you there if possible,
               or if not to provide you with a suitable guide. – The common tourist road is very
               good &amp; will do for any carriage, – the wilder &amp; finer parts of the country can only
               be <span class="strikethrough">seen</span> reached on foot or on horseback.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Our summers begin late &amp; continue long. If it were not that evening sets in so soon
               I should say autumn is the best season for coming, but summer evenings on the lake
               are so delightful that you should come in time for them.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am sorry to say <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> has no thoughts of revisiting Keswick yet he talked perhaps of my visiting him, which
               I <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> shall do during the winter.</p>

               <p>Lord Howick was wise in not contesting Northumberland, because according to all human
                  probability he must soon be called to the House of Lords by his fathers death.

                           First Lord of the Admiralty from 1806 but did not contest the election to the House
                           of Commons in spring 1807 because his sponsor, Hugh Percy, second Duke of Northumberland
                           (1742–1817; DNB), withdrew his support in favour of his own son, Lord Percy, who had
                           just come of age. Grey took his seat in the House of Lords in January 1808.</span></div>
