            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You suffered my letter to remain so long unanswered that the plan which it proposes
                  must of necessity for awhile remain unexecuted. I am bound for London, chiefly to
                  complete these Specimens

                           of the Later English Poets, which owing to Bedford’s inefficiency, was not in the
                           end published until 1807.</span></div>
                  </div> &amp; put them to press. the time for my absence must be during<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> confinement

                  </div> – &amp; that is now so near that I may possibly be departing within a week or ten days.
                  Had <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace </a> <span class="ital">arrived</span> a fortnight ago – I could have delayed my journey two or three weeks – as time now
                  stands the plan must be that I should talk to him of the Lakes, &amp; ask him down – viva-voce.
                  For him this will be so far pleasanter as he will find more society at Keswick. my
                  brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> will be here in May, hot from Edinburgh, with as much knowledge in his head as a head
                  only twenty years old can contain. Alas for your unhappy habit of procrastination!
                  ‘Dont delay’ you write in your postscript – &amp; this in answer to a letter which had
                  lain above a fortnight in your desk! here it happens to be of no moment, but you tell
                  me the habit has produced &amp; is producing worse consequences. I would give you advice
                  if it could be of use, but there is no curing those who chuse to be diseased. A good
                  man &amp; a wise man may at times be angry with the world, at times grieved for it. but
                  be sure no man was ever discontented with the world – if he did his duty in it. If
                  a man of education who has health, eyes, hands, &amp; leisure – wants an object – it is
                  only because God almighty has bestowed all those blessings upon one who does not deserve
                  them. Dear Grosvenor I wish you may feel half the pain in reading this that I do in
                  writing it – for it may serve as an answer to all the letters you have written me
                  for some years past.</p>

               <p>And what shall I say after this? for this bitter pill will put your mouth out of taste
                  for whatever insipidities I might have had to offer. only the metaphor reminds me
                  of a scheme of mine – which is to <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> &lt;improve&gt; cookery by <span class="ital">chemical tuning</span>. making every dish prepare <span class="strikethrough">for</span> the palate for that which is to come next – &amp; this reminds me that I have discovered
                  most poignant &amp; good galvanism in drinking water out of an iron cup. how far this
                  may improve fermented liquor remains to be experimented. the next time you see a pump
