            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I thought it so likely you would hear from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> the particulars concerning <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southeys</a> will, that I felt no inclination to repeat the story to you – which would not have
                  been the case had the old man done as he ought to have done. Good part of his property
                  consisting in a<span class="strikethrough">n</span> newly purchased &lt;estate&gt; is given to a very distant relation of his mothers family,
                  &amp; of course gone for ever. About 2000 £ in legacies the rest falls to his brother
                  as Sole Executor &amp; residuary Legatee. Neither my name nor either of my brothers is
                  mentioned. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Thomas Southey</a> apprized me of this the day of the old mans death. With him I am on good terms – that
                  is, if we were in the same town we should dine together, for the sake of relationship,
                  about once a month, – &amp; if any thing were to happen to me of any kind of family importance
                  – such as the birth of a child – I should write him a letter beginning dear Uncle.
                  He invites me to <span class="strikethrough">his new</span> ‘the Cottage, – &amp; I shall go there on my way to Lisbon. I think it likely that he
                  will leave his property rather to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> than to me – for the names-sake; – but not likely that he will leave it out of the
                  family.

                  an end of it. Some people, they say, are born with silver spoons in their mouths,
                  &amp; others with wooden ladles. I will hope something for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">my daughter</a> upon the strength of this proverb inasmuch as she has three silver cups,

                  comes in this preface – Dont swear, &amp; bid me do one thing at a time – I tell you I
                  can’t afford to do one thing at a time, no nor two neither &amp; it is only by doing many
                  things at a time that I contrive to do so much, for I cannot work long together at
                  any thing without hurting myself – &amp; so I do every thing by heats, that by the time
