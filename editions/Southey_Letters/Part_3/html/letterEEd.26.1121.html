               <p>My Scotch excursion with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> was a pleasant one. We saw Melrose on our way, if not the most picturesque ruin, certainly
                  the finest architectural one in the whole island.

                           in 1136 by Cistercian monks. Southey visited the Abbey, which is close to Walter Scott’s
                           then home, Ashestiel, on his trip to Edinburgh in October 1805.</span></div>
                  </div> We staid three days with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a> at his <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ashestiel">home</a> on the banks of the Tweed. One morning was given to salmon-spearing – with a heavy
                  trident about twelve feet long I had to manage one <span class="strikethrough">side</span> end of a flat bottomed crazy boat as she floated sideways down a rapid stream, &amp; to
                  keep her even, &amp; prevent her from striking against the rocks &amp; so upsetting. I did
                  my part well, &amp; having no evil designs upon the salmon came home quite innocent, &amp;
                  sufficiently instructed in a very singular &lt;savage&gt; sport. Scott is a pleasant man,
                  of open &amp; friendly manners, so full of topographical anecdote that having seen him
                  you would be perfectly well satisfied how well history may be preserved by tradition.
                  We saw much classic ground besides the Tweed. The Yarrow with Newark Castle, Branksome
                  overlooking the Tiviot &amp; Johnny Armstrongs strong hold on the Esk.
