         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">In his last letter to Bedford, Southey had complained about the delay it took for
               his pension to be paid, asking: ‘if you can by any interest get my pension paid I
               pray you exert it’ and adding: ‘I foresee that I shall be kept in hot water by it
               till I am lucky enough to get some little prize in the lottery of life which will
               enable me to wait without inconvenience for arrears’; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles
               Bedford, 15 November 1807, Letter 1378. Earlier in 1807, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> had arranged that the pension he paid Southey from his personal funds was replaced
               by a government pension.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
