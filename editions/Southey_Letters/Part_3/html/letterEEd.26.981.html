               <p>You will have wondered at a silence unusually long. in fact I have a heavy arrears
                  of letters to pay off. fine weather has led me day after day mountaineering with a
                  long succession of visitors. We have a round of company here which intrudes upon many
                  an evening. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> is with me – &amp; all these interruptions &amp; temptations give such assistance to my printer

                  – by the Medusa Frigate, for Gibralter; which met with a Line of Battle Ship that
                  ordered her, I suppose, on a cruise, &amp; took her mails from her, whether D.s Butter,
                  Cheese &amp; Paper were reckoned as dispatches &amp; forwarded likewise I do not know, but
                  if they were not, this is the last he will ever hear of them. His letter to his brother
                  I sent over land. I wrote likewise by the same Post to him &amp; to M<sup>r</sup> Pownall the agent,

               <p>I corrected this evening the 38th sheet of Madoc which brings it down to the beginning

                  2500 lines of story added in this revision – the alterations in these latter books
                  are fewer than I expected – yet I hope they materially improve them. On the whole
