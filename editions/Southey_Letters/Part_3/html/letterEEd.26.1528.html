                  </div> – but there was no prospect of profit to tempt me, &amp; as certainly, if I live, it is
                  my intention to enter fully into the literary history of both countries, – that made
                  me lay aside the thought of any thing on a lesser scale. Another reason perhaps may
                  have been this, that it is not more difficult to compose poetry than to translate
                  it, &amp; that, in my own opinion I can make as good as I can find. – Very very few of
                  the Spanish ballads are good; – they are made in general upon one receipt &amp; that a
                  most inartificial one – they begin by describing the situation of somebody, who makes
                  a speech which is the end. <span class="strikethrough">An</span> Nothing like the wildness or the character of our ballads is to be found among them.
                  It is curious &amp; at present inexplicable to me how their prose should be so exquisitely
                  poetical as it is in the Cid,

               Burrard (1755–1813; <em>DNB</em>) and Sir Hew Dalrymple (1750–1830;<em>DNB</em>). Public outcry led to an inquiry, after which Burrard and Dalrymple never again
