            <p class="indent1">I will not talk of this disappointment – for that is of little consequence – nor have
               I any thing to say respecting the worst part of your letter. – only remember that
               in doing your duty something is due to yourself, &amp; that if you reduced yourself to
               absolute want it would afford but a temporary Relief to your brother. as therefore
               no sacrifice on your part could permanently help him, none ought to be made which
               should materially inconvenience you, or at all <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> amerce you of your comforts. All this I have said to you before – &amp; it will be said
               I well know by your friends at Bristol. That the creditors are little disposed to
               accommodation is probably no evil, certainly less than any false hopes would be which
               might tempt to a farther trial of plans which cannot succeed. The war opens the same
               resources as formerly, &amp; he must submit to a separation from his family as the only
               possible means of ultimately providing for them, for in army or navy there may be
               a chance of obtaining some situation at last which would secure half-pay.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter was indeed a sad disappointment.

                  </div> I jumped up from my afternoon nap on the sofa &amp; cried this is the letter I wanted

                  very head quarters of infection at Antigua for stores. however as the stay would not
                  exceed 48 hours – probably only 24 – &amp; they are on their guard I hope &amp; trust they
                  may escape. Tom is delighted with the small Islands – quite as much as ever <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">King</a> was. – I expected to have pleased you with his letters which are really very interesting.
                  Do write to him at Barbadoes. his last letter is dated June 11. &amp; he had never received
                  one line from England – for three Packets had been taken. Provoking! there was a long
