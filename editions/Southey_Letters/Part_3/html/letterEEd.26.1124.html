               ships and their crew-members. The Cape of Good Hope was captured by the British in
               1795, ceded to the Dutch in 1803, and was once more taken by British marines on 19

It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of
               the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize
               money was contested because the ships were captured before war was officially declared.
               Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated and <em>The Courier</em> published a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday
               24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’. A ‘reply
               from a Spanish merchant’ appeared in <em>The Courier</em> for 6 September 1805. Southey’s response, that the prize money was being withheld
               from the sailors in a measure that was ‘impolitic, ungenerous and unjust’ was published
               in <em>The Courier</em> of 25 September 1805, p. 2. This was refuted by an editorial article in <em>The Courier</em> of 28 September 1805, where it was stated that there was no truth in Southey’s assertion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
