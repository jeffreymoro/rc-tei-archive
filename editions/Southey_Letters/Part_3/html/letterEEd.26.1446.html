               <p>Your letter followed me to London, – the hope which it held out that we might meet
                  there, &amp; the endless round of occupations in which I was involved during the whole
                  nine weeks of my absence prevented me from thanking you for Marmion,

               <p>Half the poem I had read at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HeberRichard">Hebers</a> before my own copy arrived. I went punctually to breakfast with him, &amp; he was long
                  enough dressing <span class="strikethrough">for me to</span> &lt;to let me&gt; devour so much of it. – The story is made of better materials than the

                  your former poem as the death of Marmion, – there is nothing finer in its conception
                  any where.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The introductory epistles I did not wish away, because as poems they gave me great
               pleasure, but I wished them at the end of the volume, or at the beginning, anywhere
               except where they were. My taste is perhaps peculiar in disliking all interruptions
               in narrative poetry. When the poet<span class="strikethrough">s</span> lets his story sleep &amp; talks <span class="strikethrough">of</span> in his own person it has to me the same sort of unpleasant effect that is produced
               at the end of an Act; <span class="strikethrough">when</span> you are alive to know what follows, &amp; lo – down comes the curtain &amp; the fiddlers
               begin with their abominations. The general opinion is with me in this particular instance.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
