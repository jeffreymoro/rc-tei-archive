            <p>Endorsement: 28 Nov–1804<br>MS: Huntington Library, RS 64<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: Pencil endorsement is not in JR’s hand and could be a later addition;
               pencil annotation to HM folder reads ‘possibly Nov 2’; RS dates ‘Wednesday’. From
               the internal evidence of the letter, where Southey says ‘we are at Lloyds’, it would
               indicate that it was written earlier than the date of the endorsement, as the Southeys
               left Lloyd’s house on 26 November (which was a Monday in 1804). The ‘Wednesday’ referred
               to is presumably 21 November 1804.</p>
