                           of the Convention of Cintra (30 August 1808). On 27 December 1808 and 13 January 1809
                           Wordsworth published, in The Courier, an article condemning the Convention. In May
                           1809 Longmans published the article as a pamphlet: Concerning the Relations of Great
                           Britain, Spain, and Portugal, to Each Other, and to the Common Enemy, at this Crisis;

                  </div> This fault will outweigh all its merits. The public never can like any thing which

                  understood, while the philosophy which he brought to their aid was heathen Greek to
                  the multitude of his readers. I impute Wordsworths want of perspicuity to two causes,
                  – his admiration of Miltons prose, – &amp; his habit of dictating instead of writing:
                  if he were his own scribe his eye would tell him where to stop, – but in dictating,
                  his own thoughts are to himself <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> familiarly intelligible, &amp; he goes on unconscious either of the length of the sentence,
                  or the difficulty a common reader must necessarily find of following its meaning to
