                  supply what, after all, dislike at the employment will prevent me from supplying so
                  well. for my transcript differs materially from the rude drafts both in language &amp;
                  arrangement. The one which arrived contains from page 1 to 7 – &amp; from 11 to 14 – one

               Fortune is the only being that I shall ever stand upon ceremony with – she may depend
               upon it that if she does not think proper to call upon me I shall never look after
               her. Seriously speaking no possible good could arise from my leaving <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> in February rather than in March. You know all I wish is an appointment at Lisbon,
               one or two, whichever turns up first.

               uncushioned bones are to go thro. I will stop at Congreve very willingly. Is there
               no coach from Birmingham to London thro Coventry? I want to see that old town, &amp; to

                  avail. – I have never seen them but once since we have lived here &amp; that was two winters
                  ago. – Of Colonel Taylor you can have heard me say nothing, for I know nothing of
                  him. you may possibly have heard me say that I had read one of his books which would
                  be a very useful guide to any person going overland to India, but is of no value to
                  anybody else.
