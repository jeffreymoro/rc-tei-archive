               <p>As for this curst affair in Portugal, I have no heart to write about it. One comfort
                  is that all England is in an uproar about it, every man feels like, &amp; I think there
                  is good reason to hope that at last we shall see a General shot for misconduct. The
                  plain course which an able ministry would pursue would be this, – to break the convention,
                  &amp; deliver up to the French the wretch who signed it, with a halter round his neck.
                  This was a Roman custom, &amp; a wise one it was. My own belief is that no man could have
                  consented to let Junot carry away his plunder, unless he had had a share given him
                  for his consent; surely he who had so little sense of honour as to make such terms,
                  cannot be supposed to have enough to stand in his way upon any occasion.

               whereby the French army commanded by Jean-Andoche Junot (1771–1813) and defeated by
               Anglo-Portuguese forces under Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the 1st Duke of Wellington)
               (1769–1852; <em>DNB</em>) at Vimeiro on 21 August, was allowed to retreat intact, with its weapons, from Portugal.
               Wellesley, who did not sign the Convention, had been superseded in command by two
               veteran generals, just arrived in Iberia, who were content to make peace: Sir Harry
               Burrard (1755–1813; <em>DNB</em>) and Sir Hew Dalrymple (1750–1830;<em>DNB</em>). Public outcry led to an inquiry, after which Burrard and Dalrymple never again
