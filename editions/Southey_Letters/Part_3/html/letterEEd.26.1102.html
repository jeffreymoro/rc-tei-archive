                  a steady sober elevation, 4. others mere verse without poetry, aiming at nothing more
                  than to carry on the tale with as little loss of time as possible, &amp; others 5. the
                  fewest of course &amp; the best, where either the personage or the poet are under the
                  influence of passion. I have figured them to specify instances. – 1. the book about
                  Bangor. the scene with Goagan. the first introduction of Neolin. 2. the festival of
                  the dead. 3. The opening of the Gorsedd: the opening of the second part after the
                  first paragraph. 4. Cadwallons narrative &amp; most of the narrated narrations – i.e.
                  when any body tells a story. the last class need not be enumerated – for they lie
                  in single sentences chiefly. <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> – the scene with Llewellyn is the finest passage in the whole.
