               <p>I very much wish you were here. You may have heard that there is an island which sometimes
                  comes up in this Lake,

                  now, sure enough, it is above water. It may stay there for some weeks, &amp; some times
                  six or eight, – it may already have sunk. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy </a><span class="ital">ought</span> to put himself in the first mail coach, – &amp; perhaps curiosity may induce you to expedite
                  your journey for the sake of seeing the oddest thing you are ever likely to see.</p>

            <p class="indent1">How it is effected is for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</a> to discover, but as much of the bottom of the Lake as is equal to the area of your
               house, has been forced up to the surface, in <span class="strikethrough">about</span> several pieces; – &amp; in other parts you can plainly see that there are rents in the
               bottom where parts have sunk in, for it is not in a deep part of the Lake. The gas
               which follows the immersion of a pole stinks. &amp; over one part of the water a thin
               steam was plainly discernable when I was there. As no person <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> was present when it rose we cannot tell whether it was accompanied with any great
               agitation of the water, or any noise, – but the noise if any, cannot have been very
               great, or it would have been heard <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> here. It is possible that the cause <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> may have some connection with the sulphureous springs in the neighbourhood, – almost

                           century Portugal and writes ‘Pentes Laares is probably a barbarous compound of the
                           two words Penates and Lares. If it be remembered how many Roman superstitions were
                           still in full use, it will not appear improbable that some family idols were preserved
                           as amulets; .. or perhaps the corrupted Pagan names applied to some of those objects
                           of Catholic idolatry which have supplied their place’.</span></div>
                  </div> The fact is that many Pagan superstitions prevailed till a very late age in Portugal,
                  – some were prohibited so late as 1383, &amp; I dare say some are to be found still in
                  existence.</p>

               <p>My friends the Spaniards &amp; Port. are justifying the character which I have long given
                  them, to the astonishment of those who heard me. Bonaparte will I suppose pour in
                  upon them with his whole force, – so let him. You know how little respect I have for
                  what is called the spirit of history, or the philosophy of history, by those people
                  who want to have every thing given them in extracts &amp; essences. – but the truth of
                  the present history is that a great military despotism in its youth &amp; full vigour
                  like that of France will &amp; must beat down corrupt establishments &amp; worn-out governments,
                  – but that it cannot beat down a true love of liberty &amp; a true spirit of patriotism,
                  – unless there be an overwhelming superiority of physical force, which is not the
                  case here. Bonaparte has one benefit more to confer upon the Spaniards – to put both
                  their King &amp; their Prince out of the way, – which I doubt not he will do. His work
                  of destruction is not quite completed, I hoped &amp; expected to have seen him destroy
                  the House of Austria &amp; the Turkish Empire. two great evils which cumber the earth.
                  He may perhaps turn upon these as an excuse for leaving Spain alone, – but in Spain
                  the fire has <span class="strikethrough">broken</span> burst out which will consume. – Well done my friend William Bryan the Prophet, you
