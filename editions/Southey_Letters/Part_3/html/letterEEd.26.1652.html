               <p>So far is your sheet of Butlerology from having convinced me that what I want you

                  heroic principle of writing all the odd things that come into your head: it will be
                  easy enough to pen a satirical allusion to the tail of some five or six of them, &amp;
                  these being plain, the whole will pass for a profound satire. Rabelais,
