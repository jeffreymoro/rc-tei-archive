                           of a cruel review. For further details, see Southey to Neville White, 28 November

                  </div> This man is continually giving the surest proof of intellectual weakness in altering
                  his plans. He builds up kingdoms and pulls them down, just as children serve their
                  card houses: aiming at nothing permanent, and incapable of producing anything that
                  can be so. Many happy new years to you and yours.</p>

               to the <em>Monthly Mirror</em>. Lofft was offended by a paragraph in which Southey praised himself, rather than
               Lofft, for bringing White’s poetry to notice after the setback of a cruel review.
               For further details, see Southey to Neville White, 28 November 1808, Letter 1545.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               designed to crush the hopes of Henry, and suppress his struggling genius, has been
               in its consequences, the main occasion of bringing his Remains to light, and obtaining
               for him that fame which assuredly will be his portion. Had it not been for the indignation
               which I felt at perusing a criticism at once so cruel and so stupid, the little intercourse
               between Henry and myself would not have taken place; his papers would probably have
               remained in oblivion, and his name, in a few years, have been forgotten’, <em>Remains of Henry Kirke White … with an Account of his Life</em>, 2 vols (London, 1808), I, p. 27.
