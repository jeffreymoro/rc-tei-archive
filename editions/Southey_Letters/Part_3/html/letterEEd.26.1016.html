                  to beg a branch of the Tree of Life – in hopes thereby to escape the penalty of death.
                  That Shem got the bough – but returned with it too late – that he planted it upon
                  the grave of Adam, where it took root. That Noah took the tree with Adam’s bones into
                  the Ark. That Adam was buried at Golgotha so called in consequence. That the Tree
                  which was a Trinitarian tree being at once a palm, a cypress &amp; a cedar, was cut down
                  for Solomon’s temple, but being by accident or rather especial Providence not used
                  in the building was the actual Cross, which was planted upon Adams skull – so that
                  as it had at first grown upon his grave, it <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> attracted his whole nature.
