                           had captured the Spanish brig Isabella and the ship Conception, both laden with wine
                           and brandy, and the ship Commerce, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers
                           to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict,
                           but in this case the prize money was contested because the ships were captured before
                           war was officially declared. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share
                           reinstated in The Courier which published a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim
                           to…</span></div>
                  </div> In a few days comes a reply from a Spanish Merchant stating that as the prizes taken <span class="ital">before</span> the Declaration of War are droits of the crown, &amp; only given in former cases by special
                  favour to the navy, there was no injustice in withholding from them what they never
                  had any <span class="ital">right</span> to. To this I replied, &amp; yesterday the Courier in their leading article assert that
                  their Correspondent (meaning me) has been greatly mistaken, for that the sailors are
                  not to receive one farthing less than in former cases.

                           28 September 1805, where it was stated that there was no truth in Southey’s assertion.</span></div>
                  </div> If this be true you may thank me for it, – for the Spanish Merchants themselves understood
                  the matter as I understood it. I believe Government has been puzzled by its first
                  blunder of stopping the frigates in that buccaneering &amp; infamous manner, – that by
                  way of making out a better story they resolved to give them to the Merchants, then
                  finding that was not enough tost your prizes into the bargain, – then fearing the
                  unpopularity of this, thought to halve it, – for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> knows a Captain who had received half his share &amp; was to have no more, – &amp; lately

               remarks in public; he again declared his desire for Elizabeth Herbert, Countess of
               Pembroke and Montgomery (1737–1831; <em>DNB</em>).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

         <div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">4.. </span><span class="noteBody">In December 1804, the naval ship HMS <span class="ital">Amelia</span>, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant, had captured the Spanish brig <span class="ital">Isabella</span> and the ship <span class="ital">Conception</span>, both laden with wine and brandy, and the ship <span class="ital">Commerce</span>, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of
               the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but in this case the prize
               money was contested because the ships were captured before war was officially declared.
               Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated in <em>The Courier</em> which published a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday
               24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               from the sailors in a measure that was ‘impolitic, ungenerous and unjust’ was published
               in <em>The Courier</em> of 25 September 1805, p. 2. This was refuted by an editorial article in <em>The Courier</em> of 28 September 1805, where it was stated that there was no truth in Southey’s assertion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
