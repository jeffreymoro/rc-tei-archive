               (1782–1800), was investigated by a Royal Commission. After its report, on 9 April
               1805, Melville was censured in the House of Commons for allowing Alexander Trotter
               (dates unknown), the naval paymaster, to misuse public funds. Melville resigned and
               impeachment proceedings were commenced against him. His trial opened on 29 April 1806,
               attracting a great deal of public interest, but by 12 June Melville had been acquitted
               of nearly all the charges.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
