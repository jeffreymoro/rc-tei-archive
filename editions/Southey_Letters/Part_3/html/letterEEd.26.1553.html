               <p>If it be possible to ruin the Spaniards our wretched ministry will do it. Common spirit,
                  – common honour, – common sense should make them send our whole disposable force into
                  Spain, – instead of thinking about nothing but how to save the handful we have there.
                  The only possible chance Bonaparte has of winning &amp; holding the country, is if the
                  people should learn to hate &amp; despise us, – &amp; they will have good reason to do both
                  if we only march in to Spain, &amp; then run out of it. Keep the mountains, – avoid all
                  general actions, &amp; then the French must inevitably be worn out at last &amp; the country
                  rid of them. But there is a curse upon poor England! – with the best &amp; bravest people
                  in the world, we are destined always to be made the bane of our allies, &amp; the jest
                  of the rest of Europe. I suppose the gross &amp; shocking folly with which this whole
                  business has been managed will unship the present ministry, but alas what good will
                  that be! – the set that comes in will not be a whit better than the set that goes
