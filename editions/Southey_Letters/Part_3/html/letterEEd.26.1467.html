            <p class="indent1">You probably know Senhora that I thanked <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir Edward</a> for the books, eight or nine days ago, soon after their arrival; – not immediately,
               – because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> was at that time very ill. He has had a severe attack of bilious fever, which has
               sadly reduced him, &amp; left him in a state of great debility. For about a week I was
               too uneasy about him to do anything, except reading, &amp; this has brought upon me an
               accumulation of letters to be written, – for seldom as I write to anybody, &amp; little
               as I love letter-writing, it is still an occupation which takes up more time than
               I can either conveniently or willingly spare. – This however is the reason why I have
               not sooner told you of the arrival of the books, thanked you, &amp; abused the Stafford
               bookbinder, for his vile lines, &amp; the yet viler way in which he has inserted the prints,
               so as to render it impossible to see them fairly open.</p>

                  first letter looks best in red &amp; gold, in blue &amp; gold – or with both colours, together
                  with sundry other points of the same nature, which the Lieutenant &amp; I debate with
                  all due solemnity. Uncle Toby &amp; the Corporal

                  is not enough for me. I am persuaded that I can write two poems better at a time than
                  in sequence, &amp; that time will be saved by so doing; because I can be going on with
                  one when at a stand with the others. for tho the whole story be made out, the immediate
                  way of getting forwards is not always obvious, nor to be found by beating about for
                  it. There is nothing to be done in such cases but to lie still &amp; wait for a revelation.
                  Now I believe that by having two at once upon the stocks, I may be working one field
                  while the other lies fallow, &amp; so I am planning a long poem in blank verse upon Pelayo,

                  before the plan is made out sufficiently for me to set at work. Huzza Senhora – another
                  nine thousand lines for five &amp; twenty pounds, – is it to be so think you? I shall
                  make a quiet trial whether it be possible to get five hundred subscribers &amp; so secure
                  the whole profits of an edition to myself, instead of letting the booksellers take
                  the Lions share, – it is not very likely, – it is not at all likely that I shall succeed,
                  – I do not believe that I shall get half the number. – but perhaps if I were to succeed
                  so far, a bargain might be made to let the book-seller print as many as they please,
                  &amp; give me my subscription copies, &amp; thus my end would be answered. At any rate as
                  I write no poetry after breakfast, whatever the profit be, it will be so much gained
                  as the price of morning-sleep, &amp; if it be not sufficient to enable me to afford other

                  it were impossible to pursue both, I should be of their opinion. But there is one
                  man in the world who thinks poetry exclusively the only worthy pursuit of any one
