            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On my return last night I found both your letters. I found also letters from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> telling me that his Spanish Prizes were taken two days too soon – ‘they are now by
                  some extraordinary act given to indemnify the merchants who suffered when Spain laid
                  the embargo – so much for my 2000£!’ – This at least is what the W. Indian agents
                  say. Many officers have received part of their shares in advance – &amp; cannot repay
                  the money. This luckily is not <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</a> case.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In December 1804, the naval ship HMS Amelia, of which Thomas Southey was a lieutenant,
                           had captured the Spanish brig Isabella and the ship Conception, both laden with wine
                           and brandy, and the ship Commerce, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers
                           to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict,
                           but because these ships had been captured before war was officially declared, the
                           prize money was being withheld. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share
                           reinstated.</span></div>
                  </div> But I do not believe that Government <span class="strikethrough">xx x xxxxxxx xxxxx</span> can have resolved to reimburse the merchants by robbing the sailors, tho there was
                  a paragraph in the Courier stating that the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx xxx</span> frigates which were captured so villainously were to be so disposed of. The Courier
                  is a rascally paper, but if I find there be really good grounds for supposing that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Toms</a> prize money is to be made away with in this unprecedented manner, I believe I can
                  get the Courier to take the matter up, &amp; will certainly make as much noise as possibly
                  about the rascality of robbing the navy.

                           it was his influence that caused The Courier to publish a paragraph supporting the
                           sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday 24 August 1805. This was followed by
                           a longer defence of their position in The Courier on 31 August 1805 under the title
                           ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</span></div>
