The success of this work prompted Macpherson to publish two epic poems, <em>Fingal</em> (1762) and <em>Temora</em> (1763), which he claimed were translations of works by a 3rd century bard named Ossian.
               Controversy about the authenticity of the poems emerged when the original manuscripts
               could not be located, and after Macpherson’s death it became evident that although
               some legitimate manuscript sources were used, the poems had principally been written
               by him. A committee had been established to investigate the controversy and published
               its findings in 1805. Southey reviewed several works on this topic in the <em>Annual Review for 1805</em>, 4 (1806): Malcolm Laing (1762–1818; <em>DNB</em>), <em>The Poems of Ossian, Containing the Poetical Works of James Macpherson in Prose and
