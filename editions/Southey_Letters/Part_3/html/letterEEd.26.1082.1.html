                  the story. There exists a sonnet, in old Portugueze, attributed to a Portugueze Infante,
                  addressed to Vasco Lobeira, as author of ‘Amadis,’ and objecting to this very part.

               <p>5. Gomes Eannes de Zurara, librarian to the King of Portugal, and keeper of the archives,
                  in a chronicle written 1463, sixty years after Lobeira’s death, has this decisive
                  passage: — ‘Many authors, being desirous to lengthen their works, fill up their books
                  by relating how princes passed their time in banquettings and games and revels, from
                  which nothing followed except their own diversion; as in the ancient feats of England,
                  which is called Great Britain, and in the book of “Amadis,” though that was made wholly
                  at the pleasure of a man called Vasco Lobeira, in the time of King D. Fernando, all
                  the things in the said book being feigned by the author.’

               <p>In reply to these arguments and this testimony, it is said that D’Herberay and Tressan
                  speak of certain originals in the Picard language. Neither of these authors speak
                  decisively. The one says, ‘he remembered such manuscripts which he <span class="ital">thought</span> might be the originals;’ the other, that ‘he <span class="ital">thought</span> he had seen such among Queen Christina’s collection in the Vatican.’

                           of Amadis (4 vols. (London, 1803), I, pp. 3–4. He refers to Nicolas de Herberay des
                           Essarts (d. ca. 1557), a Picardy-born translator ofAmadis into French (1540–1548);
                           Louis-Élisabeth de la Vergne de Tressan (1705–1783), also a translator of Amadis into
                           French (1779). Both French translators claimed an earlier, Picard original for the
                           romance. The possible location of the manuscript was in the collection in the Vatican
                           archives assembled by Christina (1626–1689), Queen regnant of Sweden from 1633 to

                  </div> These authorities are of little weight. Such manuscripts, however, may probably have
                  existed, and are easily accounted for. The daughter of Joam I. who knighted Vasco
                  Lobeira, married Philip the Good of Burgundy.

                  </div> What more probable than that this Infanta (for all the family were learned and were
                  patrons of learning) should have taken to her husband’s court the romance which was
                  the delight of her father’s, and that it should have been translated to please her?
                  The Picard version, therefore, if it could be produced, would not invalidate Lobeira’s
                  claim.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">On these grounds I shall think myself justified in asserting, in the literary History
               of Portugal, that Vasco Lobeira is the author of ‘Amadis of Gaul,’ the most celebrated
               of the prose romances, and the best.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have thus defended my opinion, because, unless I mistake, one of the Reviews in
                  question was written by a gentleman for whose talents I have the highest respect,
                  whose knowledge of chivalrous literature exceeds mine, and with whom I would not venture
                  to break a spear any where except on my own ground.
