               <p>By this <span class="strikethrough">x</span> days post I have received a letter from M<sup>r</sup> Sotheby.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>William Sotheby (1757–1833; DNB), the poet and translator, had been considering renting
                           the Peacheys’ summer residence on Derwent Isle, Derwentwater.</span></div>
                  </div> The offer of so delightful a summer residence tempted him, he says, hugely, – &amp; he
                  seems to have taken a long while before he could resolve to say that circumstances
                  forced him not to avail himself of an offer so peculiarly grateful to him. Of course
                  had I heard sooner from him, you should have heard sooner from me. – I like his society
                  well, – he is an able, very well informed, &amp; very judicious man; – but I am desired
                  to tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyEmma">M<sup>rs</sup> Peachy</a> that the inhabitants of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</a> are not disposed to like any faces upon the Island so well as those which they have
                  been accustomed to see there; &amp; if the Sothebys had come there, I should very often
                  have wished for that band of dumb musicians, who, in the absence of that incomparable
                  leader <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</a>, were pleased to be under the directions of so <span class="strikethrough">poor a per</span> &lt;<span class="strikethrough">&amp; xxx</span> humble&gt; a performer as myself.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am less inclined to pity your disappointment than that of the Officer with whom
                  you were to have exchanged. You know I am no admirer of Ireland, or rather of the
                  Irish. And it is the last country in the world in which (according to my feelings)
                  an Englishman would like to live in <span class="strikethrough">p</span> time of peace, or to serve during actual war. During actual war, which is very likely
                  to happen there, – if he took prisoners he would have to hang them after the battle;
                  – &amp; if were taken himself, it is likely enough that he might be served like poor Cookes
                  of Trinity, – who was tied between two planks &amp; thrown into a fire. You know my sentiments
                  about Catholick emancipation &amp; indeed about granting any further indulgence to the
                  Catholicks. Those sentiments are not likely to make me look unfavourably upon the
                  conduct of the present ministry towards Ireland. But I must say that if they wished
                  to insult the Irish Catholicks in the most wanton manner, &amp; to drive them into rebellion,
                  they could not have taken more effectual means <span class="strikethrough">for xxxxx</span> than by appointing D<sup>r</sup> Duigenan

                  </div> at Exeter, for this sufficient reason; that when I was at Exeter I had never heard
                  of her. My information was collected in Staffordshire, first, but afterwards from
                  about fifty shillings worth of her works, – a part of which you may have noticed on
                  my shelves thus lettered on the back Quant: suff: of Joanna Southcote. The three volumes
                  however did not prove to be Quant: suff: &amp; I sent for a farther cargo. The whole rubbish
                  will soon disappear – a friend of mine near London is curious to possess the collection,
                  &amp; as I have raked the dunghill, it is now at his service, &amp; will be sent off to him
                  in a few days.

                  been contented with mere enquiries, but would have gone to her, seen the Pythoness
                  herself, &amp; heard her oracles delivered – In London I could not visit her, after having
                  spoken so decidedly upon the subject – because one of her four &amp; twenty elders happened

                  excellent mans time is given up to this crazy beldame, – I should most probably have
                  met him at her house, &amp; had no inclination to expose myself to the vituperative eloquence
                  of one, who according to her own minutes of the conference fairly ‘down-argued’ the
