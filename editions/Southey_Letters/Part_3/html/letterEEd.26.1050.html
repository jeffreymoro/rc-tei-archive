               are some parts of the story which rhyme would very much embellish &amp; others which it
               would ruin. However your opinion of the experiment will weigh with me. Tell me if
               the rhyme surprizes you when you find it, or if you feel at a fault when you lose
               it.</p>

               <p>There are about 600 lines more written but uncorrected. they do not require so much
                  alteration as this first part because there is more of passion in them &amp; dramatic
                  character. If I get thro them to my liking they will set me off. &amp; I may perhaps fall
                  to in earnest &amp; run thro the poem. You know my plan to exhibit all the fit mythologies
                  in this form. After this there will remain the Runic the old Persian. The classical
                  – which may be considered almost as new ground so little have its recondite parts
                  been brought forward, &amp; perhaps the Japanese, the Jewish as romanceified by the Rabbis,
                  &amp; the Catholic in all its glory. – It is however somewhat discouraging to think that <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> more is to be got for a Farce than I can hope for half a dozen such poems as Thalaba.
