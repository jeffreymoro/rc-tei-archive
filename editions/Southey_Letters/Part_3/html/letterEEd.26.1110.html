            <p class="indent1">You will wonder at my long silence. the fact is that I have been either living out
               of doors, or in a crowd of company for the last three months. This morning I set out
               with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> for Edinburgh, within three weeks I shall return, &amp; shut myself up for the winter.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Ask <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DavyHumphry">Davy</a> for me whether bones burnt under ground in quick-lime are as good a manure as pounded
                  bones, or if they lose any thing by being so consumed. You will perceive that if the
                  mechanical labour can be thus saved, it would be of much consequence. I shall be glad
                  to receive an answer to this query, that I may transmit it into Devonshire to the
                  querist.

               Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated in <em>The Courier</em> which published a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday
               24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’. A ‘reply
               from a Spanish merchant’ appeared in <em>The Courier</em> for 6 September 1805. Southey’s response, that the prize money was being withheld
               from the sailors in a measure that was ‘impolitic, ungenerous and unjust’ was published
               in <em>The Courier</em> of 25 September 1805, p. 2. This was refuted by an editorial article in <em>The Courier</em> of 28 September 1805, where it was stated that there was no truth in Southey’s assertion.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
