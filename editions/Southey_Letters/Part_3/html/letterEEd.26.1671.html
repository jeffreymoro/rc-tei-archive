            <p class="indent1">I can wish you nothing better than that your life may be as long, your age as hale
               &amp; your death as easy as your fathers. The death of a parent is a more awful sorrow
               than that of a child, – but <span class="strikethrough">x</span> a less painful <span class="strikethrough">x</span> one, – it is in the inevitable order &amp; right course of nature that ripe fruit should
               fall; – it seems like one of its mishaps when the green bud is cut off. In the outward
               &amp; visible system of things nothing is wasted, – it would &lt;therefore&gt; be belying the
               whole system to believe that intellect &amp; love, – which are of all things the best,
               could perish. I have a strong &amp; lively faith in a state of continued consciousness
               from this stage of existence, – &amp; that we shall recover the consciousness of some
               lower stages thro which we may previously &lt;have&gt; past seems to me not improbable.
               The supposition serves for dreams &amp; systems, – the belief is a possession more precious
               than any other. I love life, &amp; can thoroughly enjoy it, – but if to exist were but
               a lifehold property, I am doubtful whether I should think the lease worth holding.
               It would be better never to have been than ever to cease to be.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Still I shall hope for your coming. You would at any rate have been inconveniently
               late for the Highlands, for which as near Midsummer as possible is the best season.
               September is the best for this country.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been made to do what has proved to be a foolish thing. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a> wrote to me to say that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</a> had a great wish to serve me, &amp; that he Scott had been commissioned by him to find
                  out in what manner it might be done conformably to my inclinations. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</a> was here at the time, – I told him of this &amp; he advised me to ask for the Stewardship
                  of the Derwentwater Estates which will soon be vacated by death. Upon this I wrote
                  to Scott &amp; also to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a>,

                  seem in that respect to have been framed upon the system of M. Helvetius.
