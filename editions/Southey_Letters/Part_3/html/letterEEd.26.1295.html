                  I hope will be this summer. This is the last trouble you will have with what has given
                  you more trouble than sits easy upon my conscience. I cannot tell you what a comfort
                  it is to me to feel that I have pitched my tent &amp; I am not sorry that the ousting
                  of all the Talents will take away the only grounds on which every one &lt;belonging to
                  me&gt; could blame my resolution.

                  I lay down the pen almost too often &amp; take up the spade – which it is true I do not
