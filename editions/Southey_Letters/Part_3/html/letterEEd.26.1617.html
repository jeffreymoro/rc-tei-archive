            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A ridiculous disorder, called the Mumps, has nearly gone through the house, and visited
               me in its way, – a thing which puts one more out of humour than out of health; but
               my neck has now regained its elasticity, and I have left off the extra swathings which
               yesterday buried my chin, after the fashion of fops a few years ago.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>During the half year from November to May, my time passes on with such a happy uniformity,
                  that were it not for an occasional cold, a visit from the mumps, or some other such
                  interruption, time would glide by without anything by which it could be remembered;
                  and when summer came, I should almost be surprised at finding that winter was gone.
                  Never, certainly, did man lead a life more after his heart’s desire, than it is my
                  good fortune to enjoy. My first volume is nearly half printed.
