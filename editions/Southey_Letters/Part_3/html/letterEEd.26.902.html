                  visible signs of friendship, and to know that a set of fellows whom you do not care
                  for and ought not to care for, boast every where of your intimacy, and with good reason,
                  to the heat of their understanding. You have accustomed yourself to talk affectionately,
                  and write affectionately, to your friends, till the expressions of affection flow
                  by habit in your conversation, and in your letters, and pass for more than they are
                  worth; the worst of all this is, that your letters will one day rise up in judgment

                  my eyes and look about me to see if I were not deceived: perhaps I am too intolerant
                  to these kind of phrases; but, indeed, when they are true, they may be excused, and

                  loathes anything like froth. There is a something outlandish in saying them, more
                  akin to a French embrace than an English shake by the hand, and I would have you leave
                  off saying them to those whom you actually do love, that if this should not break
                  off the habit of applying them to indifferent persons, the disuse may at least make
                  a difference. Your feelings go naked, I cover mine with a bear-skin; I will not say
                  that you harden yours by your mode, but I am sure that mine are the warmer for their
                  clothing. . . . . . . . It is possible, or probable, that I err as much as you in
                  an opposite extreme, and may make enemies where you would make friends; but there
                  is a danger that you may sometimes excite dislike in persons of whose approbation
                  you would yourself be desirous. You know me well enough to know in what temper this
                  has been written, and to know that it has been some exertion; for the same habit which
                  makes me prefer sitting silent to offering contradiction, makes me often withhold
                  censure when, perhaps, in strictness of moral duty, it ought to be applied. The medicine
                  might have been sweetened perhaps; but, dear Coleridge, take the simple bitters, and
                  leave the sweetmeats by themselves.</p>
