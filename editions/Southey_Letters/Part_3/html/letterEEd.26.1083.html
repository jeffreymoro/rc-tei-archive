               <p>It is so very possible that I might by play writing get five hundred a year, with
                  less labour than it now costs me to get one, that I do not in conscience think it
                  a sufficient excuse <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> either to others or to myself to say that I cannot write a good play, especially when
                  a bad one will answer the main end as well. Lewis’s offer

                           met when they were both pupils at Westminster School. Lewis had suggested that Southey
                           should write a play which he would promote at the Covent Garden Theatre to ensure
                           it was well received; see Southey to Peter Elmsley, 10 July 1805, Letter 1081.</span></div>
                  </div> – for which I am very much obliged to him, would remove some very weighty objections,
                  – the fretting vexations of a green-room negotiation, &amp; the chance of hostility from
                  some of those persons whose goose language is very inoffensive upon paper, but would
                  be very mischievous when delivered viva voce at the theatre. I will therefore <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> thankfully accept his offer, &amp; seriously &amp; resolutely set myself to work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have asked <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> to refer to Diodorus Siculus for me, for what is there said of a Pythoness who eloped
                  with a young Thessalian. This may be connected with the Pythian games, &amp; with the
                  invasion of the temple by the Gauls or Persians, &amp; worked up into a fine spectacle
                  of Grecian costume.

                           the story of the Pythoness. The Pythia was the title given to the priestess of Apollo
                           at Delphi, who was famous for her prophecies, uttered under the influence of vapours
                           rising from the earth. The priestess was originally always a young virgin, but after
                           Echecrates the Thessalian kidnapped and raped the incumbent, the priestess was always
                           chosen from among old women. Because of its wealth and influence Delphi was a regular
