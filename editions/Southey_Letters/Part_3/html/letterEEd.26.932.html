            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have a daughter whose name is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</a>, born last night. at four in the afternoon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> lay down as usual to take a nap. at half after five she awoke feeling herself unwell.
               at half after eight she was obliged to retire to her room, &amp; before ten my daughter
               very considerately made her appearance, knowing I did not like to be kept up late.
               They are both doing well. the young one is very large &amp; so hideously ugly that I think
               she would look better in a bottle than a bed.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</a> says <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> you expect to <span class="ital">clear</span> my books. I do not comprehend what the phrase means for it smelleth of the Custom
               House, but it gives me hope for I have been groaning in spirit about those books,
               which are exactly those which I now most want. Send them off as soon as ever you can
               recover them, if such good fortune should befall me.</p>

                  </div> this has been delayed thus long merely because I have been for the last month in expectation
