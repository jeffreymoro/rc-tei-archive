               <p>My fear about <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> has been considerably strengthened – if indeed I ought not rather to say confirmed
                  – by a paragraph in a country paper, which noticing the death of the Master of the
                  Galatea in the attempt to cut out the <span class="ital">Lydia</span>, says that the first Lieutenant fell also.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Thomas Southey’s ship, HMS Galatea, a fifth-rate 32-gun frigate, had, on 14 August
                           1804 1804, made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer General Ernouf
                           (formerly the British sloop of war Lilly) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of
                           the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that
                           his brother was among the dead. Thomas did hold the rank of first lieutenant, but
                           was absent from the raid because he had been placed under arrest.</span></div>
                  </div> I do not give full credit to this account, because it says the Surgeon was killed
                  – who of course could not have been in the action but what makes it credible is that
                  private letters from the ship should have reached England &amp; yet none for me. Your
                  brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHenry">Harry</a> can easily ascertain this at the Admiralty. Surely they must by this time know whether <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> the first Lieutenant be killed or not. The probabilities are very much on the wrong
                  side. I know he would be in the danger, both by choice &amp; by necessity, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> had he escaped it I know he would have written by the first opportunity – I re<span class="strikethrough">ac</span>lied more upon your letter than it now seems to warrant. the first Lieutenant might
                  have been mentioned in the account you saw, when your eye was in search of his name.
                  Make for me a second enquiry. the official accounts must have arrived as the affair
                  took place three months ago. Unless the letter which you saw particularized the other
                  officers who fell, we have no reason to infer from its silence that my brother has
                  escaped. The newspaper account, which must have come from a private letter also, is
                  positive in its assertion.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I had many things to say, but this unfortunate subject harrasses me too much. that
               it is as I fear there can be little doubt – still in these cases one clings to possibilities
               fooling oneself with hope.</p>
