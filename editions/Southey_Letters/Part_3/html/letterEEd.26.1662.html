                  I believe do little more at first, but if it be good for any thing it will have its
                  day of sale at last. It is not worth booksellers while to purchase &lt;copy-right&gt; in
                  hopes of a joyful resurrection, – but it is worth mine to keep it in that hope. –
                  And for the old plan of sharing, – as there is no risque on the booksellers part,
                  there is no good reason why I should not take the whole profits to myself little as
                  they will be, – especially as I have been offered any advance of money necessary for
                  such a purpose, from two quarters,–from either of which such an offer may be accepted
                  without reluctance. The only question therefore seems to be in what form to print.

               a prospect) prove successful, it will make a material difference in my literary occupations.
               I should be relieved from the necessity of any employment which is not perfectly congenial
               to my own wishes &amp; aspirations, &amp; should without interruption pursue the great historical
