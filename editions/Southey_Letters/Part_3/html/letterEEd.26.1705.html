                  </div> F. is a native of this country. One of our country gentlemen (a very remarkable &amp;
                  strong headed man) who was his school fellow &amp; knows his person as well as you know
                  mine, told me, that about five or six years ago, as he was walking near his own house
                  with his daughter he saw two gentlemen riding towards him, &amp; recognized one of them
                  time enough to say to his daughter look at this man – it is F. C., – &amp; also to consider
                  that it would be better not to speak to him, – which he was on the point of doing.
                  There was a dog with the horsemen, – &amp; presently afterwards some boys came along who
                  had picked up a collar bearing the name of F. C.s father.

               <p>The question which you discuss respecting the means of civilizing savage tribes I
                  shall enter into hereafter in the Quarterly. You will find it advanced in my first
                  volume of Brazil that ‘when man has been degraded to the savage state it is only by
                  priestcraft that he has ever yet been reclaimed! – &amp; that no nation has ever yet emerged
                  from a savage state till it had a regular priesthood! –’

                  </div> There is one other mode of civilization which is possible – that of force, according
                  to the Roman plan, – but it is more expensive, less sure in its operation, &amp; there
                  is no government which would undertake it. It only <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> remains therefore to make what we can of the Missionaries. About the Bible I could
                  say much &amp; will say it in an article at some future time respecting the Bible Society;
                  – suffice it now to state that I do not dream of representing Xtianity as an <span class="ital">historical religion</span>, but as a <span class="ital">perpetual revelation</span>, the strong ground upon which all enthusiasts proceed<span class="strikethrough">x</span>.</p>
