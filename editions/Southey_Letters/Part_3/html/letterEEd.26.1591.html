                  numerous of the old Brazilian tribes. As I was about to write to you on the subject
                  of the map I thought it worth while to put the sheet in, not for the sake of franking
                  it (for they all go back under cover to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> the M P. – )</p>

                  no business) for the sake of increasing the scale? – I will correct as many of these
                  names as I can, &amp; the return of the map, – <span class="strikethrough">thxx xxx</span> that they may be inserted in my outline; – it will <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> be easier then to add the rest. But it must travel to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a>, for his mss. maps will enable him to correct many <span class="strikethrough">which</span> more than I can do. – The different tribes must be marked in their situations – how
                  will it be best to distinguish them? a + will be the fit mark for a Missionary settlement.
                  Maps of the several Captainships <span class="strikethrough">x xxx</span> &lt;had better&gt; not be given, unless I could give <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> all – &amp; how many <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> has I do not know.
