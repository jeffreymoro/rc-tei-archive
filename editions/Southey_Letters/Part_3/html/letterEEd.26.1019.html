                           ‘Matthew of Westminster’ records a story from the town of Colewiz in Saxony, where,
                           in the year 1012, the priest of the church of Magnus Martyr cursed a group of revellers
                           so that they were compelled to continue singing and dancing without pause for a year.
                           For a translation, see Matthew of Westminster, The Flowers of History, 2 vols (London,
                           1853), I, p. 502.</span></div>

                  tell how to relate it, that is at what point of time to begin –, for I should like
                  best to make the ballad of a terrific character which might be easily done. There
                  is a story in the Pia Hilaria how St James of Nisibis made some &lt;young&gt; women old

                           superstitions, some in verse, compiled by Angelin Gazet (1568–1653). Southey owned
                           the two volume London edition of 1657. The story of St James of Nisibis (died c. AD
                           338), a saint of the Syriac church, appears on pages 353–355.</span></div>

                  at some leisure time may very possibly produce a whole batch. The Old Woman of Berkeley
