                           France. His disputes with Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh and 2nd Marquess of
                           Londonderry (1769–1822; DNB) led to a plan to expel Castlereagh from the War Office,
                           but when Castlereagh discovered the plan he challenged Canning to a duel. This took
                           place on 21 September 1809, and though both men survived, but there was much public
                           outrage over their behaviour.</span></div>

                           to discontinue trade with Britain, in line with his plan to exclude British ships
                           and commerce from continental Europe. This pressure led to public manifestos by both
                           countries in support of Napoleon’s policy. Canning, in his capacity as Foreign Secretary,
                           replied to the Russian manifesto in a state paper.</span></div>

               Londonderry (1769–1822; <em>DNB</em>) led to a plan to expel Castlereagh from the War Office, but when Castlereagh discovered
               the plan he challenged Canning to a duel. This took place on 21 September 1809, and

               and commerce from continental Europe. This pressure led to public manifestos by both
