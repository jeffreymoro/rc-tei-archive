               of Anjou (b. c. 1138). Dafydd was imprisoned by Llewelyn in 1197 and then driven out

               Southey contributed a paragraph to <em>The Courier</em> of Saturday 24 August 1805, arguing that the sailors deserved to receive the money.
               This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note18_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
