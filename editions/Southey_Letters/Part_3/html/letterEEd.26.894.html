I wanted <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> to have written the whole reviewal, for it was more his <span class="ital">call</span> than mine – but in vain. he delayed me week after week, &amp; at last sent me only a few
                  notes which I have inserted, &amp; which you may distinguish by a difference of texture.
                  his language is more technically argumentative, &amp; his sentences are rounded, whereas
                  mine are pointed – &amp; poisoned into the bargain. I have not said enough – having been
                  hurried in consequence of his delay, but however the blow is a hard one. time was
                  ‘that when the brains were out, the man would die’

                  </div> – Malthus however is safe from that kind of death. the ground I have taken is this
                  – that he supposes lust to be like hunger an appetite of physical necessity when he
                  argues against <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Godwin</a>, that when he proposes his own damned plan he founds it upon the possibility of moral
                  restraint, &amp; the practical virtue of chastity – ergo the scorpion strikes his tail
                  into his own head – the end of his book confuting the beginning. that half his book
                  is altogether superfluous – &amp; that if his propositions respecting population be true
                  they prove the very evils in society for which he apologizes – for if a country be
                  overstocked before it be half peopled <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> in proportion to its power of production, the fault lies in a bad system of society,
                  not in the system of Nature. M<sup>r</sup> Malthus therefore is cast in his action against God Almighty. I have shown also that
                  the perfect system on his plan would be to breed slaves &amp; regulate population by the
                  knife of the sow-gelder. If he replies to any effect I will gibbet him in a pamphlet,
                  &amp; draw &amp; quarter him, for I have something of the same sense of strength in me in
                  reference to this dog that Milton must have had when he made minced meat of Salmasius.
