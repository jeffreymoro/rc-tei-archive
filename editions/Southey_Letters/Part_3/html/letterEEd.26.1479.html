                  all which I am capable of doing. The plain reason I cannot afford to write poetry
                  has a mercenary sound with it; unless it be explained that it is not the love of money
                  but the necessity of subsisting which is implied: &amp; tho I cannot prevent unjust criticisms
                  from impeding the sale of my books, yet if they prevent me from writing altogether,
                  &amp; &lt;so&gt; cut off the palm-head of my future fame, that is my own fault. I will therefore
                  go on strenuously. When a poem is compleated, if I can get a fair price for it, according
                  to the ordinary trade-price of labour, well &amp; good. If not, the MS. shall lie by &amp;
                  be left for my children, &amp; I will accumulate something for them in this shape, which
                  will produce its value <span class="strikethrough">when</span> after my death. And while the present unjust laws of copy-right exist, I believe this
                  will be the wisest plan which a man, who <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> does not <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> level himself down to the fashion of the times, can possibly pursue. I am now proceeding
