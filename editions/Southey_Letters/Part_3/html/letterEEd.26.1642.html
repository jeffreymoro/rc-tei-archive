            <p class="indent1">I know not what you will say to me about the Carpet. There is a manufactory of them
               here, – where you have of course better choice &amp; get them cheaper, – but <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> must take the whole piece. This as I found one which pleased me much I thought it
               best to do – so I have sent off 64 ½ yards – being 13 ½ more than my commission, –
               but this I know be enough for the wing bed-room, –- or you may now carpet the parlour
               &amp; cut up the study-carpet for yours &amp; the spare-room, – just as you think best. 3–6<sup>d</sup> a yard, – a difference more than adequate to the carriage. The whole damage has been
               £11. 5 – which has left me so poor that I am afraid <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edaw</a> must wait for her silver knife. Will you believe it – I can neither get nine pins
               nor map of England here! – these however I have no doubt of finding at Newcastle.</p>

                           Annual Review for 1808, 7 (1809), 224–235. Zouch married his second wife, Margaret

                  </div> with whom we dined yesterday, was a bride last year after a courtship of five &amp; forty
                  years, – &amp; she talked to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMaryHarriet">Mary</a> about the awkwardness which she felt after making her appearance here! – Dr Z. is
                  one of the most gentle-minded men I ever saw. He has been deaf from his childhood,
                  &amp; seems now to be recovering his hearing.</p>

               from hence about nine tomorrow, &amp; weather permitting &amp; God willing should reach home
               not later than Thursday – you will either hear from me or see me then. Don’t scold
               me about the carpet – we wanted one for the wing room &amp; it was as well now as a few
               months hence when we must have paid dearer &amp; could not have got any thing so pretty
               – It went off for Newcastle last night, &amp; may not impossibly arrive at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> as soon as I shall. I shall be glad to get home, tho as comfortable here as I can

               for money, – because they feared it was not in safe hands. Their main speculations
               have answered remarkably well – that I know, – &amp; I know also that they speculate less
               than any other great publishers.</p>
