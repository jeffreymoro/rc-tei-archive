               <p>The box is safely arrived. some of the smaller books have rubbed against each other
                  &amp; suffered great excoriation in consequence, the larger &amp; valuable part have luckily

            <p class="indent1">In all the letters to me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</a> has expressed a full &amp; proper sense of your very kind &amp; very friendly attention to
               him. Towards women I suspect that his attachments are not very lasting; – his friendships,
               as they are better founded seem to me more durable. I had good opportunity of seeing
               him thoroughly in the course of the three summers &amp; autumns which he past, at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>. A little too much inclination for pleasure, a little too high a value for worldly
               fortune, are his obvious faults, &amp; as far as I could perceive, his only ones. Of the
               first time will cure him. the second lies deeper, &amp; tho this might contribute under
               favourable circumstances to make <span class="strikethrough">his</span> a shining character, it <span class="strikethrough">would I fear prevent him from becoming</span> &lt;never can exist in&gt; a great one. I recognised in him many parts of my own natural
               character, – a quickness of perception which makes a man speak rapidly &amp; listen impatiently,
               – &amp; a reluctance to continuous study, which I have rather compromised than cured,
               by contriving to do many things at once, &amp; so finding variety in going from one to
               the other.</p>

                  score of his acquaintance with me and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a>. His history is not a very sane one since that time, &amp; not a very fortunate one.
                  He is at this time surveying this land of lakes with the intention of making a book
                  about it.

                  </div> partly occasioned by the very severe duty which fell upon him during the winter &amp;
                  spring. The ship was badly manned, &amp; the men she had on board were almost all landsmen;
                  he thought it more than probable that she would be lost for want of hands. There was
                  no master – one of the Lieutenants was ill, &amp; the other &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> were obliged to watch &amp; watch. This incessant labour &amp; still more the incessant anxiety
                  with which it was accompanied, every thing falling upon him as first Lieutenant, with
                  the help of wintry weather &amp; incessant gales fairly knocked him up, he having been
                  broken in to a tropical climate. His old complaint (hæmorrhoids) came on him with
                  great violence, &amp; he has been obliged to declare himself unfit for service at present,
                  &amp; to require the Captain to order his state of health to be examined; – for the Captain
                  would have worked him to death without remorse, being one of the very worst men in
                  the navy. Ill as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> was this fellow abused the surgeon for putting him on the sick list, &amp; declared that
                  if the surgeon had said he was capable of duty he would have made him do it. However
                  there are some limits to this sort of tyranny. he could not refuse what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> demanded. the Physician of the fleet, &amp; the Hospital Surgeons have declared it necessary
                  for him to go to the country to recruit, &amp; by this I <span class="strikethrough">expect</span> suppose he is at Taunton, where he will rest awhile before he proceeds here. All this
                  is very important: we must not however overlook the good in it. had the Captain been
                  sensible of the value of such an Officer, &amp; paid him that respect to which he is entitled,
                  &amp; has been accustomed, I have no doubt that he would have gone on, till perhaps no
                  rest could have been of any avail.</p>
