            <p class="indent1">Make your writing books in foolscap quarto &amp; write <span class="strikethrough">onl</span> on only one side of a leaf; draw a line down the margin, marking off space enough
               for your references, which should be given at the end of every paragraph, – <span class="strikethrough">min</span> noting page, book or chapter of the author referred to. This minuteness is now demanded,
               &amp; you will yourself find it useful, for in transcribing, or in correcting proofs it
               is often requisite to turn to the original authority. Take the best author, that is
               to say the one who has written most at length of all the original authors upon the
               particular point of time on which you are employed; – &amp; draw up your account from
               him, – then on the opposite page correct &amp; amplify this from every other who has written
               upon the same subject, this page should be divided into two columns, one of about
               two thirds of <span class="strikethrough">th</span> its breadth, the other the remaining one; – you are thus enabled to <span class="ital">add</span> to your <span class="ital">additions</span>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">One of these books you should have for your geography, – that is to say for collecting
               descriptions of all the principal scenes of action, – which must be done from books
               of travels – their situation, their strength, their previous history, – &amp; in the notes
               their present state. These descriptions you can insert in their proper place when
               you transcribe. Thus also you should collect accounts of the different tribes &amp; Dynasties
               whom you have occasion to mention. In this manner the information which is only to
               be got at piece meal, &amp; oftentimes incidentally when you are looking for something
               else, – is brought together with least trouble, &amp; almost imperceptibly.</p>
            <p class="indent1">All relative matter, not absolutely essential to the subject, should go in the form
               of supplementary notes, &amp; these you may make as amusing as you please, the more so
               &amp; the more curious the better. Much trouble is saved by writing them on separate bits
               of paper, each the half of a quarter of a foolscap sheet, numbering them, &amp; making
               an index of them; – in this manner they are ready for use when they are wanted.</p>

               <p>It was sometime before I fell into this system of book-keeping, &amp; I believe no better
                  can be desired. A Welsh Triad might comprehend all the rules for style, say what you
                  have to say as <span class="ital">perspicuously</span> as possible, as <span class="ital">briefly</span> as possible, &amp; as <span class="ital">rememberably</span> as possible, &amp; take no other thought about it.
