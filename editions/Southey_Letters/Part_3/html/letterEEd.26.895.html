               <div class="salute">Dear Grosvenor</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have seen a sight more dreamy &amp; cheerful than any scenery that fancy ever yet devised
               for Faery Land. – We had walked down to the Lake side, it was a delightful day, the
               sun shining, &amp; a few white clouds hanging motionless in the sky. the opposite shore
               of Derwent water consists of one long mountain which suddenly terminates in an arch
               – thus [a large ‘u’ shape drawn here] – &amp; thro that opening you see a long valley
               between mountains, &amp; bounded by mountain beyond mountain – to the right of this arch
               the heights are more varied &amp; of greater elevation. Now as there was not a breath
               of air stirring, the surface of the Lake was so perfectly still that it became one
               great mirror, &amp; all its water disappeared. the whole line of shore was represented
               as vividly &amp; steadily as it existed in its actual being – the arch – the vale within
               – the single houses far within the vale – the smoke from their chimneys – the farthest
               hills – &amp; the shadow &amp; substance joined at their bases so indivisibly that you could
               make no separation even with your judgement. As I stood on the shore Heaven &amp; the
               Clouds seemed lying under me I was looking down into the sky, &amp; the whole range of
               mountains having one line of summits under my feet, &amp; another above me seemed to be
               suspended between two firmaments. Shut your eyes &amp; dream of a scene so unnatural &amp;
               so beautiful. What I have said is most strictly &amp; scrupulously true – but it was one
               of those happy moments that can seldom occur, for the least breath stirring would
               have shaken the whole vision &amp; at once unrealized it. I have before seen a partial
               appearance, but never before did, &amp; perhaps never again may lose sight of the Lake
               entirely – for it literally seemed like an abyss of sky below me – not fog &amp; clouds
               as from a mountain – but the blue heaven spotted with a few fleecy pillows of cloud,
               that looked placed there for Angels to rest upon them.</p>

                           intended as a companion work to George Ellis, Specimens of the Early English Poets
                           (1790; 2nd edn 1801; 3rd edn 1803).</span></div>

                  Poets good bad &amp; indifferent, with specimens of each – except the dramatic writers.
                  If this take place it will cost me a journey to London &amp; a months hard work there
                  – the main part can be done here. You know Ellis’s book of course – &amp; if you do not

                  my obligation for assistance to my friend Mr G. C. Bedford &amp;c – in the preface, &amp;
                  perhaps find some amusement in the task. So tell you me your Lordships pleasure, &amp;

                  in the pursuit it may prove really a good prescription. By doing something to assist
