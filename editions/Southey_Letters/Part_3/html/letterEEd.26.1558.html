            <p class="indent1">An unavoidable accident made my parcel ten minutes too late for this days coach, –
               which would have conveyed it to you on Friday; – &amp; in consequence you cannot now receive
               it before Monday.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have found it impossible to include more than the Indian mission &amp; controversy in
                  one article.

                  </div> You will find a decided opinion in its favour, but by no means an unqualified approbation
                  of the Missionaries, tho there is a fair testimony borne to their merits. The political
                  objections are fairly met &amp; to the best of my judgement fairly refuted, – nor has
                  that judgement been either lightly or lately taken up. Having thoroughly studied,
                  &amp; actually half written the history of the Portgueze in Asia my opinion is the result
                  of a wider knowledge of the Hindoos than has fallen to the share of the Anti-Missioners.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The remaining missions will furnish two articles of some twelve or fourteen pages
                  each, &amp; of a very different character from this argumentative one – One will relate
                  to the South Sea Islands, the other to South Africa.

                  </div> In these I propose to give the history of what has been done, speculate upon what
                  should be done, &amp; collect &amp; arrange the information which is scattered thro the journals.
                  And in one of these I shall compare the Protestant with the Catholic Missionaries.</p>
