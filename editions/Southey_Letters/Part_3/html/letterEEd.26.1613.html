                  – as being days only fit for dogs. I am unlucky &lt;enough&gt; just to know so much of physic
                  as to discover bad symptoms very readily, &amp; there is <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> hardly &lt;a&gt; symptom<span class="strikethrough">s</span> which I cannot refer to some damnd thing or other, &amp; which is most vexatious in that

               my business in six days, do not come till the warm weather, – they have a connection
