                  &amp; provoked, that I do not look on to the arrival of the book with any satisfaction.
                  The sheets which were sent me were full of the most egregious &amp; beastly blunders,
                  – &amp; as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Dapple</a> in spite of my frequent afflictions, never sent me the rest God knows how they may
                  be. I suppose he was afraid I should order more cancels, – but still the book ought
                  not to have been published till I had seen it. nor did I suppose it would till the
                  newspaper told me the thing was done. – You may be sure I will take care of the second
                  edition – if such there should be – myself.
