            <p class="indent1">If you should have heard of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southeys</a> death, &amp; not of his will, you will be in an uneasy state of hope on my account. He
               has left every thing from me. 2000£ in legacies, one estate, which I suspect is a
               large one, to a very distant relation of his mothers, – all the rest to his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">own brother Thomas</a>, who is whole &amp; sole executor, &amp; residuary legatee. From him I received this intelligence
               yesterday evening, in a civil letter, concluding with an invitation to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &amp; me to visit him at the Cottage. Brothers are nearer than Nephews, &amp; the old man
               was right in setting me aside there; – but he should <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> not have given an estate to one almost a stranger, so very remotely related that
               I never heard of him before. However I was a stranger in every thing but blood, &amp;
               certainly do not authorize the Devil to commence a suit against him on my account.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This will vex <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>, because if he had not unaccountably offended the old man, he would have had the
                  property. He is on his way home with the Convoy &amp; may soon be expected.
