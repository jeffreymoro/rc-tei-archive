               <div class="salute">Dear Sir,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The books have just arrived safe. I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have
               taken, and have to regret that it has not more frequently been in my power to practise
               the defensive virtue of smuggling. The duty upon bound books is sixpence per pound
               weight: and his Majesty has received above seventy pounds for what I and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> have brought into his Dominions, so expensive a luxury have our wise rulers resolved
               to make literature!</p>
            <p class="indent1">Should any alarm take place in your neighbourhood consign as many of your family as
               you please to my care, and we will house as many as we can and find house room for
               the rest. I do not myself apprehend any danger. London is indeed threatened by its
               own rabble, and in all overgrown cities the same evil exists, and the same consequences
               may possibly result. But an invading army must perish. I hope they will attempt invasion
               and lose enough by sea to fatten the channel crabs, and enough on shore to furnish
               bones for a monument on Dover Cliffs to be seen from Calais. We also deserve to suffer
               something, and when both nations have smarted, Europe will be at peace, and not till
               then.</p>
