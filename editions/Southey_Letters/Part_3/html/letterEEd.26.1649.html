                           Curwen’s Act, passed in 1809. The act was a significant attempt at parliamentary reform
                           that intended to reduce the sale of seats and the number of government placemen in
                           the House of Commons. The government’s opposition took the form of suggesting modifications
                           that watered down the bill so much that those who had supported it voted against it
                           because it was feared it would stand in the way of proper reform.</span></div>
                  </div> except in its preamble which establishes the principle that seats in parliament ought
                  not to be purchased, will do nothing but mischief, for it leaves the power in the
                  Treasury, – &amp; destroys it every where. A man can not now buy an opposition borough
                  as he was wont to do, – but government can still manage theirs, &amp; pay for them in
                  half a thousand ways, so as effectually to elude the spirit of the act themselves,
                  while they enforce the very letter of it upon their opponents. In like manner that
                  Bill to prevent the sale of places was a mere juggle, &amp; an excellently clever one,
                  – for by making it criminal <span class="strikethrough">either</span> to buy, sell or assist in the sale of any place under government, all persons who
                  offended are provided with means of escaping discovery. It is no longer of any avail
                  to appoint Committees of the House &amp; examine them, – to every question (which before
                  this rascally bill they were obliged to answer) they have now only to reply ‘I must
                  not criminate myself’ – It is a legal answer, – the question cannot be prest. – from
                  this time forward therefore the trade is secured from all possibility of discovery,
                  &amp; this was what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PercevalSpencer">Perceval</a> brought the bill in for. As for Curwen he neither meant harm nor good. He is a hunter
                  after popularity, &amp; merely thought to curry a little by doing something which should
                  be talked about. The more I have seen of him the less have I liked him.</p>
