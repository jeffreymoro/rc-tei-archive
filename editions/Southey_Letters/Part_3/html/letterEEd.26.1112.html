               <p>I need not tell you, my own dear Edith, not to read my letters aloud till you have
                  first of all seen what is written only for yourself. What I have now to say to you
                  is, that having been eight days from home, with as little discomfort, and as little
                  reason for discomfort, as a man can reasonably expect, I have yet felt so little comfortable,
                  so great sense of solitariness, and so many homeward yearnings, that certainly I will
                  not go to Lisbon without you; a resolution which, if your feelings be at all like
                  mine, will not displease you. If, on mature consideration, you think the inconvenience
                  of a voyage more than you ought to submit to, I must be content to stay in England,
                  as on my part it certainly is not worth while to sacrifice a year’s happiness; for,
                  though not unhappy (my mind is too active and too well disciplined to yield to any
                  such criminal weakness), still without you I am not happy. But for your sake as well
                  as my own, and for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">little Edith’s</a> sake, I will not consent to any separation; the growth of a year’s love between her
                  and me, if it please God that she should live, is a thing too delightful in itself,
                  and too valuable in its consequences, both to her and me, to be given up for any light
                  inconveniences either on your part or mine. An absence of a year would make her effectually
                  forget me. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                  talk at leisure; only, dear dear Edith, we must not part. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
