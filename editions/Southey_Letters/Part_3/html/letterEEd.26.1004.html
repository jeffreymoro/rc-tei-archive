            <p class="indent1">In spite of the information your letter contains it is the most welcome one that I
               have received for many a long month. it has this minute reached me – plague on the
               length of time that has elapsed – &amp; must elapse before you can receive the answer.
               I write but these few lines – for we have company whom I expect every instant – to
               tell you to draw on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</a> for thirty pounds if you want it – which you will needs do unless you very speedily
               get an appointment. I wish to God I could say for a larger sum but you know how the
               world stands with me. &amp; this will stop a gap till something better may turn up.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been in much distress about you owing to the affair of the Lilly.

                           1804, made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer General Ernouf
                           (formerly the British sloop of war Lilly) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. 65
                           of the 90 men sent on the mission were killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that
                           his brother was among them because the first lieutenant had been reported as dead,
                           but he was absent from the raid because he had been placed under arrest.</span></div>

                  </div> that the first Lieutenant was killed – I am never in the habit of overhastily believing
                  tidings whether evil or good – the paragraph stated that the Lieutenant of Marines,
                  the Master, Surgeon &amp; thirty men fell also. Hall I thought would have been with you,
                  but it seemed an absurdity to imagine that the Master &amp; the Surgeon should be in the
                  boats.
