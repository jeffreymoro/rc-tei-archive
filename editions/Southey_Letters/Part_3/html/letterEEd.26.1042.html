            <p class="indent1">If Portugal be forced into a war with us, which by the public accounts seems exceedingly
               probable, what will you do? if people leave off Port wine, because they can get none,
               there is a chance that they will not take any other foreign wine, for indeed what
               can be got in its place? – I cannot but think that it would be a very promising speculation
               to manufacture wines for sale, as good as are sometimes made for home consumption.
               Ten pounds sacrificed in experiments would enable one to produce many different flavours,
               &amp; if they were really made good, as they certainly can be – it does not appear improbable
               to me that the person<span class="strikethrough">s</span> who starts upon the plan would find it a very profitable one at present, – still
               more so if the regular wine trade should be so dislocated as it would be by a Portugueze
               war. Almost every foreign wine may be well imitated. <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> black currants will make something <span class="ital">essentially</span> like port, that word is used <span class="strikethrough">when</span> with chemical accuracy as I am convinced that the colouring matter is the same. Enough
               use is not made of flowers in this way. why <span class="ital">only</span> cowslips? – This is worth thinking of, &amp; talking of with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">King</a>. many old beverages may be revived, many new ones by the help of chemistry invented,
               &amp; you would find the pursuit interesting. I could throw out many hints upon the subject
               – but this is enough just now. A common brewing apparatus is all that is necessary.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Instead of sending you news of Madoc now, I must look for <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> news from you. One is going to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southey</a>, an experiment which may take heaven knows how. If he lived more in the world there
               would be no doubt about it, – but he has probably no notion of the rank which literature
               gives in society, &amp; the advantages resulting from it. However the sight of so handsome
               a book may perhaps please him, – &amp; at any rate it is best to try. –</p>

                  world, till I get my history out, of which I look upon the profits as almost certain;
