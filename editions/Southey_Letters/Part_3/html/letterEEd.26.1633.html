               <p>My last letter told you of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herberts</a> danger &amp; of his recovery. You will be a little shocked at the intelligence in this.
                  We lost <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Emma</a> yesterday night. five days ago she was in finer health than we had ever seen her,
                  &amp; I repeatedly remarked it, – for a day or two she had been ailing – on Saturday night
                  breathed shortly &amp; was evidently ill, – yesterday morning was violently sick, &amp; tho
                  she discharged a prodigious quantity of bile by vomiting, was not relieved. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> repeatedly saw her, – thought her better at ten o clock, &amp; assured us he saw no danger,
                  – in half an hour she literally fell asleep without a struggle. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is as well as should be expected, &amp; I perhaps better. You know how I take tooth-ache
                  &amp; tooth drawing, &amp; I have almost learnt to bear moral pain, – not indeed with the
                  same levity, – but with as few outward &amp; visible signs. In fact God be praised thanked
                  for it, there never was a man more who had more entirely set his heart upon things
                  permanent &amp; eternal as I have done; the transitoriness of every thing here is always
                  present to my feelings as well as my understanding, – were I to speak as sincerely
                  of my family as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</a> little girl, my story that I have five children, – three of them at home, – &amp; two

                  the great advantage of being in earnest, as well as thoroughly understanding the subject.
                  Sidney Smith the Ed. Reviewer knew nothing of Hindoo history except what newspapers
