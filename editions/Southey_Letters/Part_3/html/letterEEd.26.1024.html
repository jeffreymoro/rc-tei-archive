            <p class="indent1">Your letter, for the main part, was answered before it was received, so that for that
               matter I have only to thank you for what you have done in it. It never was my opinion
               that the expedition would take place, till the papers <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> positively affirmed it. I cannot think any military man would advise it, knowing
               the state of the Portugueze army, – still less that we should be so mad as to send
               troops to a city, so near the seat of pestilence, &amp; so perilously exposed to it. Being
               a spare bodied man myself, more in danger of diseases of debility than of inflammation,
               I have – at this distance – no fear of the fever, &amp; think that my constitution &amp; plentiful
               fumigations would secure me if it came in my way. At least it is not that fear – which
               should keep me from going to Lisbon to do my work thoroughly.</p>
