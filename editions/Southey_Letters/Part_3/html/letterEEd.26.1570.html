               <p>It is so long since I have heard from you that if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> had not per chance mentioned you in one of his last letters, I should have been making
                  enquiry whether you were in this world or the next. I am looking with much more solicitude
                  than I ever did before to the meeting of Parliament, to see what effect the Spanish
                  question will have upon our home parties. – &amp; I confess with a strong hope that it
                  may lead to a schism between you &amp; the Foxites, as they must still be called for want
                  of any other name.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Wynn was of the Grenville faction within the Whig party; this grouping differed from
                           the followers of the policies of Charles James Fox on the issue of how to deal with
                           the French occupation of Spain and Portugal.</span></div>
                  </div> Delay after delay, blunder after blunder, panic &amp; pusillanimity, have not yet utterly
                  lost the only opportunity we ever have had of bringing the war to a glorious termination;
                  &amp; had we but a Ministry who would act up to the wishes of the people &amp; put forth the
                  whole strength of England Bonaparte would inevitably find his grave in Spain. But
                  if it be possible to ruin such a cause, our peace-party, our war office, &amp; our wretched
                  most wretched Cabinet will do it. There is no hope that the Edinburgh Review will
                  destroy itself – for whatever gratifies the malignant passions is sure to find partizans
                  in plenty, – but I <span class="strikethrough">hope it will</span> think it must injure the party which it aims at serving. Nothing could be more absurd
                  than <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxxx</span> the way in which <span class="strikethrough">in which</span> it has been endeavouring to give the opposition a Jacobinical character.

                  </div> To them it is as unjust as it must be mischievous, &amp; for the Jacobines – as far as

                  in the feelings of the Scotch Review, &amp; all fellowship with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</a> &amp; his associates is utterly to be renounced. The true &amp; consistent lovers of liberty
                  are convinced that this war <span class="strikethrough">has now become</span> &lt;has long been&gt; a business of national life &amp; death; – our salvation is in our own
                  right hands, &amp; such can only come from ourselves. But if we abate one jot of heart
                  &amp; hope, we do the work of the enemy, &amp; no heavier evil can befall us than we deserve.</p>
