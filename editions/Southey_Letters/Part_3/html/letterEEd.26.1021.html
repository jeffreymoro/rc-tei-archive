                           65 were killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that his brother was among the dead,

                  of all Gods creatures &amp; becomes quainter &amp; quainter every day. It is not easy to conceive
                  what is perfectly true – that he is totally destitute of any thing like modesty, yet
                  without the slightest tinge of impudence in his nature. His religion makes one of
                  the most humorous parts of his character. ‘I’m a boy of religious turn!’ he says,
                  – for he always talks of himself &amp; examines his own character just as if he was speaking
                  of another person, &amp; as impartially. Every night he makes an extempore prayer aloud,
                  but it is always in bed, &amp; not till he is comfortable there, &amp; got into the mood.
                  When he is ready he touches <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson</a> who sleeps with him, &amp; [MS torn] listen! – &amp; off he sets like a Preacher. If he has
                  been behaving amiss, away he goes for the Bible, &amp; looks out for something apposite
                  to his case in the Psalms, or the Book of Job. the other day after he had been in
                  a violent passion, he chose out a chapter against wrath – ‘ah! that suits me!’ The
                  Bible is also resorted to whenever he ails anything, – or else the prayer book. He
                  once made a pun, upon occasion of the belly ache – tho I will not say that he designed
                  it – Oh M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson <span class="ital">I’se</span> got the <span class="ital">Colic</span>!

                  about them when he is out of their sight. It is not possible for one human being to

                  loves her better than he does any body else. Last summer she was dangerously ill,
                  &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a> in consequence came &amp; lived at home. He never manifested the slight uneasiness or
                  concern about her, nor ever would go near her. I do not know whether I should <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> wish to have such a child or not. there is not the slightest evil in his disposition,
                  but it wants something to make it steadily good. physically &amp; morally there is a defect
                  of courage. He is afraid of receiving pain, to such a degree that if any person begins
                  to read a newspaper, he will leave the room least there should be any thing shocking
                  in it. This is the explication of his conduct during <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Wilsons</a> illness. he would not see her, because it would give him pain, &amp; when she was out
                  of sight, he contrived to forget her. – I fear that if he lives he will dream away
                  life like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">his father</a>, too much delighted with his own ideas ever to embody them – or suffer them if he
                  can help it, to be disturbed. – I gave him Robinson Crusoe two years ago. he never
                  has read, nor will read beyond Robinsons departure from the Island. No – he says –
