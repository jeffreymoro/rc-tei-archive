                  state of Europe affects even me among the mountains of Cumberland. I am afraid to
                  remove my family to a country from whence we should be in danger of being driven out.
                  Go however I must, to compleat what has already cost me so much labour, and under
                  these circumstances it will be equally uncomfortable to go or stay.

                  </div> My present plan, as far as man at any time and especially in these times can be said
                  to have any plan, is to set off in the close of the autumn with my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>, leaving <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> in Cumberland: to travel over the Northern provinces, the only ones which I have not
                  yet seen, and on my return to Lisbon send for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, who will then be able to take the voyage with less inconvenience than if she were
                  to attempt it sooner. Once in Lisbon I could willingly make up my mind to remain there.
                  To eat grapes in summer at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Cintra">Cintra</a>, and oranges in winter at Lisboa, speak Portuguese as long as I live, and go to rest
                  under the cypress trees at last. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> would not like this, and for this as well as other reasons which there are no difficulty
                  in finding to throw into the scale, I must not look out for a permanent residence
                  there. Otherwise my mother country is such a mother-in-law sort of country that I
                  should willingly fix elsewhere. &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>
