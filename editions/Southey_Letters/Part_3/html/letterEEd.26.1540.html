               <p>Now to soft Tommys criticism. He seems to suppose that a book ought always to be rendered
                  into English of the newest fashion, – &amp; if not, that it should be given in the English
                  of its own age, – a book of the fifteenth century (16<sup>th</sup> he means) in that of the fifteenth. He did not recollect that in the thirteenth century
                  there was no such thing as English, which is I think answer enough. But the fact is,
                  that both in the Chronicle &amp; in Amadis

                  </div> I have not formed a style but followed one. The originally when represented as literally
                  as possible ran into that phraseology, – &amp; all I had to do was to avoid words &amp; forms
                  of words of modern creation, &amp; also such as were unintelligibly obsolete. There is,
                  as you must have heard <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> point out, a language of pure intelligible English which was spoken in Chaucers time
                  &amp; is spoken in ours – equally understood then &amp; now, &amp; of which the Bible is the written
                  &amp; permanent standard in prose, as it has undoubtedly been the great means of preserving
                  it. To that beautiful manner of narration which characterises the best Chronicles
                  this language is peculiarly adapted, &amp; in fact it is <span class="ital">appropriated</span> to such narration by our books of chivalry, &amp; I might almost say <span class="ital">consecrated</span> to it by the historical parts of scripture. – It so happens that of all things which
                  I have ever done the only one for which all the Reviews with one accord commended
                  me, was for the manner in which I had rendered Amadis; – I wish he may steer clear
                  of all mischief as I shall of them upon this occasion. The fault which he finds is
                  that I have translated the Chronicle of the Cid instead of writing his history.</p>

                  &amp; inweaving after ornaments a couple of hundred may probably be added. I had originally

                  was agreably startled to find myself as it were within sight of the end – so much

               Another month – God willing – will set her on her legs to stand at least &amp; perhaps
               walk by the window &amp; chairs, – &amp; then she will become a play thing in her turn.</p>

               machine of a soldier, – but should he be in a besieged town, such a man is worth a
               whole regiment there. God protect him wherever he be.</p>
