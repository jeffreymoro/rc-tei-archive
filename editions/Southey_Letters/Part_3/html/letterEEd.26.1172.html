                  properly delivered it. Now then for my subsequent adventures. We went in the Coach
                  – which took us up at half after four. two stages on I got some tea, &amp; very good it
                  was – I drank three large cups – for which I had afterwards reason to be sorry, &amp;
                  found myself disposed to be sick from riding backwards. So I asked my opposite traveller
                  to change – the sickness went off but left me ventose, &amp; when I dozed I had <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> nervous startings <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> which at length made me think it better to keep quite awake. There was a <span class="strikethrough">young</span> Lady in the coach <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> bound for Norfolk &lt;as well as myself&gt;. We both alighted at Alconbury Hill

                  </div> at two in the morning, roused up the ostler &amp; got chaise to Fen-stanton. It was bright
                  moonlight. We were not very cold till we changed chaises between four &amp; five, <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> the coldest time of the whole day or night – &amp; then the cold room in which we waited
                  about twenty minutes &amp; the cold chaise afterward chilled us – my companion had nothing
                  either agreable or disagreable about her – she was about thirty, neither ugly nor
                  otherwise – &amp; I liked her well enough till when we were at Cambridge she would have
                  washed in my dirty water if I would have let her. I merely breakfasted at Cambridge,
                  left my companion to wait for the Fakenham stage, &amp; posted to Bourne Bridge thinking
                  to be there in time for the day coaches &amp; accordingly – there I got by nine in the
                  morning. Guess my satisfaction at learning there would be no coach till between one
                  &amp; two the following night. I was by this hour fairly tired &amp; in a highly nervous state
                  – partly occasioned perhaps by the unusual quantity of strong green tea which I had
                  drank without eating anything. So I had the bed warmed, &amp; for the first time in my
                  life went to bed in the morning. My feet were cold so that I was obliged to put on
                  stockings – I dozed about half an hour &amp; had dreadful startings, – I lay awake till
                  two, &amp; then feeling my self rather worse than better, rose to see what a good dinner
                  would do for me. The larder furnished nothing better than beef stakes, – &amp; because
                  I had not ordered potatoes the rascally Landlady thought proper to give me none. The
                  stakes were very bad &amp; nauseated my sickly palate – I began to be apprehensive of
                  being taken ill – to wait till past midnight in this house was a gloomy thought –
                  a single inn in a desolate country – my spirits were never worse – hardly ever so
                  bad – &amp; then another night without sleep would effectually lay me up. It came suddenly
                  into my head that I might get on to Thetford before dark – I asked the distance –
                  thirty two miles – in my state of feeling expense seemed nothing – in fact it was
                  nothing – I ordered chaise &amp; felt revived as soon as I got into it by the thought
                  of seeing somebody who knew me. Nothing can be so excellent as the Norfolk roads –
                  the man drove admirably – twelve miles to Newmarket within the hour &amp; half. Off in
                  about ten minutes – the rain (for it rained when I set off) cleared off but the country
                  was covered with a thin sheet of snow. You can conceive nothing so desolate as this
                  country – flat &amp; open. But I had a fine view of all the racers (I dare say at least
                  thirty) exercising against next week upon the Newmarket heath, flying like the wind
                  – till they seemed no bigger than rabbits. One hour brought me the nine miles to Barton
                  Mills – luckily for the inn-keeper for in the room into which I was shown a red poker
                  lay upon the floor in the act of setting fire to it. – Eleven to Thetford in about
                  ten minutes above the hour. I got out of the chaise quite a different being from that
                  I was in the morning. That woman at Bourne Bridge was so brutal &amp; impudently selfish
                  that to have been sick in her house would have been fearful. My spirits were getting
                  up – Where does Mr Wilkinson

                  with an accident which they are afraid will cost him the sight of one of his eyes.
                  he was playing with a knife which he had stuck into the crevice of a table, the blade
                  snapt and fled up into his eye – Mr W. was in London at the time, &amp; Mrs W. is gone
                  up with the child – I was very much shocked – very much indeed. However as I really
                  was better it was still a matter of great satisfaction to feel myself sure of a nights
                  rest – for the coaches pass between half past six &amp; eight in the morning – within
                  thirty miles of Norwich &amp; with civil people about me. I ordered a roast fowl, called
                  for pen &amp; ink, &amp; was beginning to write when the Landlord came in &amp; said Mr Wilkinson
                  was at home – he had just seen his servant. He had returned last night to serve his
                  church that day being Good Friday. He called the servant in &amp; off I set.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Whether Wilkinson was more glad to see me or I to see him – I cannot tell – he had
               a brother clergyman &amp; an Eton boy dining with him, &amp; had been drinking wine enough
               to warm his heart &amp; to make him shake my hand ten times as often as he would else
               have done. I had cold meat set before me – &amp; then joined the party – three glasses
               of madeira were truly medicinal to me – tea after this, &amp; before tea I got to bed
               in a comfortable room, with a good fire in it. I fell asleep immediately, had such
               a nights rest that I would have given fifty guineas to have been sure of it only half
               a day before, &amp; awoke this morning quite well. To day I stay here, &amp; tomorrow take
               the coach to Norwich where I hope to be before dinner time. I have no other sense
               of fatigue now than the motion of a carriage in my head – like what a voyage leaves
               – &amp; an upper lip so hideously swolen as to be like the neck of a turkey cock – this
               the cold has done. – but I am quite well thank God, &amp; verily believe that by posting
               on here from that doleful house &amp; damnable Landlady I have escaped a serious illness
               – which assuredly half a day &amp; night then – &amp; half a night &amp; day in the coach (had
               there even been room) must have occasioned me in the state I then was.</p>

                  cream of human kindness – never did wine make a man happier – nor better pleased with
                  every body around him – his friend the clergyman was in a high state of enjoyment
                  – his whole face perfectly relaxed with animal happiness – the cheeks hanging down,

               <p>I have neglected my journal for the sake of writing to you – &amp; shall therefore run
                  over my memory for the remainder of the road. Lincoln Cathedral is in good order within
                  – they have been obliged in some places to lay a beam from one column to another to
                  support them – but have so ornamented the beam with Gothic work – that tho it looked
                  unlike any thing I had ever before seen – my notion was that it was a continuation
                  of one of the passages <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxx</span> above. In the cloisters a fine Roman pavement was discovered, not many years ago –
                  they have built a brick building over it with commendable care, but with abominable
                  taste – the place being more like a <span class="ital">pavilione</span> than any thing else – Something in keeping might have been put there – a Library forms
                  one side of the cloister quadrangle in detestable taste. The Cathedral wants painted
                  glass sadly – we felt the light quite unpleasant – &amp; where three old windows remained
                  the effect of the colourd light upon the little crockets &amp; pinnacles within crowning
                  them &amp; playing upon the columns with red &amp; purple &amp; saffron shade of light – made
                  me the more regret that all were not in the same state of beauty. Peters who painted
                  that vile Angel &amp; Child which has been so popular is a Prebend here &amp; has stuck up
                  a picture of the annunciation. He is a worthless fellow – who has studied his Virgins
                  &amp; Angels in the vilest brothels – and his picture is a disgrace to the choir.

                           and biblical scenes, many of which featured female nudity. These pictures were reproduced
                           in engravings and became popular. He took up a career in the church in 1781, becoming
                           prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral in 1795. In this post he painted numerous religious
                           works, including An Angel Carrying the Spirit of a Child to Paradise (1783), and a

                  we became satisfied that it was quite as great a thing as it is said to be – one might
                  stand under it &amp; the mouth measure one &amp; twenty feet. It must be a large tree which
                  would be the size of its middle – the hours are struck upon it with a hammer. No other
                  bell of nearly this size is ever moved: this is &amp; it is tolled on Whitsunday, &amp; when
                  the Judges come to town it has been (I think it should be used at executions – to
                  which it would give great solemnity). It has been disused on other occasions because
                  it shook the tower &amp; endangered it. They have secured the tower now with iron cramps.
