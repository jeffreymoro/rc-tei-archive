            <p class="indent1">I should have written to you in consequence of a letter received from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> on Sunday last, if the newspaper of the same post had not acquainted me with your
               brother’s death. The older we grow the more important these ties of relationship become,
               as we become more sensible of the value and comparative instability of all others
               – so much the worse for the loss.</p>

               <p>Autumn is a better time for visiting this country than summer, because the weather
                  is settled, – indeed our summer hardly sets in till autumn. I hope you may be able
                  to come this year, especially as it is very possible I may not be here the next. The
                  want of my own books, which it would be folly to remove till I have a fixed residence,
                  and the want of occasional access to others are inconveniences that I feel more and
                  more, and I have made up my mind to settle in the neighbourhood of London as soon
                  as possible. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brother</a> has made prizes in the West Indies which, if they have escaped the Toulon fleet, will
                  be worth a thousand pounds – he will lend me a fourth of this, of which 50 will remove
                  me and my appendages and the 200 purchase furniture enough to make a house habitable.

                           concerned that the arrival of the French Mediterranean Fleet in the West Indies, which
