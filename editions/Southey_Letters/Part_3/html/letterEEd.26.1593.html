               <p>It was well that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</a> very handsome letter inclosing sweet remuneration in the shape of L 21.13. arrived
                  a few hours after the Quarterly itself. For when I beheld the cruel mutilation which

                           in the Quarterly Review, 2 (August 1809), 24–61, but there are no reviews by him on
                           the South African missions.</span></div>
                  </div> &amp; saw how dexterously he had <span class="strikethrough">no xxx xxx</span> cut every thing down to the standard of orthodoxy, – in spite of all former experience
                  of the sow-gelding propensities of Review-Editors, I was on the point of vowing a
                  vow that nothing should ever again induce me to send my opinions <span class="strikethrough">to be</span> for revision &amp; correction at <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;an&gt; Inquisition. Anger does not last long with me; – it is some comfort that he has
                  only <span class="ital">implied</span> for me an assent to Doctrines which I disbelieve, for <span class="strikethrough">that</span> &lt;had&gt; there been an express belief asserted, that, even I, should not have borne.
                  So upon taking into consideration the number of sound &amp; orthodox divines, Doctors,
                  Deans, yea haply Bishops, – who <span class="strikethrough">on</span> will read this good Review with their wigs on, I began to think him not unwise in
                  expunging things which might have made those wigs start off, abhorrent of my heresies.
                  I have returned an answer of perfect acquiescence; – observing only that the printer
                  has jostled one paragraph out of its place, &amp; that the beginning of another is made
                  nonsensical, by the omission of what proceeded it in the Manuscript.
