                  as politics at present stand you can have no interest with the Lord Chancellor, but
                  it is not impossible that some how or other – you may have some with the <span class="ital">Lady</span> Chancellor, who I am told exercises over her husband in these matters the same sort
                  of thorough supremacy, that he does in his political capacity over all common laws

               a canvass capable of retaining what images are laid on it, his mind is like the whited
               wall on which the figures of the optical-Raree-show-man pass along, &amp; leave <span class="strikethrough">it as</span> it just as blank as before.

               in an intellect which is as unstable as water &amp; as untenacious as sand. – I am glad
               that before you told me this I had written to him &amp; pointed out to him the uses of

               they give, I shall make him a Keltic scholar in the easiest &amp; best way, by sending
