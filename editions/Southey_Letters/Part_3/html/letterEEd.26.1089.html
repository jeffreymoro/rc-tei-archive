            <p class="indent1">I was uneasy till your letter arrived – because <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BunburyHenryWilliam">Bunbury</a> here had heard that your brother was dangerously ill with a white swelling, &amp; I had
               attributed your silence to that cause. It is however clear that nothing is the matter,
               as you mention nothing; – probably the gout has been converted by some blunder into
               the worse disease. – I see alas by the non-contents of your letter that you have forgotten
