               <div class="salute">My dear Wynn</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will be a little surprized to hear that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</a> has expressed a wish to serve me, &amp; that in consequence <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a> has been <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> desired to communicate this to me &amp; find out in what manner it can be done conformably
               to my own inclinations. There was a situation of 300 £ a year in his own department
               which he would have offered, – but that was nobly judged by himself, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</a> to be inadequate to the <span class="strikethrough">x</span> expence of time &amp; attendance which it required. So Scott wrote to mention to me Professorships
               at the Universities, Diplomatic Situations, – or any other thing which could be pointed
               out.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Professorships in England are fenced about with subscription, &amp; therefore unattainable
               by me. In Scotland I would accept one if nothing more suitable can be found. The Secretaryship
               in Portugal is now no longer desirable. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a> has left that country &amp; the salary would not support me there. I am too old to begin
               the pursuit of fortune in that line, – &amp; nothing but the desire of becoming independent
               ever made me desirous of a situation for which I know myself in many points to be
               exceedingly unfit. The truth is that I have found <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> my way in the world, &amp; am in that <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxxxx</span> state of life unto which it has pleased God to call me, &amp; for which it has pleased
               him to qualify me. At the same time my means are certainly so straitened that I should
               very gladly obtain an addition to them, if it could be obtained without changing the
               main stream of my pursuits.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Now <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpRichard">Sharp</a> has told me that the Stewardship &lt;to Greenwich Hospital&gt; for the Derwentwater Estates
                  is expected soon to be vacated by the death of a Mr Walton.

                  </div> is the managing Director, – &amp; for this Sharp has advised me to apply, – I have therefore
                  written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> to tell him this, &amp; I now write to you, well knowing that if you can be of use <span class="strikethrough">of</span> to me in this application you will.

                  </div> What the value of the appointment is I do not know. Sharp fancies from 6 to 800 a
                  year. If this be thought ‘too good a thing for me’

                           position in Portugal through Charles James Fox who was Foreign Secretary in the ‘Ministry
                           of all the Talents’ before his death in 1806, reporting that Fox considered the ‘Consulship’
                           to be ‘too good a thing for me’; see Southey to Walter Scott, 16 June 1809, Letter
                           1645.</span></div>
                  </div> – as I dare say it will, – the Cumberland estates might be divided from the Northumberland
                  ones. Certes I should rather have the whole than half, but better half a loaf than
                  no bread. And now I have done all that it is in my power to do; having thus found
                  out a specific thing, – asked for it, &amp; written to you for your assistance, if you
                  can give me any. Having done this I dismiss the subject altogether from my thoughts.
                  In this respect I have been truly a philosopher that no hopes or fears with respect
                  to worldly fortunes have ever given me an hours anxiety.</p>
