               <p>I am much obliged to you, Sir, for your translation of the last Book of the ‘Iliad’.

                  </div> It would be a highly respectable version from any hand, and must be considered as
                  a very extraordinary one for one who has not been long practised in the act of versifying.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">In writing verse myself I seldom or never elongate a word to three syllables which
               is commonly and naturally pronounced as two. It appears to me that any such attenuation
               of sound weakens the rhythm of the line for instance, you have written, How brave
               he was, how generous and true: this line is far less sonorous than another in which
               the same word is used as a dissyllable </p>
            <p class="indent1">Thy form, thy countenance and generous mind. </p>
            <p>So also</p>
            <p class="indent1">Pelides satiate at length with grief:</p>
            <p class="indent1">the sound of the line would be strengthened if the word ‘satisfied’ were substituted.
               </p>
            <p class="indent1">On the other hand, such a word as askest cannot be made into a monosyllable (tho certainly
               it is often done) without producing a harsh and unpleasant effect. You have authority
               enough in both cases, but the ear – is the best and only sure criterion, and whenever
               that is disappointed of the full sound which it expects, or is jarred by a harsh one
               which it does not expect, unless the passage itself affords an especial reason for
               the variety, the line may be pronounced faulty. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The couplet is to me a wearying measure, and I have sometimes found that the terza
                  rima of the Italians might with great advantage be used in its stead, in the translation
                  of Homer, Virgil, or any of the classical narrative poets. Stanzas cannot be used,
                  because they require a regular length of period not to be found in the original: the
                  terza rima would have all the charm of rhyme, with the advantage of continuousness.
                  The common quatrain might also be written continuously, after the example of Mason,

                  </div> I differ from him but the opinion of Dryden on such a subject is a weighty one.</p>

            <p class="indent1">It has often been doubted whether literature be the worthy occupation of a man’s life.
               I believe it is, and have acted accordingly. But it can never be doubted that it is
               the worthiest amusement of leisure, after the business of life is done.</p>
