                  military enquiry may, or may not, convict Sir Hew Dalrymple of military misconduct.
                  This is the least part of his offence; &amp; no legal proceedings can attach to the heinous

            <p class="indent1">It is of importance to make the country feel this. &amp; these sentiments would appear
               with most effect if they were embodied in a County Address, of which the ostensible
               purport might be to thank his Majesty for having instituted an Enquiry, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">perhaps</span> to request that he would be pleased to appoint a day of national humiliation for
               this grievous national disgrace. This will not be liable to the reproof with which
               he thought proper to receive the City address, because it prejudges nothing, – military
               proceedings are out of the question; – what is complained of is <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;a&gt; breach of the law of nations, &amp; an abandonment of the moral principle, which

                  to be expected, &amp; we know well enough how little Government are desirous of having
                  any thing so considered. But if he could be convinced that this business is aloof
                  from all party questions, he might be contented to let it take its course, without
