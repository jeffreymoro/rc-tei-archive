                  </div> – The <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Speakers Secretary</a> happens to be one of my very intimate friends, &amp; one of the men in the world for whom
                  I have the highest respect. It may be some convenience to you upon this occasion to
                  know him, because he can give you every necessary information respecting Parliamentary
                  business, &amp; thus perhaps spare you some needless troubles, – &amp; there needs no other
                  introduction than knocking at his door &amp; sending up your name, with which he is well
                  acquainted. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a> is his name, &amp; you will find it over his door, in S<sup>t</sup> Stephens Court, New Palace Yard, – next door to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AbbotCharles">the Speakers</a>. I will tell you what kind of man he is. His outside has so little polish about it,
                  that once having gone from Christ-Church to Pool in his own boat, he was taken by
                  the press-gang, – his robust figure, hard-working hands, &amp; hoarse voice all tending
                  to deceive them. A little of this is worn off. He is the strongest &amp; clearest headed
                  man that I have ever known, – pondere, numero &amp; mensura is his motto,

                  </div> – how to read for the purposes of history from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a>. – His manners are stoical, they are like the husk of the cocoa-nut, &amp; his inner
                  nature is like the milk within its kernel. When I go to London I am always his guest,
                  – he gives me but half his hand when he welcomes me at the door, – but I have his
                  whole heart; – &amp; there is not that thing in the world which he thinks would serve
                  or gratify me that he does not do for me, – unless it be something which he thinks
                  I can as well do myself. The subject which he best understands is political economy.
                  Were there but half a dozen such men in the House of Commons, there would be courage,
                  virtue &amp; wisdom enough there to save this country from that revolution to which it
