            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter has given me very great pleasure. There are few things of which I am more
                  earnestly desirous than that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> ‘Remains’
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> should meet with that respect immediately, which they certainly must sooner or later
                  obtain; and it now appears very probable that this desire will be gratified; for though
                  the rapid sale of this edition must for the most part be attributed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> personal acquaintance, and Cambridge reputation, the manner in which strangers have
                  been interested by the book may fairly be considered, not merely as a testimony of
                  its intrinsic merit, but as an indication of public and unbiassed opinion. I did not
                  receive the censure till last night, which is the reason your letter has remained
                  unanswered till now. I, as well as yourself, have been affected by the way in which
                  Mr. Brydges mentions the ‘Remains’; his mind seems to be at once so alive to genius,
                  and so sore with wrongs; – wrongs I conclude them to be, as nothing else would occasion
                  such complaints.

                           success of poets such as Kirke White, his own Sonnets and other Poems (1785) (a fourth
                           edition appeared as Poems in 1807) having been met with faint praise. Brydges was
                           also acutely sensitive about his family lineage, his attempts to claim that he descended
                           from the Barons of Chandos having, in 1803, been judged by the House of Lords not
                           to be well founded. Brydges had greeted the forthcoming publication of White’s Remains
                           gushingly in ‘Original Poems by the late Henry Kirke White’, Censura Literaria, 5
                           (1807) …</span></div>
                  </div> The passage on which he comments was written with reference to those poets who are
                  usually mentioned as peculiarly unfortunate; – Otway, Savage, Boyse, Dermody, &amp;c.

                           Thomas Otway (1652–1685, DNB); Richard Savage (1697/8–1743; DNB), Samuel Boyse (1702/3?–1749;
                           DNB), Thomas Dermody (1775–1802; DNB). In the Remains, Southey had criticised the
                           forcing of youthful poetic genius into unsuitable intellectual labours and had suggested
                           (I, p. 55) that ‘[t]hey who are thus lamented as the victims of genius, have been,
                           in almost every instance, the victims of their own vices’.</span></div>
                  </div> Their genius could not save them from untimely and miserable death, but it reprieved
                  them from it. Should the fifth volume of the “Annual Review” fall in your way, you
                  may there see something which I have said upon the subject in reviewing the ‘Life

               <p>Had it not been for my wish to see this preface, I should have replied immediately
                  to your letter, relating to what you say of unknown persons soliciting a correspondence
                  with you. Upon this subject you speak with thorough good sense. Letter-writing is
                  a favourite amusement with the young; as men grow older they find less leisure for
                  it, and as they cease to want employment for idle hours, their inclination for it
                  ceases also. Your correspondents will drop off, not from disappointment at the letters
                  which they receive, but from this natural cause. Those who were nearly and dearly
                  intimate with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a>, will probably continue to keep up an intercourse with you, as doubtless you will
                  wish to do with them; to all others, whether they were slightly acquainted with him,
                  or not acquainted at all, you may either plead the fair excuse of want of time, or
                  exchange a few letters at longer and longer intervals, till they let the example of
                  stopping short. And this is perhaps the most advisable way; for the interest which
                  these unknown persons feel towards one who had been a good brother to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> certainly seems to imply some goodness in themselves, and it may be that you may find
                  among them some pleasant acquaintance, or even serviceable friend, for yourself or
                  your brother and sisters. Now though this is such prudent advice that a Scotchman
                  might have given it, do not suppose that I am related to the family of Mr. Worldly
                  Wiseman,

               accept, and place among the choicest treasures of my collection, – and I will not
               scruple at choosing a large one. Let it, if you please, be that which contains the
