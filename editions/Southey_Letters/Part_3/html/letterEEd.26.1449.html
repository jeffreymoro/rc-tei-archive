                  </div> It is no little comfort to me to see them safe, &amp; for the first time gathered together.
                  The tea chests just did their duty, a longer journey in the waggon would have shaken
                  them to pieces. For freight of these 22 cases, I paid something less than three pounds,
                  – the carriage from Newcastle made it amount to £9–7-, – surprizingly little for removing
                  above seven &amp; twenty hundred weight, three hundred miles. The carpenter has not yet

                  </div> the latter has little remarkable except its impudence. The fact is that the Florentines <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> seem determined to support their countryman thro thick &amp; thin, – just as Frenchmen
                  would do. There is one letter in Bandini which was never before printed, &amp; this I
                  take to be the letter the authenticity of which has been suspected, for it makes Amerigo
                  discover the lunar observation. No satisfactory account is given of the original from
                  which this has been printed, &amp; the whole complection of Bandinis <span class="strikethrough">life</span> &lt;memoirs&gt; makes me very very suspicious of his honesty.
