            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>That part of your letter which relates to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilberforceWilliam">Mr. Wilberforce</a> requires an immediate answer; for, by this time, you must have received my parcel,
                  and no time ought to be lost in getting the new edition through the press. Undoubtedly,
                  if Mr. Wilberforce and Mr. Simeon desire to have their names withdrawn,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>William Wilberforce and Charles Simeon (1759–1836; DNB) had been recorded in The Remains
                           of Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham (1807), as having contributed £20 and £30 per
                           annum respectively to Henry Kirke White’s education. Now they were requesting that
                           this information should be omitted from the second edition.</span></div>
                  </div> they must be. At the same time, I cannot but say that it appears to me a very idle
                  request on their parts; for, admitting that there was any good reason for keeping
                  the thing secret, that which has been printed in 750 books, and read by ten times
                  as many readers, copied into magazines and reviews, and by their means circulated
                  through all the reading populations of Great Britain, must be already as well known
                  as it can be. They may object to letting their light shine before men, but when the
                  candle has been set up and looked at, if they choose to have it blown out, it is my
                  opinion that the smell of the snuff will attract more notice than the light would
                  have done.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">But the sum which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> received from these gentlemen must not be vaguely stated, – that is an essential
               matter of fact; it is of consequence that the precise nature and amount of his resources
               should be reported, and I do not think any valid reason can be assigned, on the part
               of his patrons, for pressing this omission upon me. The public would be deceived by
               the omission, and certainly suspect that the aid which he received was more, unless
               they are told how little it was.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As little can I consent to leaving out that passage which expresses <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> intention of becoming a dissenting minister, if he could find no means of ordination
               in the establishment. It is not possible that the sale of the book can be affected
               by it in the slightest degree. Had I overlooked the fact, I should have deserved censure
               for negligence; did I expunge it now, I should be liable to a heavier charge.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I feel myself much indebted to you for your prompt vindication against the ‘Christian
                  Observer’s’ suspicions, and shall much like to see your letter.
