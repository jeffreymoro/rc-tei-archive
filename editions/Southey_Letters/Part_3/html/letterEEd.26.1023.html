                           of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian

                           sent to review the practicability of defending Portugal from a French invasion. His

                  things I am not so well informed as you will be, – as far as I am it appears that
                  the office of Inspector of Accounts would suit me best – what I beg of you is to say
                  whether among the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> civil appointments annexed to such an established there be any one less unsuitable <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> to one who like myself has no great call to any other business than <span class="strikethrough">my</span> &lt;his&gt; own. – If I can live at Lisbon at the King’s expence, &amp; be paid into the bargain
                  for living there, there would be a clear demonstration of the fitness of things so
                  far as they related to me. if after all we are not about to send troops there – there
                  is an end of the matter. but seeing the positive assertions in the paper it was my
                  business to look out in time, Bedford was one channel – &amp; not a bad one, – by means
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> also I shall make application in other quarters.</p>
