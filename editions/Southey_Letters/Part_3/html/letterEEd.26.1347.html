                           in Bristol had been sent by sea. Samuel Reid, who lived in Liverpool, had promised
                           to look out for them when they arrived in port and have them forwarded on to Workington;
                           see Southey to Charles Danvers, 20 April 1807, Letter 1308.</span></div>

                  of freight so far, or deliver it to you. To this, as his letter contains no address
                  I could not reply except to you. Do you settle with him &amp; I will ere long send you
                  a draft upon the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Long Men</a> of the Row to <span class="strikethrough">settle</span> balance my money account with you.</p>

                  which my print was squeezed at the expence of half-an-inch of its breadth: a very
                  abominable trick which the &lt;framer&gt; could not have practised if it had not been sent
                  to a distance. My directions were for a broad plain flat black frame with an inner
                  rim of gold – it is neither broad, plain, nor flat, – &amp; consequently looks not half
                  so well as if it had. Of course I am fully sensible that you gave the directions which
                  I sent, &amp; my only motive for telling you all this is that you may never employ the
                  same tradesman again, for nothing can be more abominable than chipping a print to
                  fill a frame, – especially so costly a one as this is.</p>
