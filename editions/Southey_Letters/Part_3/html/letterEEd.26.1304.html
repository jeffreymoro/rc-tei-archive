                  </div> I have inserted in it such poems as seem best suited to that place, because they refer
                  to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> then state of mind, and thus derive an interest from the narrative, and in their turn
                  give it also. After the introduction I purpose to insert a selection of his letters,
                  or rather of extracts from them, in chronological order. Upon mature consideration,
                  and upon trial as well, I believe this to be better than inserting them in the account
                  of his life. If the reader feel for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> that love and admiration which I have endeavoured to make him feel, he will be prepared
                  to receive these epistolary fragments as the most authentic and most valuable species
                  of biography; and if he does not feel that love, it is no matter how he receives them,
                  for his heart will be in fault, and his understanding necessarily darkened.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have, to the best of my judgment, omitted every thing of which the publication could
                  occasion even the slightest unpleasant feeling to any person whatever; and if any
                  thing of this kind has escaped me, you will, of course, consider your own opinion
                  as decisive, and omit it accordingly, without any regard to mine. Assuredly we will
                  not offend the feelings of anyone; but there are many passages which, though they
                  can give no pain to an individual, you perhaps may think will not interest the public.
                  If this fear come across you, take up Chatterton’s letters to his mother and sister,
                  and see if the very passages which will excite in you the greatest interest are not
                  of the individual and individualising character, and then remember that Henry’s is
                  to be a name equally dear to the generation which will come after us.
