            </div>
            <p class="indent1">If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Peter Elmsley</a> had not lived so far from town that we were four hours on the way to his house, &amp;
               as long in returning, you &amp; I should scarcely have seen each other during my long
               absence from home. This is always the case when I visit London. In the endless hurry
               &amp; fatigue which it is impossible to avoid, I scarcely ever see my friends, except
               in large parties, which is almost as bad as [illegible word] seeing them at all; &amp;
               even in that way I have no opportunity of falling &lt;in&gt; with you. My head too was always
               full of what I had just done, or what I had next to do: always weary, always in haste,
               always restless, &amp; with a sense of discomfort produced by the detestable composition
               of fog, smoke &amp; pulverized horse dung which serves the Londoner for an atmosphere.
               – I can truly say that the pleasantest minute I past in the capital, was when I seated
               myself in the stage coach to depart from it. I spent four days with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Mr T. Southey</a> at Taunton. He behaved as well as is in his nature to do, &amp; gave me a 25£, – for
               him an act of great liberality. He walked me over fields in which I could neither
               feel nor feign an interest, &amp; showed me the plan of an estate in Devonshire for which
               he had just paid 7,000£, &amp; made five per cent by the purchase. I left him in good
               humour with me &amp; generally am much in his good graces, – but what hold can there be
               upon the good will of a man who is growing fond of money, &amp; who by shunning all better
               society lays himself open to the artifices of low flatterers – just as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">his brother</a> did before him. Whatever expectations there may be from him have more reference to
               my children than to me, for he is not yet sixty, &amp; never was there a haler man of
               his age – my head has more grey hairs in it than his.</p>

                  in default of issue male from the present heir. The truth is that I know nothing about
                  the matter, &amp; were I to say care nothing about it, it would not be far from the truth.
                  This too concerns my children more than me, – my worldly wealth will be no hindrance
                  to me when I appear at Heaven’s gate: - if it &lt;should&gt; be a turnpike gate it will

                           to Southey’s edition of the Chronicle of the Cid. Frere had been Britain’s ambassador
                           to Portugal while Southey’s uncle had lived there; from 1808–1809 he was ambassador

                  </div> Had it been prest upon me to go I should probably have gone, because nothing could
                  be so unpleasant to me as to have it supposed that I was afraid of visiting him. For
                  this reason I did not promise you to the contrary. But because of your wishes I kept
                  out of the way of the person with whom the thing would have been arranged – or to
                  speak more accurately did not get in his way. Any gratification I might have felt
                  in seeing so remarkable a man was willingly given up, – but I could not bear to have
                  it supposed that I am bound with a treasury chain, &amp; must not go beyond my tether.
                  Independent as relates to money, it is not possible that I shall ever be, – but blessed
                  be God this dependence brings with it no other curse to me than a few worldly cares.
                  – without which I should not have my share of evil in the world. It is too late in
                  the day for me to walk in trammels: &amp; I never shall <span class="strikethrough">xx xxx</span> learn to consider <span class="strikethrough">whether</span> &lt;in what light&gt; what I say or do may appear to others – till after it is done. I believe
                  too that you overrated the importance of a thing which in itself <span class="strikethrough">ha</span> is of none. To strike off my pension would be making me of consequence, &amp; my life
                  for it no body in power ever thinks about me or my pension. Why should they? I think
                  nothing about them, &amp; have literally more to do with any times than <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> my own. The worst offence I commit is probably <span class="strikethrough">that of</span> when I receive my quarter – &amp; swear at the deduction instead of being thankful for
