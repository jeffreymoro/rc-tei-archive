               <p>I am perfectly accurate about the catoptrics. – see the prose title of the question

                           convex?’ ‘Espejo’ is Spanish for mirror, ‘speculum’ Latin.</span></div>
                  </div> yet <span class="ital">antojos</span>, <span class="ital">spectacles</span>, were used at the same time, &amp; mentioned in the same volume so as not to be mistaken.
                  ‘The thing which is smaller appears greater if we see it with spectacles.’ – I cannot
                  understand the reason <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> for using these reflecting mirrors. ‘They who <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> are accustomed to study &amp; find <span class="ital">el molde</span> hurtful to the sight, recommend them as the best remedy.’ I know no other meaning
                  of <span class="ital">molde</span> than its plain English a <span class="ital">mould</span> or frame; unless it be put shortly for type. <span class="ital">libros de molde</span> being used for printed books. &amp; how these mirrors should be better than spectacles
                  – when so much more expensive &amp; so troublesome, heaven knows. However the testimony
                  to their use is positive, &amp; a very curious fact it is.
