               His affected reason for this is that he could not properly leave her more than he
               has left to two of his sisters; a reason by no means valid, for she was more to him

         <div class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">2.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey is referring to the controversy surrounding the Battle of the Basque Roads
               in April 1809. Although the British fleet achieved some success, it failed to destroy
               the French navy completely. Captain Thomas Cochrane, later 10th Earl of Dundonald
               (1775–1860; <em>DNB</em>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of the battle, accused
               his commanding officer, the evangelical Admiral James Gambier, Baron Gambier (1756–1833;
               <em>DNB</em>) of being reluctant to pursue the attack and thus achieve a complete victory. Cochrane
               was also an MP with a reputation for exposing abuses of office, and, in the weeks
               after the battle, he pursued his campaign against Gambier via parliamentary speeches.
               Gambier demanded a court-martial at which he was exonerated and, by implication, Cochrane
               was blamed for libelling a superior officer. Whilst Gambier received public thanks
               from parliament for his actions in the battle, Cochrane was not permitted to rejoin
               his ship for a few months. When he received new orders to serve in the Mediterranean,
               Cochrane refused and went on half-pay, devoting his time to exposing abuses in the
               Admiralty. For Southey’s account, see <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</em>, 2.1 (1811), 364–379.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               of York (1763–1827; <em>DNB</em>) and Mary Anne Clarke’s (1776?-1852; <em>DNB</em>) involvement in office trafficking. However, his own reputation was quickly sullied
               by counter-allegations from Clarke, alleging corruption and conspiracy. He was the
