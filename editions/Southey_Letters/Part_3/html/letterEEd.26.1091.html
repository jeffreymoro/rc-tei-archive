               <p>I am much gratified with your praise of Madoc, &amp; disposed to acquiesce with some of
                  your censure. It was my intention at one time to have made Erillyab arrive during
                  the contest, &amp; put Amalahta to death with her own hands: an action of savage heroism
                  which might have been made sufficiently consistent with her character.

                           to her.</span></div>
                  </div> Why this was altered I cannot very clearly explain – this much is certain that the
                  part as it now stands after the Hoamen are driven out from the hut – offends me more
                  than any thing else in the volume – &amp; is therefore most likely to be altered.

                  </div> – What you say of the earlier termination of the poem is not founded so well, as you
                  will probably perceive if you reconsider the story. the historical foundation of the
                  story is the emigration of the Aztecas which gives by the concluding lines that same
                  probability to the second part which historical names &amp; facts have given to the first.
                  &amp; there are many characters of the drama to be disposed of, who must &lt;not&gt; be killed
                  &amp; married off too precipitately. – It pleased me that you had selected for praise
                  the quieter passages, – those in an under key, with which the feeling has the most
                  – &amp; the fancy the least to do. – the names are uncouth only to the eye, &amp; were all

                  </div> – which for want of catalogues I cannot get at by any other channel. The book is said
                  to be of sterling value, &amp; the subject so connected with Christian &amp; Oriental superstitions
                  – that my knowledge of both is very imperfect till I have read it well. besides I
                  think I have discovered that one of the great Oriental mythologies was borrowed from
                  Xtianity – that of Budda – the Fo of the Chinese – if so what becomes of their chronology!
