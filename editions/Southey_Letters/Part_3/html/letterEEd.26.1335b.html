            <p class="indent1">I am very busy. Today I had a repairer mending the carpet in my study; I had this
               same repair-man (whose name is Johnny Cockbaine, assuredly the best – Prince-King-Emperor
               – most worthy mender of all menders. He is worth seeing, and he is worth painting.
               If you are able to form in your mind an abstract idea of the perfect mender, it will
               certainly be of this short little Johnny Cockbaine. From head to foot, he is all mender:
               whatever he does, whatever he thinks is about mending. This little Johnnykins carries
               as his device a Lion rampant on his buckles. This is a very long parenthesis: now
               to the matter at hand) I had this same repair-man making new curtains for the study;
               he had a painter painting the door. I had a bell-hanger hanging a bell. I had a wagon
               with two packages of books to be reviewed. May the devil take the books. May the devil
               take the reviewing. I do not like reviewing. I had a fisherman here with a jack [pike]
               weighing four pounds. The jacks of this lake are very good. I love jack, not roasted
               but boiled. Boiled jack is better. Roasted is dry. Tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> this because Horace loves fish. I had another time a jack of twenty-two pounds. O
               beautiful Apollo! This was Jackus, this was Johannes. This was Johannes Magnus [1488–1544,
               the last Catholic bishop in Sweden] as truly as the Archbishop of Uppsala, but certainly
               that Archbishop would not have been so good boiled.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Where is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Peter the Great</a>? Would that this Peter were an Archbishop, then I should dine with an Archbishop.
               I should very much like to dine with an Archbishop. This whopping Peter wrote me about
               some books, which was very kind – but did he buy those books? Ask this greatest of
               all Peters, in the name of the least and the thinnest of all Roberts.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am quite angry with my printer because he is so very slow. My book [Espriella] is
                  soon to be published.
