                           Dyer; see Southey to Charles Danvers, 14 October 1809, Letter 1694. The frames for
                           these had been bought for Southey by Bedford, see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford,

                  </div> arrived this day &lt;having come&gt; by the Mail Coach – <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xx xxxx xxx xxx</span>, – &amp; as was to be expected the large glass broken into fifty pieces. All the others
                  by good fortune have escaped. It is well for the frame-maker that I am not Buonaparte,
                  – as I should think cutting his ears off not too severe a punishment for the absurdity
                  of sending such things by such a conveyance, when the waggon would have brought them
                  with perfect safety, at one fourth of the cost. Unquestionably the loss ought to fall
                  upon him, &amp; if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> has not paid him, I shall remonstrate upon the subject, – tho I am a bad hand at such
                  disputes myself, &amp; in conscience one cannot expect a friend to dispute for one. The
                  worst of the business is the great inconvenience it occasions, – for how is another
                  glass to be sent, when the frame is here? – however I must make enquiry as to the
                  possibility of getting one of that <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> size <span class="strikethrough">here</span>, &lt;upon the spot&gt; &amp; endeavour to do the enamelling myself. But it is as vexatious
                  as I ever permit a thing of no greater moment to be, because it has been occasioned
                  by a piece of folly not to have been calculated upon.</p>

            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DyerGeorge">Dyers</a> picture is a most happy likeness. He does me wrong if he supposes that I do not set
               great value upon it, for I have a great regard for him, &amp; so much respect for his
               better part, that I never lose sight of it even when his oddities &amp; weaknesses provoke
               a smile. It is melancholy to <span class="strikethrough">think</span> see so many of the ingredients both of genius &amp; happiness existing in that mans mind,
               &amp; spoilt in the mixing, – to think how trifling an alteration in his character would
               have made him as useful as he is good, &amp; as happy as useful. – The frames look well,
               but by no means so well as they would have done if the gilding had been broader. It
               was a bitter disappointment not to find <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Moons</a> picture among them, – because we remembered it as the happiest likeness, – the better
               way of sending it will be in a frank, sufficiently enveloped. Dyer will convey it
               to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</a>, &amp; then no matter what may be the weight. It is hardly possible that he should lose
               a second charge of the same kind.</p>
