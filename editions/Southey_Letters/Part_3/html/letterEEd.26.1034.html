               <p>The nine months being up, I am daily in hopes of hearing that you are safely delivered
                  of a proof sheet, – &amp; every delay now makes me begin to apprehend a miscarriage. –
                  Seriously loss of time begins to be to me a serious loss, for I had calculated that

                  – &amp; it will not now be forth-coming till the next. If you find it interfere too much
                  with your own concerns, make no scruple about telling me, – &amp; I can easily transfer
                  it to another friend. My motive for charging you with it was twofold – an old feeling
                  which made me prefer associating my name with yours, – &amp; a hope that you might acquire
                  a habit of literary research, to be directed hereafter to better purposes. But if
                  you feel that to be irksome in which I expected you would have found amusement, –
                  do not be so unfriendly as to go on with an unpleasant undertaking, from any fear
                  of inconveniencing me. You &amp; I have known each other long enough to speak freely.
                  No inconvenience could be so great to me as procrastination, &amp; I could without the
                  smallest difficulty entrust the business to somebody else. If however this be not
                  the case – O bone testudo

                  to the end of the journey unless I can find some means of spurring you thro that thick
                  shell. Send me a list of the authors still desiderated, &amp; I will cause enquiry to
                  be made at Edinburgh, which may somewhat accelerate us: &amp; go to press without delay,
