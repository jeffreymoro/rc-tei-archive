                  </div> of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge’s</a> is that it looks as if it realy was extracted from a letter, and that there are some
                  things in it which would be fitly enough said to a friend, but are not so fitly said
                  to the Public. Some few corrections of little importance he has made in it, two of
                  more importance I believe are yet to be made. It is not possible that he can get together
                  the list of his subscribers in time to publish so soon as this paper proposes, and
                  if there should be any number of copies engaged by persons residing either in the
                  country or in small towns, his only way of circulating it will be by post. In that
                  case it must be stamped, and the stamp will only carry a single sheet. Larger paper,
                  however, and smaller type will bring it to the same quantity of contents and the same
                  marketvalue.</p>

            <p class="indent1">You have never seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>. He is in so many points so far superior to all other men whom it has ever been my
               lot to fall in with, that I wish you had seen him, tho I know how much you would differ
               from him, and can guess what you would dislike. If this scheme of his be carried into
               effect, a greater body of sound criticism and sound philosophy will be given to the
               world, than modern times have ever yet produced. I have doubts and fears about it,
               and now that it is too late, believe that monthly or quarterly parts, or even of irregular
               publications would have been a preferable mode of proceeding for his habits. However,
               his common-place books are numerous and well-filled, and little more is necessary
               than to put his loose materials in order.</p>
