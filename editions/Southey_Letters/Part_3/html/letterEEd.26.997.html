               to cut out the French privateer <span class="ital">General Ernouf</span> (formerly the British sloop of war <span class="ital">Lilly</span>) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission 65 were
               killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that his brother was among them because the
               first lieutenant had been reported as dead, but he was absent from the raid because
               he had been placed under arrest. Charles Hayman (d. 1804) was made first lieutenant
               in his stead and died in the attack. Michael Birbeck (dates unknown) was indeed the
               Master and was killed in the action, according to William James (d. 1827), <em>The Naval History of Great Britain</em>, 5 vols (London, 1822–1824), III, pp. 274–276.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               ship by Nicholas Pocock (1740–1821; <em>DNB</em>) was omitted because Southey was displeased with the vessel’s anachronistic modernity;see
