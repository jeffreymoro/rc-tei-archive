               <div class="l">At morning their high Priest Ayayaca</div>
               <div class="l">Came with our guide, the venerable man</div>
               <div class="l">With more especial welcome greeted us,</div>
               <div class="l">Deeming us children of another race</div>
               <div class="l">Mightier than they, he led us to the Queen.</div>
               <div class="l">The fate of war had robbed her of her realm,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet with affection &amp; habitual awe,</div>
               <div class="l">And old remembrances that gave their love</div>
               <div class="l">A deeper &amp; religious character,</div>
               <div class="l">Fallen as she was &amp; humbled as they were,</div>
               <div class="l">Her faithful people still in all they could</div>
               <div class="l">Obeyed Erilyab, she too in her mind</div>
               <div class="l">Those recollections cherished, &amp; such thoughts</div>
               <div class="l">As tho no hope tempered their bitterness,</div>
               <div class="l">Gave to her eye a spirit &amp; a strength</div>
               <div class="l">And pride to features, which had borne belike,</div>
               <div class="l">Had they been fashioned to a happier fate,</div>
               <div class="l">Meaning more gentle &amp; more womanly,</div>
               <div class="l">Yet not more worthy of esteem &amp; love</div>
               <div class="l">She sate upon the threshold of her hut,</div>
               <div class="l">For in the palace where her sires had reigned</div>
               <div class="l">The conqueror dwelt, her son was at her side</div>
               <div class="l">A boy now near to manhood, by the door.</div>
               <div class="l">Stript of its bark, the head &amp; branches lopt</div>
               <div class="l">Stood a young tree with many a weapon hung,</div>
               <div class="l">Her husbands war-pole &amp; his monument.</div>
               <div class="l">These had his quiver mouldered, his stone axe</div>
               <div class="l">Had there grown green with moss his bow-string there</div>
               <div class="l">Sung as it cut the wind.</div>
               <div class="l">She welcomed us</div>
               <div class="l">With a proud sorrow in her mien; fresh fruits</div>
               <div class="l">Were spread before us, &amp; her gestures said</div>
               <div class="l">That when he lived whose hand was wont to wield</div>
               <div class="l">Those weapons – that in better days, – that ere </div>
               <div class="l">She let the tresses of her widowhood</div>
               <div class="l">Grow wild, she could have given to guests like us</div>
               <div class="l">A worthier welcome, soon a man approached</div>
               <div class="l">Hooded with sable &amp; his half bare limbs</div>
               <div class="l">Smeared black; the people at his sight drew round,</div>
               <div class="l">The women waild &amp; wept, the children turnd</div>
               <div class="l">And hid their faces on their mothers knees</div><br><div class="l">He to the Queen addrest his speech, then look’d</div>
               <div class="l">Around the children &amp; laid hands on two,</div>
               <div class="l">Of different sexes, but of age alike</div>
               <div class="l">Some six years each, they at his touch shriekd out –</div>
               <div class="l">But then Lincoya rose &amp; to my feet</div>
               <div class="l">Led them, &amp; told me that the conquerors claimd</div>
               <div class="l">These innocents for tribute, that the Priest</div>
               <div class="l">Would lay them on the altar of his God,</div>
               <div class="l">Tear out their little hearts in sacrifice,</div>
               <div class="l">Yea with more cursed wickedness, himself </div>
               <div class="l">Feed on their flesh! .. I shuddered &amp; my hand</div>
               <div class="l">Instinctively unsheathd the holy sword,</div>
               <div class="l">He with most passionate &amp; eloquent signs,</div>
               <div class="l">Eye-speaking earnestness &amp; quivering lips</div>
               <div class="l">Besought me to preserve himself, &amp; those</div>
               <div class="l">Who now fell suppliant round me, youths &amp; maids,</div>
               <div class="l">Grey-headed men, &amp; mothers with their babes.</div><br><div class="l">I caught the destined victims up, I kissd</div>
               <div class="l">Their innocent cheeks, I raised my eyes to heaven,</div>
               <div class="l">I calld upon Almighty God to hear</div>
               <div class="l">And bless the vow I made; in our own tongue</div>
               <div class="l">Was that sworn promise of protection vowd …</div>
               <div class="l">Impetuous feeling made me pause for thought, </div>
               <div class="l">Heaven heard the vow; the suppliant multitude </div>
               <div class="l">Saw what was stirring in my heart; the Priest,</div>
               <div class="l">With eye inflamed &amp; rapid answer raisd </div>
               <div class="l">His menacing hand, the tone the bitter smile</div>
               <div class="l">Interpreting his threat.</div>
               <div class="l">Meantime the Queen</div>
               <div class="l">With watchful eye &amp; steady countenance</div>
               <div class="l">Had listened, now she rose &amp; to the Priest</div>
               <div class="l">Addressd her speech, low was her voice &amp; calm</div>
               <div class="l">As one who spake with effort to subdue </div>
               <div class="l">Sorrow that struggled still; but she spake </div>
               <div class="l">Her features kindled to more majesty,</div>
               <div class="l">Her eye became more animate, her voice</div>
               <div class="l">Rose to the height of feeling; on her son</div>
               <div class="l">She calld, &amp; from her Husbands monument</div>
               <div class="l">His battle axe she took, &amp; I could see</div>
               <div class="l">That as she gave the boy his fathers arm,</div>
               <div class="l">She calld his fathers spirit to look on </div>
               <div class="l">And bless them to his vengeance!</div>
               <div class="l">Silently</div>
               <div class="l">The tribe stood listening as Erilyab spake</div>
               <div class="l">The very Priest was awed, once he essayd</div>
               <div class="l">To answer, his tongue failed him, &amp; his lip</div>
               <div class="l">Grew pale &amp; fell, he to his countrymen,</div>
               <div class="l">Of rage &amp; shame &amp; wonder full, returnd,</div>
               <div class="l">Bearing no victims for their shrine accurst</div>
               <div class="l">But tidings that the Homen had cast off</div>
               <div class="l">Their vassalage, rous’d to desperate revolt</div>
               <div class="l">By men in hue &amp; speech &amp; garments strange,</div>
               <div class="l">Who in their folly dared defile the power</div>
               <div class="l">Of Aztlan.</div>
               <div class="l">When the King of Aztlan heard</div>
               <div class="l">The unlooked-for tale, ere yet he rous’d his strength,</div>
               <div class="l">Or pitying our rash valour, or belike </div>
               <div class="l">Curious to see the men so bravely rash,</div>
               <div class="l">He sent to bid me to his court, surprised </div>
               <div class="l">I should have given to him no credulous faith,</div>
               <div class="l">But fearlessly Erilyab bade me trust </div>
               <div class="l">Her honourable foe, unarmd I went,</div>
               <div class="l">Lincoya with me to exchange our speech</div>
               <div class="l">So as he could; of safety first assured,</div>
               <div class="l">For to their damned Idols he had been</div>
               <div class="l">A victim doom’d, &amp; from the bloody rites</div>
               <div class="l">Flying, been carried captive far away.</div><br><div class="l">From early morning till the midnoon hour</div>
               <div class="l">We travelled in the mountains, then a plain</div>
               <div class="l">Opened below, &amp; rose upon the sight</div>
               <div class="l">Like boundless ocean from a hill-top seen.</div>
               <div class="l">A beautiful &amp; populous plain it was,</div>
               <div class="l">Fair woods were there &amp; fertilizing streams,</div>
               <div class="l">And pastures spreading wide, &amp; villages</div>
               <div class="l">In fruitful groves embowred, &amp; stately towns, </div>
               <div class="l">And many a single dwelling specking it,</div>
               <div class="l">As though for many a year the land had been</div>
               <div class="l">The land of peace, below us, where the base</div>
               <div class="l">Of the great mountains to the level sloped,</div>
               <div class="l">A broad blue lake extended far &amp; wide</div>
               <div class="l">Its waters, dark beneath the light of noon,</div>
               <div class="l">There Aztlan stood upon the farther shore;</div>
               <div class="l">Amid the shade of trees its dwellings rose,</div>
               <div class="l">Their level roofs with turrets set around</div>
               <div class="l">And battlements all burnished white, that shone</div>
               <div class="l">Like silver in the sunshine. I beheld </div>
               <div class="l">The imperial city, her far-circling walls,</div>
               <div class="l">Her garden groves &amp; stately palaces,</div>
               <div class="l">Her temples mountain-size, her thousand roofs,</div>
               <div class="l">And when I saw her might &amp; majesty</div>
               <div class="l">My mind misgave me then.</div>
               <div class="l">We reachd the shore</div>
               <div class="l">A floating Islet waited for me there,</div>
               <div class="l">The beautiful work of man; I set my foot</div>
               <div class="l">Upon green-growing herbs &amp; flowers, &amp; sate</div>
               <div class="l">Embowered in odorous shrubs; four long light boats</div>
               <div class="l">Yoked to the garden, with accordant song</div>
               <div class="l">And dip &amp; dash of oar in harmony,</div>
               <div class="l">Bore me across the lake.</div>
               <div class="l">Then in a car</div>
               <div class="l">Aloft by human bearers was I borne,</div>
               <div class="l">And thro the city-gate, &amp; thro long lines</div>
               <div class="l">Of marshalled multitudes who throng’d the way,</div>
               <div class="l">We reached the palace court; four Priests were there,</div>
               <div class="l">Each held a burning censor in his hand,</div>
               <div class="l">And strewed the precious gum as I drew nigh,</div>
               <div class="l">And held the steaming fragrance forth to me</div>
               <div class="l">As I had been a God, they led me in,</div>
               <div class="l">Where on his throne the royal Azteca</div>
               <div class="l">Coanocotzin sate. ‘Stranger!’ said he,</div>
               <div class="l">Welcome, &amp; be this coming to thy weal!</div>
               <div class="l">A desperate warfare does thy courage court:</div>
               <div class="l">But thou shalt see the people &amp; the power</div>
               <div class="l">Whom thy deluded zeal would call to arms,</div>
               <div class="l">So may the knowledge make thee timely wise,</div>
               <div class="l">The valiant love the valiant. Come with me!’</div><br><div class="l">He said &amp; rose, we went together forth</div>
               <div class="l">To the Great Temple, twas a huge square hill</div>
               <div class="l">Or rather like a<span class="strikethrough">n</span> rock it seem’d hewn out,</div>
               <div class="l">And squared by patient labour; never yet</div>
               <div class="l">Did our forefathers oer their leader fallen</div>
               <div class="l">In glorious battle, heap a monument </div>
               <div class="l">Of that prodigious bulk, tho every shield </div>
               <div class="l">Was laden for his grave, &amp; every hand</div>
               <div class="l">Toild unremitting at the willing work</div>
               <div class="l">From morn till eve all the long summer day</div><br><div class="l">The ascent was lengthened with provoking art,</div>
               <div class="l">By steps that led but to a wearying path</div>
               <div class="l">Round the whole structure, then another flight</div>
               <div class="l">Another road all round, &amp; thus a third </div>
               <div class="l">And yet a fourth before we reached the height.</div>
               <div class="l">Lo now!’ Coanoctozin cried, ‘thou seest</div>
               <div class="l">The cities of this widely-peopled plain,</div>
               <div class="l">And wert thou on yon farthest temple-top</div>
               <div class="l">Yet as far on ward wouldst thou see the land</div>
               <div class="l">Well-husbanded, like this, &amp; full of men.</div>
               <div class="l">They tell me that two floating palaces</div>
               <div class="l">Brought thee &amp; all thy people … when I sound</div>
               <div class="l">The trumpet of the God, ten cities hear</div>
               <div class="l">Its voice, &amp; answer to the call in arms.’</div><br><div class="l">In truth I felt my weakness, &amp; the view</div>
               <div class="l">Had wakened no unreasonable fear,</div>
               <div class="l">But that a nearer sight had stirrd my blood:</div>
               <div class="l">For on the summit where we stood, four Towers</div>
               <div class="l">Where piled with human skulls, &amp; all around</div>
               <div class="l">Long files of human heads were strung to parch</div>
               <div class="l">And <span class="strikethrough">blacken</span> &lt;whiten&gt; in the sun. what then I felt</div>
               <div class="l">Was more than natural courage, twas a trust</div>
               <div class="l">In more than mortal strength, a faith in God,</div>
               <div class="l">An inspiration from the Almighty One</div>
               <div class="l">Whose Champion then I seemd to be. I cried </div>
               <div class="l">Not tho ten cities ten times obeyed</div>
               <div class="l">The King of Aztlans bidding, should I fear</div>
               <div class="l">The power of man!’</div>
               <div class="l">Art thou then more than man?</div>
               <div class="l">He answered, &amp; I saw his tawney cheek</div>
               <div class="l">Lose its life-colour as the fear arose;</div>
               <div class="l">Nor did I undeceive him from that fear,</div>
               <div class="l">For sooth I knew not how to answer him,</div>
               <div class="l">And therefore let it work, till we had reach’d </div>
               <div class="l">The court, no word Coanoctozin spake.</div>
               <div class="l">And I too went in silent thoughtfulness,</div>
               <div class="l">But then, when save Lincoya, there was no one</div>
               <div class="l">To hear our speech, again did he renew </div>
               <div class="l">The query. ‘Stranger! art thou more than man</div>
               <div class="l">That thou shouldst set the power of man at nought?</div>
               <div class="l">Then I replied. ‘two floating Palaces</div>
               <div class="l">Bore me &amp; all my people over the seas.</div>
               <div class="l">When we departed from our mother land</div>
               <div class="l">The moon was newly born, we saw her wax</div>
               <div class="l">And wane, &amp; witnessed her new birth again,</div>
