                           likely to have been an early version of carbon paper, first patented by Ralph Wedgwood
                           (1766–1837) on 7 October 1806 as the ‘stylographic manifold writer’; see Southey to

                           The attack caused more damage to the town than the fleet, and Napoleon initiated a

                  Pelayo – a hero of fifty, – on whom I could throw a new interest by making him not
                  so much a Goth as a Cantabrian, – an ancient-Briton-Spaniard, – for which there is
                  authority enough for my purpose. His daughter Ormisinda, Munuza the tributary governor
                  who chuses to have her for his wife, &amp; so irritates Pelayo to revolt. Young Alonso,
                  who married her &amp; became King in her right, Count Julian &amp; Oppas among the Moors.
                  Egilona the Queen of Rodrigo, now wife of a Moorish chief. Rodrigo himself as a hermit,
                  &amp; Florinda – in a state of half derangement, finally killing herself in her fathers
                  sight. The storming of Gijon, the death of Munuza &amp; the marriage of Alonso would form
                  the conclusion.
