                           translated poems for Duppa’s Life and Works of Michel Angelo Buonarroti, with his
                           Poetry and Letters, which was published in 1806. Wordsworth translated one sonnet;
                           Southey three sonnets and a madrigal. A further poem, ‘And sweet it is to see in summer
                           time’, was a joint effort, the first four stanzas by Wordsworth, the following five
                           by Southey. See Kenneth Curry, ‘Uncollected Translations of Michelangelo by Wordsworth

                  all others was the least to be expected or foreseen. To indemnify the Merchants whose

                           had captured the Spanish brig Isabella and the ship Conception, both laden with wine
                           and brandy, and the ship Commerce, laden with cotton. It was customary for naval officers
                           to be allotted a share of the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict,
                           but in this case the prize money was withheld because the ships were captured before
                           war was officially declared. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share

                  that it is very probable the ministry may give it up, if the thing be taken up well
                  in the newspapers. I am trying to get the Courier open to me, as being ministerial;
                  – &amp; will open as many batteries as I can – if government will have the money. it shall <span class="strikethrough">have</span> &lt;pay&gt; its full price of unpopularity. It is in fact robbing the sailors to indemnify

                  &amp; many Officers have received money from the agents in advance which they are utterly
