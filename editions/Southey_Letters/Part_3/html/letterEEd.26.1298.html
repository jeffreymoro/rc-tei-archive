                  a quarter where it could be better spared. I say this from no feeling of repugnance
                  at accepting such support; – had you your brothers fortune I would rather receive
                  from you than from government – as it is, if you can pension quarter me upon the Treasury
                  – by all means do. – Of course in this topsey-turveying I never thought of myself,
                  – except indeed in a sort of half hope that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> might have been promoted. As for the question on which you are ousted it may perhaps
