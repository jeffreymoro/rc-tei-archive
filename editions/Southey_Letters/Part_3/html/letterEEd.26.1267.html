                           for thirty years. He was the brother of Gilbert Wakefield (1756–1801; DNB), the Unitarian
                           classical scholar and radical pamphleteer, whom Coleridge and Southey admired and
                           whose death after a period of imprisonment was mourned by the Aikin family and other
                           Unitarian dissenters.</span></div>
                  </div> from haste, letters &amp; a proof-sheet (which requires immediate attention) coming in
                  while I was writing to you, which put it out of my head. What your loss must have
                  been struck me when I read his death in the newspaper, &amp; I sincerely condole with
                  you upon the occasion. The character which you sent me I like well, &amp; what you have
                  (in your last) added to it better, because it is more <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> discriminating. – You ask me for an inscription, – the successful one I conjecture
                  will come from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikinJohn">D<sup>r</sup> Aikin</a> ; a likely man – from family &amp; friendly feelings to attempt one, &amp; a likely one to
                  succeed in it. The <span class="ital">lapidary</span> style is of all others the most difficult, – I have a volume written upon it by a
                  German – but it is not here, &amp; I have never yet read it. In my own judgement the shorter
                  such things are the better, – <span class="ital">all</span> cannot be said upon stone, <span class="strikethrough">some gain</span> comprehension therefore should be aimed at, – not discrimination. I would enter his
                  character at length in the register ‘by special desire of his Parishioners’ – &amp; inscribe
                  the stone with something to this purport</p>
