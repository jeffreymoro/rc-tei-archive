            <p class="indent1">The date of my letter will not much surprize you after what you heard from your brother.
               The fact is that after consulting upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> business well with his friends in London, it was not thought necessary for me to
               visit Herefordshire. Bristol then became as much out of the question as out of the
               way – I put myself into the Carlisle mail on Saturday evening, &amp; arrived safe &amp; sound
               yesterday afternoon. The noise of the coach is still in my ears, &amp; my solids seem
               to be jellified by so much shaking. but I am quite well, thank God, &amp; heartily happy
               to feel myself at home, by my own fire side, &amp; once more in my Cumberland costume.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>London never agreed with me so ill – I caught a severe cold &amp; cough, &amp; felt my breathing
                  much affected by that cursed composition of smoke, dust, smuts, human breath, &amp; marsh
                  vapour, which passes for an atmosphere in the metropolis. For ten days I was unwell
                  enough to render it quite prudent to abstain from animal food &amp; all fermented liquors;
                  so wherever I went I dined upon fish &amp; vegetables like a Catholic in Lent, &amp; drank
                  water as rigidly as a Turk. It served me also as an excuse for refusing invitations
                  which I had no wish to accept, so I past much part of my time at home, that is at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</a>, &amp; usually got to bed at my own right seasonable hour, as soon as the clock struck
                  ten. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<sup>rs</sup> Rickman</a> is a very good natured woman, who made the hours quite pleasant to me. I was left

                  dined there or abroad. John the boy,
