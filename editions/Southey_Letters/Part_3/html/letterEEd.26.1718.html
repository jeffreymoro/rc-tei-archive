                  This I believe it is the custom of the Admiralty not to grant, for the sake of preserving

                           (London, 1809), pp. 194–208. See S. T. Coleridge, The Friend, ed. Barbara E. Rooke,

                  of a religious madness which prevailed in Denmark (I think), and not above half a
                  century ago, precisely similar to the case in question. A set of fanatics had persuaded
                  themselves that the best way to ensure their own salvation was by committing murder,
                  in order that they might suffer death and die in a state of repentance; and they preferred
                  children for their victims on account of their innocence. It was only put a stop to
                  by condemning them to perpetual imprisonment. I cannot recollect where I met with
                  this fact, it is so many years ago, but of it I have a full and perfect recollection;
                  it is probably to be found in one of the earliest ‘Annual Registers’.

                  </div> It seems to me that upon this foundation some German <span class="ital">horrorist</span> has made up Coleridge’s story, for however monstrous the defects of law and justice
                  in any part of Europe, it is scarcely possible that execution under such circumstances
                  could have been ordered. Coleridge has related the story very finely, but the description
                  of Maria’s voice and countenance is too beautiful for its place; it is too much like
                  poetry. We should beware of mingling fancy with the narration of what we believe to
                  be truth, – I mean to say of weaving it into, and making it part of, the story. However
