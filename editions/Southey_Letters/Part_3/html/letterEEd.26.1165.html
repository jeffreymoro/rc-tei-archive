            <p class="indent1">I have a fine story for you of which all the people in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> are at this moment brimfull. There is a man here of some little credit among the
               people as doing well in the world &amp; being very religious. He keeps a little hole of
               a shop where he sells sugar &amp; tea &amp; stationary, has about fifty circulating books,
               besides a few methodistical ones which last he lends gratis to any body who will read
               them. This mans son has just written him <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> what I am about to tell you, from Newcastle as a circumstance &lt;which has&gt; just happened
               in that neighbourhood. The old methodist believes it, – &amp; half the servants in the
               town will not be able to sleep tonight in consequence of their terror.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A man of reprobate character was playing at cards so late on Saturday night that somebody
               warned him to leave off, because, as the Irishman says, it was Sunday morning. The
               fellow replied he would sit there till the day of judgement &amp; immediately as he had
               uttered the words – <span class="ital">he past away</span>. This is the phrase here for dying, &amp; the very words in which one of our maids has
               just related the story. Well – there the corpse remained sitting at the table &amp; the
               candle burning before him, unconsumed; they could not move him from the chair to bury
               him, nor could they extinguish the candle. – the house has been deserted – as you
               may well suppose – &amp; there till the day of Judgement he is to remain, – a <span class="ital">sitting</span> miracle. It is a very fine story, &amp; I should like to know the <span class="strikethrough">pro</span> rise &amp; progress of the latter part of it. That a man may have died suddenly when
               playing at cards is very likely.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have noticed so many stories of these judgements as they are called in the newspapers
                  that I begin to suspect the Methodists are following the laudable example of the Saints
                  of former times, &amp; inventing pious lies. One such contingency &lt;indeed&gt; certainly happened
                  at Devizes some thirty years ago. There is a monument there to record it, &amp; the thing
                  was public. But Gordon &amp; Trenchards argument against witchcraft applies to such cases
                  as these. <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> did you ever see it in Catos Letters?

                           on various anti-clerical, anti-papist, and anti-corruption publications which became
                           very influential in Britain and America. Trenchard and Gordon submitted letters, usually
                           under the pseudonym of Cato, between 1720 and 1723 to the London Journal and later

                  a few old women this is the drift of what he says, &amp; it is worth looking at to see
                  how well it is said. And so, if any other argument was necessary against the notion
                  of particular providence than that it derogates from general providence, – that these
                  things are done in a corner would be sufficient. Jupiter chose a fit subject when
