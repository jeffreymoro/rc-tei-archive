               his views in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. Smith’s review of ‘Ingram on Methodism’ appeared in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, 11 (January 1808), 341–362, and he reviewed ‘Indian Missions’ in the next issue
               12 (April 1808), 151–181). In the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 1 (February 1809), 193–226, Southey reviewed the <em>Periodical Accounts Relative to the Baptist Missionary Society</em> (published from 1794); [John Scott-Waring (1747–1819; <em>DNB</em>)], <em>Vindication of the Hindoos from the Aspersions of the Reverend Claudius Buchanan,
                  M.A. With a Refutation of the Arguments Exhibited in his Memoir, on the Expediency
                  of an Ecclesiastical Establishment for British India, and the Ultimate Civilization
                  of the Natives, by their Conversion to Christianity… By a Bengal Officer</em> (1808); Thomas Twining (1776–1861; <em>DNB</em>), <em>A Letter to the Chairman of the East India Company, on the Danger of Interfering in
                  the Religious Opinions of the Natives of India; and on the Views of the British and
                  Foreign Bible Society, as Directed to India</em> (1807). In his turn, Smith responded in ‘Styles on Methodists and Missions’, in the
               <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, 14 (April 1809), 40–50.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
