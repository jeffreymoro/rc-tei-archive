                           Southey had previously expressed his interest in this project; see Southey to Ebenezer
                           Elliott, 13 October 1808 (Letter 1519) and 22 November 1809 (Letter 1711). See also

                  </div> In the first place it will not sell. Depend upon it that unless a poem has the good
                  luck to become fashionable (upon which the writer has no more reason to calculate
                  than <span class="strikethrough">x</span> upon a prize in the lottery) – there are not twenty copies which sell out of the circle
                  of the authors immediate friends, &amp; very few even of those become purchasers. Of the
                  many volumes of poetry which are published every year there is not one in a score
                  which pays the printers bill. Unless you get a bookseller to take the risk of the
                  work (which it is not likely that you will do) you must lay your account at losing
                  seven eighths of what the publication will cost. This is not all. If the Reviews do
                  not treat you with insolence, they will with neglect; – it is the <span class="strikethrough">x</span> humour of these evil days. You will be dismissed with half a dozen contemptuous lines
                  in the monthly catalogue, – or if they make you of more consequence, it will only
                  be for the malicious purpose<span class="strikethrough">s</span> of displaying their talent at sarcasm. In either case your feelings will be wounded,
                  &amp; perhaps, which is far worse, your heart discouraged. These will be the present inconveniences,
                  &amp; hereafter, even if you escaped from these, you will regret the publication as premature.
                  For I am firmly persuaded that you will accomplish things so much better than the
                  Soldiers Love that you yourself will one day be the last person to acknowledge the
                  merit which it displays. – so strongly will you perceive its defects. I am advising
                  you from my own experience, &amp; that of <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> other persons with whose literary history I am well acquainted, – &amp; this is the uniform
                  &amp; unavoidable consequence of premature publication.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Madoc is perhaps too severely written. Your nature leads you to a more ambitious style
               &amp; you will do well to follow it, – but beware of amplifying too much. &amp; do not let
               the path of your narration be hid by the flowers which you scatter as you go on. Always
               remember too that whenever your subject reaches the height of passion – all thoughts
               of ornamenting it must be laid aside. You must then trust to the passion itself, –
               as painters when they want to express exertion delineate the naked <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> muscles.</p>
