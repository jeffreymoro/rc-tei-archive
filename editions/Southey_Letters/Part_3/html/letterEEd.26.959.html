Among James’s own works were <em>Providence Displayed: or, The Remarkable Adventures of Alexander Selkirk</em> (1800). He also tried his hand at poetry, including <em>The Pilgrim’s Progress.

An associate of the members of the Baptist Missionary Society Committee,
               James was well placed to supply the <em>Periodical Accounts Relative to the Baptist Missionary Society</em>, 6 vols (1800–1817). These were published as a periodical beginning in 1793, but
               then as bound volumes beginning in 1800.
