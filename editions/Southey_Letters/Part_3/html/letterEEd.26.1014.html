                  Irish woman by name Louisa Bourke,

                  </div> who went thro her year of probation resolutely &amp; professed. She had left her own country
                  &amp; thus abandoned the world in a fit of jealousy. Her lover at length traced her, followed
                  her &amp; spoke with her at the grate. They corresponded upon the means of getting her
                  out by way of dispensation – the scheme was discovered – &amp; it was said Louise died <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> soon after. Jane Power was ill at this time. After her recovery being in a remote
                  part of the Convent which was not <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> in use, she heard Louisa’s voice as within the wall, thought it was her spirit &amp; asked
                  if she should order any services for her soul. Louisa directed her how to find an
                  entrance to her place of confinement, which was on a higher story, matted round &amp;
                  so entirely remote from all hearing that she had even her instrument there. She had
                  that day got down by finding some means of slipping back a lock or bolt &amp; by the same
                  means Jane was enabled to visit her which she did regularly every night for some months.
                  Once she staid later than usual, because her friend appeared more depressed than she
                  had ever seen her; in consequence of this delay her lamp being exhausted went out
                  in the cloisters, she was afraid that she might mistake her cell &amp; thus be discovered,
                  &amp; therefore sat herself down to wait for day break. When the dawn came she thought
                  she would first go back &amp; tell Louisa how she had past the night. She knocked &amp; received
                  no answer. She pusht the door &amp; found something against it. – <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> on opening it saw Louisa lying on the ground with her throat cut from ear to ear.
                  Jane Power immediately fainted – &amp; in that state was found by the Nuns who came with
                  food for their prisoner. They made her take a solemn vow never to reveal what she
                  had seen.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">She continued several years longer in the nunnery – her sister’s husband had a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> civil appointment in our army there: – (his name is Heatley or Headley) &amp; latterly
               the frequent visits of her sister &amp; her English friends made her life more chearful
               than that of a nun usually can be. When the troops were removing she complained bitterly
               to her sister &amp; Heatley determined to carry her off. he conveyed boy’s cloaths to
               her, &amp; gave her his watch to know the hour, &amp; that all might be well made the male
               part of the establishment drunk. <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> Jane in her disguise came to the door the key creaked – she had resolution to go
               back to the dormitory &amp; dip it in the lamp. The hour was too soon – for never having
               &lt;had&gt; a watch before she had not wound it up, &amp; she flung the watch over the wall
               for a signal instead of a stone. However she effected her escape.</p>
