            <p class="indent1">I am a little surprized at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillThomas">M<sup>r</sup> Hills</a> pertinacity. – Three years ago I received a letter signed with that name requesting
               that <span class="strikethrough">my xxx</span> &lt;I&gt; would be graciously pleased to beautify the Monthly Mirror with my portrait,
               – to which I returned a civil answer declining that honour, as I had done on former
               occasions of the same kind. here it ended – I afterwards became acquainted with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillThomas">M<sup>r</sup> Hill</a>, who is the very useful dry-salter in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#QueenHithe">Queen Hithe</a>, – &amp; recognised his hand-writing. but the portrait has never since been mentioned
               to me, &amp; I am still in the same mind, that it is better to keep out of the Magazines.
               If you are plagued again say I have an objection to it, &amp; have <span class="strikethrough">always</span> returned the same answer to other applications.</p>
