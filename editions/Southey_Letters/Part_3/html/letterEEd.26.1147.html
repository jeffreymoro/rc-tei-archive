               <div class="salute">Dear Rickman</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Before I speak of myself let me say something upon a more important subject. Nature
               has given <span class="ital">offensive</span> armour for two reasons. in the first place it is <span class="ital">defensive</span> because it serves to intimidate. a better reason is that claws &amp; teeth are the tools
               with which animals must get their living. <span class="strikethrough">X</span> that the general system of one creature eating another is a benevolent one needs
               little proof; – there <span class="ital">must</span> be death, &amp; what can be wiser than thus to make death subservient to life?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As for a state of nature, the phrase as applied to man is stark naked nonsense. Savage
                  man is a degenerated animal. My own belief is that the present human race is not much
                  more than six thousands years old – according to the concurrent testimony of all rational
                  history – the Indian records are good for nothing. But add as many millenniums as
                  you will, the question how came they here at first still recurs, this <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> infinite series, is an infinite absurdity, &amp; to suppose them growing like mushrooms,
                  or maggots in mud, is as bad. Man must have been <span class="ital">made</span> here, or <span class="ital">placed</span> here, with sufficient powers bodily &amp; mental for his own support – I think the most
                  reasonable opinion is that the first men <span class="strikethrough">were</span> had a knowledge of language &amp; of religion – in short that the tales of a golden or
                  patriarchal age are in their foundations true. How soon the <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> civilized being regenerates under unfavourable circumstances has been enough proved
                  by history. Free will – God, &amp; final retribution solve all difficulties. that Deity
                  cannot be understood is a stupid objection – without one we can understand nothing.
                  – I cannot put down my thought methodically without much revision &amp; re-arrangement
                  – but you may see what I would be at – it is no difficult thing to harpoon the Leviathan

            <p class="indent1">London disorders me by over-stimulation. I dislike its society more from reflection
               than from feeling. Company to a certain degree intoxicates me. I do not often commit
               the fault of talking too much, – but very often say what would be better unsaid, &amp;
               that too in a manner not to be easily forgotten. People go away &amp; repeat single sentences
               <span class="strikethrough">forgetting</span> dropping all that led to them &amp; all that explains them – <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> very probably too in my hearty hatred of assentation I commit faults of the opposite
               kind. Now I am sure to find this out myself – &amp; to get out of humour with myself;
               – what prudence I have is not ready at demand &amp; so it is that &lt;the&gt; society of any
               except my friends tho it may be sweet in the mouth is bitter in the belly. Besides
               I get a head ache usually – how should it be otherwise when my habits are so thoroughly
               recluse?</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You may account by other means for the spread of the Mexican religion than by any
                  love of blood. man is by nature a religious animal, &amp; if the elements &lt;of religion&gt;
                  were not innate in him (as I am convinced they are) sickness would make him so. You
                  will find that all savages connect superstition with disease. – some cause which they
                  can neither comprehend nor controul affects them painfully, – &amp; the <span class="strikethrough">uniform</span> remedy always is to appease an offended Spirit or drive away a malignant one. Even
                  in enlightened societies you will find that men more readily believe what they <span class="ital">fear</span> than what they hope. religions therefore which threaten damnation, &amp; which impose <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> privations &amp; self-torture have always been more popular than any other. How many of
                  our boys amusements consist in bearing pain, – grown children like to do the same
                  from a different motive, – you will more easily persuade a man to wear a hair cloth
                  drawers, to flog himself, or swing upon a hook, than to conform to the plain rules
                  of morality &amp; common sense. I shall have to <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> look into this subject when writing of the spirit of Catholicism, which furnishes
                  as good an illustration as the practices of the Hindoos. Here in England <span class="strikethrough">you find</span> Calvinism is the popular faith, – where one man believes in universal restitution,
                  there are fifty who believe that he will be damned for his damnable opinion. Beyond
                  all doubt the religion of the Mexicans is the most diabolical that has ever existed
                  – it is not however by any means so mischievous as the Braminical system of casts,
                  which, wherever it exists, has put a total stop to the amelioration of society. The
                  Mexicans were rapidly advancing. Were you more at leisure I should urge you to bestow
                  a weeks study upon the Spanish language for the sake of the mass of information contained
                  in their travellers &amp; historians. I cannot express to you the utter contempt in which
                  I hold Robertson in consequence of having read what he ought to have studied.
