            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>If I had leisure to enter into a new correspondence I would thank Mr Walhouse for
                  his curious paper by letter,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Edward John Walhouse (1791–1862), Sir Edward Littleton’s nephew and heir. He assumed
                           the name of Littleton on Sir Edward’s death in 1812, and became MP for Stafford. The
                           ‘paper’ has not been traced.</span></div>
                  </div> – but you know how very much I am employed, &amp; that it is not possible for me to write
                  with tolerable regularity to the friends already on my list. Almost every letter that
                  reaches me brings with it a complaint, &amp; every one which goes from me has occasion
                  to begin with an apology. Do you say this for me, &amp; excuse me in the handsomest manner
                  you can. Part of the paper I had seen in a Birmingham Newspaper, &amp; easily guessed
                  who was its author. It is very odd &amp; ingenious, – tho it is not to be supposed that
                  I am who am both Whig &amp; Dissenter can assent to its philosophy. Mr Walhouse speaks
                  in parables; – seeing things vividly &amp; combining them rapidly, he expresses himself
                  as if the type &amp; the thing typified were the same: thus because those principles which
                  would be beneficial to our body politic may be likened to the constituent parts of
                  Lemington Water,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                  </div> he says Lemington water will save the King; – not that he can possibly mean that the
                  King &amp; the body politic are one, – or that good political principles are the same
                  things as carbonate of iron &amp;c – or even that Lemington water, drastic as it may be,
                  can purge away political corruption, or natural stupidity. There are some persons
                  whose ideas are so vivid as to produce all the effect of actual impressions, &amp; to
                  be mistaken for such. You have heard me relate a remarkable instance in my own case,
                  before I went last to Lisbon. The phantoms produced by laudanum are of this description.
                  When the body is weak, &amp; the patient makes the mistake he is what is called light-headed,
                  &amp; it is beyond a doubt in this state of mind that so many ghosts have been seen, –
                  which did really exist in the sight of the beholder, – &amp; had no other existence. These
                  peoples perception differs from that of others in its excessive vividness, – so if
                  I am not mistaken, do the reasoning powers of Mr Walhouse. He passes so rapidly from
                  his premises to his conclusions, that you know not by what process he has got there.
                  If I am in the top of one tree, &amp; want to get to another, I must descend the first
                  &amp; then climb the second, – but he jumps from one to the other like a squirrel, &amp; they
                  who are not like squirrels in their understanding cannot follow him. – It is plain
                  that he is a very ingenious man, &amp; I have no doubt a very interesting one. If his
                  inclination should ever lead him to the lakes, I shall be glad to show him all the
                  attention in my power, &amp; to talk with him upon matters on which I have no time to
                  write. As he is an amateur of waters, you may tell him that there is some of the finest
                  &amp; purest in the world at poor old Peter Crosthwaites
