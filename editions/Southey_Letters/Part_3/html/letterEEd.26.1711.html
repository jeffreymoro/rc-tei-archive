                           Southey had previously expressed his interest in Elliott’s projected poem; see Southey
                           to Ebenezer Elliott, 13 October 1808, Letter 1519. See also Southey to Ebenezer Elliott,
                           29 December 1809 (Letter 1725), 9 February 1810 (Letter 1743) and 1 August 1810 (Letter
                           1796) The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four.</span></div>
                  </div> little more than a week; – yesterday I carefully perused it (not having had leisure
                  before) – &amp; should this evening have written to you, even if your letter had not arrived.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">There are in this poem (which appears to me an alteration of that whereof you formerly
               sent me an extract) unquestionable marks both of genius &amp; the power of expressing
               it. I have no doubt that you will succeed in attaining the fame after which you aspire,
               but you have yet to learn how to plan a poem, – when you can do this I am sure you
               <span class="strikethrough">will</span> are able to execute it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The Soldiers Love, being the title, should have been the main &amp; moving subject of
               this tale. Its connection however with the conquest of Quebec is <span class="strikethrough">merely</span> altogether arbitrary, &amp; purely episodical. The expedition is not undertaken in consequence
               of your hero’s history, nor is he any otherwise instrumental to its success than as
               any other soldier who did his duty. Nothing is produced by the passionate state in
               which you have placed him. – he fights indeed &amp; falls, – but only as he might &amp; would
               have done had he left Eliza his wife. The circumstance of his killing his fathers
               murderer is one of those improbabilities which it is always proper to avoid, because
               they are instantly felt as such. Such an incident is indeed of too high a character
               to be casually &amp; incidentally introduced, – there should be preparation for it, &amp;
               it should be made a thing of importance in the main action.</p>
            <p class="indent1">This is my advice to you– lay this poem aside as one whose defects are incurable.
               Plan another, &amp; be especially careful in planning it. See that your circumstances
               naturally produce each other, &amp; that there be nothing in the story which could be
               taken away without dislocating the whole fabric. Ask yourself the question is this
               incident of any use? does it result from what goes before? does it influence what
               is to follow? Satisfy yourself compleatly with the plan before you begin to execute
               it. I do not mean to say that the detail must be filled up. – only make the skeleton
               perfect. There is no danger of your getting into the faults of common place writers,
               otherwise I could recommend to you to read some of the bad epic writers, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> for the sake of learning what to avoid in the composition of a story.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In your execution you are too exuberant in ornament &amp; resemble the French engravers
                  who take off the attention from the subject of their prints by the flowers &amp; trappings
                  of the foreground. This makes you indistinct, but distinctness is the great charm
                  of narrative poetry. – see how beautifully it is exemplified in Spenser our great
                  English master of narration, whom you cannot study too much, nor love too dearly.
                  Your first book reminded me of our old pastoral poet William Brown,

                  </div> – he has the same fault of burying his story in flowers, – it is one of those faults
                  which are to be wished for in the writings of all young <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> poets. I am satisfied that your turn of thought &amp; feeling is for this higher branch
                  of the art, &amp; not for lighter subjects. Your language would well suit the drama, –
                  have your thoughts ever been turned to it?</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I will only notice one minor fault. <span class="ital">Regina</span> is not a word to be used as you have used it. Its simple meaning is Queen &amp; nothing
               else.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Where shall I send your poem? – If when you have planned another you think proper
               to send me the plan I will comment <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> upon it where it may be of use to point out its defects. It would give me great pleasure
               to be of any service to a man of genius, &amp; such I believe you to be. If business ever
               brings you this way, let me <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> see you. Should I ever travel thro Rotherham I will find you out. I have spoken so
               plainly &amp; freely of your defects that you can have no doubt of my sincerity when I
               conclude by saying <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> go on, &amp; you will prosper.</p>
            <div class="closer">yours respectfully &amp; with the best good wishes 
               <div class="indent2">Robert Southey</div>
            </div>
            <p>One thing more. forget this poem while you are planning another, lest you spoil that
               for the sake of appropriating materials from this.</p>
