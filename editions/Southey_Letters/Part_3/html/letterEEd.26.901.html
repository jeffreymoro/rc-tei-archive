                  companion work. There will be a preliminary essay on the state of our Literature at
                  the Restoration, referring more particularly to poetry, as affected by that event;
                  then, upon Ellis’s plan, and beginning where he leaves off, a brief biographical notice
                  of every English poet from that time, with the best or most characteristic specimen
                  of his works, arranging the authors chronologically, and bringing them down to the
                  present time, exclusive only of living authors. I include every poet, good, bad, and
                  indifferent, who had any reputation, or produced any effect in his day. A sort of
                  estimate of the present state of our poetry will conclude it. And this work, with
                  Ellis’s, will contain accounts and specimens of all the English poets, so that, reckoning
                  upon the notoriety of his book, and the market value of my name, this bids fair to
                  be a profitable speculation.

                  I tried how far it would be advisable to adopt the mode of subscription, and, after
                  feeling the ground safely and certainly, was convinced that any public attempt would

                  in giving the book these eye-catching utilities, which are always hearty shoves to
                  a heavy quarto; and that I might receive large interest, instead of paying large discount;
                  for, in fact, that is the clear mode of stating it. I have hopes that this volume
                  will do well, being certain that it will please those of whose approbation I am desirous.

               Joachim’s three books (<em>Liber Concordiae Novi ac Veteris Testamenti, Expositio in Apocalipsim</em>, and<em>Psalterium Decem Cordarum</em>) constituted the Eternal Gospel, replacing the Gospel of Christ, for the spiritual
