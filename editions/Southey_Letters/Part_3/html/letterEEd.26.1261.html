                  </div> I have desired his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Doctorship</a> to show himself to you. You will find him less a coxcomb than is to be apprehended
                  from such a person, excellently-good-natured, &amp; better informed than most men of his
                  years. He does not love hard work I believe – whatever knowledge he gets – he gets
                  at a heat like a greyhound, – but I do not think he will ever <span class="ital">nose</span> out any thing, like a good hound, tho his nose like mine is quite long enough for
                  all useful purposes. However he is a very likeable personage, &amp; if he were not, I
                  would not pin a direction upon his back &amp; send him to your door, tho he were tentimes
                  my brother.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I have something else to say. You are no picturesque man – but notwithstanding that
               – is it not possible to prevail upon you to spend your next summer leisure here? –
               &amp; if there be no cogent reason against it <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanSusannah">M<sup>rs</sup> Rickman</a> with you? – We shall have ample house room – the Coleridges all migrating in the
               early spring – that we shall be heartily &amp; most heartily glad to see both – need not
               I hope be said, – &amp; this I will vouch for, that if you were here, long as the journey
               is you would think the trouble well bestowed. You might see Liverpool on the way returning
               – &amp; York on the way coming – two places which should be seen – I have a boat on the
               lake – am the best guide in the country, &amp; will walk with you to all the out-of-the-way
               places. You cannot well understand what an extraordinary country this is unless you
               were to see it. Think of this.</p>
