               <p>My letters (which relate to Portugal exclusively, not Spain) are not in much forwardness:

                  </div> &amp; this as a matter of less moment has been going on at intervals. Having however the
                  whole materials before me as written to my brother at the time, or entered in my own
                  memorandum books, they may certainly be ready for the press in a few weeks, &amp; if printed
                  in a small size, two volumes may be going on at once.

                  that form the most profitable. You must know best, &amp; certainly, in other respects,
