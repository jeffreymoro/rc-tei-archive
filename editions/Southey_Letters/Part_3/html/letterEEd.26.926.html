                  Indian planters, than to any effects that invasion can produce, if indeed Bonaparte
                  does design to invade us – &amp; if he be permitted to live to carry his design into execution.
                  Pichegru was probably murdered. it does not appear to me a practicable mode of suicide.
                  one convulsive motion might have slipt the stick &amp; loosened the handkerchief, &amp; there
                  was a motive for murdering him.
