                  Trieste, charged, as we suppose from his former letters, with dispatches overland
                  from Naples. He would be at Vienna not much before the French, but the danger of travelling
                  in a country full of soldiers is so great that I am far more alarmed than I think

                  the discussion was stopt fairly deceived me. Had the positive assurance that I was

               1804. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share of the prize money reinstated
               and <em>The Courier</em> published a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday
               24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
