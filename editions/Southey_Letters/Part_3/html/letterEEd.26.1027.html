                           Portugal (1749). When Littleton, via Barker’s letters, had previously sought information
                           about ‘Price’s book on Spain’ Southey had forgotten that Price is an anglicised form
                           of ap Rhys, and had mistaken the author, looking for a work on Spain by his contemporary
                           Uvedale Price (1747–1829; DNB), author of an Essay on the Picturesque (1796), rather
                           than one by Price’s grandfather Udal ap Rhys/Uvedale Tomkyns Price (1685–1764). Thus,
                           writing to Barker on 1 May 1804 (see letter 931, of this edition) he declared that…</span></div>

                  along concluded that you meant the present man, never recollecting that Uvedale Price
                  is the English of what had appeared to me very uncouth for a title page not above
                  fifty years old. I have seen the book, &amp; cursorily looked it thro, only cursorily
                  because it is my intention to buy it whenever it falls in my way, – as a part of my
                  collection. You asked if it was the work of a plagiarist – It is one of those books
                  which does not pretend to much originality – like many old travels being chiefly an
                  account of what such &amp; such towns had been, what had happened there &amp;c – things which
                  must be compiled from other authors. It is a part of my plan to give an account of
                  all the books which have been written concerning Portugal – &amp; of their respective
                  authors, &amp; as this gentleman seems to have been a very odd fellow I pray you remember
                  for me all the odd things you may hear of him, &amp; give me a list of his other works

               ‘Price’s book on Spain’ Southey had forgotten that Price is an anglicised form of
               ap Rhys, and had mistaken the author, looking for a work on Spain by his contemporary
               Uvedale Price (1747–1829; <em>DNB</em>), author of an <em>Essay on the Picturesque</em> (1796), rather than one by Price’s grandfather Udal ap Rhys/Uvedale Tomkyns Price
               (1685–1764). Thus, writing to Barker on 1 May 1804 (see letter 931, of this edition)
               he declared that he did not know Price had written such a work. On 10 December 1804
               (see letter 1010), Southey again declared his ignorance of the book. According to
               Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, (‘The Letters of Robert Southey to Mary Barker From 1800
               to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 144–147), Littleton then wrote on the

               ridicule of Whister; Fine Lady’s Catechism Conversation between 2 Lap Dogs, Scipio
               &amp; Braganza’. Because Littleton still failed to distinguish between grandfather and
               grandson, Southey continued to mistake the author in his letter to Barker of 29 December
