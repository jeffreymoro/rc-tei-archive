                           Ambleside. She was the daughter of Gerard Noel Edwardes, of Exton Park, Rutland (1759–1838;
                           DNB), who had adopted the surname Noel in 1798, and inherited a baronetcy in 1813
                           to become the 2nd Baronet Barham. When her family objected to the couple’s plans to
                           marry, their relationship ended.</span></div>
                  </div> parents she must have foreseen, – it was naturally to be expected, &amp; would just as
                  naturally have given way to proper obstinacy on her part. I see nothing that you &lt;can&gt;
                  do – except by any accident you meet her again, &amp; then you must run away in the first
                  slow waggon. – You have this for your consolation that what has happened to you, has
                  happened almost without exception to every body before, – one such disappointment
                  being as regular as the small-pox – &amp; as impossible to be suffered a second time.
                  It has too this advantage – that a man marries his second love with sobered expectations
                  &amp; as Goldsmith says not expecting rapture, makes shift to find contentment.
