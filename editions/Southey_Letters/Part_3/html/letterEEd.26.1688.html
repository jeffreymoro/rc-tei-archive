               <div class="l">Being free from mortal taint, so free from pain.</div>
               <div class="l">A joyous band, expecting soon to soar</div>
               <div class="l">To Indras happy spheres,</div>

               <div class="l">Or where their base is founded</div>
               <div class="l">None could espy. Above all reach of sight</div>
               <div class="l">They rose; the second Earth was on their height,</div>
               <div class="l">Their feet were fixd in everlasting night.</div>

               <div class="l">So deep the Gulph no eye</div>

               <div class="l">Yet all its depth must try, for this the road</div>
               <div class="l">To Padalon &amp; Yamens dread abode.</div>
               <div class="l">And from below, continually</div>
               <div class="l">Ministrant Demons rose &amp; caught</div>
               <div class="l">The souls whose hour was come,</div>
               <div class="l">Then with their burthen fraught</div>
               <div class="l">Plungd down &amp; bore them to receive their doom.</div>

               <div class="l">Then might be seen who went in hope &amp; who</div>
               <div class="l">Trembled to meet the meed</div>
               <div class="l">Of many a foul misdeed, as wild they threw</div>
               <div class="l">Their arms retorted from the Demons grasp</div>
               <div class="l">And lookd around all eagerly to seek</div>
               <div class="l">For help, where help was none; &amp; strove for aid</div>
               <div class="l">To clasp the nearest shade,</div>
               <div class="l">Yea with imploring looks &amp; horrent shriek</div>

               <div class="l">With hands extending</div>
               <div class="l">This mercy they essayd.</div>
               <div class="l">Still from the verge they strain</div>
               <div class="l">And from the dreadful gulph avert their eyes</div>
               <div class="l">In vain, down plunge the Demons &amp; their cries</div>
               <div class="l">Feebly, as down they sink, from that profound arise.</div>

               <div class="l">If Kalyals lip were blanchd with inmost dread.</div>
               <div class="l">The chill which from that icey Belt</div>
               <div class="l">Struck upward was less keen than what she felt</div>
               <div class="l">With her hearts-blood thro every limb dispread.</div>
               <div class="l">Close to the Glendoveer she clung</div>
               <div class="l">And clasping round his neck her trembling hands</div>
               <div class="l">She closd her eyes, &amp; there in silence hung</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Then to Ladurlad said the Glendoveer,</div>

               <div class="l">Of Yamen, wonder to behold us here.</div>
               <div class="l">But for the dead they come &amp; not for us.</div>
               <div class="l">Therefore albeit they gaze upon thee thus</div>
               <div class="l">Have thou no fear.</div>
               <div class="l">A little while thou must be left alone.</div>
               <div class="l">Till I have borne thy daughter down,</div>
               <div class="l">And placed her safely by the throne</div>
               <div class="l">Of him who keeps the Gate of Padalon.</div>
            </div><br><div class="stanza">
               <div class="l">Then taking Kalyal in his arms he said,</div>
               <div class="l">Be of good heart Beloved! it is I</div>
               <div class="l">Who bear thee. Saying this his wings he spread</div>
               <div class="l">Sprung upward in the sky &amp; poisd his flight </div>
               <div class="l">Then plunged in the Gulph &amp; sought the world of Night.</div>
