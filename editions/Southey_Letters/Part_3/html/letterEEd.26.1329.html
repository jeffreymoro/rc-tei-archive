            <p class="indent1">You are perfectly right in supposing I meant a <span class="ital">sandwich tray</span>. 36/<sup>s</sup> was <span class="strikethrough">the price</span> &lt;what&gt; we paid at Rings for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a>, – the difference of price therefore surprizes me. However we have no friend whom
               we can trouble at Liverpool, &amp; perhaps <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> C.</a> speaks of what <span class="ital">was</span> the price there three years ago.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You are right too in concluding that if I had received any letters from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SmithThomas">M<sup>r</sup> Smith</a> I should have answered them. One letter he wrote to me let me know his sister had
                  arrived at Lisbon, &amp; no other has ever reached me, – her return I learnt only from
                  you, &amp; accidentally from Edinburgh by way of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>. this, on my part, I also thought odd, when I thought about it – but now the mystery
                  is explained, &amp; I will without delay write to him.

                  </div> when that has been effected I shall acknowledge it: but if it be talked of in any

                  by my immediate friends, that there seems little reason to think that the book will
                  be imputed to me. I have just corrected the eleventh sheet of the last volume; – four,
                  or five more at farthest compleat it. Your copy shall be sent. I wish it were published,
                  &amp; wish also it may have a good sale, not only for a substantial reason which need
                  not be explained, but also because three volumes do not hold half of what I had to
                  say, &amp; I should be very glad to have encouragement to say it all. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a>, who sees the proofs, says it will be a famous common-sense book.</p>
