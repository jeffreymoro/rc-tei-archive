            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have to thank you for the little box of books which I found here a few days ago
               on my return from a short visit to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a>. That it came thro you I learn by my Lisbon advices and also from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ReidSamuel">Samuel Reid</a>. The cargo is deficient in three volumes which I hope have been forgotten in the
               first packing, and not lost on the way.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It will not be very long before I shall have it in my power to send you the first
                  fruits of many years hard labour. I am going to press with the Chronicle of the Cid,
                  a book of which the history is briefly this.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           in 1808.</span></div>
                  </div> In describing the state of society in the Spanish peninsula at time when Portugal
                  first became an independent state I had many years ago written an abstract of the
                  Cid’s life, as exhibiting in a connected and highly curious narrative the manners
                  of the age; for this, however, short as it was the after growth of my papers convinced
                  me that there would be no room. I then thought of enlarging it and printing it separately;
                  but in setting about this the original documents appeared to be every way so interesting
                  that I finally resolved upon setting seriously to work, and giving a Chronicle of
                  the Cid at length and more fully than it has ever yet been done even in his own country.
                  Here are three documents which I have had before me, the Poema del Cid, the oldest
                  poem in the language and perhaps the oldest work having been written almost immediately
                  after his death. The Chronica del Cid, and the Chronica Geral compiled by order of
                  Alonso el Sabio about the year 1250.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                           with additions from the Crónica de España of Alphonso the Wise (1541) and Romancero
                           e Historia del Cid (1632).</span></div>
                  </div> These two works are generally the same, that is the one has either been extracted
                  from, or engrafted into the other, each however, contains some circumstances which
                  are not in the other. With these before me, I have combined all that is contained
                  in the three into one narration, which is every where translation, tho of course it
                  differs from every one of the separate originals. I have added whatever matter is
                  to be found in other equally authentic authorities, given minute references to these
                  at the end of every section, and entered into every kind of critical investigation
                  and elucidation which was necessary in the notes.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The whole will be preceded by an introduction concerning the state of Spain under
               the Goths and Moors, which will sketch its history till the period when the Chronicle
               begins. I believe that this will be as curious a book as has ever yet appeared in
               our language.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It has pleased his most gracious Majesty, or rather it pleased <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord Grenville</a> for him just when he went out of office, to give me a pension of 200£. I thank the
                  royal bounty. It will please his Majesty to deduct from this in the shape of taxes
                  56£. I admire the royal conscience. Having thus premised that I am a pensioner I may
                  now say a word or two upon the state of affairs. Things appear to me to be hurrying
                  towards a revolution and that not from the efforts of any party to bring about one,
                  but from the total lack of all talents among our governors, and the excess of political
                  profligacy. While Pitt

                  faith is at an end. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Ld. Grenville</a> is the only man left who has the character of a statesman. In that character he is
                  greatly over-rated, and he has let the time slip when he might have acquired the highest
                  popularity by resigning those sinecures of which sooner or later he must be stripped.
                  The people begin to despise their rulers; every day they become more and more convinced
                  of the extent of their prodigality and peculation. External circumstances become daily
                  worse and worse, and what is to save the state waggon, driven so unskilfully and at
                  such an unmerciful rate, down so steep a road, what is to save it from an overturn! <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Burdett">Sir Francis Burdett</a> wants talents equal to his integrity and his popularity, but were there an able man
                  in his place, he might be the political Martin Luther of England. I was very very
                  sorry, or rather very indignant at your last election. Nothing could be more dishonourable
                  to a city which I was wont to think one of the most liberal in the kingdom; than thus
                  to displace one of the best members to make room for one of the very worst.
