            <p class="indent1">I have had my visit from the Influenza, a pleasant visitor, who liked my company well
               enough to come twice. it cost me some flesh, some physic, &amp; some time, – of the first
               &amp; last articles I have too little at all times to spare any with convenience – however
               I am come up to my original standard of leanness, – the time there is no recovering
               – I am so much behind hand with reviewing, &amp; so much the poorer. My journey to London
               will take place about the end of March – God willing, a proviso which I also insist
               upon such occasions from a deep sense of the uncertainty of all human projects, impressed
               by frequent disappointments. If you are in the way, that is if you are not out of
               it, for <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</a> lies in the road, I will rest a day with you. My way home will be by another route,
               as in all probability I shall go to Norwich for a week.</p>
            <p class="indent1">This journey is a great undertaking, &amp; not a pleasurable one, tho I have many friends
               to see, &amp; shall feel real pleasure in seeing them. But to emerge from the total seclusion
               of this place, for nothing can be more secluded than I am during my hybernation –
               &amp; go at once to London, where every day I shall be dining with a party invited expressly
               to meet me, – every morning to be past in walking &amp; every evening in talking, – where
               I shall not get to bed till after midnight, get too little milk for breakfast – &amp;
               too much wine at dinner – Senhora all this is not agreable. it puts me out of my way,
               &amp; I like my own way best. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickmans</a> is a very comfortable house, &amp; ought to be more so now if the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanSusannah">Rickwoman</a> be what I expect her to be. I like all my male friends to be married – if I had many
               females ones, I am not quite sure whether selfishness would let me form the same wish
               for them.</p>

                           (d. 1873). She was the daughter of Gerard Noel Edwardes, of Exton Park, Rutland (1759–1838;
                           DNB), who had adopted the surname Noel in 1798, and inherited a baronetcy in 1813
                           to become the 2nd Baronet Barham. When her family objected to the couple’s plans to
                           marry, the relationship soon ended; see Southey to John May, 1 November 1805, Letter
                           1116.</span></div>
                  </div> She ought to have considered them sooner. After going so far she ought to have considered
                  that she had contracted a duty towards him. However it is not much matter. First loves
                  are blossoms that rarely bear fruit, – &amp; it is perhaps well that they do not. in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harrys</a> case too I had rather he married into some less aspiring family because he has in
                  him a certain love of fashion &amp;c which needs no fostering, &amp; which if fostered would
                  destroy all better aspirations. I know he would rather be a member of Parliament than
                  any thing else, &amp; shine away as an orator. I want him to be contented in that station
                  of life to which it has pleased God to call him, to write a good book, &amp; leave a fair
                  remembrance of himself to posterity.</p>
