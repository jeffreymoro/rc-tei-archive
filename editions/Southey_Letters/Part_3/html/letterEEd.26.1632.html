            <p class="indent1">You would have heard from me a fortnight ago if I had not been disappointed – the
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">young one</a> has proved a girl – &amp; I believe my main reason for being sorry is that I have lost
               the pleasure of calling a boy by your name. A few days after her delivery <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> became very unwell, with a return of the same dysenteric symptoms which she had had
               two months before. she is however now well recovered, &amp; has this evening for the first
               time, drank tea out of her room.</p>
            <p class="indent5">____</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Seven weeks have past away since the few lines above were written, &amp; in time we have
                  had our share of suffering. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> has had the croup &amp; been saved from it, – but last night we lost <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Emma</a> by a violent bilious attack. – We are as well as can be expected after such a shock,
                  – for nothing could be more unexpected. – I had indeed oftentimes suspected there
                  was something wrong in the childs inside &amp; were we at Bristol, that should have been
                  now ascertained. Enough of this. These losses are but for a time, – this is not the
                  first that we have sustained, &amp; probably will not be the last. Neither I nor my children
                  seem made of very lasting materials, – in fact it is very unlikely that my children
                  should be. It is not altogether a fanciful analogy between a man who cultivates his
                  mental faculties exclusively, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">flowers</span> &lt;plants&gt; which are improved by culture in an artificial soil; – they bring forth fine
                  flowers, – but either they do not seed at all, – or the seedlings wither away. I often
                  think of what D<sup>r</sup> Jarrold has said of pointers, – the finest of the breed hardly ever grow up.

               will be to Bath in preference to any other place. But I have now broken ground in
               yonder church yard, – &amp; to a man who has no other freehold – even a family grave is
               something like a tie.</p>
