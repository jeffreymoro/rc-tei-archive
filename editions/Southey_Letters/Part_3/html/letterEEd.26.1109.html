                  </div> The copy of these is imperfect at the beginning, but nothing of any importance is
                  lost. The story this. Amadas has spent all his property except forty pounds. With
                  this he sets out to seek his fortune – he finds a widow sitting by a bier in a lonely
                  chapel with two tapers burning, &amp; her husbands body, which was rotting above ground,
                  because a cruel creditor would not permit it to be buried. Amadas pays 30£ to redeem
                  it, &amp; spends the other ten upon the funeral. As he rides on close thro a forest bewailing
                  his poverty aloud, a knight in white armour upon a white horse overtakes &amp; overhears
                  him; &amp; then advises him to go &amp; marry the Emperors daughter by his help, covenanting
                  to have half of whatever he shall chuse for this assistance. Accordingly he supplies
                  him with cloaths from a wreck &amp; bids him say that his retinue have perished in the
                  storm. Amadas marries the Princess &amp; has a child. The White knight comes &amp; sends up
                  word of his arrival in a <span class="strikethrough">sort of</span> suspicious way, as if he doubted whether the promise would be kept; he is most joyfully
                  &amp; gratefully received but demands to have the Princess &amp; the child cut in half. The
                  Lady on no account will permit her husband to break his promise &amp; prove a false knight,
                  &amp; lays down on a table to submit to the operation. It then appears that the White
                  Knight is the Spirit of the Merchant who does this only to prove Sir Amadas.</p>
