                  I am inclined to think he has mistaken the will for the deed, &amp; misinterpreted the

                  </div> – for I do not think that you would take this step without first consulting both him
                  &amp; me, &amp; I cannot conceive that you can need any advice at all upon the subject, it
                  being so utterly impossible with your means, &amp; so little desirable if &lt;<span class="strikethrough">xxx</span>&gt; possible. I do not know any one thing which would be so certainly prejudicial to
                  you as this which you are wishing for. In the first place you are too old – it being
                  more usual to go under eighteen than above it. in the next place you would find yourself
                  behind hand in University attainments – for the sake of obtaining immediate gratification
                  you would devote yourself to these – which would lead to nothing, &amp; you would find
                  when too late that you had abandoned one pursuit – without getting any other. Be content
                  as you are: repeated change of profession is folly in those who can afford it, – in
                  you it would be something worse. what only makes them ridiculous would ruin you. An
                  English degree is of no other use to a physician than as it enables him to be a Fellow
                  of the College of Physicians. he may practice in London as a Licentiate without it.</p>

                  </div> Since the question arrived I have found the passage on which I suppose the common
                  opinion is founded, &amp; which is certainly irrefragable. It is in a work by Oviedo whose

                           Southey: Poetical Works 1793–1810, gen. ed. Lynda Pratt, 5 vols (London, 2004), II,

                  </div> – so I need not hunt for it again. He says that the first Spaniards who went to the
                  West Indies (N B where he was <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> settled) caught it there, where it was a very common but very mild disease – &amp; he
                  goes on with the history of the war at Naples &amp;c to account for its names in France
                  &amp; in Italy. Possibly some analogous disease may have existed in Europe before, <span class="strikethrough">which was</span> &amp; this may have been a worse sort – as if the Small Pox had turned out the vaccine.
                  Certain it is that till the discovery of America it was never known as a general &amp;
                  dreadful malady. If you want more particulars tell me, &amp; I will translate the passage
                  from Oviedo at length &amp; send you chapter &amp; verse.</p>
