                  not subjects of comparisons, but it is possible to give these advantages to the hero
                  of a poem as dramatically true in its structure as Madoc, &amp; this I have done. – I

                  to talk it over, &amp; to decide whether that or the Deluge be the better subject for
                  a poem to be pitched in a higher key than Madoc.

                  as to buy such a poem as Thalaba once in eighteen months, which, if they would do
                  it, would supersede the necessity. A years reviewing certainly does not occupy so
