            <p class="indent1">We began to wonder at your silence, &amp; to look uneasily for your letters, till the
               parcel arrived. Whether <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Sir Domine</a> has yet written to thank you for the chain I know not, as he is now at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a> with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a>, – whose wife you will be glad to hear is safe in bed, with a fine girl.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I did not like leaving you, – &amp; as there has been no farther news of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> yet, am sorry he prevented me from seeing the caves in better company that is likely
                  again to fall to my lot.

                  </div> Parting is at all times a bad thing, &amp; we took leave in no very agreable circumstances

                  then cleared off till we <span class="strikethrough">reached</span> past <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a>, &amp; then began again. At <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a> we were persuaded to stay &amp; dine with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ClarksonThomas">Clarkson</a>, which I could not well refuse not having before seen him. accordingly we changed
                  ourselves, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> walked on in the evening, the weather being fine, in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworths</a> shoes, &amp; I remained the night, letting my own dry. Tho I was not footsore upon this
                  walk, yet the soaking had been so compleat that the skin of all my toes is peeling
                  off.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">We have missed you much – the more so being the daily &amp; present sight of you, seemed
               like the removal of a customary thing. I have been on the lake since you went, &amp; <span class="ital">in</span> the lake, – but never walked anywhere. I have made great progress in swimming in
               a single lesson by help of the cork jacket, going fairly on my back in the jacket,
               &amp; then without it, – an important achievement, for in swimming what is once learnt
               is never lost.</p>
