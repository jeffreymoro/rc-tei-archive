               detailing real events of the sixth century. He was attacked by John Pinkerton (1758–1826;
               <em>DNB</em>), a Scottish antiquarian and cartographer whose many publications earned him a reputation
               for irreligious views, arrogant irritability and personal immorality. Pinkerton believed
               the Celts were incapable of rising to high levels of civilisation and sought to prove
               that Scottish place names were not of Celtic origin: he wished to trace the Scottish
               people to the ancient Goths and to purge Scottish culture of Celticism. Turner replied
               to Pinkerton’s critique in 1803, in his <em>Vindication of the Genuineness of the Ancient British Poems of Aneurin, Taliessin,
                  Llywarch Hen, and Myrddin</em>. Taylor had reviewed Turner’s <em>Vindication</em> in the <em>Critical Review</em>, 3rd series, 2 (May 1804), 10–17.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
