               the Central Junta on 4 October 1808 and when the French marched on Madrid he urged
               Sir John Moore (1761–1809; <em>DNB</em>), the Commander of the British forces in northern Spain to also advance upon Madrid,
               despite his inclination to retreat through Portugal. After the disastrous retreat
               to Corunna, Frere was blamed for this advice and recalled by the British government.
               After some of Frere’s and Moore’s correspondence was read out in the Commons on 27
               April, Moore’s side of matters was presented in James Moore (1763–1860; <em>DNB</em>), <em>A Narrative of the Campaign of the British Army in Spain, Commanded by His Excellency
                  Sir John Moore. Authenticated by Official Papers and Original Letters</em> (1809). Frere’s correspondence with Moore was published in 1810 in a work entitled
               <em>To the British Nation is Presented by Colonel Venault de Charmilly, Knight of the
                  Royal and Military Order of St. Louis, the Narrative of his Transactions in Spain
