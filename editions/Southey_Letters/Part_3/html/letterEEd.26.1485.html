               – but it is a tax of some weight on the few individuals whom it affects – &amp; a good
               deal of inconvenience is occasioned to the Printers by waiting for franks, while their
               presses stand still. Few persons have greater facilities for geting franks than myself,
               yet the proofs which are without them, &amp; those which are over weight from being damp,
               or &lt;which are&gt; misdated, do not cost me less than 30/ shillings, a year. – The proofs

                  becomes fine, then vapid, – &amp; at last you come to the dregs. Moravianism is in its
                  second stage: its few proselytes fall silently in, led by <span class="strikethrough">conviction</span> &lt;solitary&gt; thought &amp; conviction, not hurried on by contagious feelings, – &amp; the main
                  body of its members have been born within the pale of &lt;the&gt; society. They do not live
                  up to the rigours of their institutions in England, – even here however it is certain
                  that they are a respectable &amp; respected people: &amp; as missionaries they are meritorious
                  beyond all others. No people but the Quakers understand how to communicate Xtianity
