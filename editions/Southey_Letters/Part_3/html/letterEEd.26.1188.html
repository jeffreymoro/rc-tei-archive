            <p class="indent1">A discovery of the original language, propounded to the consideration of the worshipful
               &amp; right worthy Master Bedford</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There was in old times a King of Egypt who did make a full politick experiment touching
                  this question, as is discoursed of by sundry antique authors; Howbeit to me it seemeth
                  that it falleth short of that clear &amp; manifest truth, &lt;the which&gt; should be the butt
                  of our enquiry. Now methinks, if it could be shown what is the very language which
                  dame Nature, the common mother of all, hath implanted in animals whom we, foolishly
                  misjudging, do term dumb, that were indeed a hit palpable, &amp; of notable import. To
                  this effect I have noted <span class="strikethrough">Latin</span> what that silly bird <span class="strikethrough">who</span> called of the Latins Anas doth utter in time of affright; for it then thinketh of
                  the water, inasmuch as in the water it findeth its safety, &amp; while its thoughts be
                  upon the water so greatly desired of it, it cryeth qua-a-qua-a-qua, wherefore it is
                  to be inferred that <span class="ital">aqua</span> is the very natural word for water, &amp; the Latin therefore the primitive, natural,
                  &amp; original tongue.
