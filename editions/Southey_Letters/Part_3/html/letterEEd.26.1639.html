               after sorrow – not less than three serious bouts of illness in my family since last
               you heard from me. – &amp; the last terminated fatally. It was but this &lt;day&gt; week that

                           published, in The Courier, an article condemning the Convention. In May 1809 Longmans

                  of the final deliverance of Spain. If any thing were wanting to convince me of the
                  baleful effects of party spirit it would be sufficient to see that no member of opposition
                  ever utters one generous sentiment in favour of the Spaniards.</p>
