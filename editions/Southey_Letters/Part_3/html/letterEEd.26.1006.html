                  therefore wrote a humbler letter than either his temper liked or the strict justice
                  of the case warranted, but the Captain replied nothing but a full confession of all
                  the charges could be satisfactory. – The day on which he wrote he had breakfasted
                  with the Commodore to whom he applied for an appointment. Sir A. very properly answered
                  ‘my doing that before I have read the minutes, for only the sentence has been sent
                  me yet, will be prejudging the case. if you incline to wait till I have read them

                  will offer till April, relying on this as the minutes are more in his favour than

                           attempt to cut out the French privateer General Ernouf (formerly the British sloop
                           of war Lilly) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of the 90 men sent on the mission
                           65 were killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that his brother was among the dead,
                           having read in the newspapers that the first lieutenant had been killed. Thomas had
                           been placed under arrest and it was his replacement on the raid, Lieutenant Charles
                           Hayman (d. 1804), who died.</span></div>

            <p class="indent1">At any other time this would have given me much uneasiness, for of course it will
               injure him. the merits of these things never can be looked into, &amp; it is a rare instance
               of good fortune that Captain Hoods brother should happen be the Commander on that
               station – else he might have reviewed the minutes by the sentence – as I do many a
               book by the first page. but unless he be speedily appointed he cannot afford to wait
               in a country where money is of so little value that the very negro beggars will hardly
               accept of copper. his finances he told me would last six weeks, before which period
               the minutes would arrive. the letter was nine weeks on its way – &amp; I shall look very
               anxiously for another. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> is as good an officer &amp; as brave a man – to use one of his &lt;own&gt; phrases, as ever
               stept between stem &amp; stern – but as he would be the kindest creature in the world
               to those below him I fear he has more honesty than prudence in his dealings with his
               superiors. The constitution of the navy like every thing else has undergone a great
               alteration, &amp; he is a sailor of the old mould which is now out of fashion.</p>
            <p class="indent1">So much for that. you would probably see the fact in the papers – or else perhaps
               I should not have mentioned it. – I am not only very fond of my brother – but very
               proud of him, &amp; have a strong hope in my heart that if he lives I shall have good
               reason for that pride. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Dapple</a> I know is very <span class="strikethrough">fond</span> &lt;proud&gt; of his brother <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> – such an <span class="ital">elegant</span> young man he calls him.
