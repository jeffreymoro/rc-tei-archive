         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">Coleridge had asked Southey on 20 October 1809 to ‘look over the eight numbers’ of
               <em>The Friend</em> ‘and to write a letter ... in a lively style, chiefly urging, in a humorous manner,
               my Don Quixotism in expecting that the public will ever pretend to understand my lucubrations,
               or feel any interest in subjects of such sad and unkempt antiquity’, meaning to answer
               Southey’s letter in a future number of <em>The Friend</em>. See <em>The Collected Letters of S. T. Coleridge</em>, ed. E. L. Griggs, 6 vols (Oxford, 1956–1971), III, p., 254. As well as this letter,
               Southey also wrote a reply intended for publication, which however arrived too late
               for Coleridge to use it in <em>The Friend</em>. For that letter, see Southey to Samuel Taylor Coleridge, [28 October 1809], Letter
               1704.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in fighting at Scylla, Calabria, in 1809, but in 1808 became notorious when on 4 October
               it fled back to barracks and allowed itself to be taken prisoner, rather than face
               flanking fire from the French. Coleridge supplied Southey with information on the
               Maltese regiment in a letter of 24 December 1809 (see <em>The Collected Letters of S. T. Coleridge</em>, III, 265). Southey used this information as the basis of his account of the affair–blaming
               British officers for removing the Maltese from the defence of their own island–in
               the <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1808</em>, 1.1 (1810), 213.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
