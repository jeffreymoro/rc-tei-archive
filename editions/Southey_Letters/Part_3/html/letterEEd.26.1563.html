                  &amp; I in transcribing with my usual scrupulous accuracy, constantly referred to the

                  notice. Well – I found my own references to the number of the Chapter wrong, – for
                  the first time it past well enough for a blunder, tho I wondered at &lt;it&gt; a little,
                  being remarkably exact in these things – the second time I thought it very extraordinary,
                  – &amp; a third mistake made me quite certain that something was wrong, but that the fault
                  was not in me. Upon examination it appeared that a whole chapter, &amp; that chapter the
                  most important as to the historical part of the volume, had been omitted by De Bry,
                  because he was a Catholick, De Lery a Hugonot, &amp; this chapter exposed the villainy
