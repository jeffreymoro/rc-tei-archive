Lett. c. 24<br>Previously published: Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), III, pp. 32–36 [in part].<br>Dating note: This letter is incorrectly dated as 1806 by C. C. Southey, based presumably
               on the endorsement. Most likely Southey gets the day right (‘Wednesday’) but the date
               wrong: the 7th March in 1804 was a Wednesday.</p>
