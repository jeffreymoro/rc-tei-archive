               <p>You will be pleased to hear that I have received two letters, both from persons whom
                  I have never seen, one yesternight, and the other this evening, requesting me to favour
                  them with some fragment of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> writing, however trifling, that they might preserve it as a relic. One of these applications
                  comes from Mr. Arthur Owen, whom I think you will feel disposed to oblige, in requital
                  for his sonnet, which bore tribute to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> merit at a time when such tributes were useful as well as pleasing.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           Southey in his edition of Kirke White’s Remains, as was another sonnet, presumably
                           sent by Owen to Southey, dated 17 December 1807, which paid tribute to the Remains:
                           it was included in the first volume of later editions of the Remains in a section
                           of ‘Tributary Verses’.</span></div>
                  </div> His direction is Edmund Hall, Oxford. The other is from Mr. William Fox, junr. Clapton,
                  near Hackney, who published, some years ago, a descriptive poem called ‘La Bagatelle.’

                  </div> It is a book which leaves a favourable impression both of the talents and disposition
                  of the author; and, as the papers are so numerous, you will perhaps have no objection
                  to oblige him also. If you gave the MS. of one of the shortest <span class="ital">printed</span> poems to each, they would be gratified, and your store not impoverished. There is
                  something in the feeling from which such requests originate that pleads their excuse,
                  and makes one wish to gratify it.</p>

               <p>My friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</a>, the historian of the Anglo-Saxons, one of the best, as well as of the most learned
                  men with whom it is my good fortune to be intimate, tells me he cannot express how
