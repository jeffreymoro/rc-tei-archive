                  for writing a political pamphlet upon the state of Spain, – these things require a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;kind&gt; of wire-drawing which I have never learnt to perform, &amp; a <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;method&gt; of logical reasoning to which my mind has never been habituated, &amp; for which
                  it has no natural aptitude. What I feel about Spain you know, – what I think about
                  &lt;it&gt; is this, – the country has much to suffer, in all probability there will be many
                  &amp; dreadful defeats of the patriots, &amp; such scenes as have never been witnessed in

               <p>Now Grosvenor, understand me clearly. I could not fill half a score of pages by dilating

                  before me, extracting its essence, bringing my own knowledge to bear upon the subject,
                  &amp; where occasion serves seasoning it with those opinions which in some degree leaven
                  all my thoughts words &amp; actions. If you had read the Annual Reviews you would comprehend
                  this better by example than I can make you in a letter. Voyages &amp; Travels I review
                  better than any thing else, being well read <span class="strikethrough">upon</span> in that branch of literature, better indeed than most men. Biography &amp; History are

            <p class="indent1">You know my way of thinking upon most subjects. I despise all parties too much to
               be attached to any. I believe that this country must continue the war while Bonaparte
               is at the head of France, &amp; while the system which he has perfected remains in force,
               – I therefore from my heart &amp; soul execrate &amp; abominate the peace-mongers. I am an
               enemy to any farther concessions to the Catholicks. I am a friend to the Church establishment,
               – not as a Churchman, for I am <span class="ital">almost</span> a Quaker, – but because an establishment is now, &amp; long will be necessary, – &amp; the
               one we have secures toleration to such hereticks as myself. I wish for reform, because
               I cannot but see that all things are tending towards revolution, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> nothing but reform can by any possibility prevent it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This much is said to you, that it may be said thro you. – To yourself I add that the
                  pay proposed will be exceedingly suitable to my poor finances, &amp; that the more books
                  of travels they send me the better; for that reason. I had almost forgotten to say
                  that if a fit text be sent me the subject of converting the Hindoos is one upon which
                  I am well prepared. It is my belief that they ought to be converted both as a matter
                  of policy &amp; duty, – &amp; as you know I do not suppose salvation to be exclusively attached
                  to any particular faith, you may be sure that this opinion does not proceed from religious
                  bigotry. Claudius Buchanans book
