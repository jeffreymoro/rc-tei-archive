                           1804, made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer General Ernouf
                           (formerly the British sloop of war Lilly) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of
                           the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that
                           his brother was among the dead. Thomas was the first lieutenant, but was absent from
                           the raid because he had been placed under arrest. Charles Hayman (d. 1804) was made
                           first lieutenant in his stead and died in the attack.</span></div>
                  </div> – &amp; no reason to expect any but what will be a confirmation of ill. In all such calamities
                  – &amp; I have had my share of them – I always apply myself with intense application to
                  study. To me it is a heavier loss than you or any one else can imagine. There is now
                  no human being left who can talk with me of my infancy old times – not one who nursed
                  me in infancy or played with me in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my fathers</a> house. It makes the heart grow old before its time when so many of its dearest feelings
                  &amp; recollections are made thus cut off – never again to be participated with any one
                  on earth.</p>
