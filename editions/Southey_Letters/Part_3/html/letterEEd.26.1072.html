               will not be easy this early in the season to procure one at one of the inns. he will
               do well to take this opportunity of seeing the Lakes when he has leisure, &amp; will have

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your route will be the same as if you came by Liverpool, the roads joining at Preston.
                  When you are at Coniston I should advise you to go to the Ferry on Windermere, &amp; come
                  up to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a> – or <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#LowoodInn">Low-Wood</a> in a boat, by which you will see that Lake to the best advantage. From <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a> to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> is sixteen miles, &amp; you see three Lakes on the way. – If therefore you cross the sands

                  to be informed of. Esthwaite is not remarkable, the other two are, but in all this
