               <p>I am not a little surpized &amp; vexed at what your letter tells me. The MSS set off with
                  the books which were mentioned, directed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</a> <span class="ital">for you</span>. They wrote to tell me it contained some books &amp; no directions what to do with them,
                  – from which I understand that they had stupidly opened the parcel, – but concluded
                  that they had sent the papers by themselves, – &amp; in the persuasion that you had read
                  them, have I corrected the whole eighth chapter, which contains every thing relating
                  to the manner of the Tupinambas.

                           7 and 8. Southey had intended that Hill should comment on the accounts; see Southey
