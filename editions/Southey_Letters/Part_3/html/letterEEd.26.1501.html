                  whom she would not perhaps have chosen. Your charge will now give you new anxieties
                  in life, but it will give new interest as well, &amp; I heartily rejoice that they are
                  in such hands: – for my own sake too I must rejoice in any arrangement which will
                  bring you once more, &amp; more than once more to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>. – The Legacy is indeed unhealthy. it can however only be suspended, – not lost,

                  I could not be satisfied till this point was ascertained, – home I came &amp; M<sup>r</sup> W. with me, &amp; there we found not only the strawberry (the breed of which now seems

                  to print it, – not as a book for public sale, – but just the number for the subscribers.
                  It is very probable that this could be effected. Shall I try it? that is ascertain
