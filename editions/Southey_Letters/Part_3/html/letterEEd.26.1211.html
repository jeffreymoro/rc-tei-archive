               <p>I do not like writing to you – &amp; you will immediately see why. Our house is in a very
                  comfortless state. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> is laid up with the ague, – in addition to which he has the piles in so damnable a
                  degree that God knows when he will be cured. The measles have found their way here,
                  – one of the children (you know <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a> are in the same house) is just recovered, – the rest must have it, &amp; it is one of
                  the plagues of this infernal disorder that it requires a fortnight for the infection
                  to ripen – so that unless they all take it from one – it may stay in the family these
                  six weeks. The long &amp; the short is that the house is full of sickness &amp; of people
                  at the same time, – &amp; I had rather you would come in October – when we shall have
                  got rid of both. Into the bargain – I strongly suspect that the unborn will be here
                  before he or she <span class="strikethrough">is xxx</span> or they are expected.
