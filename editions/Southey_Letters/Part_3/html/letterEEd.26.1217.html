               <p>For some days past I have refrained from writing to you, thinking it probable that
                  a letter would arrive, &amp; my expectation has this evening been fulfilled. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</a> are both reading by the light of my <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> single candle – sad to say my eyes are ailing again &amp; I am thus obliged to sport Nicodemus

                           who, in John’s gospel (3.1–21) visited Jesus by night. In the etching, the figures
                           are illuminated only by one candle.</span></div>

                  Why <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> has not written it would be difficult to say, &amp; yet is very easy to understand – he
                  has talked daily of doing it, &amp; thought daily of his daily procrastination as a neglect
                  of duty, &amp; begs me now to say that forgetfulness has not been the occasion. I think
                  he will go to Taunton, &amp; if so you will of course see him on his way. As for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the Doctor</a>, sheer idleness I suppose will continue to keep him silent – I believe he makes about
                  half a dozen &lt;new&gt; correspondents every year, who are regularly superseded by as many
                  more. He is to blame – but you will not judge too hardly of a fault which you foresaw.
                  We very often talk of you &amp; never without a wish that you were here again to mountaineer

                  would have been – or to speak more truly – not angry at all, – only thinking at the
                  time that it was not very modest in him to take it for granted that he had <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> considered the subject more than I have done; or was better qualified to understand
