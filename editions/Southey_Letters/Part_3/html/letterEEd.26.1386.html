               <div class="salute">My dear Wynn</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Here is a piece of trickery inclosed which I will beg you to frank up to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a>, &amp; desire him to dispose of it according to direction.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Your notions respecting the Criminal Laws seem to me very just &amp; sensible: yet I should
               be sorry to see less use made of transportation, which as you say, does not deter
               criminals, but is certainly the best means of employing them. Wise &amp; extensive plans
               of colonization would be, I am fully persuaded, the best means of preventing not only
               petty offences, but &lt;also&gt; imminent danger to society; – the huge steam engine of
               the body politic needs such safety valves. Enlighten the poor, &amp; find employment for
               all who want it, <span class="strikethrough">– that</span> these are the preventatives. – I am inclined to think the punishment of death might
               in cases be best dispensed with; not from any horror at the thought of sending a criminal
               into eternity with all his unrepented sins upon him, – for if the man would have repented
               had life been granted him I cannot but suppose the will will be accepted for the deed,
               – but because I think imprisonment for life more terrible than death, – &amp; the reverence
               for life which it would exhibit in the law would tend to produce <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> or strengthen the same reverence in the people. The <span class="strikethrough">only</span> main objection seems to be that <span class="strikethrough">a</span> criminals are thus made burthensome to the state as long as they live<span class="strikethrough">d</span>: – this might be obviated by making them do prison work, – there are enough zealous
               clergymen of every persuasion who would look after their spiritual concerns, &amp; I am
               mistaken in all my views of human nature, if the spectacle of one true penitent for
               such a crime as murder would not have more effect than fifty executions, – he might
               be made a spectacle by having the prison &lt;church&gt; service public.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The malice in the Critical comes from a man whose name is Le Grice, a school fellow
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a>; he hates him &amp; therefore abuses me.

                           Valentine Le Grice (1773–1858; DNB). Southey also believed that Le Grice reviewed
                           Wordsworth’s Poems in Two Volumes in the Critical Review, ns 11 (August 1807), 399–403,
