               <p>I am very sorry to learn by your brothers letter, which has just reached me, that
                  you are suffering from a complaint, in which I can from sore experience so well sympathize.

                  </div> You have doubtless the best advice, – yet it may not be amiss to tell you that the
                  remedy which I have found most efficacious was an infusion of cayenne pepper, – the
                  infusion just strong enough to make the eye smart strongly. it was recommended to
                  me by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">D<sup>r</sup> Beddoes</a>, &amp; frequently proved effectual, – but <span class="strikethrough">as</span> the inflammation with me lay originally in the <span class="ital">eye lid</span> &amp; <span class="strikethrough">not</span> only by sympathy in the eye itself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have been several times on the point of writing to you, &amp; still delayed it in the
                  expectation that another post might bring me letters from you, or from Lisbon. – The
                  Metrical Tales are – as I believe you know – only a republication from the two volumes
                  of the Anthology, which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> has.

                  me, &amp; which probably I should not have had in a better climate. The country is now
                  becoming very beautiful, &amp; I, like other hibernating animals, have begun to crawl
                  out of my den, &amp; warm myself in the sunshine. If <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> had come to England I should have met him in London, where I am in no want of business

                  so long a journey will deter me from undertaking it while it can possibly be avoided.
