               <div class="salute">My dear Grosvenor,</div>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I do not know that I should have taken up my pen with the intention of inflicting
                  a letter upon you, if it had not been for a suspicion produced by your last letter
                  that you expect me in London sooner than it is any ways possible for me to be there
                  &amp; that peradventure therefore you may think it is not worth while to look after my
                  pension till I arrive in proper person to receive it. Now M<sup>r</sup> Bedford touching this matter there are two things to be said. My going to London seems
                  to me no very certain thing, – it depends something on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle’s</a> movements of whose arrival from Lisbon I daily expect to hear, &amp; of course if I go,
                  my journey must be so timed as to meet him. It depends also something on my finances;
                  &amp; I begin to think I cannot afford the expence of the journey, for I have had extraordinary
                  goings-out this year in settling myself, &amp; no extraordinary comings-in to counterbalance
                  them. The Constable is a leaden-heeled rascal, &amp; if I do not take care will be left
                  confoundedly behind. I must work like a negro the whole winter to set things right,
                  &amp; the nearer the time for my projected journey approaches the less likely is it that
                  I can spare it. My object in going would be to consult certain books for the preliminaries
                  &amp; notes to the Cid:

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s Chronicle of the Cid, from the Spanish was published by Longmans in 1808.
                           It comprised translations from the Crónica particular del Cid (1593), with additions
                           from the Crónica de España of Alphonso the Wise (1541) and Romancero e Historia del
                           Cid (1632). Southey had thought of visiting the library of Spanish books assembled
                           by Henry Richard Vassall-Fox at his seat, Holland House, and the British Museum; see
                           Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 24 October 1807, Letter 1373.</span></div>
                  </div> &amp; these books I should assuredly feel myself bound to consult if it required no other
                  sacrifices than those of time &amp; trouble. But if the necessary expence cannot prudently
                  &amp; justifiably be afforded I must be content to do the best I can, – which will be
                  quite well enough to satisfy every body except myself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In the second place if you can by any interest get my pension paid I pray you exert
                  it. I foresee that I shall be kept in hot water by it till I am lucky enough to get
                  some little prize in the lottery of life which will enable me to wait without inconvenience
                  for arrears. – At present the only chance for this is in the sale of Espriella, –
                  should that go thro two or three editions, it will set me fairly afloat.

               <p>I thought to have brought up my lea way by doing a specific piece of jobwork, of which
                  I have been rather unhandsomely disappointed<span class="strikethrough">xx</span>. The story is simply this: Smirke has projected a splendid edition of D Quixote with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CadellThomas">Cadell</a> &amp; Davies. They proposed to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> to take a share in it, &amp; he was authorized by them to ask me to translate it. While
                  I was corresponding with them upon the fitness of revising the first translation in
                  preference, &amp; forming such a plan for preliminaries &amp; annotations as would have made
                  a great body of Spanish learning, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CadellThomas">Cadell</a> &amp; Davies unknown to them struck a bargain with a Mr Balfour, – who is no more <span class="strikethrough">fit to</span> able to translate D Quixote than he would have been to write it.

                  </div> This is some disappointment to me, as I should have &lt;been&gt; paid a specific sum for
                  my work, &amp; could have calculated upon it. The Longmen behave as they ought to do in
                  the business. They refuse to take any share in the work in consequence of this unhandsome
                  dealing towards me, – &amp; offer to publish my edition upon our ordinary terms of halving
                  the profits. This however, would not serve my purpose.</p>
