            <p class="indent1">You have not quite so much forethought about you in packing a box as I should have
               expected, – or you would have remembered when you filled it up with waste sermons
               that I was to pay by weight for it &amp; that waste paper weighs as heavy as books. Had
               you instead of &lt;thus&gt; filling that heavy Portugueze box (wood is cheap there &amp; they
               put thrice the quantity in one that we do in England) bought a tea chest I should
               have had at least two stone less to have paid for, which on a journey of 300 miles
               amounts to a great deal. I wish too when you laid in the book of prints for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> amusement you had added the two volumes belonging to it for mine, in place of part
               of the abominable sermons.</p>

               <p>I have just received yours. You had indeed in your letter of the 7<sup>th</sup> not expressed yourself unintelligibly, but made the very ingenious mistake of telling
                  me that you could not find all the books which you had found, &amp; that you had found
                  those which it seems you could not find. All is right except the other two MS.S. about
                  which however I will not again plague you, but there they are among the other books
