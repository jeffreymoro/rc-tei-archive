                  </div> found me in London; – a well borne testimony against a most atrocious measure. I ought
                  to have thanked you for it long ago, &amp; the date of your letter makes me ashamed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In that letter you say that our opinions on the most important of all subjects are <span class="ital">not</span> essentially different: it is in the belief that we agree in some of the most essential
                  points, – that I proceed to speak of things which I regard with too sacred &amp; deep
                  a feeling ever to expose them to those who might treat it lightly. Many Xian sects,
                  or societies, seem to me to have been founded upon a strong perception of part of
                  the Xtian system; none to have a clear &amp; steady comprehension of the whole, perfectly
                  pure &amp; simple as that system is. It is from the words of Christ that I collect it,
                  setting all creeds, catechisms &amp; commentators, however early aside. To me nothing
                  can be clearer than that Christ Jesus has expressly forbidden his disciples to possess
                  either riches or authority; that his words are to be received in their plain &amp; incontrovertible
                  meaning instead of being explained away into nothing; &amp; that they lead to nothing
                  short of a total revolution in the whole constitution of human governments, &amp; the
                  establishment of a new order of things, in which no man is to exercise authority over
                  another; none are to be rich &amp; none poor, but all do their part in the general labour
                  &amp; receive their portion of the produce. The Jewish dispensation in its Jubilee &amp; its

                           known as Shemitah in Hebrew, or ‘Release’, and in this year fields are to be left
                           fallow and debts are cancelled. The seven years are counted in a cycle, with the fiftieth
                           year being the Jubilee (or Yovel) year, in which according to tradition, there is
                           no agricultural work, all landed property reverts to its original owner, and slaves

                  </div> bears the same relation to the feelings of Gospel truth here, as it does in other
                  points. It is beyond a doubt that the primitive Christians understood their Master
                  as I understand Him: the Mendicant Orders &amp; the Moravians understood Him so at this
                  day with respect to property:

            <p class="indent1">This, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrahameJames">James Grahame</a>, I believe to be the political system of Christ Jesus, &amp; any other system tends to
               counteract on the morals of Christianity: &amp; little is it to be wondered at that the
               world is in the lamentable state it is when its main institutions are thus at war
               with the revealed will of its Maker. Were that will to be obeyed moral evil would
               be annihilated, &amp; by far the greater part of physical evil with it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My creed is what I cannot so explicitly lay down. That there was in Christ a far greater
                  portion of the Divine Mind than has ever been imparted to any other of the sons of
                  men, I believe. It may be that His birth was not after the ordinary manner of man:
                  but this part of His history has too mythological an appearance, &amp; the whole system
                  of miracles appears to me untenable. Middleton’s Free Enquiry

                           miracles.</span></div>
                  </div> is the death blow to them. There is no touchstone to distinguish between a true miracle
                  and a false miracle, &amp; they who argue in their behalf come at last to prove the miracle
                  by the doctrine, not the doctrine by the miracle. That Christ healed diseases instantaneously
                  I can believe because I can understand it, – He himself said that faith had made the
                  patients whole, &amp; charged them to tell no man, – a remarkable expression, perfectly
                  intelligible if it be supposed that He knew the power would be thought to have proceeded
                  from Him, &amp; foresaw the consequence of the mistake, – that is, the trade of deception,
                  which the Catholic Church has carried on from the first ages to this very day. To
                  give mankind the certain knowledge of a future state of retribution appears to be
                  a worthy object for revelation, &amp; Original Sin as it is commonly understood is not
                  consistent with the Justice of the Creator, – nor indeed with the language of Christ,
                  whose opinions seem to be faithfully delivered to us, tho’ the history of His life
                  is corrupted with many human inventions. Redemption, in its usual acception also,
                  is built upon Original Sin. I prefer Pelagius to St. Augustine.

            <p class="indent1">I cannot believe in Hell, – I do believe in Purgatory, &amp; almost in the efficacy of
               prayers for the dead. When our fathers rebelled against the accursed superstitions
               of the Romish Church they served our faith, something in the same way that your Reformers
               served the churches. The Papists are beyond all doubt, Idolators in the strictest
               sense of the word; – but in flying from idolatry what a fearful chasm have we left
               between man &amp; God! What a void have we made in the Universe! Had the senses &amp; the
               imagination their wholesome food set before them, – they would not prey upon such
               garbage as that of the bedeadening &amp; bedarkening sectaries, who are now gaining ground
               so rapidly as to threaten us with a second age of persecution.</p>

               <p>These opinions have not been lightly taken up. Many of them you may perhaps think
                  erroneous, – but you will see with how little justice I have been reviled as an unbeliever,
                  &amp; an Atheist. I care not what the world may think as yet: they will know me in due
                  season, if it be God’s will. But I wish you to know me now, because we have many Xtian
                  feelings &amp; principles in common, whatever may be the difference on other points. I
