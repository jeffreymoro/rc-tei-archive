                           1804, made an unsuccessful attempt to cut out the French privateer General Ernouf
                           (formerly the British sloop of war Lilly) lying at the Saintes near Guadeloupe. Of
                           the 90 men sent on the mission, 65 were killed or wounded, and Southey suspected that
                           his brother was among the dead. Thomas was the first lieutenant, but was absent from
                           the raid because he had been placed under arrest. Charles Hayman (d. 1804) was made
                           first lieutenant in his stead and died in the attack.</span></div>
