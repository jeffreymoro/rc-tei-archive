               <p>On the duty of spreading Christianity you know my opinions – which perfectly coincide

                  have led you to suspect. The Quakers err in prohibiting things which it is sufficient
                  to despise; – they err in their principle of preaching; – &amp; their conduct about tythes
                  is foolish &amp; troublesome. – Their opinions concerning war go against the instinct
                  of self defence; – just now that sort of religion which the Maccabees held upon this
                  subject is more called for;

                           sparing women and the survivors of sieges.</span></div>
                  </div> – there can however be no question but that the Quaker system were it general would
                  produce the greatest possible good; it never can spread so rapidly as to lay any part
                  of the world at the feet of a conqueror, – &amp; if it were not for Bonaparte I should
                  have with little hesitation in declaring my conviction that it is the true system
                  of the gospel. – that is my reason is convinced, but I want to have the invasion over
