            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker/ Congreve/ Penkridge/ Staffordshire<br>Postmark: KESWICK/ 298<br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, ‘The Letters of Robert
               Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 191–195.
               Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), I, pp. 385–388.<br>Dating note: “No. 19 S Madoc to Mary Barker. Keswick 26 May 1806” written on MS. According
               to Kirkpatrick “S Madoc” is in Mary Barker’s hand in pencil. A pencil line has been
               lightly drawn through it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I ought to have written to you long since. But in London I was very unwell at first
               as well as very busy; &amp; so idle, idle from sheer enjoyment of fresh air &amp; fine weather,
               – that I am behind hand with every thing. </p>
