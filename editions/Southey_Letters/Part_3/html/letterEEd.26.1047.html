                  </div> I suspect that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> did not write poetry oft enough when a boy, for he has little command of language.
                  His vocabulary of the obsolete is ample – but in general his words march up stiffly
                  like half trained recruits – neither a natural walk, nor a measured march <span class="strikethrough">of</span> which practice has made natural. But I like his poem for it is poetry, &amp; in a company
                  of strangers I would not mention that it had any faults. – The <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> beginning of the story is too like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a> Christabell which he had seen.
