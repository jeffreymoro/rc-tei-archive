               of importance – so that in them I have only now to run my eye down the margin, &amp; make
               my notes from the land marks. The first of next month I begin – &amp; after the first

               sheet a day – exclusive of notes – that is a volume in 136 days. See how much may
               be done in a little time by only going steadily straight forward. Give me six months,
