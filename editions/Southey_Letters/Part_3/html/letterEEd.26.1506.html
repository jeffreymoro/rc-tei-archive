         <div class="note" id="Note8"><span class="noteLabel">7.. </span><span class="noteBody">The letter in question was one of one hundred written by the personal physician of
               John II (1405–1454), King of Castile from 1406 to 1454. The letter contains gossip
               about the turbulent politics of Castile at that period, and the passage in question
               is a debate about which of two nominees should be sent to carry assurances of safe
               passage from the king to a third party. <em>Centon Epistolario del Bachiller Fernan Gomez de Cibdareal: Y Generaciones y Semblanzas
                  del Noble Caballero Fernan Perez de Guzman</em> (1790).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note9"><span class="noteLabel">8.. </span><span class="noteBody">In the letter from which this passage is taken the writer reports on an incident in
               the never-ending upheavals of John II’s reign. It is written after John II had arrested
               Pedro Manrique de Lara, Adelantado and second-placed counsellor in the royal council.
               Manrique’s sons then began to stir up their followers to revolt. The King then sent
               for Fadrique Enriquez de Mendoza, Admiral of Castile, who was an ally of the arrested
               Adelantado. The admiral refused to come unless the king sent a third party to make
               a sworn oath to the Admiral that he would ensure his safe passage to and from the
               court. The King referred the matter to the Council. The Council recommended that Gomez
               Carrillo should be sent to the Admiral. The King had named Juan Sanchez de Tovar.
               A debate ensued as to which of the two men should go, particularly involving Fernan
               Sanchez el de Berlanga and Pedro Laso de Mendoza, who were related to one another.
               Pedro Laso said in the King’s presence that Gomez Carrillo was a son of a royal doncel
               [a man who began serving as a royal page and then passed into the military amongst
               whom the donceles were a corps with certain privileges] and grandson of the cup-bearer
               of King Enrique, connected to Lope de Carrillo – a doncel and master of the hunt for
               King John I – and that he [here begins the passage quoted by Southey:] ‘was certainly
               not descended from a judge of shepherds. This was said because Juan Sanchez de Tovar
               is descended from Fernan Sanchez de Tovar, judge of la Mesta é Pastoría Real. [The
               Spanish Honrado Concejo de la Mesta/ Honored Council of the Mesta was a powerful association
               of sheepbreeders and shepherds in the medieval Kingdom of Castile.] And Fernan Sanchez
               el de Berlanga answered him, in the presence of the king, that he understood by the
               point that he was not a good crossbow man and spoke against him thus. That the Fernan
               Sanchez who he was censuring by identifying him as a judge of shepherds was also a
               cousin of the grandfather of Fernan Sanchez de Berlanga, who was a royal vassal and
               had become a wealthy man: and the offices of the courts of the Mesta were always held
               by honourable gentlemen but the King Don Pedro had given this office to Fernan Sanchez
               de Tovar, raising him to offices in the royal house including that of his chief falconer,
               which was just as good as Gomez Carillo; and when the carracks brought the sheep first
               from England, the King Don Alfonso, first conferred this office on Inigo Lopez de
               Orozco, from whom the mother of the same Pedro Laso is in tenth part descended and
               his father Inigo Lopez de Mendoza; and the same is descended from a juez de pastores’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
