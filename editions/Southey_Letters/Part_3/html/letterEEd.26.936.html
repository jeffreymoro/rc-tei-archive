               nothing to do with lying-in. If your moon-gazing prediction had been true it would
               have been exceedingly inconvenient to us – it is bad enough to leave <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> now when Spring has just put on his seven leagued boots &amp; set out upon a race as
               if he meant to overtake summer. I move tomorrow – but only thirteen miles – to sleep
               at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a>. the next day foot it sixteen to Kendal in time to step into a long coach which will
               convey me that night to Lancaster &amp; the next to Liverpool. there I purchase &amp; send
               off a stock of writing paper, &amp; there I mean to see the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Kosters</a> so that possibly I may remain there the whole of Thursday, &amp; not make my entry into
               London before Sunday night, or Monday morning. it is a tremendous journey! look at
               your map &amp; see what a figure it makes there!</p>

                  nearest town that is the most convenient, for as I shall be on my return encumbered
                  with nothing but a knapsack a twenty miles walk will go for nothing in the account.
