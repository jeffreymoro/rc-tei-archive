                  a man on board when my brother joined who knew one rope from another ; – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> stated to me that the men were so few as well as so little used to their work that
                  the ship was not safe in bad weather. They were so exhausted for want of hands in
                  bad weather, that he said it made his heart ache to drive them on to fresh exertions.
                  The ship had no master, &amp; to compleat &lt;the matter&gt; one of the Lieutenants knocked
                  himself up at Plymouth, so that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> &amp; the other were watch &amp; watch (ie every other <span class="strikethrough">three</span> four hours on deck) till they were both so ill that the Captain – which he ought to
                  have done sooner – allowd an old Midshipman to take charge of the deck. The men have
                  now learnt their duty.</p>
