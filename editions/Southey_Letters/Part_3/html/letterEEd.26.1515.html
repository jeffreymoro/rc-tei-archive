                           of ‘Sermons on the Doctrine and Duties of Christianity’ [Henrietta Maria Bowdler]
                           (1808). Smith had been, from 1801, a resident of Coniston in the Lake District with
                           her parents. Smith was an accomplished self-taught linguist, who translated from Arabic,
                           Persian and Hebrew.</span></div>
                  </div> which I had heard of and wished to see. In the winter of 1796 I was introduced to
                  her on the South Parade at Bath, by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LoshJames">James Losh</a>, a gentleman now settled at Newcastle, and practising as a provincial counsel, –
                  one of the best and most estimable men in all respects whom it has ever been my good
                  fortune to know. He borrowed of her for me Carlyle’s translations from the Arabic,
                  then newly published.

                  </div> From that time I neither saw nor knew anything of her till about three years ago,
                  when, hearing that one of Mrs. Smith’s daughters, at Coniston, understood Hebrew,
                  I knew that she must be the person to whom I had formerly been made known; but I made
                  no attempt at renewing the acquaintance, because there is a haughtiness and harshness
                  about her mother

                           fortune when Britain went to war with France in 1793.</span></div>
                  </div> which are to me exceedingly offensive. Not many weeks before her death I chanced to
                  meet her and her mother in a one-horse chair, when I was in an open carriage with
                  one of her acquaintance. Death was in her countenance; my friend stopped to talk with
                  them, but I merely bowed my head: that was not a time to remind her of days when she
                  was in health; she had evidently no breath to spare in waste words, and the sight
                  of her made me melancholy for the rest of the day. Indeed I have her, as she then
                  appeared, vividly in my recollection now. You liken her to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a>; but genius is wanting on her part for the resemblance, for of this there is no trace
                  to be found among her Fragments. There is great good sense, great acquirements, prodigious
                  industry, and, what is most admirable, a pure love of knowledge for its own sake,
                  – for the quiet enjoyment, and the holy self-satisfaction which it afforded.</p>

                  </div> remembered from that time what was best worth remembering. You rightly compare him
                  to Goldsmith.

                  </div> He is an imitator, or rather an <span class="ital">antithesizer</span>, of Goldsmith, if such a word may be coined for the occasion. His merit is precisely
                  the same as Goldsmith’s, – that of describing actual things clearly and strikingly;
                  but there is a wide difference between the colouring of the two poets. Goldsmith threw
                  a sunshine over all his pictures, like that of one of our water-colour artists when
                  he paints for ladies, – a light and a beauty not to be found in Nature, though not
                  more brilliant or beautiful than what Nature really affords. Crabbe’s have a gloom,
                  which is also not in Nature, – not the shade of a heavy day, of mist, or of clouds,
                  but the dark and overcharged shadows of one who paints by lamp-light, – whose very
                  lights have a gloominess. In part this is explained by his history. He had formed
                  an attachment in early life to a young woman who, like himself, was absolutely without
                  fortune; he wrote his poems to obtain patronage and preferment. In those days there
                  was not much good poetry, and hardly any negligent criticism. He <span class="ital">pushed</span> (as the world says) for patronage with these poems, and succeeded; got preferment
                  sufficient, and married. It was not long before his wife became deranged,

                           the deaths of three of their children.</span></div>
                  </div> and when all this was told me by one who knew him well, five years ago, he was still
                  almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and
                  hopeless malady. A sad history! It is no wonder that he gives so melancholy a picture
                  of human life.</p>

                  him upon the subject; and this is a great merit. It was not till some months after <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> had resided that Mr. C. heard of his little volume;

                  </div> and when he mentioned it to him, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> was very much abashed, said that he was heartily sorry he had published it, and heartily
                  ashamed, but that it must be considered that he was very young. Mr. C. requested to
                  see the book, and was much pleased with it. He could not, of course, encourage him
                  in pursuits which might have interfered with his academical studies; – no person in
                  his situation could do that. It is not yet generally understood that of all men, a
                  great poet, such as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> might probably have been, exercises the most extensive and most useful influence over
