            <p class="indent1">I humbly beg leave to suggest Senhora that it is much more expedient both for your
               health &amp; spirits, &amp; for my improvements that you should be at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</a> than that you should be lodging in London; – that it will cost you less to travel
               here than to stay there; – that if you are for modelling my nose, here is the living
               one which is better than any picture, – &amp; that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Mr Jackson</a> is making bricks of excellent clay, which may very likely do for other purposes also.
               London &amp; Little Masters &amp; Great Masters are all very expensive, – &amp; besides it is
               not good for woman to be alone (any more than man) when she is not disposed to be
               in the best good spirits. So be pleased when you leave Hampstead to set your face
               this way.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will perceive that this was written before the arrival of yours this evening,
               which has been a very welcome letter, as indicating your own wiser projects, &amp; as
               giving us some news of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</a>, which will be much relief to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">Mrs Wilson</a>. Good woman she has been earnestly &amp; anxiously looking to hear what was become of
               him, which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">his mother</a> at Bristol did not know – &amp; Heaven knows when we should have known but for your chance
               mention of him.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> is in a merchant ship on his way to Lisbon. But if you want a young man, with a good
               face &amp; a good voice to introduce to your cousins, take compassion upon the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Count</a>, who is to be found at 42 Princess Street Leicester Square, working now really very
               hard, &amp; I am afraid out of health &amp; nearly out of spirits. If you were to pay him
               a visit, – as you are in the way of visiting gentlemen, I think it would set him in
               a good humour for a week.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The accounts of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyEmma">Mrs Peachy</a> are better than I expected, the news is that she &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyWilliam">her imperial husband</a> are to be here in June, with what female companion I know not. You should if possible
               by any manner of means come early in June, that you many may see the glorious sunsets
               behind <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a>, before midsummer, of which you can have no conception.</p>

                  </div> by the name of Ann<span class="ital">a</span> – saying it was not affectation, but he had been so long accustomed to speak Italian
                  that he could not help using the <span class="ital">a</span>. I told him I was quite aware that this must be the reason, &amp; gravely explained to
                  my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> how natural it was! – I should however have thought more of his judgement in pictures
                  if I had not known that before he went abroad he had no love of them &amp; pretended to
                  none, &amp; if I had not heard him speak of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppas</a> heads in terms which even before me were unwarrantable strong, &amp; when I was not in
                  the room became in the highest degree contemptuous &amp; abusive. There are few men with
                  whom I have so many intellectual points of contact as with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">C.</a> &amp; none with whom my habits, feelings, morals, &amp; affections are in more direct &amp; almost
                  hostile contrariety. We are so utterly opposite in all the outward &amp; visible signs
                  of men, &amp; in the inward &amp; spiritual grace as well, that in my conscience I do not
                  believe any person whom we both know likes the one, without at the same time not liking,
                  or positively <span class="ital">dis</span>liking the other. We are north &amp; south &amp; if the needle of any ones affections point
                  to the one, it must necessarily turn tail to the other. – Strange, for two men who
                  have been so closely connected by their opinions, – &amp; who at this time more nearly
                  agree in opinion upon all subjects with each other than they do with any body else:
                  – saving upon the subject of divorce &amp; the Trinity, – the former he defends because
                  it gives him an opportunity of letting people know he is unhappily married as Milton
                  was before him, – &amp; the latter he affects to believe – for the sake of making people
                  wonder, &amp; exhibiting the wonderful acuteness of his mind, which loves to make even
                  absurdities appear reasonable.
