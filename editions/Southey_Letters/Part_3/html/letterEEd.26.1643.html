               for that sort of travelling. Send them off by the waggon, either now, or after your
               return, as may be most convenient. There were some in the list for which I would have
               been in a hurry, had they been procured, – these others I am glad of, but not in haste

                  a practitioner is very much. A Bill in Chancery will put him soon in possession of

                  but without the slightest shadow of right. This sum will enable him to go on till

                  </div> he will have enough to enable him to retire from practice altogether. ‘Some thing
                  handsome’ is a phrase which Sealy makes use of, – I apprehend not less than 10,000
                  &amp; probably half as much more. Sealy is at present in Lisbon, &amp; will <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> I suppose make his daughter some present as soon as he hears of the marriage, which
                  is now with his perfect approbation.</p>

            <p class="indent1">All this you will say is very well, – better still you will think when I tell you
               that my new sister is an accomplished woman, gentle-minded, with a very pleasing countenance,
               &amp; by the testimony of all who know her best, a good heart, – to which I am sure she
               &lt;has&gt; all possible right of inheritance. But there is one evil which counterbalances
               the whole, – at least it would so to me. By some accident in her childhood her shape
               has suffered, so little that I, who have no very curious eye for these things, did
               not perceive it till I was told so; – but it is enough to affect her health. she has
               an habitual nervous cough, – when at the best, that is in its general state, it shows
               itself by one or two <span class="ital">hems</span> – as if to clear the throat, – but of a deep &amp; distressing sound; – unattended with
               any pain however, except to the hearer. &amp; whenever she catches cold this ceases, –
               which is a curious circumstance. The last earthquake terrified her so much <span class="strikethrough">th</span> (for she was then very ill) that she has even since been subject to something more
               distressing still to my ear, – a way of groaning at times when she breathes, – something
               like the noise a man makes in paving the streets only in a very low tone. It would
               break my heart to hear it, if she were my wife. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> says there is nothing alarming in all this, – &amp; as she has had the cough for eight
               years it may be so. But this was the objection I made when he first told me of his
               attachment, – &amp; I confess it would have prevented me from ever forming one. I always
               liked her, – like her better now that I have seen her more.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I came home thro Newcastle for the sake of staying a day with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LoshJames">Losh</a> . He enquired for you, &amp; expressed a great wish that you might one day take that
               road. It was seven years since I had seen him, he in better health than ever, &amp; has
