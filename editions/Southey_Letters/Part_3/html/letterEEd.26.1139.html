                  Spain, Italy &amp; the German States from ever becoming integral parts of the French Empire.

                  two &amp; probably so, &amp; Bonaparte cannot, in the course of nature be a long lived man.
                  The wear-&amp;-tear is too great. A twenty years peace will kill off the best French generals,
                  &amp; reduce the army to a level with other armies. A twenty years &lt;peace&gt; will consolidate
                  the Italian kingdom, &amp; the more extensive that kingdom is made the better, for it
                  must ultimately fall off from France. In Germany whatever tends to the destruction
                  of the House of Austria, eventually does good. It is a barbarizing power – the Ottoman
