               <p>The intelligence which I have to communicate will surprize you, if you have not already

                  seen the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillCatherine">Lady</a>, but there are so many Hills in the world that I utterly disbelieved his reported
                  rumours. Married however he is to the fourth daughter of Lovelace Bigg Wither, a gentleman
                  of great weight in the county of Hampshire, &amp; of the very ancient &amp; good family of
                  my old friend George Wither the poet. It seems however that he must have taken the
                  name for an estate, for his daughters name was Bigg.
