                           de la Mancha. Translated from the Spanish by Mary Smirke, Embellished with Engravings,
                           4 vols (London: Cadell and Davies, 1818). Longman had proposed Southey edit it earlier
                           that year; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, [end of August 1807], Letter
                           1356; for a fuller account, see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 15 November

                  </div> Their splendid edition will be sure to sell for its splendour. I would have made such
                  a work as should have been reprinted after the plates were worn out. I thank you for
                  offering to engage in it, but my nature is as little disposed to this kind of warfare
                  as yours; and I have as many plans to execute as I shall ever find life to perform.
                  Let it pass. Morte d’Arthur is a book which I shall edit with peculiar pleasure, because
                  it has been my delight since I was a school-boy.

                  the press. In what form are such works most profitable? If in quarto with engravings,
                  I can procure some sketches and some finished drawings. If you judge it expedient
                  to reprint my former volume, it must undergo some corrections; for though it has pleased
                  the public to receive my first publications far more favourably than my later ones,
                  I am fully sensible of their faults, and look upon them with efficient humiliation.

                  them than any London newspaper would give me for any number of verses, good, bad,
                  or indifferent, sold by the yard, and without the maker’s name to warrant them. What
                  I feel most desirous to do is to send Espriella again on his travels, and so complete
