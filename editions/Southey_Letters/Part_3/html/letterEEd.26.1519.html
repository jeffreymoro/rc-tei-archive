               <div class="salute">Sir,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A recommendation to the booksellers to look at a manuscript is of no use whatever.
               In the way of business they glance at every thing which is offered them; and no persons
               know better what is likely to answer their purpose. Poetry is the worst article in
               the market; – out of fifty volumes which may be published in the course of a year,
               not five pay the expense of publication: and this is a piece of knowledge which authors
               in general purchase dearly, for in most cases these volumes are printed at their risk.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From that specimen of your productions which is now in my writing desk, I have no
                  doubt that you possess the feeling of a poet, and may distinguish yourself; but I
                  am sure that premature publication would eventually discourage you. You have an example
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke White</a>; – his Clifton Grove

                  </div> sold only to the extent of the subscription he obtained for it; and the treatment
                  which it experienced drove him, by his own account, almost to madness. My advice to
                  you is, to go on improving yourself, without hazarding any thing: you cannot practise
                  without improvement. Feel your way before you with the public, as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</a> did. He sent his verses to the newspapers; and when they were copied from one to another
                  it was a sure sign they had succeeded. He then communicated them, as they were copied
                  from the papers, to the Poetical Register;

                           declared itself a ‘repository of fugitive poetry’.</span></div>
                  </div> the Reviews selected them for praise; and thus, when he published them in a collected
                  form, he did nothing more than claim, in his own character, the praise which had been
                  bestowed upon him under a fictitious name. Try the newspapers. Send what you think
                  one of your best short poems (that is, any thing short of 100 lines) to the Courier
                  or the Globe. If it is inserted send others, with any imaginary signature. If they
                  please nobody, and nobody notices them for praise, nobody will for censure, and you
                  will escape all criticism. If, on the contrary, they attract attention, the editor
                  will be glad to pay you for more, – and they still remain your property, to be collected
                  and reprinted in whatever manner you may think best hereafter.</p>

                  </div> can you not try it by subscription? 250 names will indemnify you for the same number
                  of copies. I will give you a fair opinion of your manuscript if you will direct <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> to forward it to me, and will willingly be of what little use I can. But be assured
                  that the best and wisest plan you can pursue is, to try your strength in the London
                  newspapers.</p>
