               <p>I had allotted this evening to dissect old Barbablao – &amp; am sorry the second edition
                  should have arrived before the first was so noticed. but I had no suspicion that you
                  designed to reprint it in the Iris.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Taylor had printed his poem on Bluebeard (‘Barbablao’) in the newspaper he edited,
                           The Iris; or, Norwich and Norfolk Weekly Advertiser, on 17 March 1804. A revised edition
                           appeared three weeks later. It was later published in the Monthly Magazine, 38 (1814),
                           437–440.</span></div>
                  </div> What you say of cheap editions is still more applicable to newspaper publication.
                  for short poems it is the best possible vehicle, &amp; those which stand the test may
                  then safely be transferred to a more permanent paper.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Lines 7 &amp; 8 in the old copy are well omitted – but I miss the following couplet, which
               pleasd my ear &amp; tallied well with the story as you have represented it. for the future
               <span class="ital">number the lines</span> of such poems for the benefit of us critics. – The You know he was brother &amp; – comes
               clumsily in like the <span class="ital">you-knows</span> in the opening of our old plays which always are addrest to the audience &amp; mean you
               do not know. – his will was <span class="ital">withstood</span>. is that word accurately used? surely withstand &amp; disobey are not synonimes. – The
               one line of Sister Anne which follows is not pleasantly – in fact not well – expressed
               – &amp; methinks you have made Sister Anne too cool at the discovery – the <span class="ital">blood</span> upon the key should alarm her suddenly. the couplet rhyming tomb &amp; doom is in its
               close cramped &amp; crowded. The tongue trips against it. ‘The key my loose powerless
               fingers forsook’ a lame &amp; expletive way of saying I dropt the key. Now come two words
               coupled either of which, in that place, <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> I should have feard to use – <span class="ital">shy stare</span> – &amp; both together I believe will strike every reader as very uncouth &amp; disagreable.
               ‘‘on a peg of black wood’’. needless for <span class="ital">hung up</span> is enough, &amp; worse than merely expletive by presenting an image too definite &amp; too
               trivial. the next lines are very good had they been related by the Poet – but <span class="strikethrough">not</span> altogether undramatic. the word <span class="ital">clung</span> I do not understand – &amp; the exquisite <span class="ital">touch</span> is too technical a phrase – nor could M<sup>rs</sup> Bluebeard be so little terrified as to recognize any likeness to the statue. Of the
               Heads speech I object to nothing but the way in which she expresses her decollation,
               which is too roundabout. The two first lines of Annes next speech very clumsy. indeed
               the whole paragraph appears to me incorrigible. The brothers speech is again too poetical
               for the occasion.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I now come to some smooth sailing – <span class="ital">build remission</span> being the next objectionable phrase. then they applaud the sound of the horn when
               they ought to have dreaded it – &amp; to have turnd pale. And prattling <span class="ital">prolongs every gift of the fire</span> – I can affix no meaning to this. <span class="ital">all</span> – too plainly for the rhyme – Bluebeard is also too loquacious &amp; too poetical in
               sudden passion. My decision has never been sympathys fool – this I do not like – it
               means he be not mislead by <span class="ital">com</span>passion when <span class="ital">passion</span> is what the sentence requires. <span class="ital">framed to confine the couch</span> – awkward. &amp; that vile word <span class="ital">spar</span>! which is damned <span class="strikethrough">by</span> the slang of pugilists. Say <span class="ital">And</span> Sion instead of <span class="ital">Even</span> – for it more rapidly combines the thought &amp; more flowingly fills the sentence. You
               have given too much attachment to the horse – it is impossible – you have raised him
               to the rank which the Dog holds – &amp; I suspect there are many degrees of transmigration
               before the soul <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> ascends from one to the other. <span class="ital">parry</span> is too <span class="ital">fencing</span> a phrase. <span class="ital">scrape</span> too slow a one. nor do I recollect any precedent for making them stamp like sheep
               who threaten – or for setting the Knight swearing. His armour big gushes &amp;c – another
               line of lame expression.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And now having culled the weeds I come to the story. you have hurt it by lessening
                  the atrocity of Bluebeard, who seems, bating his dealings with the Devil, to have
                  been as good as Knight need be. There is too a most incongruous mixture of &lt;the&gt; modern <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> &amp; the legendary. Sister Anne we must have – but why Eliza – so modern a name as not
                  to be fifty years old in English? &amp; in her dress the language &amp; – also the looking
                  glasses are all modern. This surprizes me in <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> you, who struck the right key with so unerring a hand in Ellenore!

                  &amp; in spite of the general power which pervades it the poem does not please me. In
                  all legendary tales I require the absence of all ideas &amp; phraseology which are manifestly
                  modern &amp; force upon me the anachronism. In all dramatic writing or dialogue I require
                  brevity &amp; the breaks of passion &amp; the plainness <span class="strikethrough">of</span>, in all, narrative rapidity – &amp; that it be so perspicacious as to be instantaneously
                  understood. – If I had given you the more recondite &amp; metaphysical feelings which
                  make me object to the passages here noted as faulty – you would form some judgement
                  of the care with which I reject in writing. for it is a bad symptom that I am now
                  as solicitous to wound faults as I once was to produce beauties: But again of Bluebeard
                  – I believe a shorter line is better for narration – &amp; wish you had modelled the story
