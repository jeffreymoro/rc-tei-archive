                           rare medieval metrical romances since the sixteenth century. It was compiled by one
                           Richard Heege in the fifteenth century. Southey was arranging for its purchase, through
                           the good offices of Scott, by Scott’s friend Thomas Thomson (1768–1852; DNB), an Edinburgh
                           advocate, record keeper and editor of medieval manuscripts. From Thomson the manuscript
                           went to the Advocates Library, Edinburgh. It remains in their collection today (National
                           Library of Scotland, Advocates MS 19.3.1). For more information; see So…</span></div>

                  they in return will make their draft payable to M<sup>rs</sup> Sherbrook, &amp; inclose it to me, as it will be decorous that I should write to her,

               rare medieval metrical romances since the sixteenth century. It was compiled by one
               Richard Heege in the fifteenth century. Southey was arranging for its purchase, through
               the good offices of Scott, by Scott’s friend Thomas Thomson (1768–1852; <em>DNB</em>), an Edinburgh advocate, record keeper and editor of medieval manuscripts. From Thomson
               the manuscript went to the Advocates Library, Edinburgh. It remains in their collection
               today (National Library of Scotland, Advocates MS 19.3.1). For more information; see

               to give bread to starving peasants during a famine, the bishop locked them up in a
               barn and set fire to it, burning all the occupants. Out of the ruins of the barn there
               appeared a great many rats (or mice, in some versions of the story) who pursued the
               bishop and devoured him. Southey wrote a poem on this subject entitled, ‘God’s Judgement
               On A Bishop’, published in the <em>Morning Post</em>, 27 November 1799 and reprinted in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (Bristol, 1800), <em>Metrical Tales</em> (1805), <em>Minor Poems</em> (1815 and 1823) and <em>Poetical Works Collected by Himself</em> (1837–1838).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
