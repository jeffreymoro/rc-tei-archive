                  </div> &amp; also that he was born in the birth-place of his fathers. Men are not like potatoes
                  the better for changing soil; – as far as my observation extends the finest people
                  in England both morally &amp; physically, are those whose forefathers have lived upon
                  the same spot from time immemorial; – they are born to a rich inheritance of good
                  works, fair <span class="strikethrough">respect</span> reputation &amp; kindly feelings, &amp; have as it were a relationship to the very earth they
                  tread on, which in time of need would make them its best defenders. It seems to be
                  supposed that man is not injured by transplanting, because he is locomotive, – as
                  if the heart &amp; the affections did not strike root. A Humphrey Senhouse would have
                  lost much had he been born anywhere but at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</a>. I hate an overgrown aristocracy; – the land-Leviathans who overspread whole counties
                  are the bane of England, but in proportion as I abominate them do I wish to see the
                  old English feelings of family dignity &amp; character preserved, as the best counteracting
                  principle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I spent two days at Workington Hall last week.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Workington Hall in Cumbria was owned by John Christian Curwen (1756–1828; DNB), politician
                           and agriculturist, where he embarked on an improvement programme that had a profound
                           impact on local agriculture in the first half of the nineteenth century.</span></div>
                  </div> Once before I had declined going, &amp; could not repeat the refusal without incivility,
                  – but I do not like M<sup>r</sup> Curwen, except as a member of Parliament; – his manners are compleatly artificial,
                  &amp; the more I have seen of him the less respectfully do I estimate his powers of mind. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Burdett">Sir Francis Burdett</a> was not exactly right in what he said about the gentleman-agriculturists, – neither
                  was he altogether wrong. They are doing that in person which they should do by proxy,
                  – &amp; they are attempting to unite characters which are not in themselves compatible.
                  M<sup>r</sup> Curwen sells flour at his farm, fourpence (I think) a stone cheaper than it can be
                  bought at the shops, so he has a board over the fire-place of his shop – (or counter
                  or whatever it may be called) with this inscription ‘We do not give, but expect thanks
                  from our customers.’ Now this is a bad thing. People who pay for what they want, expect
                  to be thanked for their custom, – &amp; it is better they should pay an additional fourpence
                  a stone to some poor shop-keeper, no richer than themselves, who would thank them
                  for it, than be told that they are obliged to M<sup>r</sup> Curwen for taking their money, &amp; that if they do not chuse to thank him they may go
                  somewhere else. A farthing upon a pound of flour is well paid for mutual civility
                  &amp; the wholesome feeling of mutual obligation.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The system of stall-feeding milch cows succeeds admirably in calculation, I both hope
               &amp; trust it will not succeed in any other way, for if it should country cows hereafter
               will be as miserable as London cows, &amp; instead of seeing them every where at pasture,
               we must look for them in cow-houses yoked by the neck to a wooden post, &amp; feeding
               out of a trough. The milkmaid will have to enter a sty instead of carrying her pail
               into the field &amp; Heaven help the poets &amp; painters! But the thing is too unnatural
               to continue long. I learnt from somebody else that these cows had a sort of itch,
               – &amp; that they caught cold if were let out &amp; happened to get wet thro! – </p>
            <p class="indent1">I have never yet seen any thorough gentleman-agriculturist who was the better for
               his pursuit, &amp; sure I am that very many of them are the worse for it. To be perpetually
               <span class="strikethrough">think</span> conversant with farmers, graziers, &amp; butchers, <span class="strikethrough">x</span> thinking from morning till night about manure, consulting about tups &amp; bulls, what
               sheep are to be sent to market, &amp; when the calf’s throat is to be cut, are not the
               best means of improving either the imagination or the understanding. M<sup>r</sup> Curwen has a room full of agricultural books, – yet he said enough to prove that
               he was utterly ignorant of the physiology of plants, &amp; I could not discover that he
               had paid the slightest attention to any other branch of knowledge, – except the mere
               subjects of the day.</p>
