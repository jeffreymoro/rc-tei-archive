            <p class="indent1">YOU have with much propriety declared, that the complaints of offended authors against
               their critics cannot be inserted in the Athenæum; it is not the place for them. Every
               critical journal ought to be open to such replies, under obvious restrictions; and
               if admittance were refused to a fair defence in one, it should be granted in another.
               Such a regulation would be some check upon the licentiousness of reviewers; as it
               is now, their gross ignorance and their wilful misrepresentations pass current, and
               do their work of malice, because there is no place in which they can be exposed. It
               will not be supposed that this censure of reviewers is meant to be general and indiscriminating;
               but it cannot be denied, that every existing journal furnishes some proofs of its
               truth.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Notwithstanding your prohibition, I presume that you will permit an error in literary
                  history to be set right, wherefrom-ever it may occur. It is said in a late number
                  of the Critical Review, that Mr. Hole’s Arthur ‘failed of success, because published <span class="ital">at the same time</span> with the Joans of Arc, Alfreds, and Cœur de Lions, which disgusted the world within
                  the very name Epic.’

                           favourably to Southey’s Joan of Arc (1796), to Alfred (1800) by Joseph Cottle, and

                  </div> Arthur, or the Northern Enchantment, was published in 1790, Joan of Arc in 1796, the
                  Alfreds and Cœur de Lion in 1800. The failure of Mr. Hole’s poem, therefore, is not
                  attributed to the true cause; and it cannot b[e] necessary to point out why this false
                  one has been invented.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Mr. Holes Arthur failed of success because it did not deserve it. The poem had fair
                  play; it appeared before reviews were converted into tools of party, and before the
                  butchers’ phrase, ‘cutting up,’ was supposed to be synonymous with criticising. The
                  journals gave it at least as much praise as it deserved, and it failed in spite of
                  them, as the Epigoniad

                  possessed were made of no use. There is no name with which a chivalrous or a poetical
                  mind associates more delightful recollections than with the name of Arthur, but it
                  is with the Arthur of the Round Table and of Spenser; for there are enough indications
                  in the Faery Queen, that if that wonderful poem had been completed, the hero would
                  have been sufficiently identified with the Arthur of Romance.
