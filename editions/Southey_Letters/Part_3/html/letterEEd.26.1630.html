                  at the R Oak, &amp; would be happy to wait on me at whatever hour I might appoint, – so
                  I asked him to dinner, – a lucky piece of civility on my part, – inasmuch as it appeared
                  afterwards that he was come from Penrith on purpose to see me, &amp; returned there the
                  same night. Of this I had not the smallest suspicion. The matter was this: I had in
                  a letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> said that a Review of old books, – that is of any books, except such as were in the
                  province in the contemporary Criticism, – would answer if it were well conducted.
                  Scott talked this over in London, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</a> returning from thence came commissioned to treat with me about such a work. Things
                  will not be finally settled till I have seen <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a> who offers to take a great share in the work, if I will conduct it – I am offered
                  100 a year as editor, – &amp; ten guineas a sheet. the thing to be in quarterly five shilling
