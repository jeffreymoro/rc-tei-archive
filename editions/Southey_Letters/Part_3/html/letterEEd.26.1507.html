               <p>The Portugueze have a better story to make out than you have made for them. The conscription
                  certainly had been enforced, but it was before any stir began in Spain, &amp; consequently
                  before there was any probability of resisting to good purpose. The business at Porto
                  may not have been upon a great scale, but perhaps you are not aware that there is
                  in the large towns a French party in opposition to an English one, &amp; therefore the
                  true Portugueze have had more to contend with than the Spaniards. Besides they certainly
                  lost no time in stirring: long before Duponts surrender

                  </div> the whole of Algarve had risen, &amp; you may see what Alentejo has suffered for rising,
                  exposed as it was to troops from Lisbon on the one side &amp; from Elvas on the other.
                  The French had more troops there in proportion than in Spain, &amp; better distributed.
                  There is also this remarkable difference between the two countries. In the one the
                  higher you ascend in rank the better the people are, – that is till you come to royalty
                  which is necessarily worthless everywhere. But in Portugal the reverse holds good,
                  &amp; nothing can be worse than the nobility &amp; the fidalgos. This is only to be accounted
                  for physically. The kingdom is very small, &amp; as these casts intermarry only among
                  themselves the breed has degenerated, – syphilis too has probably in many or most
                  instances left a taint in the blood &amp; helped on the process of kakkerlakkenism.

               <p>Your estimate of Spain is right. the difference between our age &amp; that of Elizabeth
                  is that the bulk of the people are better in no respect, &amp; worse in some: that the
                  middle classes are fineered instead of being heart of oak, – &amp; the higher ones are
                  better classics &amp; worse in every other possible point of view. Ours is a degrading
                  &amp; dwarfing system of society I believe as you do that the Spaniards have displayed
                  more spirit than we should have done, &amp; that the peacemongers were ready to have sacrificed
