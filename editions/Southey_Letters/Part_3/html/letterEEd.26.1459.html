               <p>I will use such materials as have stood the test, – those materials are the same in
                  all languages, &amp; we know what they are. With respect to metre it is otherwise. there
                  we must look to English only, &amp; in English we have no other great poem than Paradise
                  Lost. Blank verse has long appeared to me the noblest measure of which our language
                  is capable, – but it would not suit Kehama. there must be quicker – wilder movements
                  – there must be gorgeousness of ornament also, – eastern gem work; – &amp; sometimes rhyme
                  must be scattered upon rhyme till the reader is half dozing with the thundering echo.
                  My motto must be Ποικιλον ειδος εχων, οτι ποικιλον <span class="strikethrough">δι</span> υμνον αρασσω.

                  </div> This is not from any ambition of novelty, but from the nature &amp; necessity of the subject.
                  I am well aware that novelty in such things <span class="strikethrough">in</span> is an obstacle to success, – Thalaba

                  </div> has proved it to be so. The mass of mankind hate innovation, they hate to unlearn
                  what they have learnt wrong, &amp; they hate to confess their ignorance by submitting
                  to learn any thing right. I would tread in the beaten road <span class="strikethrough">th</span> rather than get among thorns by turning out of it, but the beaten road will not take
                  me where I want to go. What seems best to be done is this, to write mostly in rhyme,
                  – to slip into it rather than out of it, &amp; then generally into some metre so strongly
                  marked as to leave the ear fully satisfied.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>One inference I think must be drawn from the obscurity of Pindars

                  </div> metre that be what it may, the pleasure which it gave did not result from the rhythm.
                  Indeed the whole system of Classical metres seems to have been that of creating difficulty
                  for the sake of overcoming it. We mis-read sapphics without making them worse, – we
                  misread pentameters &amp; make better; &amp; the hexameter remains the most perceptible of
                  all other measures tho in our pronunciation we generally distort four feet out of
                  six.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A great deal more may be done with rhyme than has yet been done with it – there is
               a crypto-rhyme which may often be introduced with excellent effect, the eye has nothing
               to do with it, but the ear feels it without perhaps perceiving any thing more than
               the general <span class="strikethrough">effect</span> &lt;harmony&gt;, &amp; not knowing how that <span class="strikethrough">effect was</span> &lt;harmony is&gt; produced. Sometimes the sparing inter mixture of rhyme in a paragraph
               may be so managed as to satisfy the ear, &amp; give greater effect to their after profusion.
               These are not things which one thinks of in composition, but they are thought of in
               correcting. They are the touches in finishing off, when a little alteration produces
               a great difference</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your dislike of the ballad metre is perhaps because you are sick of a tune which has
                  been sung so often &amp; so badly. It is not as capable of dignity, but there is a sort
                  of language which usually goes with it &amp; <span class="strikethrough">seems to</span> has the effect of making it so. Kehama is pitched in too high a key for it. I shall
                  weed out all uncouth lines, &amp; leave the public nothing to abuse except the strangeness
                  of the fable, which you may be sure will be plentifully abused. The mythology <span class="strikethrough">will</span> explains itself as it is introduced, – yet because the names are not familiar people
                  will fancy there is a difficulty in understanding it. Sir William Jones has <span class="strikethrough">not</span> done nothing in introducing it so coldly &amp; formally as he has done.
