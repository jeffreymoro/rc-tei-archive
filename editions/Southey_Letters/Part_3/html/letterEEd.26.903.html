            <p class="indent1">I was glad at seeing your hand writing this evening – &amp; in truth you would have seen
               mine before – if I had had heart to write to you – that could not be done without
               adverting to our removal from Bristol, a subject which still brings with it too much
               pain to be ever voluntarily admitted into my mind. You will, I am sure, rejoice to
               hear <span class="strikethrough">x</span> that it is probable I shall soon again become a father, but indeed the recollection
               of what has past makes it to me a thing more of anxiety than of hope.</p>

                           edited to relieve Chatterton’s family from financial distress. In 1803 Southey reckoned
                           that the publication would clear over £400 for her.</span></div>

                  more one who had been cheated, suspicion was to be expected, &amp; both you &amp; I did foresee
                  it &amp; wisely provide against it. But if any farther symptoms should appear, it will
                  then be proper to wash our hands clean &amp; let her negociate immediately with the publishers.
                  It will be well to publish the statement in the Monthly Magazine, &amp; perhaps in the
                  Gentlemans also when the booksellers whom you mention have settled their accounts.
                  She has good reason to be thankful – for we have done better for her in publishing

                  </div> my bargain is the same as yours, – to share the eventual profits. they however are
                  to expend more upon the work, for it is to have vignettes &amp; tail-pieces, some in copper,
                  some in wood according as the subjects suit. I made this stipulation. not from any
                  ambition of what is merely ornamental, nor solely from the wiser motive of setting
                  eye-traps in the booksellers windows, but because I wish to have the costume, the
                  antiquities, &amp; the natural history of the poem elucidated. Thus there will first come

                  </div> I divide the poem into parts – of which the first ending with his return to America,
                  &amp; comprising the old six books, is finished. The subdivisions are now eighteen in
                  number, called by no &lt;common&gt; name, but each having its title from its subject – as
                  thus – 1. The Return. 2. The Banquet. 3. Cadwallon. 4 The Voyage &amp;c − &amp; the length
                  perfectly at pleasure. some exceeding 300 lines, some short of 100. the whole 18 containing
                  about 3700. from 8 to 9000 will be the content of the whole. These minutenesses would
                  interest you as mere literary gossip if I were not assured that you will take a nearer
                  interest in a poem which is among your old recollections &amp; belongs to an old friend.
                  You will find great additions – of the alterations you will hardly be sensible, as
                  they are of that nature which occur almost in every line, affecting the sentences
                  not the story, the story remaining nearly the same, except that much is ingrafted
                  into it. It has cost me much labour, &amp; will yet cost much. What is added in the second
                  part will relate chiefly to the extirpation of idolatry − &amp; in fact the philosophy
                  of the poem will be showing how to civilize &amp; convert by force − for the last tail
                  piece − or else for the title-page there shall be this emblem, the Cross planted upon
                  a rock, a Palm Tree beside it, &amp; a spring of living waters gushing forth.

               of this labour. In 1789 I conceived the design of writing upon Madoc &amp; in the course
               of that &amp; the two ensuing years more than once began – In the winter of 1794 the first
               book &amp; half were written in the state which you may remember. In the spring of 1797
               <span class="strikethrough">rewritt</span> corrected &amp; carried on to the [MS torn] of the fourth book, in 1798 resumed &amp; finished
               in 1799. It then remained till October 1801 when the rewriting was commenced at Dublin
               − &amp; this is the history. Yet so much of my thought &amp; so many of my solitary feelings
               have been fixed upon this object, that the getting rid of it at once – the turning
               it adrift, &amp; making my main private delight public property – seems the most serious
               thing I have ever done in my life. Not from any anxiety for its fate – for I know
               the acorn will come up, tho I shall never see its growth, nor sit under the shade
               of my own Oak: but having considered it as my own great work, the publication will
               bring with it a feeling that my great work is done – &amp; that I may go to rest.</p>
