               <div class="salute">My dear friend</div>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is so long since I have written to you that my conscience would rise up in judgement
                  against me, – if the silence on your part had not been longer than mine. During this
                  interval one or two things have occurred to me which you will not be displeased to
                  hear. – For two or three years past I have occasionally interchanged letters with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a>, – originating in an interchange of books. Some three months ago he wrote to tell
                  me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</a> had a great desire to serve me, – that he talked the matter over with him (W Scott)
                  &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis</a>, – that he would have offered me the situation of <span class="ital">precis</span>-writer in his own office, but on considerations its emoluments were not thought equivalent
                  to the sacrifice of time &amp; the change of abode required, – &amp; that he left it to Scott
                  to find out by consulting me in what manner I could be served most conformably to
                  my own wishes &amp; pursuits. Diplomatic situations, or professorships at the Universities
                  were mentioned. – Concerning the former my reply was, that the time in which such
                  a situation was desirable was gone by. (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a> being in England &amp; I myself settled with my books about me.) – concerning the latter,
                  – they are fenced round about with tests, – I cannot go thro the door, &amp; will not
                  leap over the hedge. Moreover my way of life was determined, – it was my deliberate
                  &amp; unrepented choice, &amp; no prospects however flattering could induce me to change it.
                  I asked however to have the office of Historiographer created for me, with a respectable
                  salary. – While things were in this state I learnt that the Stewardship of the Derwentwater
                  Estates was likely soon to be vacated, &amp; I was advised to ask for this. Accordingly
                  I wrote to Scott, &amp; at the same time to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> (my constant privy Counsellor) asking his advice.

                  </div> Both thought it the best thing that could be sought for, – &amp; both urged me to obtain <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdales</a> recommendation for it, as paramount . – Well – behold me place-hunting, – I write
                  my plain story to my twenty-mile-off-neighbour <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Humphrey Senhouse</a> (the only <span class="ital">friend</span> whom I have made in the county) – requesting him to apply to Ld Lonsdale, – &amp; I write

                  </div> Both take the matter up warmly, – Ld Lonsdale enters very handsomely into my views,

                  </div> in whose gift it is to be, &amp; with whom Sir G. is very intimate. The answer under a
                  plea that very peculiar qualifications are required for the situation, implied that

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>So ended this quest. With respect to the Historiographers place Canning said there
                  was a great objection to creating any new place, however just the occasion; – when
                  lo! to the great surprize of all parties I discovered that the place already existed
                  &amp; was held <span class="strikethrough">by</span> &lt;of&gt; all men in the world by Dutens the Frenchman.

                           and it went to one of his particular bêtes noires, James Stanier Clarke (c. 1765–1834;
                           DNB).</span></div>
                  </div> So C. promised all his influence for it whenever the said Dutens should go to Heaven,
                  – &amp; you know the least thing <span class="strikethrough">you can</span> to be expected from a Frenchman is that he should go <span class="ital">there</span> to oblige <span class="strikethrough">you</span> one. – The topsy-turvy changes in Administration which have just taken place, put

                  </div> W Scott, applied to me to write the history of Spanish affairs for the year (1808)
                  – this, liking the subject, I undertook. They found themselves woefully disappointed
                  in the sample of the other part of the history which was sent them, – so much so that
                  they cancelled it, &amp; applied to me to undertake the whole, – for which they offered
                  me 400 £ a year. I have accepted it for one year on trial, – hoping &amp; indeed expecting
                  to continue it, – less in love with the employment than with the ‘sweet remuneration’
                  that awaits it.

                  astonished Ballantyne. He is exceedingly delighted with it, – looking bookseller-like
