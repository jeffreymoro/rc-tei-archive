               <p>Nearly a fortnight ago I sent you a draft at sight on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> for forty pounds – during this time I have been so unwell that I have not till now
                  recollected that you have not acknowledged it. If it should not have arrived write
                  to stop payment – tho I fear it may be too late.
