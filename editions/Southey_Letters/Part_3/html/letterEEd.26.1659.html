            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Some little while ago I received a letter from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a> telling me that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">M<sup>r</sup> Canning</a> had expressed a wish to serve me, that he would have offered me a situation of 200
                  £ a year in his own department, but on consideration it was thought not worth my acceptance
                  as requiring more time &amp; attendance than were equivalent to the salary, &amp; that in
                  consequence he, Scott, was desired to communicate with me upon the subject, &amp; learn
                  in what manner I could be benefitted most conformably to my own pursuits &amp; inclinations.
                  Now the Stewardship for the Derwentwater Estates, held by a M<sup>r</sup> Walton,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> is expected soon to be vacated by his death, – the whole would be thought too much
                  for me I apprehend, but this objection might easily be remedied by seperating the
                  Cumberland from the Northumberland property.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)

                           the end it was considered unsuitable for him; see Southey to Walter Scott, 8 August
                           1809 (Letter 1666) and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 12 August 1809 (Letter

                  </div> This therefore I mentioned to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</a>, – his reply is that the thing seems feasible, but that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdales</a> recommendation will probably command it, that at any rate his countenance would be
                  in the highest degree important &amp; therefore he urged me to make what interest I could
                  in that quarter, stating the grounds upon which I applied, – that is, the disposition
                  on the part of the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">M<sup>r</sup> Canning</a> towards me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I should like this office because it would give me the care of these woods, &amp; the
                  power of planting &amp; beautifying this neighbourhood. I should like the salary because
                  it would enable me to follow without interruption <span class="strikethrough">such</span> &lt;those&gt; literary pursuits for which I am best qualified. I have written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeaumontSirGeorge">Sir George Beaumont</a> requesting his recommendation at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lowther</a>, &amp; I have requested <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> to do the same to Lord Bute,

                  </div> A word from you would perhaps be of more avail than from either; for tho <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</a> appears sensible of the credit which is gained in these times by patronising literature,
                  he is far more likely to have election purposes in view. If however from any just
                  cause or impediment you are unwilling to address him upon the subject, tell me so
                  as freely as I have now applied to you. The chance is important enough to make it
                  my duty to omit no likely means of success. My circumstances would be materially bettered
                  by obtaining it, – but I shall suffer neither expectation nor failure in the slightest
                  degree to diminish my tranquillity.</p>

                  else, but with anomalous &lt;symptoms&gt; which seemed to me to indicate some organic disease.
                  My <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">little boy</a> had just before been saved from the croup. At present, thank God, all are well, except
