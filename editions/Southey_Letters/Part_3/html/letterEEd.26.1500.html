                           and a Short Residence in Portugal.</span></div>
                  </div> which it is thought proper to reprint at this time. By well weeding it, referring
                  to the original journal, and hunting out local information, it is made into a respectable
                  book, and one which future travellers will find useful. It will be printed in two
                  small volumes, making the whole of my operas in that size twenty-two-a pretty regiment
                  when in good uniform. It required some effort of prudential patience in me not to
                  write to you two days ago, immediately upon the receipt of an epistle from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CampbellHenry">Horse Campbell</a>. The Equus Evangelizans (who sayeth that he hath no taste in poetry for anything
                  above a tabernacle hymn?) has taken occasion from ‘Kirke White’s Remains’

                  </div> to write and inquire of me whether I may not have suppressed some edifying papers,
                  because they differed from my own sentiments. This, however, he has done with all
                  possible civility, and it prefaces an attempt to convert me to the Calvinist faith,
                  and an invitation to Shrewsbury. The letter is by no means a bad one: you know there
                  was always a spice of shrewdness in the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CampbellHenry">Horse</a>, which gave a finer flavour to his absurdity. I give him full credit for sincerity,
                  and had a gush of laughter upon discovering who the epistle came from, which was honestly
                  worth five shillings, and would have been worth five guineas if you and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> had been here to have participated in it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Nothing makes me so melancholy as to ‘call over the names’ at Westminster. I tried
               to find out <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">Combe</a> in London, but he was not to be heard of at the Temple. It is about six years since
               I saw him. Both he and I have grown into men with as little change as possible in
               either and yet, after a few minutes, there was a dead weight upon me which was not
               to be shaken off. We met with the heartiness of old and thorough familiarity – something
               like a family feeling; but it was necessary to go back to school, for the moment we
               ceased to be schoolboys there was nothing in common between us. We had no common acquaintance
               or pursuit, and I feel that of all things in the world there is nothing more mortifying
               than to meet an old friend from whom you have had no weaning, and to find your friendship
               cut through at the root.</p>

                  </div> and Nicol has acknowledged me for a true prophet. It is indeed a scene unparalleled
                  in history, and a more glorious one never has and never can be exhibited to the world. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</a> (Gebir) is gone as a volunteer. I know not whether we ought to desire a renewal of
                  the war in Germany or not. If North Germany could be roused, that would be something;
                  but from Austria it seems to me that no good can be expected till its Government be
                  cut up root and branch. A diversion there will give Bonaparte a pretext for abandoning
                  Spain. He will beat the Austrians and freshen his popularity in France by so doing;
                  the Spaniards will be tempted to cross the Pyrenees, and there they would probably
                  meet with defeats of which I have no fear while they remain on the right side, even
                  though their enemy were tenfold mightier than he is.</p>

My brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>, knowing nothing of his quarrel with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">his sister</a>, called there on his way to Plymouth; he was with the haymakers, and had his back
                  towards him when he approached. ‘How d’ye do, sir?’ says <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>; and ‘How d’ye do?’ he answered, without turning his face. ‘You seem very busy, sir.’
                  ‘Very busy.’ Not a word more; so that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> could not avoid saying, ‘I think, sir, you don’t seem glad to see me.’ ‘I never desire
                  to see any of the family.’ <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> then went to the house to look for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">his aunt</a>, and heard from the servants that ‘he had used her worse than a dog,’ and turned
                  her out of doors. She herself is a woman whose spirit has been long since broken down,
                  and who would bear, and did bear, a great deal in the hope of serving us; and even
                  now she begs me to say nothing which can offend him, because she thinks I am not quite
                  out of his good graces. And I believe this very fear of making him displeased with
                  me prevents her from coming here, as I have urgently requested her to do. It does
                  not fall to every man’s lot to have had two such precious uncles.
