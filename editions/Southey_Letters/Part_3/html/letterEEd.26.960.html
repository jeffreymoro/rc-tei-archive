                  </div> We were then school boys – &amp; now I have grey hairs in my head. It is so little likely

                  a sense of radical faults in the story, that my feelings are not what they used to
                  be at the sight of a proof sheet. This &amp; the history – but for many long years – this
                  has been the <span class="strikethrough">thing</span> &lt;work&gt; to which I lookd forward – &amp; when <span class="strikethrough">wor</span> ones work is done it seems as if the day would soon be over.</p>
