               Southey wrote of him ‘his school failed him, not because he was deficient in learning—of
               which he seems to have had a full share for his station—but because of his gross and
               scandalous miscouduct.’ Later, he ‘kept something . . . like an alehouse’ performing
               marriages there for the fee of a crown per couple. See George Price, ‘Emanuel Collins’,
