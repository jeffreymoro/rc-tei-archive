            <p class="indent1">I received a letter last night from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> which has vexed me a good deal. he mentions the receipt of the last ten £ you sent
               him, &amp; the inconvenience which he suffers for want of more regular &amp; adequate supplies
               he goes on in these words ‘To write to a person with whom I have so little personal
               acquaintance as M<sup>r</sup> May upon this subject is disagreeable to myself &amp; must be troublesome to him. I have
               indeed so often annoyed him that I feel unwilling to write now, the more so, as I
               cannot express myself so strongly as I would wish without appearing rude. In a fortnight
               I shall be pressed for money if I do not receive some. Let me be regularly supplied
               even with little, &amp; let me know what I am to expect, &amp; I shall accommodate myself
               to my situation – or endeavour to better it.’ – he says also – ‘I do not lead an extravagant
               life, on the contrary I never was more œconomical in my habits’.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A year &amp; half hence when he has his diploma in his pocket it will be very well that
               he should endeavour to <span class="strikethrough">attempt</span> better himself – but any attempt of that kind now would ruin all his professional
               views – &amp; I own it is what I have been at times apprehensive of, recollecting the
               effect of a similar pressure upon myself – tho my supplies were more scanty than his.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>What I know of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> English income was communicated in my last,

                  </div> &amp; I hope soon to communicate a confirmation of it from his agents. at any rate I am
                  sure there will be more than 300 £ – <span class="strikethrough">prob</span> the next quarter as the allowance from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a> will be coming in, there will be no call on my Uncle – under these circumstances I
                  think I am justified in requesting you to send him 20 £ – tho I write with almost
                  as much reluctance as he himself would have done – for in all likelihood it is asking
                  you to advance – in plain English to lend – the money. &amp; the habit of receiving obligations
                  from you has as little blunted the feeling with which I remember them – as it has
                  the sense of their value.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">There would have been money in abundance but for what has been squandered upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a>. fifty you remitted to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</a> – for his first fitting out – on which she did not expend a third part of the sum.
               140 <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasDr">D<sup>r</sup> Thomas</a> expended – all this in one year – when a third part would have done all we wished
               for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>. – the same revenues which supplied this money <span class="strikethrough">will</span> are coming in again, &amp; you may be assured that had there been a doubt of the whole
               300 £ being paid in, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> would not have preferred <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> to his brother. his intention was to increase our power of disposing of his money
               – not to limit it.</p>
