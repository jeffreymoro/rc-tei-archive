               &amp; inconvenience, &amp; every thing here was to my hearts desire. Knowing by experience
               <span class="strikethrough">xx xxxxx xxx</span> &lt;so many of &gt; the accidents of life, I am thankful for this happy return.</p>

                  against the surgeons) but he ought to have remained under able hands till the parts
                  had recovered their strength.

                  than could have reached the south. I found him beginning to be uneasy about his eldest
                  child, &amp; upon asking a few questions clearly, perceived that there was every symptom
                  of hydrocephalus &amp; that those symptoms had been blindly neglected. Among other things
                  I mentioned to him a mode of practice which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">King</a> have often found successful, that of bleeding in the jugular vein, – &amp; promised him
                  to make search for a letter of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KingJohn">Kings</a>, wherein he had described the operation so minutely that he wished me if <span class="strikethrough">ever</span> a country practitioner hesitated (&amp; the case required it) to operate myself<span class="strikethrough">x</span> by the directions. My meaning was to alarm <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a>, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">it</span> in this I so far succeeded, that he immediately began to look for some account of
                  the disease &amp; that account so increased his alarm that he dispatched a messenger at
                  midnight, who called me up <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;before&gt; four in the morning to look for the letter in question – If the child is
                  saved, as probably it may, he will owe his life entirely to this. They wanted me to
