                        C. C. Southey, as Southey’s letter to Edith dated 11 May 1804 (Letter 939), states
                        that he has just arrived in Liverpool and is catching the coach to London at 6pm on
                        that day. That letter is also postmarked 11 May 1804, which verifies its date. Southey

                  got into the coach; slept at Warrington; breakfasted at Stone; dined at Birmingham;
                  slept at Stratford-upon-Avon; in the dark we reached that place, so that I could not
                  see Shakspeare’s grave, but I will return that road on purpose. At five, on Sunday
                  morning, we arrived in Oxford, and I walked through it at that quiet and delightful
                  hour, and thought of the past and the present. We did not reach London till after
                  five last evening, so that I was forty-eight hours in the coach. I landed at the White
                  Horse Cellar; no coach was to be procured, and I stood in all the glory of my filth
                  beside my trunk, at the Cellar door, in my spencer

                  by in all their finery, and all looked askance on me.

                  to admire me, pulled it off, and gave it to my dirty porter, and exhibited as genteel
