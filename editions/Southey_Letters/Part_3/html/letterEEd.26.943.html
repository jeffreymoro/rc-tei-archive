                  with the sweet draught because it is given in a goblet of such workmanship. I saw
                  it rapidly &amp; therefore cannot recriticise till it lies before me. there are however
                  some things to be defended. I ought to have explained my design – that of exhibiting
                  the various mythologies of the world in a set of poems founded upon the characteristics
                  of each.
