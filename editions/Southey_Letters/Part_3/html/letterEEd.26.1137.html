                           Poetry and Letters, which was published in 1806. Wordsworth translated one sonnet;
                           Southey three sonnets and a madrigal. A further poem, ‘And sweet it is to see in summer
                           time’, was a joint effort, the first four stanzas by Wordsworth, the following five
                           by Southey. See Kenneth Curry, ‘Uncollected Translations of Michelangelo by Wordsworth
