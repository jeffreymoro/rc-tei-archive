               one in the way of study I readily excuse him, remembering what my own habits were
               when something younger. As you may suppose he left behind him a very favourable impression
               with every body; with me also tho I wish him more perseverance, &amp; enough self-denial
               to secure his own permanent comfort &amp; self-complacency. Advice usually excites dislike
               – I therefore never offered it. <span class="strikethrough">or xxxxx for xxxx xxx xxxxxx</span> he knew what I thought right, &amp; to have told him when I thought he was wrong would
               only have provoked him to a defence. Our time passed easily, &amp; should we remain here
               next summer I shall be glad when the time for his return arrives, &amp; he will not be
