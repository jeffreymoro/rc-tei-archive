                  most impracticable one for a painter, &amp; had you begun the picture, it is ten thousand
                  to one that you must have finished it from memory. His countenance is the most variable
                  that I have ever seen; sometimes it is kindled with the brightest expression, &amp; sometimes
                  all its light goes out &amp; is utterly extinguished. Nothing can convey stronger indications
                  of power than his eye, eye brow &amp; fore head, – nothing can be more imbecil than all
                  the rest of the face; – look at them seperately you would hardly think it possible
                  that they could belong to one head, – look at them together you wonder how they came

                  </div> kindness so lamely that you were not certain I was gratified, &amp; that in a very high
                  degree. It has been my lot, Miss Betham, to meet with much injustice in the world
                  – both as an individual &amp; an author, &amp; the effect it has had upon me has been to make
                  me more sensible of any act of kindness. I have taken up a comfortable opinion that
                  evil tongues speak only for themselves, but that favourable ones may be considered
                  as speaking for posterity; &amp; this opinion is likely to be true, because they who abuse
                  me do it in their vocation &amp; have therefore an obvious motive for so doing, whereas
                  on the other hand no person can have any other motive for praising me – than the belief <span class="strikethrough">x</span> that I deserve praise. We who write poetry have a double object in view, to please
                  ourselves, &amp; to please others; it is very gratifying to succeed in either. –Besides
                  the general reason why I am greatly gratified in this <span class="strikethrough">particular</span> instance, it will give<span class="add">⟨n⟩</span> me particular pleasure to see my own conceptions embodied, &amp; set before me in a visible
                  &amp; permanent form. It has been always my wish to have my <span class="strikethrough">long p</span> long poems accompanied with <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> prints, because so many pictures are lost to those readers who are not familiar with
                  the costume: I particularly desired this for Madoc,
