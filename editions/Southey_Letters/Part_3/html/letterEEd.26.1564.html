                  Spain before the public dared <span class="strikethrough">any</span> entertain any, &amp; shall have strong hopes long after the public will despair. There
                  is not under heaven so patriotic a people as the Spaniards. they are proud of their
                  past greatness, &amp; sensible of their present degradation, – yet with the feeling that
                  the degeneracy is not in them but in their government. It is the same with the Portugueze,
                  – I was never ten minutes in conversation with one, that he did not allude to the
                  state of the country, as if he sought by expressing his sense of national shame, to <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> show that none of it attached to him as an individual. – From these people every thing
                  is to be expected, except what our ministry was weak enough to expect, – that they
                  should at once be able to stand against equal or superior numbers of the French in
                  the field. The war of the Low Countries against Philip 2 is the only parallel in modern

                  been so grossly neglected that I can neither speak nor think upon the subject with
                  patience. But I have thought it worth while to trouble you with a letter because a
                  few more blunders will ruin all.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Bonaparte will beyond a doubt push for Seville &amp; Cadiz, &amp; for Lisbon. Cadiz is a regular
               fortification &amp; may hold out. Seville depends wholly upon the passes of the Sierra
               Morena, &amp; the city itself is larger than Madrid &amp; equally defenceless. It is hardly
               of less importance than Madrid, perhaps indeed of more, as the Junta has no other
               Capital of imposing name to retire to. Now in the present state of things ten thousand
               British could better defend those passes, than any force the Spaniards have, – &amp; yet
               upon every breath of bad news we disembark our troops, &amp; countermand sailing orders,
               instead of running them over in ships of war as fast as they could be got on board.
               If it be possible to ruin that country &amp; this too, such fancies &amp; such pusillanimity
               will do it.</p>

                           career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784–1790. After the controversial Convention
                           of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian
                           peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna.</span></div>
                  </div> has misled himself for the sake of drawing Bonapartes main force towards the North,
                  – by which means he will be able to land troops at Porto, Lisbon or Cadiz, before
                  the enemy can march there. Lisbon is effectually defended on one side by the Tagus,
                  which is fordable no nearer than Santarem (nearly fifty miles up) &amp; then only in the
                  dry season. This too is a passage which never would be <span class="strikethrough">ventured</span> attempted against any respectable force on the heights of the town. At Abrantes there
                  is a bridge of boats. If an invading enemy enter Portugal higher up &amp; keep on the
                  North of the Tagus, as hitherto they have always done, – then the river Zezere which
                  falls into the Tagus about ten miles below Abrantes, is supposed to be the strong
                  post on which the safety of Lisbon depends. I have crost this river, it is about as
                  wide as the Bath river, &amp; its banks are steep. If the enemy enter from Galicia &amp; keep
                  along the coast, it is but to break down bridges, &amp; the Minho, the Douro, &amp; the Mondego
                  are each impassable. <span class="strikethrough">If</span> Higher up these rivers is one uninterrupted track of mountains. Very few countries
                  are so defensible as Portugal. Hitherto we have been keeping 10,000 men <span class="strikethrough">there</span> at Lisbon to preserve Portugueze traitors from justice, in virtue of the blessed convention
                  of Cintra. The main part of them are now it seems marched into Spain, in what direction
                  we know not. If it be towards Seville <span class="strikethrough">all is well. But</span> that would be well. But Portugal requires at this time 30,000 English, &amp; with that
                  force it would be safe, unless Sir Hew, or Sir Harry, <span class="strikethrough">were at</span> or any &lt;other&gt; old woman in regimentals be at their head.

                           army in Portugal was repatriated in British ships. The other general responsible for
                           this decision was Sir Harry Burrard, 1st Baronet (bap. 1755–1813; DNB). This act was

                  floating army off Catalonia, to land just when &amp; where they would be most serviceable,

                           stating that its object is ‘to bring every action immediately to a close engagement,

                  made a worse wound than the ball. If any thing be devised proof against a common musket
                  ball, steel balls would immediately be adopted. Yet I am curious to see more about
                  this discovery, for I have long believed that something might be done towards saving
                  soldiers, – a matter of no light consequence to us – who have so much difficulty in
