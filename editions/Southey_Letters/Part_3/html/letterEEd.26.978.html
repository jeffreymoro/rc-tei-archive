               <p>It is a heartless &amp; hopeless thing to write letter after letter when there seems so
                  little probability of their ever reaching you. How the Devil it is that all your letters
                  seem to find me, &amp; none of mine to find you I cannot comprehend. I write &amp; write &amp;
                  write always directing Barbadoes or elsewhere – &amp; suppose that according to direction
                  they go any where elsewhere than to the Galatea.

                           was displeased with the vessel’s anachronistic modernity; see Southey to Joseph Cottle,

                  &amp; you get paid off while we are at Lisbon (which God grant) that you may join us there,
                  &amp; in that case you will find Spanish may soon change into Portugueze – so think of
                  that, &amp; let it be an additional motive for going on. – You ask for politics. I can
                  tell you little; – but as for invasion it still continues the same humbug &amp; bugbear
                  as when it was first bruited abroad to gull the people on both sides the water. Bonaparte
