            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker/ Congreve/ Penkridge/ Staffordshire<br>Postmark: KESWICK/ 298<br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, ‘The Letters of Robert
               Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 126–128.<br>Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), I, pp. 334–335.<br> Dating note: [Kirkpatrick’s note on the manuscript] In the pencilled data at the
               top of the MS., the ‘5’ has been written over with a larger ‘4’. However, in <em>Selections</em> the date is incorrectly given as 1805. The reference to the sale of Greta Hall established
               the date as October 1804. See Kenneth Curry (ed.), <em>New Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), I, pp. 361–362. In his letter dated 15 October
               1804 Southey states that George Dyer has gone, and in this letter Edith Southey reports
               that ‘George Dyer left us this morning’. Southey dates the letter ‘Sunday’, so this
               is presumably Sunday 14 October 1804. (The first dated reference to Greta Hall being
               sold is on 11 October 1804.)</p>
