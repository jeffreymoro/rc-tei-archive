               <p>Of our journey homeward, safe arrival, &amp; finding all well &amp; as it should be, you have
                  heard from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a>. Since he wrote I have been in a state of happy confusion, occasioned by the arrival
                  of my books – two and twenty packages. Here they are at last, after so many years <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;that&gt; I have been wanting them, wishing for them, &amp; yet never able to get them together,
                  here they are gathered under together under one roof. It was only yesterday that we
                  got them stowed away, – I have had a range of shelves &lt;run up&gt; along one side of the
                  passage which connects the two houses, – from the floor to the ceiling, – that holds
                  about 1350 volumes, &amp; is denominated Duck Row,

                  </div> – tho there is only the dark end to which that name can properly be applied, those
                  which are in the light being Drakes. There must be yet a small stand of shelves on
                  the upper landing place, to hold about 200 which are still kicking to windward, –
                  &amp; to receive droppers-in. I have seven stands upon brackets in my study, which support
                  the parchmentarians,

                  </div> &amp; the carpenter is making three more, to go over the three doors in the passage, –
                  that is, the study door, our own bed-room, &amp; that wherein you slept. Heartily do we
                  wish you were coming to us this summer; you would delight to see me in my glory, with
                  all my riches round me.</p>

                  will be some inconvenience <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> – but that cannot be helped. He is a beautiful boy, terribly violent, &amp; almost unmanageable.
                  All this he will outgrow, if it please God that he lives. I am in great favour with
                  him, &amp; when he &amp; I have the book of the birds &amp; beasts before us, I teaching him the
                  language of all &amp; he repeating them after me, I verily believe such a concert hath
                  not been heard since Noah &amp; his live stock came out of the Ark. What you hear at Exeter

                  for her eyes are dark grey. I hear her voice so seldom &amp; see so little of her (our
                  nurse not having yet been called away) that I hardly think of her as one of the family,
                  &amp; forget her existence till she makes her appearance.</p>
