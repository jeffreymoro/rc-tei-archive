               you to forward them to him with as little delay as you can, – for he keeps my other
               things waiting that they may all be shipped together, &amp; of some of the books thus
               detained I am in great want. Indeed they are essential to a book which is going to
               press very shortly.</p>

                           of Greek and Latin poetry (1801). In 1804 he published part 1 of his Select Icelandic

                  </div> I have met him twice in London, but he said little. His books, I have seen, &amp; that
                  is all, – by what I hear both of him &amp; them, he is a man of rare learning, yet <span class="strikethrough">in his writings</span> rather apt to make a display of what he has acquired than to go on acquiring more.
                  He has been too solicitous in his writings to show that he is no lover of liberty,
                  &amp; in <span class="strikethrough">the house</span> &lt;his speeches&gt; that he <span class="ital">is</span> a lover of the slave trade, for me to think of him at all favourably. There is a long
