               bombarded neutral Copenhagen until the Danish surrendered its fleet into British hands.
               He attracted controversy again over the Battle of the Basque Roads in April 1809.
               Although it achieved some success, the British fleet failed to destroy the French
               navy completely. Captain Thomas Cochrane, later 10th Earl of Dundonald (1775–1860;
               <em>DNB</em>), who had led a highly effective fireship attack at the start of the battle, accused
               Gambier, his commanding officer, of being reluctant to pursue the attack and thus
               achieve a complete victory. Cochrane was also an MP with a reputation for exposing
               abuses of office, and, in the weeks after the battle, he pursued his campaign against
               Gambier via parliamentary speeches. Gambier demanded a court-martial at which he was
               exonerated and, by implication, Cochrane was blamed for libelling a superior officer.
               Whilst Gambier received public thanks from parliament for his actions in the battle,
               Cochrane was not permitted to rejoin his ship for a few months. When he received new
               orders to serve in the Mediterranean, Cochrane refused and went on half-pay, devoting
               his time to exposing abuses in the Admiralty. For Southey’s account, <em>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1809</em>, 2.1 (1811), 364–379.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               into Austria where he suffered a significant defeat at the battle of Aspern-Essling
               (22 May 1809). The Austrians failed to follow up this victory, which allowed Napoleon
               to seize the capital, Vienna, in early July. The Austrians were then defeated by the
               French at the battle of Wagram on 5–6 July 1809, after which they sued for peace.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Wellesley (Duke of Wellington), his main aim being to support his brother’s army in
               the Peninsula. The Junta’s unwillingness to organise supplies for the British Army
               while urging a policy of attack led Wellesley (and Southey) to suspect some of the
