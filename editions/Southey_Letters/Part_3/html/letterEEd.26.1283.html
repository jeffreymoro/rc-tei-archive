            <p class="indent1">You attribute more weight among the Booksellers to my recommendation than it possesses.
               It might be of some avail if they referred a manuscript to me, <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx</span> but it is of none in introducing a work to them, for this reason – that they regard
               subject as the main thing, &amp; consider themselves as the best judges of that, which
               probably they are. If the subject be likely to succeed among other winter fashions,
               then they think about the execution, &amp; refer it to some professor of criticism which
               in contradistinction to cobbling, may be called the ungentle craft.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I should conceive your subject a good one, but that the booksellers would object to
               the proposed extent of the work, &amp; that you would be far more likely to obtain a purchaser
               for three volumes than for six.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I will peruse your MSS. with great pleasure, &amp; return it with such remarks as may
               occur upon perusal. Mess<sup>rs</sup> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> &amp; Co are the only publishers with whom I am acquainted; – to them I will mention
               the book – if you still think such mention can be of use; – but the truth is that
               they find my own books so little successful in point of sale, that tho my opinion
               might induce them to think <span class="strikethrough">I</span> well of a published work, it is by no means likely to induce them to publish one.</p>
