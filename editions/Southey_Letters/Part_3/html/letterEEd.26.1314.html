            <p class="indent1">This last had been oiled, and though it had been so short a time at sea, was nearly
               illegible when it came to shore; whereas the others had received no other injury than
               that of wear and tear in the hands of the curious. I take this opportunity of returning
               my thanks to the gentlemen, who did me the favour of forwarding them.</p>
