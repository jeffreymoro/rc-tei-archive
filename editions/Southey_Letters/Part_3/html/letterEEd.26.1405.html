                  </div> I thought of the event with the feelings of a poet &amp; a historian, – &amp; with such feelings
                  as no person less familiar with the whole story of the country could have experienced.
                  But it now makes me heavy-hearted – I cannot help thinking of those English who are
                  left behind, – &amp; of those who have &lt;been&gt; driven away from their family-burial place.
                  If I know <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> this breaking up of the great family in which he has lived so many years, – <span class="strikethrough">men</span> &lt;of whom&gt; he has buried one generation, married a second, &amp; baptized a third, &amp; by
                  whom he was so entirely beloved, – if I know him, the political earthquake which has
                  scattered <span class="strikethrough">that</span> the factory &amp; reduced its dependents to ruin, will leave a wound upon his spirits
                  which nothing can heal. Mine are far more affected by it than I should have supposed,
                  or than any person would imagine.</p>
