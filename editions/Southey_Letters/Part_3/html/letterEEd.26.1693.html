            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I wrote you a Letter which has to travel into Wales on its way, &amp; will not reach you
                  much before this.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Southey to Matilda Mary Betham, 10 October [1809], Letter 1690.</span></div>
                  </div> And I now write in haste, merely to reply about the frames.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey had commissioned frames for miniatures painted by Betham during her visit
                           in August-September 1809 of Southey himself and of Edith, Edith May and Herbert; see
                           Southey to Mary Barker, 8 September 1809, Letter 1679.</span></div>
                  </div> My secret calculation was about five &amp; twenty shillings for each frame, - &amp; I would
                  not have them less handsome &amp; less suitable to their contents for the sake of saving
                  eight or ten shillings upon each. In things which occur so seldom oeconomy is no object.
                  So let them be by all means square, - &amp; if they cost six seven or eight &amp; twenty I
                  shall not think it too much. – Do not hurry yourself – but keep them till every body
                  has seen them to whom you wish them to be shown.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Why do you make any sort of apologies for what can stand in need of none? - You know
               me by this time well enough to know that I am a plain speaker, &amp; you ought to believe
               me when I say that we were very sorry to part with you, - &amp; shall be right heartily
               glad to see you again. If any apologies were needful they would be on our part, that
               we did not amuse you better &amp; show you more of the country. When next you come <span class="strikethrough">you</span> we will hope for better weather, - &amp; when my fortune improves I may [MS torn] one
               day afford to keep a <span class="ital">cart</span>. As for my hesitation or slowness at professions, - do you &lt;not&gt; know how I hate
               <span class="ital">professors</span> of fine feeling, &amp; how I suspect all sentimentalists? <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerMary">Mary</a> I dare say will write to you when she comes home from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Netherhall">Netherhall</a>. I dare not promise as much for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, - it is her incurable fault that she scarcely on any possible occasion can be induced
               to write to any person except her sisters, - &amp; me. The Cart’s tail might perhaps have
               remedied this some years ago, - &amp; you know I could find employment for a Cart in this
               way, as well as in jaunting about the Lakes. - I perfectly understand why she dislikes
               letter writing, and how exceedingly foolish her dislike is, but <span class="strikethrough">it is something</span> of what use is it, like a Physician, to understand the nature of what you know you
               cannot cure?</p>
            <div class="closer">I am too busy to fill the paper, so farewell. God bless you.
