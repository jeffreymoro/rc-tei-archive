            <p class="indent1">You will think that I have forgotten you, &amp; forgotten also the stray books &amp; chattels
               which have been so long trespassing upon your hospitality. The truth is that these
               very things have been the cause of preventing me from dropping you now &amp; then a letter,
               because I have been always looking on to fixing myself, &amp; hoping soon that I should
               write to request <span class="strikethrough">that</span> they might be dispatched. That time is come at last. My resolution is taken to become
               a settled resident here at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, – &amp; as I have been here three years &amp; a half on trial, nobody can say the resolution
               is a hasty one. I will therefore beg you to consign whatever you have of mine in the
               shape of books, papers, prints &amp; portraits to the care of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</a>: who will forward it forthwith to me by sea, by way of Whitehaven. From this I except
               a certain portrait of myself (the framed <span class="strikethrough">from</span> side face) – which if you think it worthy of retaining a place in your parlour, is
               very much at your service, &amp; will serve to remind you of one who neither has forgotten,
               nor <span class="strikethrough">wil</span> can forget, many friendly acts of hospitality &amp; good neighbourhood, &amp; many pleasant
               hours, for which he is indebted to you.</p>

               <p>Since we met in London I have had an increase to my family, which now consists of
                  a daughter <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, nearly three years old, &amp; a son, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a>, nearly six months, – both strong, hearty, &amp; fine children – who furnish me with
                  abundant amusement. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is very much improved in health since she was in Hampshire; – nursing agrees wonderfully
                  with her, &amp; she is grown fat &amp; strong. I myself am <span class="strikethrough">th</span> as usual – first cousin to a skeleton, – but my skin – &amp; bones <span class="strikethrough">x</span> continue to enjoy the same good health &amp; good spirits. I go on as I begun, &amp; am perhaps
                  a closer student than ever; – my main occupation at present is upon a great work respecting
                  South America, – for which I possess very ample &amp; very important manuscript documents.

                  Few persons perhaps understand it better than myself, for I have studied its history,
                  &amp; seen its effects in countries where it flourishes in all its glory. Indeed I have
                  long resolved on writing the History of the Monastic Orders, &amp; have long been collecting
