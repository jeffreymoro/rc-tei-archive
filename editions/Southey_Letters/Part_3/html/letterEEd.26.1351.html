                  </div> As for keeping any conquests in that part of the world, there is a case in point which
                  is perfectly decisive – that of the Dutch in Brazil, – turned out of provinces which
                  had been ceded to them by treaty, when they had been settled about twenty years, &amp;
                  which they had managed ten times better than we should manage them; but the Portugueze
                  &amp; the concerted natives could not bear the dominion of heretics, &amp; they were expelled
                  by these insurgents, without any aid from Portugal. The case is precisely in point,
                  as has been already pretty plainly proved at Buenos Ayres. We might have insisted
                  upon a free trade with the Spanish colonies at peace, – or we might have guaranteed
                  to them their independence during war; Of three possible modes of conduct two were
                  good, &amp; therefore we blundered upon the third. Oh that Hounslow Heath should still
