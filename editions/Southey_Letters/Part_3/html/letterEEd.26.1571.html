                  as it is done will send it back. It will be the work of from ten days to a fortnight.
                  I thank you very heartily, &amp; hope to show you early in the summer that the books have
                  not been sent in vain, but will have brought forth good fruit in their season. I thank

                           of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian

                  </div> must have been a very able man, or he could not have obtained such a reputation, having
                  so often been unfortunate. I fear the worst consequence will be that this army, coming
                  home dispirited &amp; exhausted as it needs must be, will be full of complaints of the
                  Spaniards, &amp; contribute still more to indispose the nation towards the only allies
                  on whom any well founded reliance can ever be placed, – allies from whom every thing
                  is to be expected – except the one thing which we did expect, – that they should at
                  once be able to resist such armies as the French in the field. We have done far too
                  much unless we had done more, – &amp; more ought to have been done. It is in Spain that
                  we may fight our own battle as effectually as on our ground – &amp; with this mighty difference
                  that victory there would be decisive, but defeat would not. Had there been, as there
                  should have been, a reinforcement of 20,000 men at Coruña, – what a blow might they
                  have struck – a blow which would have been felt at Madrid, – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">ha</span> might have given an immediate turn to the war. – It seems to me that our ships have
                  been our bane in this business, – that had there been no embarkation to look to, we
                  should have kept the mountains, – or fallen back upon the strong frontier of Portugal,
                  where there is a double line of fortified towns, the Spanish &amp; Portugueze. All will
                  yet be well if England acts with vigour, – but alas where are we to look for vigour?
                  – not in the ministry, – &amp; still less in the opposition, who never open their mouths
                  but to show that wretchedly as the ministry have managed the business, they would <span class="strikethrough">have</span> be ten times worse. Still I do not abate one jot of heart or hope. The Spaniards are
                  slow, but they are persevering, – they must be beaten with soldiers, or then there
                  will be no beating them out of it.</p>
