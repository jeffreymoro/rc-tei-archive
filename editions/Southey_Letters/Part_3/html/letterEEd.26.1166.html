                  But my operations are very uncomfortably disconcerted by a request on the part of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> &amp; another friend of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</a> that I would go into Herefordshire &amp; myself make enquiry upon the spot what is the

                  &amp; how to set about them. In either case I do not think it would be much out of my
