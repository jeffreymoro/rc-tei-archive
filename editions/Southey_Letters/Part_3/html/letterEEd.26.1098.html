Southey is complaining that Bedford has omitted, from the Duke’s epitaph
               for his own tomb, the words ‘Christum adveneror’ (‘venerator of Christ’); see Southey
               to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 26 July 1805, Letter 1086. Bedford had copied the inscription
               as it appeared on Buckingham’s monument, rather than as originally written. According
               to William Betham, <em>The Baronetage of England: or The History of the English Baronets</em>, 5 vols (London, 1801–1805), III, 251, ‘the words, “Christum adveneror,” are omitted,
               at the desire, as is said, of bishop Atterbury, who thought the verb <span class="ital">adveneror</span> not full enough, as applied to Christ. Great clamours were raised against this epitaph,
               many asserting that it proved the Duke a sceptic; and as great a trifle as it may
               seem, his grace’s orthodoxy became the subject of a controversy: it was, however,
               defended in form by Dr. Fiddes, in “A Letter to a Freethinker,” 1721’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

It was customary for naval officers to be allotted a share of
               the value of ships and cargo captured in armed conflict, but this award of prize money
               was contested because it was claimed that the ships were captured before war was officially
               declared. Southey took up his brother’s cause to have his share reinstated. It was
               presumably Southey’s influence that caused <em>The Courier</em> to publish a paragraph supporting the sailors’ claim to the prize-money on Saturday
               24 August 1805. This was followed by a longer defence of their position in <em>The Courier</em> on 31 August 1805 under the title ‘Indemnification to the Spanish Merchants’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
