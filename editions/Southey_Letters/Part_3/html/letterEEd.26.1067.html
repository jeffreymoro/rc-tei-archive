               <p class="indent1">Sir</p>
               <p class="indent1">I have just been led by mere accident to look into the Annual Review for 1803. Two
                  or three articles in that volume, in which I am treated with a low &amp; despicable scurrility
                  worthy of the times of bishop Gardiner &amp; bishop Bonner, I recognise for yours. I know
                  not well to what feelings the mind of the man who penned them is accessible, but I
                  would willingly carry some feelings of moral compunction &amp; moral confusion home to
                  that mind.</p>
               <p class="indent1">There were several reasons why you ought not to have written those articles.</p>
               <p class="indent1">1.You must be conscious of the intellectual abilities of the man against whom you
                  have thus written, however in these articles you bely that consciousness. Several
                  parts of my Enquiry concerning Political Justice have been praised for uncommon acuteness
                  &amp; depth of reasoning by the most determined enemies of its doctrines; you cannot be
                  blind to these qualities in that book. To the novel of Caleb Williams vigour of conception
                  &amp; strength of delineation have never been denied; I do not believe that you differ
                  from all the world in these admissions. If you differ from me in some of my opinions,
                  if you think that, being both of us engaged in one cause (as you profess in these
                  articles), &amp; I at least engaged in it with no common ardour, I have failed to serve
                  it judiciously, that can be no reason for your affirming of a man, whom you know to
                  be of uncommon powers of mind, that he is a blockhead. No cause that is worth serving,
                  can be served by such falshoods. </p>
               <p class="indent1">2.You are not less fully convinced of my integrity, than of my intellectual powers.
                  My private life, my conduct to my wife, my children, &amp; my connections, is beyond exception.
                  You feel, more deeply than most men, the sincere devotedness of heart with which,
                  however you may suppose me to be mistaken, I gave myself up to the cause of truth
                  &amp; public interest. If ability, united with integrity, do not demand the respect of
                  every one who sets up the slightest pretensions to either, I am then at a loss to
                  conceive what foundations for respect can exist in the world.</p>
               <p class="indent1">3.You were, at the first appearance of the Enquiry concerning Political Justice, the
                  most devoted advocate of the doctrines of the book. If you have since seen reason
                  to alter your opinion, or if I have forfeited your approbation by what you may deem
                  my injudicious management of th[e] controversy since, still you owed something to
                  your former good opinion. An apostate, who immediately becomes the bitter &amp; scurrilous
                  enemy of the party he has deserted, is a character which the common sense of mankind
                  has agreed to reprobate. </p>
               <p class="indent1">4.You were my personal acquaintance. Some decency, by all the laws of civilised society,
                  was due to this circumstance. A few weeks after the publication of this volume, we
                  dined together at the house of a common friend. With what sensations, if you were
                  accessible to any ingenuous feelings, must you have sat down with a man, against whom
                  you had asserted such gross falshoods, whose character, the result of honest &amp; unwearied
                  exertions in what he conceived to be the public cause, you had endeavoured to destroy,
                  whose family you had done your best to starve, &amp; against whose indignant eye you had
                  no protection except the cloak of anonymous publication you had assumed? </p>
               <p class="indent1">5.You must have known that the scribblers of reviewers &amp; periodical pamphlets had
                  entered into a combination by the silliest &amp; most impudent misrepresentations to write
                  me down. You must have seen how the leaders of the church, &amp; the fawning slaves of
                  priestcraft &amp; tyranny, w[ere] united against me. We were engaged by your own statement
                  in one cause, the cause of human improveableness, of liberty, equality &amp; mankind.
                  What ought you to have thought of yourself, when you joined the vulgar &amp; artful cry
                  of the enemies of this cause against me? While no one as yet openly opposed my work,
                  while it &amp; its author appeared to possess an extensive popularity, you were its friend.
                  When the refuse of every tyrannical &amp; aristocratical party joined against me, &amp; gave
                  my book the appearance of being hunted out of the world, then you thought it prudent,
                  &amp; you thought it magnanim[ous], to stand up against me, to repeat the words of these
                  hirelings, &amp; to echo their sentences. I have too much singleness of heart, to endeavour
                  to form to myself a party, or by the ordinary &amp; accustomed means to curry favour with
                  the drudges of literature, &amp; to this is owing the proceedings of a crew, in the train
                  of which you are the last volunteer. </p>
               <p class="indent1">It may seem strange that, in writing this letter, I pay you an attention which I never
                  dreamed of paying to your brother reviewers &amp; magazine-writers. But I have heard you
                  so repeatedly represented by men of honour as an honourable man, that, against all
                  hope &amp; argument I cling to the idea; &amp;, though I am satisfied that the writer of these
                  articles, can have neither honesty nor worth, I render this oblation to your departed
                  good name.</p>
               <p class="indent1">It is in vain for you to answer this letter. Between me &amp; the person I address there
                  can be nothing reciprocal. I address you as a judge addresses himself to a convicted
                  criminal. If you think you can prove that you are not the author of these articles,
                  we have common friends, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambCharles">M<sup>r</sup>. Lamb</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RickmanJohn">M<sup>r</sup>. Rickman</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">M<sup>r</sup>. Carlisle</a>; &amp;, though I have no idea of the possibility of overturning the evidence I possess,
                  I shall listen to every thing they can allege with patience &amp; respect.</p>
