                  </div> – but unluckily too late for to days coach – so it cannot reach London before Monday.
                  It is written with hearty good will, &amp; requires no signature to show from whence it
                  came. Now I wish you would ask <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gifford</a>, if he thinks it expedient to use the pruning knife, – to let the copy be returned
                  to me when the printer has done with it: because it is ten to one that the passages
                  which he would curtail being the most Robert Southeyish of the whole, would be those
                  that I should like best myself, – &amp; therefore I would fain have the pleasure of putting
                  them in again for my own satisfaction, if for nobody else’s. That <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AikinArthur">Arthur Aiken</a> in the days of his reign (which Heaven be praised is over) actually emasculated half
                  the things I sent him, as clumsily &amp; as mercilessly as a sow gelder performs his operations</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I must still confess to you Grosvenor that I have my fears &amp; suspicions as to the
               freedom of this review, – &amp; this article will in some measure put it to the proof.
               For it is my nature &amp; my principle to speak &amp; write as earnestly, as plainly, &amp; as
               straight to the mark, as I think &amp; feel. If the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Editor</a> understands his own interest he will not restrict me. A review started against the
               Edinburgh, will instantly be suspected of being a ministerial business, &amp; a sprinkling
               of my free &amp; fearless way of thinking will win friends for it among those very persons
               most likely to be prejudiced against it, &amp; to be misled by the Scotchmen. The high
               orthodox men both of church &amp; state will always think as they are told, – there is
               no policy in writing to them, – the Anti-Jacobine &amp; British Critic are good enough
               for their faces of brass, brains of lead, &amp; tongues of bell-metal, I shall not offend
               them, – tho my reasoning appeal to better hearts &amp; clearer understandings. – I would
               say this to him if I knew him, – but I do not desire you to say it, because I do not
               know how far it might suit the person to whom it <span class="strikethrough">x</span> relates.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Spain! Spain! – By the God who made me, were the resources of the nation at my command
               I would stake my head upon the deliverance of that country &amp; the utter overthrow of
               Bonaparte. But good God what blunders – what girlish panics – what absolute cowardice
               is there in our measures! – Disembarking troops when we ought to send ship after ship
               full as fast as they could be put on board. It is madness to wait for transports –
               – send ships of the line, &amp; let them run singly for Lisbon &amp; Cadiz &amp; Catalonia <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> Nothing can ruin <span class="strikethrough">Spa</span> the Spaniards, unless they feel the misconduct of England – as I am grieved to say
               – I feel it. It is the more heart breaking – because the heart of England is with
               these noble people, we are not only ready – willing &amp; able to make every effort for
               them, but even eager to do it, – &amp; yet all is palsied by plans so idiotic that the
               horse whip were a fitter instrument of punishment for them than the halter, if it
               were not for their deadly consequences</p>
