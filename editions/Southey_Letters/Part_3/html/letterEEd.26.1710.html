                  </div> I think not, except from causes as easily to be removed as explained. The vicious

                  who look no further, may triumph in the fact. Nature has materials to spare; in the
                  mule they have not their natural determination; he is always in a different state
                  of body from that of perfect animals; that which in them is collected and carried
                  off at certain seasons, seems to be diffused at all times through his whole system.
                  Now this cannot be applicable to the mulatto. That the Mamalucos were a bad breed
                  I believe; but it was because they learnt the evil of both races, and the good of
                  neither.</p>
