            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your way will be either to Manchester or Liverpool as you like best. the most expeditious
               is by the former place in the mails, but it is the most expensive &amp; is too fatiguing.
               you had better make for Liverpool from thence in the long coach to Kendal – &amp; there
               the coaches turn off &amp; you must pursue your route by some other means. Kendal is 30
               miles from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> but 20 of that distance lie thro the Lake country. In what trim are you for walking?
               – suppose you take chaise for Bowness, (ten miles) – this place is on the shores of
               Windermere, &amp; from thence walk about ten more to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a>, where I will meet you. there is a little inn there where we can have decent beds,
               &amp; Wordsworth will show us all the best walks in that neighbourhood. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a> is 13 miles from us, a most delightful road. from hence we can accomplish every thing
               else within a days distance by riding, except <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ullswater">Ullswater</a>, which must be left for your way back. Now then as to calculation of time – &amp; here
               you will find I fear an inconvenient delay at Birmingham. the long coach from thence
               to Liverpool <span class="strikethrough">goes</span> sets out at five or six, &amp; gets in in about 20 hours. the next morning you start
               at six or seven for Kendal &amp; arrive about 10 that night. the fare will be 5 or 8 &amp;
               20 shillings this last stage, &amp; about 30 from Birmingham. do you therefore let me
               know when you mean to be at Kendal (there is always room in the long coaches) &amp; on
               the following day I will be at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a> – or perhaps (if the weather be fine) at Bowness to meet you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">This plan you see is calculated for you if come alone. Should the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SmithThomas">Smiths</a> come with you the house at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a> will not have room. you must then go from Kendal to <span class="strikethrough">Lowood</span><a class="link_ref" href="places.html#LowoodInn">Low-Wood</a>, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">I will meet</span> thence to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> seeing <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GrasmereDove">Grasmere</a> in the way. they should go to the Royal Oak here at first, &amp; then if they stay as
               long as I hope – &amp; as they should do to see the country, take lodgings, if good ones
               are to be had. I wish they may come while you are here, – we shall have some delightful
               days on the Lake.</p>
