                           It was given by Florentine librarian Father Stanislaus Canovai (1740–1811) and published

                  magnifying Amerigo into a great man, – &amp; it is equally manifest to me, upon diligent
                  perusal of his letters, that he is much more truly represented as a crafty one, who
