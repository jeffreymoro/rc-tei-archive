               coast waiting to enter the harbour and many others waiting to exit the harbor that
               are already loaded, waiting, concerned about departing because the shallow canal is
               treacherous. One vessel, the Pataxó, tried to exit and sank. The government was ordered
               by the king to deepen the canal, but no action was taken even after intervention of
               captains and ministers named by the king in a letter to Franscico de Brito. In addition,
               the navigators also were aware of the loss of other Dutch vessels, governed by Jeronymo
               Serrão de Payva, in the recent past. Therefore, navigators are avoiding the port./
               The situation is made worse because ships trapped in the harbour include three existing
               fleets that would not be incorporated with the armada./ The situation is angering
               the people of the state of the Pernambuco, as the port of Tamandaré is extremely important;
               other ports are very far away and it represents their only means of transportation.
               All of the vessels, specially the bigger galleons, are waiting for the ‘terral shift’.
               The crisis also resulted in the dismissal of Francisco Freyre, no longer responsible
               for the vessels in Tamandaré, which could make the waiting situation worse for the
               boats, anchored at the coast (including the General’s) and also for the Almirante’s,
               loaded inside the harbour.// The captains were afraid to use the regular routes because
               when they made a mistake, an excuse was considered vulgar among the other captains;
               and when they steered right for themselves, they did not earn the higher premium.
               In this respect, they always reached the coast of Ethiopia, commonly called Guinea.
               In the summer, the journey was made at a specific latitude, because the winds run
               from the East to the North. And, on the contrary, the winds are to the south in the
               winter. In 1652 Francisco de Brito found these wind patterns during journeys from
               Algarve to Bahia. He is now even more persuaded by what was taught by D. Francisco
               De Faro, Count of Odemira, of the Councils of State and War. The president of the
               ultramarine provinces sought to inquire if your majesty would declare, in the Regiment
               of Royal Orders, that Caboverde governs to the south; as explained the eighth chapter
