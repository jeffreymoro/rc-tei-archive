               of the North to visit me, &amp; by laying in a stock of exercise which lasts me during

               the press would outrun me, &amp; I should outrun my means. There has been another &amp; more
               valid reason why ten weeks have been let pass since the date of my last letter, –
               it was likely that I should soon be able to say when I should leave this place on
               my way to London, &amp; consequently when I should have the gratification of halting at
               Litchfield, – instead of eyeing the outside only of its noble Cathedral while the

                           appeared in the Critical Review, ns 11 (August 1807), 399–403. By December 1807, Southey
                           had changed his mind about the authorship of this review; see Southey to Samuel Taylor

We there met this Le Grice: – he
                  was unusually courteous towards me, &amp; I as unusually repulsive towards him, for never
                  had I seen a man whose whole temper of mind appeared to me so thoroughly perverted
                  &amp; mischievous. Every thing was made the subject of his ridicule, &amp; he seemed to have
                  laughed himself out of every good principle &amp; every good feeling. Considerable talents
                  he had, but only in this miserable direction: his face was as white as a Ghosts, &amp;
                  in this <span class="strikethrough">dead</span> &lt;clayey&gt; &amp; unexpressive face were set two jet black eyes, forming so strange &amp; hideous
                  a contrast, that literally &amp; truly that face was the original from whence I described
                  the dead countenance of Donica animated by a Devil.

                  my back upon all his proferred civilities, but what has more weight with him, has
                  been a notion that he could wound <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> thro me, &amp; thus pay off some of the scores of an old &amp; rooted envy. – This man is
                  now settled at the Lands End in Cornwall, where he married an old woman to whose children
                  he went to be tutor. The eldest son is a miserable cripple, as deformed in mind as
                  in body. Le Grice &amp; the Mother have not proved faithful stewards to him, &amp; he vows
                  vengeance against them both, but him in particular, as soon as he shall be of age.
                  Le Grice himself is an unsuccessful author; – he published a little volume called
                  by the strange name of Tineum,
