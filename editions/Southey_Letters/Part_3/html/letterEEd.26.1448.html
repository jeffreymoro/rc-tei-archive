            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>From one scene of confusion to another. You saw me in London everlastingly at work
                  in packing my books, &amp; here they are now lying in all parts about me, up to my knees
                  in one place, up to my eyes in another, &amp; above head &amp; ears in a third. I can scarcely
                  find stepping places thro the labyrinth, from one end of the room to the other.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Having decided to remain at Greta Hall the previous year, Southey had been steadily
                           arranging for his books, which had been stored by friends in London and the West Country,
                           to be collected together.</span></div>
                  </div> Like Pharoahs frogs they have found their way every where, even<span class="strikethrough">y</span> into the bed-chambers. A plague on Harry Pooley,

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Henry (or Harry) Pooley was a Keswick carpenter, but no further information about
                           him has been found.</span></div>
                  </div> tho he is the best of carpenters. Last Friday he had the measure of the shelves, &amp;
                  here is Tuesday well nigh over, &amp; yet he is not come.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">And now Grosevnor, having been married above twelve years, I have for the first time
               collected all my books together. What a satisfaction this is you cannot imagine, for
               you cannot conceive the hundredth part of the inconvenience &amp; vexation I have endured
               <span class="strikethrough">at h</span> for want of them. But the joy which they give me brings with a mingled feeling, –
               the recollection that there are as many materials heaped up as I shall ever find life
               to make use of, – &amp; the humiliating reflection how little knowledge can be acquired
               in the most laborious life of man, – that knowledge becoming every age less &amp; less
               in proportion to the accumulation of events.</p>
            <p class="indent1">For some things I have been born too late. Under the last reign for instance, or in
               the first half of this, my pension would have been an income adequate to my wants,
               – &amp; my profits as a writer would have been at least quadrupled. On the other hand
               bad as these times are, they are better than those which are coming.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>At Bristol I met with the man of all others whom I was most desirous of meeting; –
                  the only man living of whose praise I was ambitious, – or whose censure would have
                  humbled me. You will be curious to know who this could be. – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Savage Landor</a>, the author of Gebir,

                  </div> – a poem which unless you have heard me speak of it, you have probably never heard
                  of at all. I never saw any one more unlike myself in every prominent part of human
                  character – nor any one <span class="strikethrough">with whom I agree more</span> who so cordially &amp; instinctively agreed with me on so many of the most important subjects.
                  I have often said before <span class="strikethrough">I xxx I had seen him</span> &lt;we met&gt; that I would walk forty miles to see him, &amp; having seen him, I would gladly
                  walk fourscore to see him again. He talked of Thalaba,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> &amp; I told him of the series of mythological poems which I had planned, mentioned some
                  of the leading incidents on which they were to have been formed, &amp; also told him for
                  what reason the plan had been laid aside, in plain English that I could not afford
                  to write them. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landors</a> reply was, go on with them, &amp; I will pay for printing them, as many as you will write,
                  &amp; as many copies of each as you please. – I had reconciled myself to my abdication,
                  (if the phrase may be allowable) &amp; am not sure that this princely offer has not done
                  me mischief. For it has wakened in me old dreams, &amp; hopes which had been laid aside;
                  &amp; a struggling desire to go on, for the sake of showing him poem after poem, &amp; saying,
                  I need not accept your offer, – but I have done this because you made it. – It is
                  something to be praised by ones peers: ordinary praise I regard as little as ordinary <span class="strikethrough">censure</span> abuse, – neither goes nearer my heart than my breeches pocket.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A world of business has accumulated upon me during my long absence – I have not yet
               cleared off the letters which must be written, – as you may guess by not having heard
               from me sooner. How are your <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Bedfordfamily">father &amp; mother</a>? how are you yourself?</p>
