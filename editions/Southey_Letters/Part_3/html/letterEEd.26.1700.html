                  of ‘very fearful health’ hath so consumptive a complection, &amp; consumption is the disease

               <p>When a young Poet is cut off, Senhora, it appears to me like the death of a young
                  Hero, – a new &amp; permanent interest is thrown over all that he has done, &amp; he escapes
                  the chance of disappointing the expectations built upon the promises which he had
                  given. There is plenty of genius in the world, – I am sure you will not suspect me
                  of undervaluing it, in any particular instance, for saying so. – there is plenty of
                  it, – but God knows it is a melancholy consideration to think how very little comes
                  to maturity. – What would have been <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> Whites fate if Heaven had not mercifully taken him? – he would either have let his
                  fanaticism extinguish the light that was in him, &amp; have become a mere Evangelical,
                  – or that light would have occasioned a struggle which must have overset either his
                  worldly fortunes, if he had followed it; – or his moral principles if he had shut
                  it up within the dark Lanthorn of expediency, &amp; gone on praying &amp; preaching when it
                  would have been only lip-worship. – And death is no evil to the Dead; – they are at
                  their journey’s end, – rather to be envied than lamented for having got there. Of
                  all other disagreeable things we say ‘I wish it was over’ – When you have heard me
                  say Senhora that I wished the year 1900 were come – the same feeling was implied.
                  – Yet that I am a very happy man you know. That good Lady who as you remember, physiognomised
                  me so luckily for ‘a man of sorrow &amp; acquainted with woe,’

                           Fletcher in Edinburgh – (Miss Smiths friend) said of me? – that xxx I was “all that
                           was intellectual, but that it was plain from every feature in his face that he was
                           a man acquainted with woe.” This tickled me not a little’; see Southey to Charles
                           Danvers, 25 May 1807, Letter 1326.</span></div>
                  </div> – did not happen to know that my acquaintance with Woe has been broken off long since.
                  We certainly did keep company once, &amp; I have been in as many situations of real suffering
                  as falls to any mans lot between the years of 17 &amp; 22. – But since that time no mans
                  life can have passed more smoothly. – Sorrows I have had – but only such as came in
                  the ordinary course of nature, &amp; which resulting from the laws of Nature bring with
                  them their own cure in a sense of the necessity as well as duty of resignation. Suffering
                  arising out of the evils of Society are of a different character, – they call up resentment
                  indignation &amp; a whole host of turbulent feelings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>This has led me from the matter. What I should have said is that Henry White excites
                  more love &amp; admiration now than he could have done under any other circumstances.
                  You feel more from his fragments than you would have done had they been finished,
                  – his heart &amp; his hopes have all been laid open to the world, – which had he lived
                  never would have been the case, – &amp; every body is ready to praise &amp; regret him, because
                  he is no longer an object of envy. His history poor fellow shows what death will do
                  for a poet! He published a little volume while he lived, &amp; it was neglected or abused.

                  look you Senhora, Genius is not all that is required to make a man a poet. The best
                  poets have been always the most learned &amp; the wisest men of their time. Shakespeare
                  alone excepted as to learning, – but intuition in him, &amp; in his peculiar walk, supplied
                  its place, – as there has been but one Shakespeare since the Creation it is not altogether
                  absurd to suppose that there may not be another till the day of Judgment. All that
                  Blacket hitherto has done I conceive to be imitation, produced indeed by genuine feeling,
                  – but still such close imitation, as to render it doubtful whether he be capable of
                  anything original. He can have no learning, no store of knowledge of his own, – &amp;
