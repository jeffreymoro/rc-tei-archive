                  by saying scarcely a tree &amp;c, so that your note has not been thrown away, but honey
                  it is; the immediate mention of the bee proves this, – &amp; other authorities confirm
                  it.

                           I, p. 169, in which Southey summarises the narrative of Ulrich Schmiedel (?1510–1579?),
                           a German mercenary in the service of Spanish conquistadors who travelled up the river
                           Plate from Buenos Aires into the interior of Peru and Bolivia. Schmiedel, the author
                           of Viaje al Río de la Plata (1534–1554), states, in Southey’s version, that the adventurers

                           (1810–1819), I, p. 638, giving the verdict of a ‘friend, better acquainted with such

               country of Italy when the Jesuits were expelled from South America in 1768 and who

               1809 by Longman, featured two appendices compiled by Southey—‘An Account of the Archipelago
