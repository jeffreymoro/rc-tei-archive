            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Had you complained that Madoc was too expensive I should readily have agreed with
                  you – or that it was too dear – I should have said it seems so – but the price is
                  likely to be a fair one – because tho I objected to it, the publishers have persisted
                  in affixing it.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Madoc (1805) was published in a luxurious quarto, costing 2 guineas.</span></div>
                  </div> But when you talk of wide margins &amp; waste paper the only reply must be that you have
                  been finding fault without consideration. As for margin it may be dishonestly broad
                  in a work of prose, – but unless you would have two <span class="ital">verses</span> in one line – you must be contented with <span class="ital">one</span>. To have used a larger type, as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantyne</a> advised, would indeed have narrowed the margin at the expence of about ten sheets
                  of paper – i – e – 7/6 more in the price of the book. As for blank paper there is
                  but one blank page in the whole volume – which is between the first &amp; second part
                  of the Notes – &amp; which I did not order the Printer to alter – because it would have <span class="strikethrough">delayed</span> occasioned a delay of <span class="strikethrough">two or</span> three days. That the blank on the page where a section concludes should sometimes
                  be larger than is sightly is a thing of mere accident; to have begun the next section
                  on the same page would sometimes have produced a greater deformity, would certainly
                  have made the volume far less beautiful &amp; less handsome, – &amp; could not on the most
                  liberal computation have diminished its price more than fourteen pence. I ordered
                  30 lines in a page – it did not suit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BallantyneJames">Ballantynes</a> types &amp; he would only promise 24 – at the same time recommending 20 &amp; the same type
                  as Scotts Lay of the Last Minstrel.
