            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Ministry – by this time, perhaps, no longer a Ministry – have made a very pretty
                  kettle of fish of it; which phrase, by the by, would look well in literal translation
                  into any other language. Perhaps you will be surprised to hear that on the Catholic
                  Question I am as stiffly against them as his Majesty himself.

                           Catholics from the civil penalties and restrictions placed upon them.</span></div>
                  </div> Of all my friends <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> is perhaps the only one who thinks with me upon this subject; but I am clear in my
                  own mind. I am, however, sorry for the business, – more to think what a rabble must
                  come in, than for any respect for those who are going out – though the <span class="ital">Limited Service</span> and the Abolishment of the Slave Trade are great things.

                  </div> As for any effect upon my own possible fortunes, you need not be told how little any
                  such <span class="ital">possibilities</span> ever enter into my feelings: they have entered into my calculations just enough to
                  keep me unsettled, and nothing more. And here I am now planting garden-enclosures,
                  rose-bushes, currants, gooseberries, and resolute to become a mountaineer – perhaps
                  for ever – unless I should remove for final settlement at Lisbon. My study is to be
                  finished – my books gathered together; and if you do not come down again, the very
                  first summer you are not otherwise engaged, why – you may stay and be smoke-dried
                  in London for your good-for-nothingness. I have a man called Willy, who is my Juniper
                  in this business.

                  </div> We are going to have laburnums and <span class="ital">lilacs</span>, seringas, barberry bushes, and a pear-tree to grow up by your window against the
                  wall, and <span class="ital">white</span> curtains in my library, and to dye the old ones in the parlour blue, and to put fringe
                  to them, Mr. Duppa, and to paper the room, Mr. Duppa, and I am to have a carpet in
                  my study, Mr. Duppa, and the chairs are to be new bottomed, and we are to buy some
                  fenders at the sale of the General’s things, and we have bought a new hearth-rug.
                  And then the outside of the house is to be rough-cast, as soon as the season will
                  permit, and there is a border made under the windows, and there is to be a gravel
                  walk there, and turf under the trees beyond <span class="ital">that</span>, and beyond <span class="ital">that</span> such peas and beans! Oh! Mr. Duppa, how you will like them when you come down, and
                  how fine we shall be, if all this does not ruin me!</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The reason of all this is, that some arrangements of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge’s</a> made it necessary that I should either resolve upon removing speedily, or remaining
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GretaHall">the house</a>. The one I could not do, and was, not unwillingly, forced to the other. Indeed, the
                  sense of being unsettled was the only uneasiness I had; and these little arrangements
                  for future comfort give me, I am sure, more solid satisfaction and true enjoyment
