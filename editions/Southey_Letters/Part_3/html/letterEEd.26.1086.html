See <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em>, 3 vols (London, 1807), I, p. 219, where the Latin epitaph is quoted with these words,
               meaning, ‘venerator of Christ’, replaced by a dash. In fact, Bedford had copied the
               inscription as it appeared on Buckingham’s monument. According to William Betham,
               <em>The Baronetage of England: or The History of the English Baronets</em>, 5 vols (London, 1801–1805), III, p. 251, ‘the words, “Christum adveneror,” are omitted,
               at the desire, as is said, of bishop Atterbury, who thought the verb <span class="ital">adveneror</span> not full enough, as applied to Christ. Great clamours were raised against this epitaph,
               many asserting that it proved the Duke a sceptic; and as great a trifle as it may
               seem, his grace’s orthodoxy became the subject of a controversy: it was, however,
               defended in form by Dr. Fiddes, in “A Letter to a Freethinker,” 1721’. See also Southey
               to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 26 August 1805, Letter 1098.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
