                  </div> I have now to tell you of the death of one. We have lost <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Emma</a>; it pleased God to take her after a very short but severe bilious attack. Not half
                  an hour before she expired we were assured there was no danger. Indeed, since I last
                  wrote to you we have had much sickness. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> was, during one part of her confinement, alarmingly ill, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> has not yet thoroughly recovered his strength after the violent remedies which saved
                  him about three weeks ago, when he was attacked by the croup. The little girl was
                  buried this morning. She was, as our nurse says, ‘as sweet a child as ever woman bore,’
                  – just sixteen months; and it is not a week ago since I repeatedly remarked in what
                  high health she seemed, and how rapidly she was improving. These losses are but for
                  a time, and this, severe as it is, is far less so than the former. I have now broken
                  ground in the churchyard here, and thus acquired a new tie to the place. Edith is
                  as composed as she should be. It is fortunate for her that she has an infant to take
                  up much of her thoughts.</p>

               <p>You asked me about a new Review, which I suppose means the Quarterly, and about which
                  I fancied I had written to you. It was set on foot by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</a>, to counteract the politics of the Edinburgh, especially with regard to the subjects
                  of peace with France, and of the Spanish patriots. I was applied to by the editor,
                  who is the ‘Baviad’ <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a>. My answer contained a sort of political confession of faith, stating that so far
                  as such opinions would be tolerated by it I was ready to bear a part. Accordingly,
                  the first number contains a defence of the Baptist Missionaries in India against Scott
                  Waring, &amp;c., and the Edinburgh Review.

                           Southey opposed his views in the Quarterly Review. Smith’s review of ‘Ingram on Methodism’
                           appeared in the Edinburgh Review, 11 (January 1808), 341–362, and he reviewed ‘Indian

                  Sidney Smith is my antagonist. It is not to be wondered at if I have the better of
                  him; for I plead for what I believe, and he is obliged to affect a belief in what
                  he is in fact attacking. I am afraid, however, that this Review is too much under
