            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am the most punctual of men in replying to a letter of business; but when a letter
               of luxury (as it may be called) is to be written, it is so often deferred till a more
               convenient season, that what would at first have been a matter of pleasure is at last
               considered with the feeling of debt. Your last letter is five weeks old. I have during
               that time been absent from home three days. I have been invalided for a week by a
               cold, and something worse than invalided, after my recovery, by some of those little
               family sicknesses which bring with them more disquiet than is reasonable to one who
               is apt to be anxious overmuch upon such occasions.</p>

                           testy of disposition. Lofft was the patron and editor of Robert Bloomfield (1766–1823;
                           DNB), Kirke White and a number of other writers from poor backgrounds. He was a regular
                           contributor to the Monthly Mirror. For further details, see Southey to Neville White,
                           28 November 1808, Letter 1545.</span></div>
                  </div> Better advice cannot be given upon that subject than what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> gives you in one of his earliest letters. In this case I think the question entirely
                  depends upon the pleasure which you derive from his correspondence. Mr. —, I believe,
                  is a man not happy in his circumstances; and fits of irritation against you, or me,
                  or anybody else, serve to divert a certain portion of uneasiness which is always fermenting
                  in him, and which becomes more tolerable by finding its object abroad than at home.
                  I respect his learning and his benevolence, and regard his infirmities of temper with
                  pity, because they are symptomatic of what is still more to be pitied.</p>

                  them. Leave it to others to do themselves honour by thus honouring him. He will, perhaps,
                  have one at Nottingham before Chatterton has at Bristol.

                           by the British for 46 days in 1806 before they were forced to retreat; in 1807 another
                           British force was repulsed when the citizens defended their town from rooftops and

                  </div> I have been reviewing it very gently, because, as we are never compelled either to
                  buy a book or to read one, the public ought to be obliged to every person who takes
                  the pains to write even a bad one for their use, provided there be no evil in it.
                  Dr. Z. is a bigot in all things; there is nothing so pestilential to my feelings as
                  the fog of bigotry in which all our cathedral establishments are enveloped. Enthusiasm
                  has the glory of the sun to kindle up mists and clouds with beauty; fanaticism has
                  thunders, and lightning, and meteors in its darkness; but bigotry, especially that
                  which is found about deans and chapters, is like one of your London fogs. Dr. Z. is
                  bigoted in his religion, bigoted in his politics, bigoted in his taste. His very admiration
                  of Sydney is bigotry, for by his censure of the ‘Arcadia’ he proves that he has not
                  the slightest perception of Sydney’s real excellence.
