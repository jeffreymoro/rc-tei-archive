                  the whole taxation, it would be the same thing. The treasury should never bribe, nor
                  his judges deter me from delivering a full and free opinion upon any subject which
                  seems to me to call for it. If I hate Bonaparte, and maintain that this country never

                  upon the same principle that I formerly disliked Pitt,

                  are worth nothing more than what they fetch per sheet. I could get my thousand a-year,
