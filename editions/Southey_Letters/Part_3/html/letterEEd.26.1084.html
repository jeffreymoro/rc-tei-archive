               <p>I have not versified any more, because I have not translations of any more, except
                  that utterly unintelligible one, &amp; the poems puzzle me, the meaning being frequently
                  so little that it is very difficult to discover any. If you think it worth while to
                  bestow paper upon more, translate for me whatever you think most suitable, &amp; I will
                  versify, – but I fancy you will think that little is enough. The merit of the poems,
                  such as they have, is not of a translateable kind. – &amp; if Michel Angelos poetry is
                  to be judged by my English, it will not rank very high, – but I confess that I have
                  succeeded very ill.

                           Poetry and Letters, which was published in 1806. Wordsworth translated one sonnet;
                           Southey three sonnets and a madrigal. A further poem, ‘And sweet it is to see in summer
                           time’, was a joint effort, the first four stanzas by Wordsworth, the following five
                           by Southey. See Kenneth Curry, ‘Uncollected Translations of Michelangelo by Wordsworth
