               <p>I have been considering and re-considering the plan of a Critical Catalogue.

                  </div> On the scale which you propose, it approaches so nearly to what we had formerly projected
                  as a complete Bibliotheca Britannica,

                  </div> that I should be loth to go so near it, and yet stop short. On the present scale (and
                  were you disposed to extend it to the original extent, it would be quite impossible
                  for me till my historical labours are closed) the opinions given must necessarily
                  be so short, that in most instances the main business would be to copy title-pages.
                  Now it would take an amanuensis more time tenfold to hunt out the book than to do
                  this; and yet, as you say, my time may be employed more satisfactorily for myself,
                  and probably more to your advantage as well as my own, than in mere transcription.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Of the possible size of such a work I cannot form even a decent conjecture. Scarce
                  books are more numerous than good ones, have longer titles, and require sometimes
                  a long description. Perhaps the best way would be to begin with a chronological list
                  of all that have been printed before the accession of Henry VIII., when printing may
                  be said to have become common. All these books have a great value from their scarcity,
                  – indeed, their main value, –and better be classed together than under any separate
                  heads. A complete list might be furnished by Mr. Dibdin, who must already have collected
                  all the necessary knowledge for his edition of Ames.

                  </div> I could give a better opinion of works than he could, and believe that I <span class="ital">know</span> more of them: but there is a sort of title-page and colophon knowledge – in one word,
                  bibliology, which is exactly what is wanted for this purpose, and in which he is very
                  much my superior. The way in which I could be best employed would be in looking over
                  the MS., adding to it anything in my knowledge, if anything there might be, which
                  had escaped him, and supplying a brief criticism, where it was wanted, and I could
                  give it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Any such assistance I should willingly give; but upon slow and frequent consideration,
               I certainly think the whole may be better executed in London than here, and by many
               others than by me; for of all sorts of work it is that in which there must be most
               transcription, and in which it will be most inconvenient to employ an amanuensis.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The extent of such a book will probably be wholly immaterial to its sale. None but
               those who have libraries will buy it; and all those may almost be calculated upon.
               There will also be some sale for it abroad, more than is usual for English books.
               The one thing in which it seems possible to improve upon the best catalogue is, by
               arranging the books in every subdivision chronologically, according to the time when
               they were written.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.
