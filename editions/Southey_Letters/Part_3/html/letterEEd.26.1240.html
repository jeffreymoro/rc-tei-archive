            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> has this evening explained to me certain passages in your late letters, to which
               I had given in my own mind a different meaning. There is in all good &amp; in all sane
               minds an <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> instinct which <span class="strikethrough">as naturally</span> finds out the best comforts &amp; consolations for itself, &lt;as naturally&gt; as the living
               principle varies its operations to heal a wound. You will find yours in the performance
               of duties, which most happily your circumstances will enable you to perform. If you
               had unmarried sisters the calamity would be great; – but as you are, it is rather
               great in appearance than in reality, &amp; you will most probably feel yourself a happier
               man for the part you are called upon to act.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On such a subject it would be idle to say much – indeed the main use of saying any
                  thing is to tell you that I know what has happened;

                  have explained to me before. Write to me I beseech you &amp; tell me how you are – that
