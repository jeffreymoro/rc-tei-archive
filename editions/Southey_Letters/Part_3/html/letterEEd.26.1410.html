                  be too much, – allowing about a third of it for critical bibliology. There is the
                  question to examine how far the books of chivalry grew out of the manners of the age,
                  &amp; how far those manners were produced by them. Few persons have so great a mass of <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> knowledge at command to bear upon this enquiry as I have. – They will be twelvemonths
