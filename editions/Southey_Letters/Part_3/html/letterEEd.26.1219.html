                  </div> letter – &amp; tho I have nothing to say but that it is received, it seems something like
                  a duty to tell you that I know what tidings awaited you on your return home. – God
                  grant you strength to bear up against the shock, – for a shock it will indeed have
                  been.

               <p>My brothers are gone. they went this afternoon – Tom going to Taunton to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">his Uncle</a>, &amp; wishing to take <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> with him. It is the first time that we have ever been all three together since we
                  were children – &amp; it is by no means improbable that it may be the last. – My head
                  feels as if it would be easier if I were to let a little water out, – but tears, Senhora,
                  are a bad collyrium for weak eyes, – &amp; I shall go to work. Idleness is the mother
                  of sins they say, &amp; it may be said that she is the wet nurse of Melancholy. My motto
                  you know is In Labore Quies.
