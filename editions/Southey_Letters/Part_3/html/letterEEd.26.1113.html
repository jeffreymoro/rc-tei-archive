               to ‘an old MSS volume of poems’ by Robert Hurrell Froude (1770/71–1859; <em>DNB</em>), a Church of England clergyman, who was later Archdeacon of Totnes. The volume contained
               the text of three rare medieval metrical romances: <em>Sir Isumbras, Sir Gowther</em>, and <em>Amadas</em> (or <em>Sir Amadace</em>). It had been owned by the Sherbrooke family of Oxton, Nottinghamshire since the
               sixteenth century. Southey arranged for its purchase, through the good offices of
               Scott, by Scott’s friend Thomas Thomson (1768–1852; <em>DNB</em>), the Edinburgh advocate, record keeper and editor of medieval manuscripts. See letter
               1147 of this edition. From Thomson the manuscript went to the Advocates Library, Edinburgh.
               It remains in their collection today (National Library of Scotland, Advocates MS 19.3.1).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in the second volume of <em>Poems</em> (1799) – printed at the end of the poem. Southey now wished to fill the gap made
               by the removal of the ‘Vision’ in the new 1806 edition of <em>Poems</em> that he was preparing for the press. He filled it with ‘The Retrospect’, originally
               published in <em>Poems</em> (1795) but did not include ‘Rosamund to Henry, Written after She Had Taken the Veil’,
               also originally published in <em>Poems</em> (1795). Other poems brought into the 1806 edition to make up for the removal of the
               ‘Vision’ were, ‘Translation of a Greek Ode on Astronomy, written for the prize at
               Cambridge, 1793’ (pp. 3–9); ‘Remembrance’ (pp. 40–43); ‘To Recovery’ (pp. 49–51);
