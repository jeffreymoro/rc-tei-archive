                  instance only a little circumstance of the moment – not operating so as to influence
                  the action of the poem. there is therefore no sameness of <span class="strikethrough">imagery</span> &lt;action&gt; such as would make it faulty. Lincoyas death is in character. he is a savage
                  of the best possible constitution, &amp; all savages <span class="strikethrough">all</span> are as violent in their loves as in their enmities. The old mans story is introduced
                  to give effect to his death – in fact the manner of his death grew out of the story.
                  I do not think it needful to cover Madocs loins – on the contrary there would be an
                  indecency in doing it. It would look like the bough of the tree which always sticks
