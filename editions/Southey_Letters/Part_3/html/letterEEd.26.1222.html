               <p>I have had two reasons for delaying in writing – the one that I waited for knowledge
                  when franking began again – the other that I expected <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> confinement – &amp; was willing to tell you its result; but it seems the unborn is in
                  no hurry.

                  done far better than I expected – &amp; if he can but keep his heart up I shall yet make
                  author enough of him to live now, whatever he may do hereafter.
