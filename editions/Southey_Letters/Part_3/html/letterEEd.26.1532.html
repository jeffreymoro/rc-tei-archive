               I have only stated my own feeling of unfitness. On the other hand no man better understands
               the Spanish character. something I know of the country, much of their history, every
               thing of their literature. – &amp; the heart of man is not capable of a stronger interest
               than what mine feels in their present cause. If it be thought proper that I should
               write I will do my best &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</a> may expunge what is too strongly marked with the stamp of Robert Southey, – <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> or knead such parts as he thinks with any body elses article, – or reject the whole.
               On such occasions I have no mutinous feelings about me state this to him, – tell me
               his determination with the least possible delay – &amp; let me know the names of some
               of your Respectables – that I may see into what company I am likely to get.</p>
            <p class="indent1">A good thing would be an article upon Spanish literature if a text could be found.
               There is a collection of their poets not yet compleated, but I am afraid at a stand
               &amp; of too old a date: otherwise it would supply three or four striking articles, with
               translated specimens. With the fine literatures of France &amp; Italy I am well acquainted,
               – our own I have no desire to meddle with. not being disposed to knock calves on the

                  lay with any weight upon my mind, was the thought of his solitary situation at a time
                  of life when solitariness is not desirable. My Uncles age I believe is <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> 57. This is somewhat late for marriage, but having been plucked up by the roots from
                  that country &amp; society wherein all his habits had grown, he had new ones necessarily
                  to acquire, &amp; the main objection to so late a change of life is therefore not applicable.
