               you will persist in complaining of the booksellers &amp; looking to them to do what they
               have no more business to do, &amp; are no more in the way of doing than the Man <span class="strikethrough">of</span> &lt;in&gt; the Moon. Dear dear Grosvenor just recollect what the business of a publisher
               is – it is to buy &amp; sell books – not to make them, – to keep <span class="strikethrough">an</span> accounts with <span class="strikethrough">a</span> paper makers <span class="strikethrough">another</span> with <span class="strikethrough">a</span> printers, – with country booksellers in almost every town throughout the Kingdom
               – with newspapers – with authors – with bookbinders – folders – stickers – &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c
               &amp;c – – how in the very Devils name do you suppose that they can find time to assist
               in making the book they publish? –</p>

               <p>As for petty faults, such as making a man die before he was born, they are trifles,

                  a thing except some country clergyman who prints a volume of sermons &amp; fancies every
                  body will be interested in them – Let all these things alone – only out with the abominations,
                  – they affect <span class="ital">us</span>, the blunders concern the printer &amp; are after all of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> far less consequence. About Chesterfield there need be no trouble – I &lt;have&gt; remedied
