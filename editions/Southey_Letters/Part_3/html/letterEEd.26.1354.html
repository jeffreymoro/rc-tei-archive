                           from the Crónica de España of Alphonso the Wise (1541) and Romancero e Historia del

                  </div> I have been settling myself here in a permanent place of abode, and in consequence
                  many unavoidable expenses have been incurred. Among others, that of removing from
                  Bristol a much larger library than perhaps any other man living, whose means are so
                  scanty, is possessed of. I thank you for the <span class="ital">manner</span> in which you have objected to purchasing it, and am more gratified by it than I should
                  have been by your acceptance. The sale of this book cannot be so doubtful as that
                  of a poem. A part of it shall be sent up in a few days, and the sooner it is put to
                  press the better. If it suits you, I should much like to let <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</a> print it.
