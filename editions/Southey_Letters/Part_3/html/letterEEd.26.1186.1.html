            <p class="indent1">Your letter has travelled from one end of England to the other in search of me, &amp;
               has been a fortnight on the road. This will account for the delay of an acknowledgement
               on my part, which you will perhaps have expected.</p>
            <p class="indent1">No approbation is more grateful to me than that of young readers, because they judge
               as they feel, &amp; their feelings are not influenced by any preconceived articles of
               critical faith, which are as likely to be wrong as right. They are not judges of the
               workmanship of poetry, but not infrequently the best &lt;judges&gt; of its materials.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Of the pieces which you notice as your favourites two will stand the test of your
                  elder judgement. Elinor

                           that collection. The other two pieces singled out by Bill are unidentified as his

                  </div> will not: the whole feeling of the poem is natural but not naturally conveyed; there
                  is an impropriety in the form of the piece; it should have been a picture, not a speech;
                  I should have described the feelings of a person so situated, not have made her utter
                  them to the winds. The Monologue is an absurd form of poem, because it represents
                  &lt;persons&gt; as talking to themselves, which they never do; the Monodrama is not, as
                  it leads to action, &amp; implies spectators.</p>
