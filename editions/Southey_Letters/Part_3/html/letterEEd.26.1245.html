            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter and parcel arrived yesterday, just as I had completed the examination
               of the former papers. I have now examined the whole.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>What account of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">your brother</a> shall be given it rests with you, sir, and his other nearest friends, to determine.
                  I advise and <span class="ital">entreat</span> that it may be as full and as minute as possible. The example of a young man winning
                  his way against great difficulties, of such honourable ambition, such unexampled industry,
                  such a righteous and holy confidence of genius, ought not to be withheld. A full and
                  faithful narrative of his difficulties, his hopes, and his eventual success, till
                  it pleased God to promote him to a higher state of existence, will be a lasting encouragement
                  to others who have the same uphill path to tread; – he will be to them what Chatterton

                  of his family to let all and every particular of his honourable and admirable life
                  be known, those feelings are, of course, paramount to every other consideration. But
                  I sincerely hope this may not be the case. It will, I know, be a painful task to furnish
                  me with materials for this, which is the most useful kind of biography,

                  that you are doing for him what he would have wished to be done, will bring with it
                  a consolation and a comfort.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Let me beg of you and of your family, when you can command heart for the task, to
               give me all your recollections of his childhood and of every stage of his life. Do
               not fear you can be too minute; I will arrange them, insert such poems as will best
               appear in that place, and add such remarks as grow out of the circumstances. The narrative
               itself cannot be told too plainly; all ornament of style would be misplaced in it,
               – that which is meant to tickle the ear will never find its way either to the understanding
               or the heart. </p>

                  will not be much, unless the public should be taken with some unusual fit of good
                  feeling; and, indeed, this is not unlikely, for they are more frequently just to the

               <p>I shall be glad to see all his magazine publications; possibly some of the pieces
                  marked by me for transcription may be found among them. There is one poem, printed
                  in the Globe for Feb. 11. 1803, which I remember noticing when it appeared, and which
                  may be more easily copied from the newspaper than from the manuscript.

                  </div> Whether any of his prose writings should be inserted, I shall better be able to judge
                  after having seen the magazines. But the most valuable materials which could be entrusted
