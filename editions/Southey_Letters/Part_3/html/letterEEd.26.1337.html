                  person, – add to a Life of Cervantes an account of all his other writings, and likewise
                  of the books in Don Quixote’s library, as far as my own stores will reach, and those
                  which we may find access to; and make such notes upon the whole book as my knowledge

                  most expedient. It gives me very great pleasure to hear that you have engaged for
                  a genuine version of the Arabian Nights, – which I consider as one of the greatest
                  desideratums in modern Oriental literature. We have a number of imitations in our
                  language, which I am still boy enough to delight in; and were you, as the French have
                  done, to publish a complete collection of them, I, for one, should be glad of the
