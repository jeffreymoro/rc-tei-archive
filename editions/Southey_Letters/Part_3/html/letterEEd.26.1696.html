               but he threatened to resign several times in 1809 over the progress of the war with
               France. His disputes with Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh and 2nd Marquess of
               Londonderry (1769–1822; <em>DNB</em>) led to a plan to expel Castlereagh from the War Office, and when Castlereagh discovered
               the plan he challenged Canning to a duel. This took place on 21 September 1809, and
               though both men survived, but there was much public outrage over their behaviour.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
