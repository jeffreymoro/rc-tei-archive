               <p>I have been busy, in gutting borrowed books which were to be returned with great speed,
                  &amp; which were like wood cock all trail. They cost me three weeks of almost incessant
                  application, – that is of all the application that I could command. I waited to begin
                  a new article for the Quarterly till the first number was published,

                  which I review better than any thing else. I am impatient to see the first number.
                  – Young Lady never felt more desirous to see herself in a new ball-dress, than I do
                  to see my own performances in print, often as that gratification falls to my lot.
                  The reason is that in the multiplicity of my employments, I forget the form &amp; manner
                  of every thing as soon as it is out of sight, &amp; they come to me like pleasant recollections
                  of what I wish to remember. Besides the thing looks differently in print. In short
                  Mr Bedford there are a great many philosophical reasons for this fancy of mine, &amp;
                  one of the best of all reasons is that I hold it good to make every thing a pleasure
                  which it is possible to make so, – &amp; these sort of Claude spectacles
