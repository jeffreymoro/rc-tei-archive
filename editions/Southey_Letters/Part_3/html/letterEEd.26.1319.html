               The part allotted to travelling for the sake of verisimilitude has taken up too much
               of the book, tho it brings in many things in a sort of dramatic order. It is because
               such books as this have not been written that we are reduced to glean scraps of knowledge
               concerning other ages: whether I may succeed in obtaining a good temporary sale remains
               to be seen, – but I am sure the book will increase in value as it grows old, – upon
               that score for which you rightly value the old periodicals. Some months ago I began
               to mark in all English books which I had occasion to read all passages relating to
               this home-history, &amp;, by my own hand in idler minutes, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</a> before <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> made his appearance – transcribed a bundle of some size, – each extract on a separate

               I will sort them into due order &amp; print them as contributions to English History.
               This way of reading I well remember you taught me, &amp; I believe nothing of any possible
               application to any thing in the <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> bounds of my knowledge ever now escapes me.</p>
