               <p>In one of the letters to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">Mr. Hill</a>, your brother mentions a very good miniature of himself by Millet, which was taken
                  gratis with the idea that some time or other it might be engraved; you, I am sure,
                  will anxiously inquire after this, (the existence of which you seem either to have
                  forgotten or not to have known): if it be a better likeness than the profile, it may
                  not be too late to engrave it in preference; at all events, while one is prefixed
                  to the book, the other may be engraved for the ‘Monthly Mirror,’ and thus we who wish
                  to preserve every relic may insert both in our own copies.

               <p>Before <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> went to Cambridge, I spoke of him to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontaguBasil">Mr. Basil Montague</a>, who then resided in that town, knowing a <span class="ital">family</span> acquaintance to be one of the things most wanted in a University, and thinking this
                  would prove a desirable one. Montague entered fully into my feelings, and promised

                  </div> of Peter House, in your brother’s favour. You probably know whether anything resulted
                  from this, – for I am not in correspondence with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontaguBasil">Montague</a>, and only saw him accidentally; but if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> at any time frequented his house, I would write to him to learn whether he recollected
                  anything worthy of preservation. You will easily perceive that to ask him the question
                  without knowing whether he ever noticed your brother at all would place him, (if that
                  were the case) under the necessity of making some awkward excuse; and this I half
                  suspect to be the case, not finding any mention of him in any of these letters. In
                  all things I had only the <span class="ital">will</span> to befriend him, not the <span class="ital">means</span>. Now it is otherwise, and I <span class="ital">can</span> do what I <span class="ital">would</span>: but that this should be the case is regretted almost as deeply by me as by his nearest
                  relatives. It is my full belief that English literature had never a greater loss.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">To a part of your letter I have only thanks to give, and to say that as I am so thoroughly
               acquainted with all <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> dearest friends, the intimacy must not always be only on one side. Nottingham is
               not in my way to London, but assuredly I will one day make it so.</p>
