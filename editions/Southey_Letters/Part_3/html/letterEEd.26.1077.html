            <p>MS: Bodleian Library, MS Eng. Lett. d.113. <br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: Unfinished and undated letter, which is presumed to have been written
               in June 1805 because it refers to Edith May Southey (born 30 April 1804) as ‘13 months
               old’. In Southey’s letter to Nicholas Lightfoot, 8 February 1806 (Letter 1153), he
               encloses this letter which he says was written ‘last June’.</p>

               <p>Of all the persons with whom I have heretofore lived in habits of near intimacy; you
                  are the only one whom I have not at some time or other met again, tho there is not
                  one whom it would rejoice me more to meet. Two years ago I heard of you from M<sup>r</sup> Rowe

                  I had the heavy affliction to lose my only child. It is now eleven years since we
                  parted at Oxford: eleven since you &amp; I who used to breakfast together every morning,
                  &amp; meet each other generally every evening, have seen each others face! – I have had
                  my share during that time of good &amp; of evil, &amp; am full eleven years older in mind
                  &amp; in body – but in my conscience I do not think there lives a happier man this day
                  upon God’s earth, nor one who has more reason to be so. My worldly wealth Heaven knows
                  is little enough, but it is enough, for my habits are the most inexpensive possible,
                  &amp; literary employments have always been so habitual &amp; so delightful to me, that I
                  should continue them just as assiduously from choice were my fortunes affluent, as
                  I now do from necessity. I have one little girl, now thirteen months old, a great
                  favourite. My health which was such in 1800 as to drive me to Portugal, is so well
                  established as to give me no cause for complaint. Of three brothers, all younger than
                  myself, two are doing excellently well – the one in the navy, the other will graduate
                  next summer at Edinburgh, where he has distinguished himself by his talents. the third
                  does not promise well – but I have done my duty by him, &amp; will not distress myself
                  at what I cannot prevent.</p>

               <p>The newspapers &amp; reviews will have told you what I have from time to time been doing.
                  I have as much reputation as my best friends could wish me, &amp; enjoy as the best effects
                  of such reputation the friendship of some of the ablest men of the age, &amp; the acquaintance
                  of almost every person who is considered, <span class="strikethrough">xxx is considered</span>, or who considers himself, as among the number. For the last four years, my main
