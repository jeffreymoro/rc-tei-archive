               the surname of Nightingale on becoming heir to his kinsman Sir Robert Nightingale.
               The monument, by the French sculptor, Louis Francois Roubiliac (1702/1705–1762) was
               installed in 1761 and it depicts Death in the figure of a skeleton aiming a dart at

               dress, with his books and representative elements of astronomy. The other monument

               Both designs were by the architect, William Kent (bap. 1686–1748; <em>DNB</em>) and were executed by the sculptor, Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770). The monuments are
               described in <em>Letters from England</em>, Letter 23.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
