                  The truth is that all my books, except those early works of which the copy right is

               <p>You may see by this statement that Constable overrates the utility of a connection

                  I bear so large a part in the Annual Review. – I have however about a thousand lines
                  by me of a poem called The Curse of Kehama, of which Hindoo superstition is the basis,
                  as the Mohammedan fault was the basis of Thalaba. It is written like Thalaba, with
                  this difference that there is a frequent intermixture of rhymes, – my design <span class="strikethrough">beg</span> being to buoy up by rhyme those parts in which there was least passion. If compleated
                  it would extend to the same length, – that is about 6000 lines, with about the same
                  proportion of notes. What would he give me for an edition of this poem were I to finish
                  it, the form &amp; number of the edition &lt;being&gt; of course at his option? If his offer
                  tempted me to proceed, I would communicate it to Longman – (to whom I should consider
                  myself so far bound,) &amp; give him the refusal of it at that price. On his refusal it
                  should be Constables.
