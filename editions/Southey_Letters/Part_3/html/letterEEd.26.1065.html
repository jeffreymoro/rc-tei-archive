            <p class="indent1">If I do not answer a letter as soon as it is received – it is likely to remain long
               unanswered – &amp; that is the history of my long silence. Just as the thing is fresh
               there is a disposition to talk in reply, – but if this be suffered to go off – the
               whole evaporates like the life of a glass of bottled ale – Besides be pleased always
               to take it for granted when you do not hear from us that all is going on well, &amp; just
               as usual. Any calamity – any good fortune – if an earthquake were to shake down the
               house – or the sky were to fall – the tidings would reach you quite soon enough.</p>

               I mean that she shall be taught to draw – chiefly I hope by your Senhoraship – as
               soon as she can hold a pencil. &amp; I mean to make it subservient to useful purposes.
               for instance I will have the whole history of a tree in a series of drawings. – the
               first appearance of the seed above ground – &amp; so on thru all its stages – the various
               appearances of its foliage from the first bud to the fall – its flower – fruit &amp;c
               – &amp; thus thro all the English trees. – But I will talk of something else – for to
               lay up hopes is to lay up evil for oneself if they be frustrated.</p>
