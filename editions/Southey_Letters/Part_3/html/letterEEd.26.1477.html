               <p>The thought of writing to you, – or, rather, the thought that I had not written, –
                  has very often risen in my conscience heavily. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SouthcottJoanna">Joanna Southcote</a> has been the cause. Her books, with Sharp’s dirty treasure,

                           Southey was sending Duppa materials on Southcott which he had used in writing Letters

            <p class="indent1">For the last three weeks I have suffered from a blinding and excoriating catarrh;
               always with me a very obstinate disease, and more violent than I have ever seen it
               in any person except one of my own family. Diseases are the worst things a man can
               inherit, and I am never likely to inherit anything else. That <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">father’s brother of mine</a> in Somersetshire – whom I would so gladly sell at half price received me as cordially
               as was in his nature last April, and gave me 25<span class="ital">1</span>., – an act of great generosity in a man of 1200<span class="ital">l</span>. a year, and remarkable as being all I ever have had, or ever shall have, from him,
               for he has now turned <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">his sister</a> out of doors, and desired never to see any of the family again. Duppa, my breeches’
               pockets will never be so full as to make me stick in Heaven’s gate. Three lines of
               that fellows pen will cut me off from more than all the pens I shall ever wear to
               the stump will gain for me, and yet I hope many is the goose egg yet unlaid which
               is to produce quills for my service.</p>

               <p>A month ago you might, perhaps, have been gratified by knowing what were my thoughts
                  of the state of Spain; now, I suppose, everybody thinks alike. But I have always said
                  that, if the deliverance of Europe were to take place in our days, there was no country
                  in which it was so likely to begin as Spain; and this opinion, whenever I expressed
                  it, was received with wonder, if not with incredulity. But there is a spirit of patriotism,
                  a glowing and proud remembrance of the past, a generous shame for the present, and
                  a living hope for the future, both in the Spaniards and Portuguese, which convinced
                  me that the heart of the country was sound, and that those nations are likely to rise
                  in the scale, perhaps, Duppa, when we are sunk. Not that England will sink yet, but
                  there is more public virtue in Spain than in any other country under Heaven. I have
                  no fears nor doubts concerning that country; the spirit of liberty is not to be extinguished:
                  nothing but that spirit could possibly check the progress of Bonaparte; this will
                  check, and, it is my firm conviction, eventually destroy him. William Bryan
