            <p class="indent1">First I have to thank you for your letter &amp; your poem, &amp; secondly to explain why I
               have not done this sooner. We were a long time without knowing where you where, &amp;
               when news came from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</a> that you were in London, by the time a letter could have reached you, you were gone,
               – &amp; lastly <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JacksonWilliam">Mr Jackson</a> wrote to you to Bristol. I will now compose an epistle which shall follow you farther
               west, &amp; tell you all the news of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</a>.</p>

               <p>Bona Marietta hath had kittens, they were remarkably ugly, all taking after their
                  father Thomas, who there is reason to believe was either Uncle or Grandsire to Bona
                  herself, the prohibited degrees of consanguinity which you will find at the end of
                  the Bible, not being regarded by cats. As I have never been able to persuade this
                  family that catlings, fed for the purpose &amp; smothered with onions, would be rabbits
                  to all eatable purposes, Bona Mariettas ugly progeny no sooner came into the world
                  than they were sent out of it; the River Nymph Greta conveyed them to the River God
                  Derwent, &amp; if neither the eels nor the Ladies of the Lake have taken a fancy to them
                  on their way, Derwent hath consigned them to the Nereids: you may imagine them converted
                  into sea cats by favour of Neptune, &amp; write an episode to be inserted in Ovids Metamorphoses.
                  Bona bore the loss patiently &amp; is in good health &amp; spirits. I fear that if you meet
