               <p>A REMARK made by the writer of the entertaining Comparison of Manners in two Centuries,
                  in one of your early numbers, concerning the infrequency of journeys for curiosity
                  in England, and the total absence of a taste for the picturesque, at the earlier period,
                  is singularly confirmed by an extract from a manuscript Tour in England, made about
                  the year 1697, by a lady of noble family, which has lately fallen into my hands.

                           her descendants, the Danvers family. For the remark referred to by Southey, see The
                           Athenaeum, A Magazine of Literary and Miscellaneous Information, 1:2 (February 1807),

                  </div> It contains an account of the Westmoreland lakes, which, as your correspondent observes,
                  were then as little known to the southern inhabitants of the island as those of Lapland.
                  The narrative is written in so bald a style, and is so unenlivened by any thing either
                  sprightly or sentimental, that a transcript of it would be tedious to most of your
                  readers; I shall therefore confine myself to the notice of a few particulars, characteristic
                  as well of the state of the country at that time, as of the turn of a female observer
                  in the superior ranks of society.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The lady begins her description with the town of Kendal, which was then, as at present,
                  noted for its manufactures. These consisted of what are called cottons, used for blankets,
                  and purchased by the Scots for their plaids, and of linsey-woolies, together with
                  a great quantity of tanned leather. The fame of Mrs Rowlandson, at the King’s Arms,
                  for potted char, induced her not only to bespeak some of that article from the landlady,
                  but made her “curious to see the great water, which is the only place that fish is
                  to be found in.” This sole motive apparently led the lady to venture through the narrow
                  stony lanes of the country, passed by no other carriages but very narrow cars like
                  wheelbarrows, to Winander-mere. Here she notices the principal island, then inhabited
                  by the lord of the manor, Sir Christopher Phillips.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Sir Christopher Philipson (1646–1709) of Crook Hall, near Windermere.</span></div>
                  </div> She, of course, makes her observations on the great object of her enquiries, the char
                  fish; and then, with sufficient accuracy, describes the water of the lakes, its motion,
                  its feeders, and outlet. She speaks of the high rocky hills by which it is surrounded,
                  and of the wild tract called Furness Fells. Thence she makes a digression to the manufacture
                  of the clap-bread, or large thin oat-cakes, which were the chief food of the people,
                  and when well made, were, she says, ‘as crisp and pleasant to eat as any thing you
                  can imagine.’</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">A ride for some miles over the fells gives occasion to a general description of the
               face of the country, in which there is a good deal of <span class="ital">picture</span>, though nothing of the <span class="ital">picturesque</span>. It is the result of an observing eye, but which conveys to the mind no ideas but
               simply those of the objects themselves. The sublimity or beauty associated in a cultivated
               mind with scenes of nature seem to have been feelings of which she had no conception;
               and the only symptom of pleasure which she betrays, is where she speaks of the murmurs
               of the currents of water which rush from the sides of the hills. The villages are
               described as composed of wretched huts, made of stones without mortar, and roofed
               with slates; and the entertainment at public-houses only clap-bread with butter and
               cheese, and a cup of beer.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I shall here transcribe a passage from her letter, as a specimen of her manner of
               writing and surveying.</p>
            <p class="indent1">‘Thence I rode almost all the way in sight of this great water; sometimes I lost it
               by reason of the great hills interposing, and so continued up hill and down hill,
               and that pretty steep even when I was in that they called the bottoms, which are very
               rich good grounds; and so I gained by degrees, from lower to higher grounds, which
               I always went up and down before I came to another hill. At last I attained to the
               side of one of these vast hills, or fells of rocks, which I passed on the side, much
               about the middle, for looking down to the bottom it was at least a mile, all full
               of those lesser hills and inclosures; so looking upwards, I was as far from the top,
               which was all rocks, and something more barren, though there was some trees and woods
               growing in the rocks, and hanging over all down the brow of some of the hills. From
               these great fells there are several springs out of the rock that trickle down their
               sides, and as they meet with stones and rocks in the way, which something obstructs
               their passage, and so they come with more violence, that gives a pleasing sound and
               murmuring noise. These descend by degrees, and at last fall into the lower grounds
               and fructify it, which makes the land so fruitful in the vallies; and upon those very
               high fells or rocky hills it is, though so high, yet a moorish sort of ground, whence
               they dig abundance of peat, which they use for their fuel, being in many places a
               barren ground, yielding no wood.’</p>
            <p class="indent1">She then crossed over into Cumberland, and came to Ulleswater, which she describes
               in the same style as Winander-mere. On riding through a forest or park by its side,
               she took the diversion of coursing by means of a greyhound that accompanied her. A
               fine round hill at the end of this lake, fertile in grass and corn, pleased her much,
               as the termination of the deserts and barren rocks she had been passing. No others
               of the lake are mentioned, and the lady seems to have been fully satisfied with the
               view she had taken of this wild and unfrequented region.</p>
