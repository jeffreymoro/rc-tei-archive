W. Robberds (ed.), <em>A Memoir of the Life and Writings of the Late William Taylor of Norwich</em>, 2 vols (London, 1843), II, pp. 213–214.<br>Dating note: dating from endorsement and internal evidence; Southey writes to Herbert
               Hill, 2 January 1808 (Letter 1409) stating that he has offered some of the books he
               had been asked to review to Taylor.</p>

               <p>I have long looked to hear from you, &amp; more than once designed to write, when proof
                  sheets, or letters which required reply have taken up the letter-writing hours <span class="strikethrough">which</span>. And now I am too highly excited by the news from Portugal which involves so many
                  of my friends some in distress &amp; others in ruin, – to be able to write on any thing
                  but business. To the point then. Reviewing books lie round about for which I have
                  now no appetite &amp; which would materially delay me in getting ready my History of Brazil.
