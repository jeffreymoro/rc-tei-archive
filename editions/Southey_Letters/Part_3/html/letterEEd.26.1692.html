               <p>Having gone thus far through life – not indeed without receiving kind offices, but
                  without ever having solicited them, – it requires some effort to expose myself to
                  the hazard of being thought obtrusive by you, for a second application. I have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">a brother</a> in the Navy, and it has been advised me by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Williams Wynn</a> (who in all things concerning my welfare has long been my privy counsellor) to make
                  application in his behalf, and get him, if possible, in the list of post-captains,
                  he having been ten years a lieutenant. Wynn wished me to avail myself of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CanningGeorge">Mr. Canning’s</a> expressed good-will to this effect; but it appears to me from what passed respecting
                  the Derwentwater stewardship

                           Estates (which were owned by Greenwich Hospital) would soon become vacant on the death
                           of the incumbent. Southey asked several friends to intercede on his behalf, including
                           Sir George Beaumont, but in the end it was considered unsuitable for him; see Southey
                           to Walter Scott, 8 August 1809 (Letter 1666) and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford,
                           12 August 1809 (Letter 1669).</span></div>

                           the command of Rear Admiral Thomas Sotheby (1759–1831), younger brother of the author,

                           the captain, Alexander Hood (1758–1798), who died of a wound to the thigh, on 2 April

            <p class="indent1">Admiral Sotheby’s ship is likely to go into dock, and in that case will be paid off.
               My brother’s situation cannot be altered for the better in his present rank, and it
               unfortunately happens that the longer a man remains in that rank, the worse does his
               situation become, for this reason, that most captains have their own first lieutenants,
               and as there are few ships in which one of ten years’ standing would not take that
               place by seniority, old lieutenants are usually disposed of in gun-brigs and small
               craft, the least reputable and the most uncomfortable part of the Navy. There is one
               circumstance which renders me peculiarly anxious to obtain promotion for him. We have
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">an uncle</a>, a wealthy man, possessing property, which in the common course of inheritance would
               have devolved upon us instead of him, as children of an elder brother. He is a man
               of that sort of disposition that the less his relations wanted his estates, the more
               he would be disposed to bequeath them as he ought to do. If Tom were Captain Southey
               he would in all probability be appointed his heir; if he remains what he is, the whole,
               there is every reason to believe, will be left to strangers. I have little doubt that
               a captain commission would secure to my brother an estate of a thousand a year. I
               could mention another circumstance more important to his happiness, and little less
               so to his welfare, to which the want of professional rank, and the prospect which
               it opens, is the obstacle; and this consideration it is which induces me, reluctant
               as I am, once more to solicit your good offices with Lord Mulgrave.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I do not wish to have him employed, confident as I should be that if he were on the
               Spanish coast he would eminently distinguish himself. To promote him and send him
               ashore would be conferring upon me the highest obligation. Family ties grow stronger
               as we advance in life, and they become fewer in number. There are few persons who
               are so rich in friends as I am. But among them all there is not one who loves me so
               dearly and entirely as he does. Nor is there that possible circumstance which would
               contribute so greatly to my happiness as to have him settled here beside the Lake.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I know not, Sir George, in what manner to apologise for an application which I am
               so little entitled to make. Yet I should have reproached myself had I not made it.
               The motive must plead for me, and I will rely upon your goodness to excuse me, if
               it should not be in your power to do more. – Your health, I hope, is better than it
               was. Present my respects to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BeaumontLadyMary">Lady Beaumont</a>, and believe me, yours respectfully, and very thankfully for your late interference,</p>
