                  this time had all things been going on well with me. I had <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">a daughter</a> born on the 27<sup>th</sup> of last month; a few days after the birth <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">her mother</a> was taken ill with an attack of dysentery, &amp; for some time there was cause of serious
                  alarm. This God be thanked is over. The night before last we had another alarm of
                  the worst-kind, tho happily this also is passing away. My <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">little boy</a> went to bed with some slight indications of a trifling cold. His <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">mother</a> went up to look at him before supper, – she thought he coughed in a strange manner,
                  – called me, – &amp; I instantly recognized the sound of the croop. We have a good <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">apothecary</a> within three minutes walk &amp; luckily he was at home. He immediately confirmed our fears,
                  – the child was taken out of bed &amp; bled in the jugular vein, – a blister placed on
                  the throat next morning, &amp; by these rigorous &amp; timely remedies, we hope &amp; trust the
                  disease is subdued. But what a twelve-hours did we pass, knowing the nature of the
                  disease &amp; only hoping the efficacy of the remedy. – Even now I am far – very far from
                  being at ease. There is a love which passeth the love of women,

               tears that start are of love or of bitterness. There is an evil too in seeing all
               things like a poet, – circumstances which would glide over a healthier mind, sink

                  </div> Gebir came to me with a parcel of other poems which I was to kill off – I was young
                  in the trade &amp; reviewed it injudiciously, – so that every body supposed it to be done
                  by some friend of the author. For I analysed the story, studded it with as many beautiful
                  extracts as they would allow room for, praised its merit almost up to the height of
                  my feeling, – &amp; never thought of telling the reader that if he went to the book itself,
                  he would find any more difficulty in comprehending it than he found in that abstract.
                  Thus instead of serving the poem I in reality injured it. The world now-a-days never
                  believes praise to be sincere – they are so accustomed to hunt for faults that they
                  will not think any person can honestly express unmingled admiration.</p>

                  heard the history of Thomas Young as he is still called by those who knew him when
                  he was a Quaker &amp; believe him to be a very able man, but not of the best class. Generally
                  speaking I have little liking for men of science, – their pursuits seem to deaden
                  their imagination &amp; harden their heart. – they are so accustomed to analyse &amp; <span class="ital">anatomize</span> every thing, – to understand or fancy they understand whatever comes before them,
                  that they <span class="strikethrough">fre</span> most frequently become mere materialists, account for every thing by mechanism &amp; motion,

                  their knowledge nor the utility of their discoveries, – but I do not like the men.
                  My own nature requires something more than they teach, – it pants after things unseen,
                  it exists upon the hope of that better futurity which all its aspirations promise
