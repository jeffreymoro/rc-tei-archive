               <p>On Tuesday evening last, I had a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">daughter</a> born, – every thing, thanks be to God – is as well as could be wished, &amp; tomorrow
                  I set my face southward &amp; depart from home. My habits have long been so domestic &amp;
                  so uniform that to set out upon any journey seems a more formidable undertaking, &amp;
                  is a more unpleasant one than it ought to be. I have however company to lighten the
                  wearisomeness of the way as far as Staffordshire. My brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Thomas</a> goes with me to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</a>, where after halting a day or two at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Teddesley</a>, we seperate, – he for Bristol &amp; I for Litchfield on my London road. <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxxx xxxxx</span> As we travel slowly for the sake of saving fatigue, seeing where we go, &amp; beating
                  up the quarters of one or two old acquaintance, it may be nearly a fortnight before <span class="ital">I</span> reach Litchfield, – but I will write from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</a>, &amp; tell you on what day I shall be at your door. Had it not been for the sad knowledge
                  that you are an invalid I think I should have made for Litchfield first, &amp; ventured
                  to show you my brother. He is three years younger than me, but made older in appearance
                  &amp; in constitution by fifteen years hard service in the navy. In the action between
                  the Mars &amp; L’Hercule,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> – the most memorable that was fought between two single ships during the last war,
                  he distinguished himself, &amp; earned his Lieutenants commission. We had reason to hope
                  he would be promoted under M<sup>r</sup> Grenvilles reign at the admiralty;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> – that hope is over, &amp; length of service in the navy &lt;only&gt; lessens the chance of
                  reward. I could say much upon the state of that navy, which is now the only bulwark
                  of liberty if it were not for his sake. But however wholesome &amp; important the advice,
                  the adviser would never be forgiven, – &amp; I pay more regard to his interests than I
                  would do to my own. You would have been well pleased with him, – he has all the best
                  parts of the sailor-character, &amp; his own good heart has preserved him from all the
                  bad ones.</p>

               <p>I am too busy in preparing for a two months absence, &amp; too much occupied with thinking
                  about it, to have either leisure or spirits for writing as I wished &amp; meant to have
                  done. My <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">eldest girl</a> clings to me &amp; says don’t go, – my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">little boy</a> will lead his nursemaid tomorrow to my study door, &amp; find no one there to show him
                  the pictures. – I had need think of Litchfield &amp; of what I shall see there with more
                  respect than the <span class="strikethrough">shrine</span> &lt;altar&gt; of S<sup>t</sup> Chad,

                  one were you in health; – yet I shall find &lt;you&gt; with a young heart, &amp; an intellect
                  to which time has only given strength; with all that is immortal about you fresh &amp;
