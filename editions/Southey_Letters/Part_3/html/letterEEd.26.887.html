               upon this world of mysteries in which we are placed. What the old Bards held of progressive
               transmigration appears to me a probable belief. There is in all of us a living power
               distinct from intellect, or connected with it (as it surely is) by some hypostatic
               union altogether unintelligible to our present capacities. I mean that wonderful wisdom
               which directs our bodily &amp; involuntary actions, that makes &amp; disposes the secretions
               – &amp; fills the bosom with milk as the embryo ripens in the womb, this truly aweful
               life has perhaps past through a long series of ascending habitations, gradually acquiring
               those instincts, which are in it perfect wisdom. How well would such an opinion explain
               the original difference of human character, for the wolf &amp; the sheep would be equally
               high in the scale, &amp; the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> Life which took one road would go on in it.</p>

                  it has been ejected by the female – &amp; then both sexes without sense or feeling eat

                  altogether distinct from the sexual appetite – &amp; lust is in them actually refined
                  with love, – that is the feeling which the appetite causes, exists after its cause
                  is extinct. the greater length of life allotted to birds is remarkable, &amp; at present

            <p class="indent1">Did I ever tell you a very extraordinary fact which happened under my own eyes? I
               had promised to kill some of the horned beetles for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</a>, – for the insect is common about the New Forest &amp; rare, or unknown, in the other
               parts of England. he had directed me to pour oil upon them, which to all insects is
               certain death. I had killed a female thus, who might have struggled with the poison
               for about two minutes – certainly not longer. I placed a buck (as they are called
               for the love of their horns) in the same saucer, &amp; in like manner pourd about a teaspoonful
               of oil over him, so as to touch every part. he also experienced the same suffocation,
               went thro the same struggles, &amp; was apparently exhausted &amp; in the very point of death
               when he discovered the dead female. a paroxysm of lust came upon him, &amp; that insect
               lived a full half-hour, in vain attempts to copulate with the dead body, which he
               could never so place as to effect his purpose. I was as much shocked as astonished.
               perhaps a more extraordinary fact has <span class="strikethrough">been</span> never been observed. Excitement will I believe always protract death. one whom I
               knew fell into the water &amp; was taken out senseless – he had felt no pain – for the
               accident was sudden. a person who had attempted suicide by drowning &amp; was restored,
               relates that the sufferings were long &amp; painful, – the mind had been in the highest
               possible state of stimulation. – It is well known that in <span class="strikethrough">cases</span> times of contagion they who fear the disease rarely escape or survive it, but how
               many are the instances wherein courageous affection or <span class="strikethrough">danger</span> duty have braved &amp; escaped the danger!</p>
