                  </div> it is exceedingly beautiful, &amp; almost induces me to say that you who manage a pencil
                  in so masterly, or mistressly – a way, ought never to use a brush – it is exceedingly
                  beautiful – dont wonder that I write a phrase twice which I have ejaculated about
                  twenty times. But, – there is a fault in the drawing – with reference to its purport
                  – which I did not discover for full half an hour, &amp; that is that if large trees are
                  introduced, the scale of proportions will reduce the poor Beaver to a very diminutive
                  personage indeed, – in fact he will look as a portrait of a man would look taken in,
                  &amp; <span class="ital">taking in</span> the inside of St Pauls. I will make something to fit this beautiful bank – &amp; you must
                  make another bank to fit the Beaver – where you may have as many reeds, flags, colts-foots,
                  &amp; stumps of trees as you please – but no tree. And for the Beaver himself I will bring
                  you down a portrait from London. The animal is a beautiful animal, &amp; his tail so ridiculously
                  convenient that it looks exactly as if he had bespoken it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I thought to have been in London by this time, &amp; am vexed to be thus delayed in daily
               expectation. it keeps one on the fret or the fidgets, &amp; half unfits me for doing anything.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will grieve &amp; groan for a burro here, we have fine things enough from the windows,
               but to get at them a long way &amp; not a pleasant one. In our direction I can shorten
               the disagreable in a way which would not be quite so convenient for you – by doffing
               shoe &amp; stocking &amp; fording the Greta at the bottom of the orchard. To boat it is dearer
               than coaching in London &amp; less convenient. however by good fortune the finest river
               scenery lies within two miles of the house – &amp; not a tourist has ever heard of it.
               You will delight in the Greta, &amp; curse the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WatsonRichardBishopLlandaff">Bishop of Llandaff</a> for cutting down its woods.</p>
            <p class="indent1">What you say of the difficulty or impossibility of getting decent design, if you bespeak
               them of a trade artist I know well. – &amp; that makes me the more desirous to have as
               little to do with them as possible. If you can manage the scenery, we may trust a
               Londoner to insert a figure, introduced solely to exhibit dress, or armour, or arms,
               not for any passion – or interesting part of the poem – for that would inevitably
               be ruined. And the scenery it is very certain you can manage.</p>
