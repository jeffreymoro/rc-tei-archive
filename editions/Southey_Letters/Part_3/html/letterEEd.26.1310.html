                  that from that time I took care to shun him. he died of a frenzy fever, &amp; I understand

                  of throwing him quite into the circle of my friends in London. I sometimes think with
                  wonder how few acquaintances I made at Oxford; – except yourself &amp; Burnett not one
                  whom I should feel any real pleasure in meeting. Of all the months in my life (happily
                  they did not amount to years) those which were passed at Oxford were the most insufferable.
                  What Greek I took there I literally left there, &amp; could not help losing &amp; <span class="strikethrough">the only thing</span> &lt;all&gt; that I learnt was a little swimming (very little the worse luck) &amp; a little
                  boating, which is very greatly improved, now that I have a boat of my own upon this
                  delightful lake. I never remember to have dreamt of Oxford, – a sore proof of how
