            <p class="indent1">These are the provinces which have asked assistance; but there is probably a French
               force at Ferrol, which may, for awhile, keep part of Galicia in awe. The people are
               a hardy race, and most of them good shots, because there are no game laws, plenty
               of game, and wolves in the country. Probably every man has his gun. One hardly dares
               indulge a hope; but if Europe is to be redeemed in our days, you know it has always
               been my opinion that the work of deliverance would begin in Spain. And now that its
               unhappy government has committed suicide, the Spaniards have got rid of their worst
               enemy.</p>

                  and soldiers quartered upon them, who behave with their accustomed insolence and brutality.
                  The ladies of one family very naturally, upon the intrusion of these unwelcome guests,
                  retired to their own apartments, where they proposed remaining; but these civilised
                  Frenchmen required their presence, and would admit of no excuse. <span class="ital">Il faut que les dames viennent</span> was the only reply which they made;

                  </div> and of course the women were compelled to be subject to their ribaldry and impertinence.
                  Whole families of the middling class are seen begging at the corners of the streets;
                  and women, who had till now borne an unblemished reputation, prostitute themselves
                  publicly to gain wherewithal to buy bread. The soldiers and the flower of the peasantry
                  are sent to recruit the French armies in distant parts.’ Nothing can exceed the misery
                  and the despondency of the people.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Were I minister, I would send half the regular army without delay to Spain; the distance
               is nothing, – a week; would be but an average passage; and these seas are not like
               the German Ocean, where so many brave men have been sacrificed in useless expeditions
               during stormy seasons.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Of public affairs enough! We have had a bilious fever in the house, which was epidemic
               among the children of the place. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</a> has suffered severely from it; I thought we should lose him. The disease has reduced
               him very much, and left him in a state of great debility. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> is scarcely ever without some kind of infectious fever, generally among the children.
               When these things get into a dirty house, they hardly ever get out of it; and I attribute
               this more to the want of cleanliness than to the climate. But ague is beginning to
               re-appear, which had scarcely been heard of during the last generation; – this is
               the case over the whole kingdom, I believe. What put a stop to it then, or what brought
               it back now, is beyond the reach of our present knowledge. You love the science of
               physic; and Nature, who seems to have meant you for half a dozen different things
               when she made you, meant you for a physician among the rest. I will tell you, therefore,
               two odd peculiarities of my constitution; the slightest dose of laudanum acts upon
               me as an aperient; – if I am at any time exposed to the sun bareheaded for two minutes,
               I infallibly take cold. This probably shows how soon I should be subject to a stroke
               of the sun, and indicates the same over-susceptibility which the nitrous oxide did,
               a smaller dose affecting me than any other person who ever breathed it.</p>

                  </div> since my return: its story is precisely as you stated it, and in the story the wonder
                  lies. Are we not apt to do with these things as naturalists do with insects? – put
                  them in a microscope, and exclaim how beautiful! – how wonderful! – how grand! – when
                  all the beauty and all the grandeur are owing to the magnifying medium? A shaping
                  mind receives the story of the play and makes it <span class="ital">terrific</span>; – in Calderon it is <span class="ital">extravagant</span>. The machinery is certainly most extraordinary; and most extraordinary must the state
                  of public opinion be, where such machinery could be received with the complacency
                  of perfect faith, – as undoubtedly this was, and would be still in Spain.</p>

                  contains such a collection of foreign literature. My Cid will be published in about

               this in a commonwealth than in a monarchy would be reason enough for preferring that
               form of government were there no other. Portugal loses something in importance and
               in feeling by being incorporated in the Spanish monarchy; it would preserve its old
               dignity by uniting in a federal republic, – a form which the circumstances of Spain
               more especially require, and its provincial difference of laws and dialects. Each
               province should have its own cortes, and the general congress meet at Madrid, – otherwise,
               that city would soon waste away. No nation has ever had a fairer opportunity for reforming
               its government and modelling it anew. But I dare say this wretched cabinet will be
               meddling too much in this, and too little in the desperate struggle which must be
               made; – that we shall send tardy and inefficient aid – enough to draw on a heavier
               French force, and. not enough to resist the additional force which it will occasion.</p>
