            <p class="indent1">The story of my unhappy brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward Southey</a> (his name is not Tyler) is very different from what he has stated to it to me in
               his letter accompanying yours, &amp; doubtless from what he had made it appear to you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">From the time he was capable of learning he was placed in the most favourable situations
               – first at the Grammar School <span class="strikethrough">at</span> &lt;in&gt; Bristol – then at the one <span class="strikethrough">at</span> &lt;in&gt; Birmingham, – lastly under a Clergyman at Bristol, – &amp; at every place it was
               absolutely impossible to make him attend to <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> any thing. In 1803 he determined to go to sea. I was then at Bristol, &amp; strongly
               dissuaded him; no dissuasions were of any avail. go he would, &amp; he was warned by me
               most earnestly that this step once taken was irrevocable, for he had no friends who
               could afford the expence of any change of plan. – I could do little for him – as will
               appear in the sequel of this letter, – he however rigged for sea at the eventual expence
               of his maternal <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">Uncle M<sup>r</sup> Hill</a> of Lisbon – the father of us all – a berth <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> found for him, the last time I saw him was in August of that year, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">my first child</a> was then lying dead. – I gave him five guineas &amp; bade him remember that if he did
               his duty I would do all that it was possible for me to do to serve him, but again
               bade him remember that I would never rob myself of necessaries to support any folly.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>In October came a letter from him telling me that he had left his ship – &amp; was in
                  a Gentlemans house at Exeter (M<sup>r</sup> Foster Barham
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>John Foster Barham (1763–1822).</span></div>
                  </div>) – waiting my determination what he should do. The fault he laid upon his <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Aunt Miss Tyler</a> (of whom it would be necessary to make you understand her character to say more than
                  a letter can hold, – suffice it that the only excuse to be made for her is to suppose
                  her – as I verily do – insane) – &amp; he expressed a readiness to obey my advice. I wrote
                  that nothing else was to be done but to return to sea, the expence of his fitting
                  out having been incurred, &amp; at the same &lt;time&gt; took measures for obtaining him another
                  ship. His answer told me that all his uniforms &amp;c had been sold to a travelling Jew.
                  The same post which brought this provoking letter brought me a draft for about 15£
                  I think – for a taylors bill at Exeter, – the next day came another from a Gun Smith,
                  – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> a third from an alehouse – or brothel at Plymouth. These I instantly returned. When
                  I come to state <span class="strikethrough">in such</span> my own circumstances you will perceive that there was no alternative between involving
                  myself in debt or leaving him to what he deserved, – &amp; you will already perceive that
                  had I begun answering such drafts there would <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> have been no end to them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Well he found his way from Exeter into Herefordshire to a friend of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">my Uncle</a>, who took lodgings for him, got him &lt;a&gt; a mathematical teacher &amp; wrote to me to get
                  him another ship. Then his bills followed him &amp; were discharged by my Uncle, amounting
                  with his expences there &amp; of a refitment for sea to above 190£. I procured an appointment
                  for him (no easy thing in these times – especially for one who had left the service)
                  – &amp; to Plymouth he went. The next news was that he had left this situation also –
                  had gone to Taunton <span class="strikethrough">&amp; there</span> to my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">fathers elder brother</a>, a man of large fortune &amp; strange character, but finding him in town had written
                  to him &amp; receive an answer bidding him <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> go to his house &amp; stay till his return – a wonderful act of kindness in him, &amp; certainly
                  indicating a disposition to do more. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> immediately ordered in a new assortment of bills to this <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;Uncle&gt;, which so irritated the old man that he turned him out of doors. He now went
                  to Bristol to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunt</a>, – &amp; I heard nothing more till <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> informed me that he had reached Lisbon in a merchant ship from Bristol, sent by her. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">M<sup>r</sup> Hill</a> I mean by my Uncle – he being the only relation who has ever demeaned himself as such
                  towards us, &amp; &lt;he&gt; is in truth one of the most admirable of men. He spoke of him with
                  bitterness very unusual in him, &amp; added that if he <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> could not be kept in the navy he would come to the Gallows. I should tell you that
                  in 1799 I predicted in the bitterness of my heart that he would turn strolling player,
                  – &amp; that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> having seen him in 1800 felt deeply convinced no good could ever come of him. At Lisbon
                  he was once more shipped in the Egyptienne,

            <p class="indent1">There was <span class="strikethrough">an</span> a Lady of some rank &amp; interest who he thought could push him in the army. She was
               a Roman Catholick, – what did he do to win her favour – but turn Roman Catholick with
               all due forms. On the Good Friday of last year I know a person who saw him take the
               sacrament at the Catholick altar! – My eye was never off him, – whatever he did at
               this time I knew: &amp; he left the regiment because <span class="strikethrough">he had</span> having charge of the French prisoners he had sold some of these &lt;prisoners&gt; provisions
               &amp; taken the money – The Colonel very humanely permitted him to resign – He took horse
               from Bristol from a livery stable, – which horse was seized at Taunton for an old
               debt contracted at the inn, – &amp; for this he is still liable to arrest: He went to

                  have ever yet increased this income to more than 300£. I write as much as any clerk
                  in an attorneys office, – but it is only half my time which I devote to writing for
                  bread, – the other is given for worthier pursuits, on which to build an everlasting
                  reputation, &amp; by which to do my duty in the world by contributing to the stock of
                  knowledge therein. Hereafter this will prove the best worldly policy, – at present
                  all I have is as you may perceive little enough for a married man with a growing family.
                  I have two other brothers – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">the one is at sea</a>, – there is not a braver <span class="strikethrough">nor a</span> &lt;or&gt; better officer, <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx xxx</span> for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">the other</a> I have done much – even to contracting debt for – &amp; having found friends for him who

                  without any exception, one of the very finest &amp; most promising young men living. For
                  both of these brothers my house whenever they have been able to make it so has been
                  a home, – &amp; for the last three years the younger has annually spent five months with

            <p class="indent1">Now Lightfoot the sum of all this is that it is not <span class="strikethrough">impossible</span> possible I can supply the money necessary to place <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> in any situation whatever: &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> if I could assuredly I would not, because it is my firm belief from the thorough
               knowledge I have of him, that the same misconduct would be repeated. Dear Lightfoot
               there &lt;are&gt; insanities &amp; disorders <span class="ital">of heart</span> – as well as of <span class="ital">intellect</span>, – &amp; defects in our <span class="ital">moral</span> being as well as in our <span class="ital">physical</span>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> was born without the sense of shame – from his childhood he has taken a delight in
               deceiving others, &amp; the wonderful talents with which he has been gifted have unfortunately
               <span class="strikethrough">have</span> been applied to this purpose – the whole life, wherever he has been, has been one
               continuous deception, – &amp; he has always imposed upon every body, first for sport,
               &amp; latterly for worse purposes. It is his own fault that he is not now at Oxford –
               whither <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> would have sent him, – that he is not in the navy – that he is not in the army. He
               is now fit for nothing but what he is: nor would it be possible to place him in any
               office of trust, – after what has past. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</a> is no more able to assist him than I am, he being already embarrassed by the expence
