                  to introduce the Chronicle, by giving the reader a summary view of the previous history
                  &amp; existing state of Spain. The Chronicle is well done &amp; the translation improves so
                  much on the original, by incorporating matter from other sources, as to be unique
                  in its kind. There is a good deal of miscellaneous matter brought together in the
