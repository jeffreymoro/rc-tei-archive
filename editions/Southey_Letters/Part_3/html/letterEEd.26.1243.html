               <p>The inclosed letters reached me. one by this evening, the other by last nights post.
                  I know not what better to do, than to thus immediately transmit them to you. The state
                  of Brazil has I know been the particular object of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my uncles</a> researches for very many years. I know little about it, having left it (unluckily
                  as it now seems) for the last part of my historical labours

                  </div> – as it would be in its natural order. However I can <span class="strikethrough">make out</span> examine the papers &amp; make any report from them which <span class="strikethrough">x</span> may be of present utility; if the said information be required – I will pack them
                  off for Lisbon &amp; myself with them in the month of April – &amp; come back with a great
                  work upon Brazil

                           papers sent him by Hill and stored by Rickman. Southey wished Wynn to use his position
                           as Under Secretary of State in the Home Office to ascertain whether the government
                           might provide him support during the preparation of a work likely to provide it with
                           useful information in the new political situation; see Southey to John Rickman, 23
