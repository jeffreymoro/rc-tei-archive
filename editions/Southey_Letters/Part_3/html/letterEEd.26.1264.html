               <p>I have an influenza upon me – which however I hope is going off. Our weather is very
                  uncommon &amp; very unwholesome. Not a flake of snow has fallen in the valley this whole
                  winter till Wednesday last, it <span class="strikethrough">then</span> just enough to swear by which thawed as it fell – the grass has continued to grow
                  – the cattle have not &lt;yet&gt; been housed nor <span class="strikethrough">fed with hay</span> &lt;foddered&gt;, The primroses and polyanthuses are in a sort of abortive blossom &amp; at
                  Christmas the daffodils were as forward as they usually are at the end of February.
                  The saying of this country is that an open Xmas makes a fat Churchyard, &amp; in fact
                  contagious fevers are rife in the neighbourhood. – Yesterday I was laid up &amp; have
                  only been able to take my pen this evening – If it had not been for this delay Espriella
