            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker/ at Mrs Simpsons / Ambleside [The wife of Joseph Sympson
               (dates unknown) of Ambleside, the family with whom the Wordsworths were most intimate.
               Sympson was the Vicar of Wythburn, and their house, called High Broad Rain, was half-way
               up the Dunmail Raise Road. Mary Moorman, <em>William Wordsworth: The Early Years</em> (Oxford, 1957), p. 469.]<br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, ‘The Letters of Robert

            <p class="indent1">The inclosed came in a frank directed to me – not looking at the interior address
               I took it for a shepistle from you, instead of a hepistle to you – &amp; opened it but
               as it begins Dear Mary – knowing that my name was not Mary I proceeded no farther,
               &amp; resealed it in the clumsy manner you see. I meant to have sent it to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</a> – thinking as my name was on the inside of the frank that you had sent a letter to
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir E.</a> for me – &amp; that he had by mistake franked back my letter to you, &amp; sent yours to
