                  </div> what intelligence I should receive respecting you this evening! – &amp; strangely deficient
                  must you have supposed me to be in the common duties of friendship, finding me silent
                  on such an occasion. I cannot forgive <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a>, for leaving me, till now, in ignorance.</p>

               <p>God be praised that the trial with which He has been pleased to visit you, heavy as
                  it is, is the lightest of all others for a wise man. Absolute want, the want of the
                  necessaries of life, is indeed of all evils the greatest; but, when decent comforts
                  are left, how much better can all beyond these be spared than health, or friend, or
                  child?

                  </div> To you, I trust, this is but a transient and recoverable loss; the hurricane has stript
                  away blossom and fruit and leaf, but the tree is standing, and will put forth its
                  buds again. My brother tells me your spirits are as I should expect them to be. Assuredly,
                  no man ever employed wealth better; and I have something like <span class="ital">a faith</span>, that one who has employed it so well, will be intrusted with it again.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My debt to you shall certainly be discharged in the course of the ensuing year. I
               explained the state of my affairs in my yesterday’s letter. I have now only to add
               that, having this additional motive for exertion, I will make such arrangements, when
               next in London, as shall secure the performance of this duty.</p>

                  </div> you will, I hope, consider and reconsider the matter well before you resolve upon
                  removing to that country. I do not say this merely from personal feelings, and the
                  pain which it would give me to have you at such a distance; but the stability of his
                  government, in case of such an event, is to be doubted. It appears that the Brazilians
                  are blind enough to their own interests to prefer the French to us. This prejudice
                  must needs be heightened by their dreadful bigotry and if they find themselves burthened
                  with the expenses of a court, which is not very likely to be under the direction of
                  wise ministers, no change which could take place would surprise me. There is another
                  personal consideration which influenced me much, when it was intimated to me, some
                  two years ago, that I, perhaps, might see South America; this is, the miserable state
                  of medical science in that country. To a single man this should not be of weight sufficient
                  to set against any material prospect of advantage; but to those who, like you and
                  I, are fathers and husbands, it should seem to outweigh everything. Good as the climate
                  of Brazil is, an English constitution does not adapt itself to so great a change without
                  some risk; and, bad as the native physicians are, it will require many years of experience
                  to make English practitioners better.</p>

                  a considerable bend out of my road to Bristol for the sake of going there. Should
                  you be at Hale, that will be motive enough to lead me there. Remember me very kindly
