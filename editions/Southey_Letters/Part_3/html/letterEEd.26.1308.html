               &amp; in the next place the moment it in his hands he considers it to all intents &amp; purposes
               as his own, &amp; makes no scruple of bescrawling it, of giving it away, – in-short of
               doing any thing with it, – except taking care of it &amp; returning it to its owner. –
               Perhaps I am too late, – but at any rate as soon as you can, set a man to box them
               up, &amp; ship them off to me, – all except the box of German books, which may remain
               with the other articles where it is, being well secured: – the glass &amp; china only
               may come with the books.</p>

               <p>One box I would have sent by waggon containing the two Mss volumes – which will come

                  see that they are forwarded either to Whitehaven or Workington, it matters not which.
                  It is now a good time of year for the coast, – you will let me know the number of
                  packing cases &amp;c; – &amp; this – Dear Charles – is the last trouble you will have with
                  this, hitherto, unlucky library, – which is now thank Heaven about to be of some use,
                  &amp; to find its resting place. – I dare say you are little pleased at my settling here;
                  – yet every body else (except perhaps <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> ) sees the fitness of the situation; &amp; I think if you consider above all things, &amp;
                  above all what the expence of removal &amp; furnishing a house would be, &amp; how little
                  able I am to meet the expence, you will see not only that I have chosen wisely, –
                  but that in fact I could not have chosen otherwise. – So do not take this last trouble
                  with an unwilling spirit, – but think rather what a joy it will be to me to see all
                  my books about me, &amp; to feel myself settled also – for be sure that tho I am, God
                  be thanked, a chearful man under all circumstances, I shall be a happier one when
                  all disquieting thoughts of uncertainty &amp; unsettledness are thus removed.</p>

               I will make Bristol in my way there or back, – which indeed may conveniently be done
               – for the sake of halting at Liverpool, &amp; afterwards at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Teddesley">Penkridge</a> with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BarkerMary">Miss Barker</a>. My first journey will be in the close of this year, &amp; then I promise you a visit
