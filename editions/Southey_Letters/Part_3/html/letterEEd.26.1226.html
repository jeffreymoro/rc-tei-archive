            <p class="indent1">You will be glad to hear that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">my child</a> proves to be of the more worthy gender, – he is as stout-limbed &amp; as strong-voiced
               as I could wish him. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> going on excellently well. The boy was born a quarter after six in the morning, the

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I would do a good deal to please poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TobinJamesWebbe">Tobin</a> (– indeed it is doing a good deal to let him inflict an argument upon me –) but to
                  write an epilogue is doing too much for any body.

                  </div> Indeed were I ever so well disposed to misemploy him; paper &amp; rhymes, it would be
                  as much out of my reach as the moon is, &amp; I bless my stars for the incapacity, – believing
                  that a man who can do such things well cannot do anything better. I am also thoroughly
                  busy. Summer is my holyday season, in which I lay in a store of exercise to serve
                  me for the winter, &amp; leave myself as it were lying fallow to the influencies of heaven.
                  I am now very hard at Palmerin,

                  produce me one penny more than if I had reprinted it with all its imperfections on
                  its head, the good conscience with which it is done reconciles me to <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> the loss of time – &amp; I have moreover such a true love of romance that the labour is

                  sized black letter – is a days work, that is from breakfast till dinner, allowing
                  an hours walk, &amp; from tea till supper. &amp; the whole is about sixty sheets.</p>
