               <p>Your little volume has given me much pleasure <span class="strikethrough">and</span> &amp; much hope. it is scarcely possible that so young a writer should write better &amp;
                  if you live to enjoy that fame which you have talents to command, tho you may regard
                  all the other pieces as juvenile composition, you will always remember the <span class="ital">Ode &lt;to&gt; the Rosemary</span> with satisfaction &amp; pride.

                  </div> In saying this much I speak the opinion of <span class="ital"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Wordsworth</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">M<sup>r</sup> Coleridge</a> as well as my own</span>.</p>

               or public commendation. If you have friends who would bestir themselves would it not
               be possible to raise such a subscription for a Second volume as might enable you to
               graduate &amp; take orders – that appearing to be your wish. Under any other circumstances
               it would be bad advice to advise you to publish. a young poet <span class="strikethrough">whatever</span> cannot write too much. but if he be indeed a poet whatever he has written will dissatisfy
               him as his understanding &amp; his taste improve. Your situ<span class="strikethrough">i</span>ation renders this common rule <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> of prudence inapplicable. The interest which I possess is but very little – very
               little indeed. <span class="strikethrough">shuch</span> such however as it is it should be willingly &amp; warmly exerted. I would recommend
               a half-guinea volume as probably more productive than one of heavier price. most likely
               you have plenty of materials – if not you can produce them easily before the subscription-list
               be sufficiently full. If you think the experiment worth trial (&amp; it may be made without
               cost) I shall gratify my feelings &amp; discharge my duty at the same time by endeavouring
               to assist it.</p>
