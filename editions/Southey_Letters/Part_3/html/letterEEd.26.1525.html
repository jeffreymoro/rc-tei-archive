               <div class="l">Seems overcharged with sweets, to stagnate there.</div>

               <div class="l">He takes the axe of sacrifice.</div><br><div class="l">That instant from the crowd a man sprang out</div>
               <div class="l">To lay upon the steed his hand profane.</div>
               <div class="l">A thousand archers drew at him their bows</div>
               <div class="l">And with their shower of arrows filld the sky.</div>

               <div class="l">He bears a charmed life which may defy</div>
               <div class="l">All weapons, &amp; the darts that round him fly,</div>

               <div class="l">And madmans gesture gallop round &amp; round.</div><br><div class="l">They seize, they drag him to the Rajahs feet.</div>
               <div class="l">What doom will now be his? what vengeance meet</div>
               <div class="l">Will he who knows no mercy now require?</div>
               <div class="l">The obsequious guards around with blood-hound eye</div>
               <div class="l">Look for the word, in slow-consuming fire</div>
               <div class="l">By piece meal death to make the wretch expire,</div>
               <div class="l">Or hoist his living carcase hookd on high,</div>
               <div class="l">To feed the fowls &amp; insects of the sky;</div>
               <div class="l">Or if aught worse inventive cruelty </div>

               <div class="l">Might prompt, accursed instruments they stand</div>
               <div class="l">To work the wicked will with wicked hand.</div>
               <div class="l">Far other thoughts were in the multitude,</div>
               <div class="l">Pity &amp; human feelings held them still;</div>
               <div class="l">And stifled sighs &amp; groans supprest were there,</div>
               <div class="l">And many a secret curse &amp; inward prayer</div>
               <div class="l">Calld on the insulted Gods to save mankind.</div>
               <div class="l">Expecting some new crime in fear they stood,</div>
               <div class="l">Some horror which would make the natural blood</div>
               <div class="l">Start; with cold shudderings thrill the sinking heart,</div>
               <div class="l">Whiten the lip, &amp; make the abhorrent eye</div>
               <div class="l">Roll back &amp; close, prest in for agony.</div>
               <div class="l">How then fared he for whom the mighty crowd</div>
               <div class="l">Suffered in spirit thus? – how then fared he? –</div>
               <div class="l">A ghastly smile was on his lip, his eye</div>
               <div class="l">Glared with a ghastly hope as he drew nigh</div>
               <div class="l">And cried aloud, yes Rajah, – it is I, –</div>
               <div class="l">And wilt thou kill me now?</div>
               <div class="l">The countenance of the Almighty Man</div>
               <div class="l">Fell when he knew Ladurlad, &amp; his brow</div>
               <div class="l">Was clouded with despite as one asham’d.</div>
               <div class="l">That wretch again! indignant he exclaimd;</div>
               <div class="l">And smote his forehead, &amp; stood silently</div>
               <div class="l">Awhile in wrath. Then with a savage smile,</div>
               <div class="l">Let him go free! he cried; he hath his curse,</div>
               <div class="l">And vengeance upon him can wreck no worse.</div>
               <div class="l">But ye who let him do it, – tremble ye!</div><br><div class="l">He bade the archers pile their weapons there,</div>
               <div class="l">No manly courage filled the slavish band</div>
               <div class="l">No sweetening vengeance roused a brave despair.</div>
               <div class="l">He called his horsemen then &amp; gave command</div>
               <div class="l">To hem the offenders in &amp; hew them down.</div>
               <div class="l">Ten thousand scymetars at once upreard</div>
               <div class="l">Flash up, like waters flowing to the sun</div>
               <div class="l">A second time the fatal brands appear’d</div>
               <div class="l">Lifted aloft, – they glitterd then no more,</div>
               <div class="l">Their light was gone; their splendour quenchd &lt;in gore.&gt;</div>

                  dare say be utterly uninteresting in its story to 999 readers out of a thousand. If
                  I had not felt this, the poem would in all likelihood have been finished seven years
                  ago, – but this feeling I had, – it prevented me from going on with the fragment,
                  – &amp; the fragment prevented me from beginning any thing else. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<sup>m</sup> Taylor</a> said as you say, – let it drop. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> was the only person who said go on; the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SharpRichard">River Sharpe</a> thought it was very extraordinary &amp; liked it, – but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</a> turnd the scale in its favour. – I am half way thro, &amp; will finish it if it be only
