                  if it were not for the too frequent good luck he had of picking up fish &amp; fowl I should
                  very readily acquit him of any thing more than common Methodist trade roguery. It
                  is very practicable for a preacher to live by Faith if he can but convince his congregation
                  of it. The book will <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> supply me with a good letter, it is a very curious production, &amp; certainly has merit
                  of its own. Did I tell you that when last in London I went with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> to hear him? he is a fat, dew-lapped velvet-voiced old man; who instead of straining
                  himself by speaking loud, enforces what he has to say more easily by a significant
                  nod of the head. His congregation had quite a physiognomy of their own: sallow, dismal
                  people, – looking as if they were already so near the fire &amp; brimstone that it had
                  coloured their complections. I mean to go to all the curious meeting houses in London
                  when next there in company with D. Manuel.

                  &amp; prepare Germany for revolution is to be regarded as favourable to the ultimate improvement
                  of Europe. anything which weakens Austria is also desirable – &amp; any thing which strengthens
                  the new kingdom of Italy. Bonaparte will hold all together while he lives, &amp; thinks
                  by family connections to keep afterwards in alliance, what he cannot consolidate with
                  France. His successors will be on a par with common princes – his generals will die
                  off – Germany &amp; Spain in their turn will be regenerated by revolutions, &amp; France be
                  again what it was under the latter Bourbons. The great French generals are children
                  of the Revolution. – which will have no grandchildren – under an Empire there will
                  be the same system of family-connections, interest, &amp; corruption, which has reduced
