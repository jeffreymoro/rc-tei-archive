                           was involved in the capture of many French and Spanish warships. In 1807, command
                           passed to Captain George Miller (dates unknown). According to a letter to Mary Barker,
                           the ship was ‘so miserably manned’ that Thomas was ‘almost worn out with duty’; see
                           Southey to Mary Barker, 4 February 1807, Letter 1273.</span></div>

            <p class="indent1">Your letters have left a weight upon my mind whenever I think of you; – &amp; in the heavy
               gale of Saturday &lt;night&gt; last I think it was (the 21<sup>st</sup>) – when the wind waked me <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxxx</span> I did nothing but think of you &amp; dream of you by turns. The days however are lengthening,
               &amp; you sure at least of soon getting a Master, if not more hands. My best hopes are
               that you may soon be made, – &amp; yet not have interest enough to get a ship immediately
               – so as to have a few months here among the mountains, &amp; a few fine weather cruises
               on the Lake. We are going to do wonders this summer. Some arrangements of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> rendered it necessary that I should either fix upon quitting this place – or retaining
               <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#GretaHall">the house</a> – this last suited me best, &amp; my mind is made up to continue here indefinitely –
               indeed I know not what could ever induce me to leave this country, unless it were
               to return to Lisbon, for the longer I stay the better I like it. Oh that you could
               see it in snow &amp; sunshine! &amp; in snow &amp; moonlight! – it is even more beautiful than
               in the finest autumnal evening. – We are going to paper the parlour with cartridge
               paper, to have the abominable curtains there died a deep blue, &amp; to fringe them. To
               buy a carpet &amp; white curtains for my study – which is of course to be ceiled &amp; plastered
               – &amp; to have my books round by the sea. The outside of the house is to be finished.
               the walk up the garden is gravelling at this time, with such gravel &amp;c as is to be
               got – which is the soil of the river. &amp; I mean to plant some trees which will shut
               out the lower end of the town, if not in my time, in somebody elses. Every thing is
               to be made decent, &amp; my study beautiful. Think of the joy it will be to arrange my
               books, &amp; see them all together, &amp; worship them every day!</p>

               of Dundonald (1775–1860; <em>DNB</em>), under whom she was involved in the capture of many French and Spanish warships.
               In 1807, command passed to Captain George Miller (dates unknown). According to a letter
