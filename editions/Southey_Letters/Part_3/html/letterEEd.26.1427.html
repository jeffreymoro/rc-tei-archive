                  read enough to show you that Catholic writers defend the punishment of heretics, and
                  quite sufficient to make your blood run cold. I have the History of the Portuguese
                  Inquisition to write, and look on to the task with absolute horror. I am decidedly

                  I am a bad trading author, and doomed always to be so, but it is not the bookseller’s
                  fault; the public do not buy poetry unless it be made fashionable; mine gets reviewed
                  by enemies who are always more active than friends; one reviewer envies me, another
                  hates me, and a third tries his hand upon me as fair game. Thousands meantime read
                  the books; but they borrow them, even those persons who are what they call my friends,
                  and who know that I live by these books, never buy them themselves, and then wonder
                  that they do not sell. Espriella
