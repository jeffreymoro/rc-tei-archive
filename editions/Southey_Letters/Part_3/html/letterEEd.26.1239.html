                  </div> I felt an inclination to follow them, which arose more from curiosity than from any
                  wiser motive. On cooler reflection South America seems an unfit place for me. I should
                  be afraid to carry my family to a country where none of the comforts of Europe are
                  to be found, &amp; few even of the decencies; &amp; to go without them for any length of time,
                  is out of the question. Books supply the want of society to me sufficiently. But how
                  it would be where I should have neither, I cannot say. This however is comparatively
                  of little importance, – amusement &amp; occupation may be found everywhere by one who
                  knows where to look for them. But my employments would be disturbed – it would be
                  impossible to carry a library with me, there will be none there. – &amp; to suspend my
                  history for some years would be every way disadvantageous. – <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> were I to die what I have done would be of little value, – as little as that of the
                  materials of a great house compared to the finished building. I am not made of very
                  lasting stuff – a warmer climate than this is certainly desirable for one who has
                  a better chance of inheriting consumption than of succeeding to any other inheritance,
                  – but perhaps the disorders to which Europeans are subject in a climate so totally
                  different as that of S America from their own, the ignorance of the native physicians.
                  &amp; the inexperience of any of our own who might be there, more than counterbalance
                  any advantage which could be derived from southern sunshine. I wish you would talk
                  this over with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a>, – my present opinion is that unless I could go either to Portugal or Holland, it
                  is better that I should remain in England, –but I will do whatever you may think best.
                  You perhaps have an ambition for me which I do not feel for myself. I have no wish
                  for any other rank in society than what literature can give me. Could I chuse my own
                  fortune it should be to have the place of Historiographer created for me,
