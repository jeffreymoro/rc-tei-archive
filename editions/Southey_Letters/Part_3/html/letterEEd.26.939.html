            <p class="indent1">This evening my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> I leave Liverpool at six &amp; hope to be in London rather before the same hour on Sunday,
               tho in case of my feeling so disposed they allow me to stop four and twenty hours
               any where upon the road. I write from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Kosters</a> desk. Harriet I have not seen for she is confined by the ear ache to which she is
               subject. Charlotte looks alarmingly thin tho with no known complaint but for this
               I should say she is wonderfully improved, for her face is become strikingly fine.
               I was somewhat shocked to find they had lost their finest boy – Tom whom you must
               remember. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterMrs">Mrs K</a> has two born since her arrival in England.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Paper is too dear here &amp; may be bought better in London, for as it comes from London
               they charge of course the difference of carriage, besides their own profit. Beg your
               sister to let <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> know that the Merchant well remembered having his book, but could not remember what
               was become of it. I have desired him, if he finds it, to send it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KosterJohnTheodore">Koster</a> where it will be safe, if it comes too late for me, &amp; will travel to Keswick when
               he himself visits the Lakes.</p>
