               <p>After writing my last hasty epistolet, I set off with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> for S<sup>t</sup> Mary Cray.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A village to the southeast of London; home of Peter Elmsley.</span></div>
                  </div> We were told it was twelve miles distant, so we walked, while his servant went by
                  the stage like a gentleman, &amp; carried what little luggage we wanted. In spite of a
                  severe east wind blowing always either in our teeth or our ears, &amp; of occasional show
                  showers we had on the whole a pleasant walk. The view of Greenwich &amp; Maize Hill <span class="strikethrough">which</span> on our left was exceedingly striking, – masts &amp; towers, – houses &amp; gravel clifts,
                  – there wanted only <span class="strikethrough">ver</span> summer verdure for the gardens &amp; trees, &amp; sunshine which would have made an incumbent
                  atmosphere of smoke beautiful. We very soon got into an unfrequented road, where even
                  fewer travellers were to be met than I have seen between <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Ambleside">Ambleside</a>, when the laking season is over, &amp; the country left to its own inhabitants. From
                  time to time we had fine rich, woody inland views, – of that character which is peculiar
                  to Kent. There is a greater appearance of general comfort in this county than in any
                  other, – the cause is probably to be found in the old <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> british law of gavel-kind,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> which is retained here &amp; here only, &amp; which has necessarily prevented the formation
                  of great estates, &amp; (what <span class="strikethrough">would</span> might not have been so much expected) has also preservd old families in the possession
                  of small but independant estates. Hence there is less riches, less poverty, more industry
                  &amp; more comfort.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The distance proved to be 15 miles instead of 12. The last three, we complained of
               as an imposition, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">but</span> like other impositions we would not have submitted to it, – if it could have been
               helped. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> has got into a comfortable old house, built about a hundred years ago. His garden
               communicates with the church yard, &amp; the river Cray flows thro it, immediately under
               the dining room window. That river would be very beautiful if it were not bricked
               up with formal banks, &amp; its bed defiled with the filth of the village, potshards,
               a dead dog or two – <span class="strikethrough">all xxxxx</span> no ornaments to a stream of clear water which is nowhere above three feet deep. When
               the weather is warm enough <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> means to send in boys to clean it, &amp; then to keep it clean by a grating where it
               enters his premises, small enough to stop such nuisances, &amp; not so small as to shut
               out the fine trout, which at present look as if they had no business in so denaturalized
               a brook,. There are paper mills just above &amp; below, – near enough to be heard, but
               not unpleasantly. He has two nephews &amp; two nieces with their mother, living with him,
               &amp; I believe wholly dependant on him. The eldest is a boy of eight years, the youngest
               a girl of four, – fine, good-humoured children, always disposed to laugh &amp; romp, –
               but without the least shyness at the sight of strangers.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The post – &amp; your letter. – I have escaped some uneasiness by being out of the way
               during <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Ediths</a> feverish attack, – &amp; yet I wish I had been there to have <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> eased you of some part of the nights trouble. How is it that you have not mentioned
               the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">little one</a><span class="strikethrough">in</span>? – not a word concerning her!</p>
