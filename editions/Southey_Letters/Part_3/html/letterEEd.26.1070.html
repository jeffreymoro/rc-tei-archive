               <p>Saturday. – I left off &amp; went to bed, sorely indisposed. the truth is that our May
                  is like a West country March. the worst month in the year. my constitution was made
                  for a better climate, &amp; for this last fortnight I have been so unwell as to be unfit
                  for doing any thing. – These sheets I suppose are proofs – that is they were struck
                  off before you had corrected the press. this did not occur to me yesterday. I took
                  them for corrected sheets but as the blunders thickened upon inspection I see how
                  it is. – There is another reason for inserting every body, – the more obscure names
                  we collect, the more curious will the book be for the Collectors &amp; in itself. the
                  Specimens may be as short as you will in bad cases but if they cannot be quite comprised
                  in a single page – it is better to lengthen them a little than to leave so much <span class="ital">fat</span> as at P. 66. You will soon be able to regulate the length of the Specimens by the
                  size of the volumes, which should be about 450 pages each – not more – to correspond
                  with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EllisGeorge">Ellis’s</a>.

                  me calculate – 17 poets in 6 sheets. say 3 to a sheet – 28 sheets to a volume 3 x
                  28 = 84. 84 Poets to a volume – now look to your list &amp; see whether the names be nearest
                  to 168 or 252, – which will determine whether we should shorten the specimens to crowd
                  them into two volumes, or extend them into three. three will sell as well as two,
