                  I am in odd company &amp; not the most congenial, – but far more so than the Edinburgh
                  would have been. For the politics of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffray</a> are to me the more hateful for the mixture of good which now &amp; then appears in them.
                  Both these men are such thoroughly unprincipled politicians that <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx xxxxx</span> the public mind <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> could not be worse guided. They set out <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;with&gt; that precious definition of war which you will remember, – they <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> are now the cowardly advocates for peace. They wrote in defence of the whole system
                  of corruption against <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</a> while their party was in power, &amp; they write Jacobinism as soon as their friends are
                  out again. Cobbett may by possibility not be a rascal because he set out with the
                  worst opinions in the world, &amp; has ever since been getting farther &amp; farther from
                  them. But for these men there is no such saving possibility – they are every thing,
                  or all things – with a view to their own advancement. I thought those articles upon
                  the Conscription, &amp; the Revolutionary Biography could not come from any ordinary works
                  in that Journal. They were in so much wholesomer a stream of thought &amp; feeling, –

               the Central Junta on 4 October 1808 and when the French marched on Madrid he urged
               Sir John Moore (1761–1809; <em>DNB</em>), the Commander of the British forces in northern Spain also to advance upon Madrid,
               despite his inclination to retreat through Portugal. After the disastrous retreat
               to Corunna, Frere was blamed for this advice and recalled by the British government.
               Frere’s correspondence with Moore was published in 1810 in a work entitled <em>To the British Nation is Presented by Colonel Venault de Charmilly, Knight of the
                  Royal and Military Order of St. Louis, the Narrative of his Transactions in Spain
