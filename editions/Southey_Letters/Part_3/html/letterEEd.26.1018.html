               <p>Unless the newspapers lie the expedition to Portugal is resolved upon. I have written

                           career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784–1790. After the controversial Convention
                           of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command the British troops in the Iberian peninsula.
                           He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna. In December 1804 he was sent to review
                           the practicability of defending Portugal from a French invasion. His favourable report
                           was widely leaked to the press, e.g. Aberdeen Journal, 9 January 1805.</span></div>
                  </div> That is to let him know what I wish &amp; why I wish it, which with such a man may possibly
                  have some weight, if he hears of me thro any other channel. It is possible that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John May</a> may find out a way to serve me at Gloucester House.

                  </div> I know he will if he can. But what I do not know is in what direction these things
                  are to be sought. There are many civil appointments attached to such expeditions which
                  would give me comfortable rations, convenient pay, &amp; ample leisure; so as to enable
                  me to do my business there, &amp; return with a few hundreds, &amp; it may be some recommendation
                  to those who dispose of these situations; that I am acquainted with the country &amp;

               <p>However this war with Spain might in its consequences benefit me, I am very sorry
                  that it has been undertaken. As far as I can judge the quarrel appears to have been
                  unnecessarily &amp; ungenerously provoked by us. The capture of the Spanish frigate was
                  an action more becoming Bonaparte than the government of England. It is as hard to
                  go to war with Spain because she pays tribute to France as it would be to hang a man
                  for having been robbed. The feelings of all Europe were coming round to us before
                  this act of aggression.
