                           career. He was also MP for Lanark Burghs 1784–1790. After the controversial Convention
                           of Cintra (1808), Moore was given the command of the British troops in the Iberian
                           peninsula. He was fatally wounded at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. Sir
                           David Baird, 1st Baronet (1757–1829; DNB). Unlike Moore, Baird was not killed, but
                           at the battle of Corruna his left arm was shattered. He never took command in the
                           field again.</span></div>
                  </div> (<span class="strikethrough">for Baird is dead also, this my letters tell me</span>) – The evil arising from <span class="strikethrough">this</span> &lt;his&gt; loss is that it makes a showy story for a Bulletin, – &amp; that it prevents enquiry
                  into the conduct of the retreat. On the other hand the superiority of our men whenever
                  they have met the enemy has been decidedly established &amp; puts us out of all fear of
                  the consequences of invasion.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Our conduct from first to last has been one series of blunders, – in which Moore himself
               has borne a part. I do not despair of Spain, but this I perceive that nothing effectual
               for Spain will be done by this country, &amp; that no good is to be hoped for till we
               have thoroughly regenerated ourselves. I know not where our political Saviour is to
               be looked for, but the Signs of the Times are full. All parties are so despicable
               that party-spirit in the nation has died a natural death, &amp; there is a wholesomer
               feeling in the people of England, than perhaps there ever has been at any former <span class="strikethrough">time</span> period.</p>
