               rather than Lofft, for bringing White’s poetry to notice after the setback of a cruel
               review. On p. 27 of the ‘Account of the Life of H. K. White’ in volume 1 of the 1808
               edition of the <em>Remains</em>, Southey states, ‘It is not unworthy of remark, that this very reviewal, which was
               designed to crush the hopes of Henry, and suppress his struggling genius, has been
               in its consequences, the main occasion of bringing his Remains to light, and obtaining
               for him that fame which assuredly will be his portion. Had it not been for the indignation
               which I felt at perusing a criticism at once so cruel and so stupid, the little intercourse
               between Henry and myself would not have taken place; his papers would probably have
               remained in oblivion, and his name, in a few years, have been forgotten’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
