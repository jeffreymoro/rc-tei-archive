                  </div> I came back on Friday &amp; am going again on Wednesday. Meantime I have uneasiness enough
                  of my own. some symptoms in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">little Edith</a> have alarmed us. as you may suppose we are soon alarmed – &amp; I hope in time. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Our apothecary</a> is a skilful one, &amp; is doing precisely what I should have done upon my own knowledge
                  – he has lanced the gums, blistered behind both ears, &amp; given calomel.

                  </div> this was done yesterday, &amp; to day there seems nothing to excite apprehension, except
                  her usual <span class="ital">unusual</span> spirits when in health, a sort of premature intelligence &amp; excitability which has
                  always made me anxious. What terrified us was that she had for two or three days hung
                  down her head when in the open air, – which to day has not been the case: but there
                  has been no fever, &amp; we can hardly say any costiveness, certainly nothing habitual.
                  We mean to keep <span class="strikethrough">xxx xxx</span> up a discharge at the ears, (which is also expedient because her eyes are subject
                  to frequent weaknesses &amp; inflammations of the upper lids) &amp; to administer calomel
                  every other day. if any fever appears to give digitalis, – &amp; if any heaviness of the
                  head manifest itself – to blister it, so that if the disease be preventable, no effort
                  to prevent it will have been omitted. tell King this that we may have his opinion.
                  She is just getting her two first upper teeth, which we believe are thro, about ten
                  weeks after the two under ones. for her age she is a large child &amp; unusually forward;
                  standing great part of her time alone, &amp; beginning to <span class="strikethrough">spe</span> talk, tho not yet full ten months. There is no bad symptom in her eyes; &amp; she has
                  never seemed heavy within doors, only been very irritable instead of very good natured
                  which is her disposition. she discovers no uneasiness at having her head washed or
                  handled. Indeed if it had not been for that ruinous drooping, &amp; for starting at times
                  – I should not have had any cause for alarm. As you may suppose this hangs upon me
                  – &amp; bears my spirits down, tho I shall not cease to exert &amp; to employ myself.</p>
