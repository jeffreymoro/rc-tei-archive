            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Your letter has answered one which was setting off the very evening it arrived. To
                  see you only for a day or two in London would be, like the preserved-apricot odour
                  of the gorse blossom, a tantalizing pleasure. I will come to you. It is four years
                  since we have seen the light of each other’s countenance. Life has not many such portions,
                  and heaven knows when we shall be within a day’s journey of each other again, for
                  in the autumn I go to Portugal, and cannot tell when I shall return.

                  </div> It suits me to set off in ten days, for the sake of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</a> company on the road, and he cannot delay his departure.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Will it suit you if I should make my appearance on the third or fourth of April? If
               so, I will cross from the north road. Tell me in your answer, if there be any stage
               from Norwich to York or Lincoln, either of which places I should like much to make
               in my way for the sake of the cathedrals.</p>

                  If your scheme should be put in execution, I will furnish you with all in my department,
                  which certainly I will not do for any other person. My seat at the Round Table is
                  resigned, and as they will not send you the books, which would have come to me, this
                  is a dead loss to the Review.</p>
