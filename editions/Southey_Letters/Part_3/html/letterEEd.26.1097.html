            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter has very much affected me – I lose no time in answering it, in the hope
               of suggesting something which may be found useful. For twelvemonths past I have used
               that sort of case-hardening which Franklin calls the air-bath, – rubbing myself every
               morning when I get out of bed with a coarse towel, <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx xxxxxxxx</span> &lt;for five minutes&gt; this <span class="strikethrough">practice</span> &lt;exposure&gt; I believe tends very much to diminish the susceptibility of the body to
               cold. if you are disposed to try <span class="strikethrough">this</span> it begin gradually, &amp; do not expose yourself at first above half a minute. but friction
               either with coarse towels or with the flesh-brush you cannot use too much; – it may
               in great measure supply the want of exercise. – I do not myself believe that sedentary
               habits are so prejudicial to health as they are supposed to be. We know they are not
               in hot climates. Might it not however prevent some of the possible inconveniences
               to which you may be otherwise liable, if you changed your chair once or twice a day,
               – &amp; when <span class="strikethrough">not</span> only employed in conversation – preferred the settee? The increased lameness I hope
               is only for a time, whatever weakens the whole system must necessarily have weakened
               the weakest part. as you get strength this affliction will diminish.</p>
