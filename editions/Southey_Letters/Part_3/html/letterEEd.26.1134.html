                  The only question is whether they offend more persons than they please – for certain
                  it is that what pleases one offends another. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> used to beseech me not to put them at the bottom of the page, for he said he could

                  end I thought all objection obviated. However it is a thing to be considered. I had

                  Thalala is ignorant. The meeting takes place in an Islet on the Lake, so that <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> the people are spectators in boats &amp; can take no part. At the moment when they are

                  himself tells him exultingly that he must die – for the weapon is poisoned. Madoc

                  Aztecan rites – &amp; cauterizes the wound. They then part in friendship – &amp; the immediate
                  catastrophe remains the same – only Thalala instead of finding his wife in Aztlan
                  delivers her himself to Madoc.
