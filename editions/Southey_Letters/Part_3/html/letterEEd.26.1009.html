Price is an anglicised form of ap Rhys which led Southey to mistake the author
               and look for a work on Spain by his contemporary Uvedale Price (1747–1829; <em>DNB</em>), author of an <em>Essay on the Picturesque</em> (1796), rather than one by Price’s grandfather Udal ap Rhys/Uvedale Tomkyns Price
               (1685–1764). According to Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick (‘The Letters of Robert Southey
               to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), pp. 144–147),
               after Southey wrote to Barker to declare his ignorance of the book, Sir Edward Littleton
               then wrote on the blank third page of Southey’s letter, confusingly: ‘Uvedale Price
               Esq. of Foxly wrote an account of Spain said to be a Plagiarism from some Spanish
               writer; a Pamphlet in ridicule of Whister; Fine Lady’s Catechism Conversation between
               2 Lap Dogs, Scipio &amp; Braganza’. Because Littleton still failed to distinguish between
               grandfather and grandson, Southey continued to mistake the author.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

Of the 90 men sent on the mission 65 were
               killed or wounded. Southey had suspected that his brother was among the dead, but
