            <p class="indent1">Having exhausted my letter-paper I must take fools-cap to let you know that I have
               another daughter, – a finer was never born into the world. She made her appearance
               yester evening &amp; every thing was as favourable as possible, &amp; continue so: We call
               her <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Emma</a>, after her godmother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeachyEmma">M<sup>rs</sup> Peachey</a>. had it proved a boy the name was to have been Danvers; – &amp; if I have any disappointed
               about the sex, it is only because I had pleased myself with the thought of giving
               a son that name.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We start on Sunday reach Kendal the next day &amp; go by way of Leeds, meaning to make
               short stages &amp; take in the Peak &amp; Matlock for the sake of showing a Spanish friend
               of mine the country. At Sheffield I mean to call on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MontgomeryJames">Montgomery</a> the Poet. At Litchfield we halt with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardAnna">Miss Seward</a>, – then go to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LittletonEdwardJohn">Sir Edward Littletons</a>, &amp; there we part, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> comes on to you, – if you will accept a sick mess-mate. Will you secure a bed for
               him. I think we shall be about ten days on the road, – but you shall hear from Staffordshire.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I shall not be with you till the end of March, if so soon, – but certainly do purpose
                  &amp; intend returning thro Bristol. From London I go into Wiltshire &amp; thence to Taunton

                  it so openly as mine when they must have known that I wished it to pass under cover.
                  There is the same want of propriety in this as there would be in lifting up a persons
                  mask at a masquerade. The thing is of no consequence. My materials for the new volume
                  are accumulating I pray you bear this in mind, &amp; keep a little paper of memorandums
                  for D Manuels use.

               as soon as he reached town. &amp; another is that he has not thought proper to execute
               a book on the strength of which I got 25 from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</a> on my security – <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> which in consequence is carried to my account. He dispirited me so thoroughly while
