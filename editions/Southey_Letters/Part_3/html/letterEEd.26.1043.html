            </div>
            <p class="indent1">As soon as you receive Madoc or see it advertised as on its way, inclose for me the
               inclosed, &amp; seal the frank with your great seal which contains eight quarters more
               than the great globe itself. Heaven knows how the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">old Gentleman</a> will take it, but at any rate I will not put him out of humour by carriage or postage.
               If he did but live enough in the world to know that literature is one sure road to
               distinction, all would be well.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">little girl</a> seems quite well again. Still I shall have an anxious time till the teething is over.
               I sometimes half envy those who, if they have no headache, sleep undisturbed &amp; work
               without uneasiness. The sweets &amp; the sours of domestic life are mixed like lemon &amp;
               sugar in punch. – but tho the sweets be improved by the mixture – I wish all the sour
               were out of the way. Some evils I have endured heretofore, – but there are none that
               go to the heart like these hopes &amp; fears –</p>
            <p class="indent1">I hardly know what to wish about politics – the times are so perilous that I should
               tremble to see an administration for which I was interested. Without new taxes there
               is no doing, &amp; yet there must be a limit beyond which taxation cannot go. &amp; we are
               in a fair &lt;way&gt; of ascertaining it. That we should suffer from dearth also is monstrous
               when there are waste lands on every side of us; &amp; after we have twice tasted of the
               evil. Should <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Fox</a> ever come into power he hazards much. We now say of him <span class="ital">if</span> he had been minister; – &amp; if history should say this too, what an object of regret
               &amp; admiration will he be to the latest generations of Englishmen! The physician who
               is called in to a desperate case loses no reputation but it is not so with the statesman.
               – What a misfortune for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Wyndham</a> he was ever in power! Why did he not propose his army-reforms when he was Secretary
               at War? &amp; what is his complection made of that he of all men can demand a reason for
               suspending the Habeas Corpus in Ireland?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The accounts from Portugal look warlike. no doubt this is compulsion, but the feelings
                  of the people will be against us about those frigates.

                  </div> It was a vile business. The man who signed the orders ought to be hung up as a national
                  scape goat. I wish there were a petition set on foot to his Majesty to dismiss the
                  Ministers who had advised an action so dishonourable to the English character. This
                  would wash off some of the shame.</p>
