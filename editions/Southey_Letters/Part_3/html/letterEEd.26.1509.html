                           was born at Little Strickland, near Morland, Westmorland, twenty-five miles east of
                           Keswick.</span></div>
                  </div> was at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>. But I can make him understand the spot on which it stands, &amp; perhaps recall to his
                  memory some persons whom he may long have forgotten.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">He knows the Bridge over the Greta, at the end of the town. There is a little hill
               on the Keswick side the bridge, – the river flows behind it &amp; makes a long sweep by
               High Hill &amp; the old Quaker meeting. On that hill two houses under one roof have been
               built by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#JacksonWilliam">William Jackson</a>, a waggoner in your fathers time; – he has left the business for some years, &amp; lives
               in the one, &amp; I am his tenant in the other. A worthier hearted man never breathed
               than my Landlord, &amp; his house keeper is as excellent a good woman. M<sup>r</sup> Betham will remember her, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">Molly Wilson</a>, – the daughter of the Midwife. M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson we call her, – our children call her Wilsy, &amp; she spoils them more than they
               do her name.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Miss Betham I am sorry to say that whatever may &lt;be&gt; the case in the higher ranks,
               the breed of good women is growing scarce in the lower ones, &amp; of this we have lamentable
               proof here in Cumberland. Manufactories furnish fine cloaths to the one sex and bad
               habits to the other: half the <span class="strikethrough">women</span> girls die of consumption occasioned by cotton stockings &amp; thin clothing; &amp; for the
               other half, – there is scarcely ever a marriage which is not followed by a christening
               within the month. It is well the white sheet has been disused, – for otherwise clean
               sheets would be sometimes wanting in Keswick. An inactive clergyman, negligent magistrates,
               cotton mills &amp; Lakers have ruined the morals of the place. The remote parts of the
               country have escaped this contagion, &amp; there the peasantry are what one has dreamt
               of so often, &amp; so seldom seen, a frank, friendly &amp; independent happy &amp; virtuous race.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Any part of the summer will be convenient to us to receive you, – I should however
               advise you to come as soon as you can after May day; for spring has almost has much
               variety as autumns, &amp; what you will most enjoy will be the long &amp; lovely evenings
               on the Lake. From my study I have the finest imaginable view of the Lake, Borrodale,
               &amp; Newlands, – the river Greta, the Vale of Keswick &amp; Basenthwaite in the distance
               to the right. <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lodore">Lodore</a> can be distinctly seen after rain. The Greta passes behind the house, at the foot
               of our orchard, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> reaches within half a mile of us on that side. Within doors you will see the best
               library that ever so poor a man possessed, contained, for the most part, in a room
               which seems to have the rare property of making all persons feel comfortably who come
               into it.</p>

                  was on the point of running to call her that she might see it opened. But liking to
                  be sure of my good tidings I took a prudent peep &amp; found the proof of a little map
                  of Spain which has been engraved for my translation of the Chronicle of the Cid.
