                  </div> telling me that my unlucky brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</a> (who when I last heard of him was a Lieutenant in the Northampton Militia) was then
                  at Lisbon as a private in the 24 Reg. – that he with the hope of making some return
                  to me (whom he had never seen) for the pleasure my poems had afforded him, hoped to
                  get him a Commission in some Portuguese battalion which he was organizing &amp; to which
                  he hoped to be appointed Colonel, &amp; that Lord John Fitzroy
