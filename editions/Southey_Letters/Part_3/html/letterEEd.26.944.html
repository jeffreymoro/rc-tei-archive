                  upon the banks of the Greta! I will not remain an hour longer than can be helped.
                  You have no notion of the intolerable fatigue it is to walk all day and not get to
                  bed till after midnight. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

                  grand triumph over you, Edith. Had you seen me in my Hyde, when I tried it, you would
                  never have sent me to a London hyde-maker again.

               know how like a bear with a sore head this place makes me; and never was I more uncomfortable
