               <p>Thank you for the books; they arrived yesterday, and I have gone through about three-fourths
                  of Dr. Collyer’s lectures.

                  </div> I have more respect for the Independents than for any other body of Christians, the

                  English history is without a blot. Their American has, unhappily, some bloody ones,
                  which you will see noticed in the next number of the Quarterly, if my reviewal of
                  Holmes’s American Annals should appear there in an unmutilated state.

                           of America, from its Discovery in 1492 to 1806 in theQuarterly Review, 2 (November

                  </div> Dr. Collyer’s is, certainly, an able book; yet he is better calculated to produce
                  effect from the pulpit than in the study. Those parts of his Lectures which are most
                  ornamental and, doubtless, the most popular in delivery, are usually extraneous to
                  the main subject in hand. All his congregations would fairly say ‘What a fine discourse!’
                  to every sermon; but, when the whole are read collectively, they do not exhibit that
                  clear and connected view of prophecy which is what he should have aimed at. There
                  is, perhaps, hardly any subject which requires so much erudition, and so constant
                  an exertion of sound judgment. The Doctor’s learning is not extensive; he quotes from
                  books of little authority, and never refers to those which are of most importance.
                  Indeed, he does not appear to know what the Germans have done in Biblical criticism.</p>
