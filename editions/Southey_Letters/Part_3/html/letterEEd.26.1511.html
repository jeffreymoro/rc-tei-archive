            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker<br>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, ‘The Letters of Robert
               Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967), p. 294.<br>Dating note: Dated from the internal evidence of the visit of Mr and Mrs Horton to
               Greta Hall. Southey declared on 27 September that the Hortons had paid their visit,
               which must have occurred before he spent five days at Netherhall, returning on 26
               September.</p>
