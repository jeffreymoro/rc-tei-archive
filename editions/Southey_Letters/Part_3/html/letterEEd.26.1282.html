               <div class="salute">My dear Sir,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your parcel reached me on Sunday evening, and I have perused every line of its contents
               with deep and painful interest. The letters, and your account (of which I should say
               much were I writing to any other person), have made me thoroughly acquainted with
               one of the most amiable and most admirable human beings that ever was ripened upon
               earth for heaven. Be assured that I will not insert a sentence which can give pain
               or offence to anyone. There will come a time (and God only knows how soon it may come)
               when some one will perform that office for me, which I am now performing for your
               incomparable <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">brother</a> ; and I shall endeavour to show how that office ought to be performed. I will be
               scrupulously careful; and if, when the papers pass through your hands, you should
               think I have not been sufficiently so, I beg you will, without hesitation, expunge
               whatever may appear exceptionable.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp;
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. When I obeyed the impulse which led me to undertake this
                  task,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> it was from a knowledge that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry White</a> had left behind him an example, which ought not to be lost, of well-directed talents,
                  and that, in performing an act of respect to his memory, I should at the same time
                  hold up the example to others who have the up-hill paths of life to tread. No person
                  can be more thoroughy convinced that goodness is a better thing than genius, and that
                  genius is no excuse for those follies and offences which are called its eccentricities.</p>

                  state that those opinions are not mine, lest it should be supposed they were, from
