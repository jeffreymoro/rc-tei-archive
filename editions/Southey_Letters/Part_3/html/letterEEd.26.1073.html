               ‘Pearl Bible’ due to its diminutive size, but also referred to as ‘Field’s Bible of
               10,000 Errors’ (1653) due to the amount of misprints in it. One of the most famous
               errors was in 1 Corinthians 6.9: ‘Know ye not that the unrighteous [instead of ‘righteous’]
               shall inherit the kingdom of God?’ Field was rumoured to have accepted a bribe from
               the Presbyterians to alter Acts 6.3 to read ‘Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among
               you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we [instead
               of ‘ye’] may appoint over this business’, so that it confirmed men’s right to choose
               their own priests.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
