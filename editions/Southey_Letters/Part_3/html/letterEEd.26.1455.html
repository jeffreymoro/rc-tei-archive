                  </div> You offered to print it for me, – if ever I finish the poem it will be because of
                  that offer, tho without the slightest intention of accepting it. – Enough is written
                  to open the story of the poem, &amp; serve as a specimen of its manner tho much of what
                  is to follow would be <span class="strikethrough">of</span> &lt;in&gt; a wilder strain. Tell me if your ear is offended with the rhymes when they occur,
                  or if it misses them when they fail. – I wish it had never been begun, because I like
                  it too well to throw it behind the fire, &amp; not well enough to compleat it without
                  the ‘go-on’ of some one whose approbation is worth having.</p>

               <p>My history as an author is not very honourable to the age in which we live. By giving
                  up my whole time to worthless work in reviews magazines &amp; newspapers I could thrive;
                  – by giving up half my time to them I contrive to live. In the time thus employed
                  every year I could certainly produce such a poem as Thalaba,

                  &amp; recalled hopes which I had dismissed, contentedly as I thought, for ever. If you
                  think Kehama deserves to be published I will borrow hours from sleep &amp; finish it,
                  by rising two hours before my customary time. When it is finished I will try whether
                  subscribers can be procured for five hundred copies, by which means I should secure
                  the whole profits to myself. The booksellers share is too much like the Lions in the
                  fable. – 30 or 33 per cent they first deduct as booksellers, &amp; then halve the residue
                  as publishers. I have no reason to complain of mine. They treat me with great respect
                  &amp; great liberality, – but I wish to be independent of them, &amp; this, if it could be
                  effected, would make me so.</p>

               <p>The will &amp; the power to produce any thing great are not often found together. I wish
                  you would write in English, because it is a better language than Latin, – &amp; because
                  the disuse of English as a living, &amp; literary language would be the greatest evil
                  that could befall mankind. It would cost you little labour to write perspicuously,
                  &amp; thus get rid of your only fault. If you will not write English, – write Latin, &amp;
