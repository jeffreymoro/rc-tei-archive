               all states and people, against all principles of law and justice and social order;
               it was an act by which he outlawed himself in human society, and, from the hour in
               which it was committed, he was under the ban of human nature. There is also one crime

               of treating with its perpetrator; the murder of Captain Wright, an English officer,
               put to death in prison’. Johann Philipp Palm (1768–1806) was a bookseller from Nuremberg,
               Germany, who was executed by a French firing squad on 26 August 1806 for publishing
               and distributing libellous pamphlets about France and Napoleon. John Wesley Wright
               (1769–1805; <em>DNB</em>), was a British naval officer. In May 1804 his ship, the <span class="ital">Vincejo</span>, was captured off the coast of France by the French navy. Accused of having landed
               royalist agents, he was imprisoned in Paris, where he died in solitary confinement.
               He was thought by the British to have been murdered. Hence Tom had better keep clear
