            </div>
            <p class="indent1">This <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">brother of mine</a> is, as you may well suppose, a thorn in the flesh. He writes me a penitent letter,
               &amp; a good one, in a hand like a stable boys: but his Priest has not taught him that
               there can be no absolution without full confession. He denies the charge about the
               French prisoners – my brother <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> heard it at Bristol, &amp; said to me ‘you may be sure I did not enquire into this matter’
               – – it is certain that for some misconduct of this kind, involving a criminal charge,
               he was obliged to leave the regiment, – &amp; it is very lucky for him the horse was stopt
               as it was, for he could have had no intention of returning with it when he <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> hired it, &amp; it is better he should be liable to an arrest for debt, than make an
               appearance for horse-stealing.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>He writes penitently now, &amp; one who did know him so thoroughly and from his youth
                  up as I do, might easily give credit to him. Hopeless however as I am from a deep
                  conviction that he is destitute of any moral sense &amp; has been blind of heart from
                  his birth, – I am well aware that I must not shut my own against him, while there
                  is any possibility, how faint soever, of restoring him. In my last letter
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>See Southey to Nicholas Lightfoot, [c. 18 May 1807], Letter 1324.</span></div>
                  </div> I stated fully to you what my circumstances were, &amp; that statement has shown you how
                  utterly unable I am to meet the heavy expence of fitting him out in life anew, were
                  it practicable to get him a situation, which as yet while his character is unreclaimed,
                  it is not, – or were it prudent if practicable. My circumstances however by Gods blessing,
                  will yearly <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> improve, &amp;, as I told him, whenever he learns to demean himself decently &amp; to do his
                  duty in any situation let it be as humble as it may, he shall not find me deficient
                  in brotherly offices.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Nothing it is certain can reclaim him. but bitter suffering. Some experience of a
               vagabond life he has had, &amp; he must have more, it is prudent for his sake, &amp; necessary
               for mine, – for now I cannot lend him a helping hand, nor would I yet if I could.
               But I shall see you before the year closes, – &amp; then, if he lives respectfully meanwhile
               (<span class="strikethrough">for</span> &lt;as&gt; – in any situation a man may be respectable) I will look after him, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; if xxx xxx xxx</span>. Do not tell him this, lest he should think of making his way to me, which would
               be of all things the most unpleasant &amp; disquieting. Only let him know that I have
               never lost sight of him, &amp; never shall, – that if he does his duty I will do mine,
               – that there are not three more affectionate brothers living than his fathers sons,
               – it is his fault that they are not four, &amp; will be his fault if they are not one
               day made so. But that he must be aware his promises of amendment are not lightly to
               be credited &amp; that some apprenticeship to repentance is necessary for one who has
               so long set shame at defiance, &amp; been the shame &amp; sorrow of his family. – Many &amp; many
               are the plans which I could build upon his talents, were their but a foundation of
               morality <span class="strikethrough">for them</span> to rest upon, – but when the heart is naught – –</p>
            <p class="indent1">At present he is utterly ignorant of the common rudiments of learning; – still his
               extraordinary talents might soon recover the time he has lost; – &amp; if he can be trusted
               when I come into Devonshire, &amp; will go thro two years severe study, I will enable
               him to maintain himself after that time by literature as a profession, – which so
               far from disqualifying him from any &lt;other&gt; means of support, will recommend him to
               it, but will support him if he has no other, &amp; give him a rank in life which nothing
               else could do. But there must be proof of good behaviour first.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I will tell you what is in my mind, do not let him know it. <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> As for the army, were it practicable – you know that for one with a lack of morals
               it is the direct road to the Devil. You <span class="strikethrough">know</span> &lt;may perceive&gt; that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edwards</a> talents are equal to any thing, &amp; will give me credit for knowing enough of literature
               to be able to direct him. I would board him one year with a Welsh clergyman, &amp; one
               year with a Scotch one, to learn the two Celtic dialects thoroughly. after which half
               a year in Ireland might suffice to acquire the third. He should then come home to
               me, – I would procure all the <span class="strikethrough">materials</span> &lt;remains&gt; which are preserved in the Welsh language, &amp; <span class="strikethrough">by xxx</span> &amp; with such help as I could give him by bringing my knowledge to bear upon the new
               materials which he would then be able by mere translation to supply, – he should produce
               a work which would give him means to fit himself out for any line of life which he
               might then prefer – if he should not by that time have acquired a love of letters.
               With my connections there is no doubt of effecting this, – if he would only be his
               own friend, – but of that I confess that I despair. –</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will I dare say laugh at the <span class="ital">out-of-the-wayness</span> of this scheme, – yet nothing is so feasible, &amp; I am thus proposing for him what
               I should do with my own son, were he old enough. – Are you shaking your head Lightfoot?
               So am I – not at the plan, but at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edwards</a> wretched want of principles, which I verily believe, will frustrate every thing that
               can be done, as it has frustrated all that has been done, &amp; will make him end as disagreeably
               as he has begun.</p>
