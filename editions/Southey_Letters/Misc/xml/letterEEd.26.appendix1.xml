						friend of yours. They are very pretty, but it is <hi rend="ital">so</hi> unnatural to imagine moss-clad rocks and springs in a
						room, that fancy could not so far blind the eyes of reason as to dress it with probability. The old woman who conducted us
						(for the man had lately broken his leg) was contented with showing it without wetting us, &#8212; the wit of the place. Ladies are
						desired to look at this and that; and the ground spouts up water &#8212; it rains &#8212; and, in short, you get completely sluiced for
						curiosity and amusement.</p>
          <p rend="indent1"> The time we spent there we did not think by any means thrown away. I shall know the practical jokes at
							Chatsworth,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The ancestral home of the Dukes of Devonshire.</note> and have
						discovered that the hydromania is almost as bad as the hydrophobia. Lord Shrewsbury has a pleasant seat, Heythorp,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Heythrop House was the ancestral home of the Earls of Shrewsbury. The owner in 1793 was
							Charles Talbot, 15th Earl of Shrewsbury (1753&#8211;1827).</note> near the village; but the situation is vile: and indeed the
						road from Oxford to Chipping Norton is very uninteresting. Some good cold beef, cold tongue, sallad, and a bottle of cider
						were productive of much entertainment: we deserved an appetite, and we had one. But Moreton lay eight miles on, and we soon
						proceeded.</p>
          <p rend="indent1"> The village of Salford is very pleasant, and the country mends much as you approach the four-shire stone &#8212; the
						boundary-mark of Gloucester, Worcester, Oxford, and Warwick shires. It is a neat stone, handsomer than even the Romans made
							Terminus,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Roman god of boundaries. His statue was kept in his temple on the
							Tarpeian rock.</note> and yet not sufficiently so to tempt me to fall down, and worship it. Moreton-in-the-Marsh we
						reached to tea, &#8212; a vile, unhealthy, horrible town. Early the next morning we rose, after a curious division of the bed, &#8212; for
						we slept together. He took all the bed and I took all the clothes; but we did not need rocking. Over Camden Downs to Broadway.
						The hill above the town presented me with a most delightful view.</p>
          <p rend="indent1"> Equally rich, and far more extensive, than that from Madamescourt Hill, yet not so beautifully diversified, you
						see the fertile vale of Evesham, the town of the same name, Broadway just below, and at a distance the smoke of Pershore and
						Worcester, Malvern Hills melting into distance. A man of Exeter<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified, perhaps
							an undergraduate at Exeter College, Oxford.</note> breakfasted with us at Broadway, who, in walking twenty miles in boots
						once, had lost his two toe-nails. He was mounted, but though we left Oxford together, we kept up with him, even into
						Worcester. The Abbey of Evesham is wonderfully grand; in a very different stile from Battle, but equally beautiful. A tower, a
						perfect sample of the simple Gothic, fronts the skeleton of the church, whose roof, in many places fallen in, affords light
						enough to show distinctly the inside, and casts a shade in many places. The grass grows in the high arched windows. Desolation
						makes it more striking; but unless some lover of antiquity gives assistance very shortly, it will, I fear, fall entirely. We
						reached Worcester to dinner, having never rested for twenty-one miles. Here, as you may easily imagine, we were not sorry to
						rest. To proceed twelve miles through a very clayey, wet country, was, though not impossible, very unpleasant. We remained
						that night, and the next morning being wet breakfasted with a clergyman. The day cleared up. I bought a trusty stick, drew on
						my Old Bear*<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">*: Warter adds footnote: &#8216;His great coat, to which there is an ode in a
							MS. letter to G.C. Bedford, December 14. 1793.&#8217;</note> (the luggage having arrived), and on we proceeded. The country had
						been pleasant before; it now became romantically beautiful, and I rejoiced in having journeyed to it; but the wet grounds and
						roads, such as in Sussex would be deemed impassible, made the travelling not good. It was a trifle, not worth consideration;
						but we grew hungry, for speed was impossible. ....<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">....: Warter adds footnote: &#8216;MS.
							illegible, and part torn out.&#8217;</note> The bread and cheese, cold pig&#8217;s face, tongue, and tarts, and cider, were most
						agreeable. It may seem strange, but I never found such pleasure in travelling as in this expedition. The highest pride is
						couched under humility, and in truth I was proud of travelling so humbly.</p>
          <p rend="indent1"> I have since visited Abberley, Bewdley, Kidderminster, and Malvern, each well worth seeing; but it is difficult
						to describe so many assemblies of houses in a different manner. Since our arrival here the snow has fallen; and I am inclined
						to hope, from the aspect, that we shall be weather-bound till the last moment. Arthur Young&#8217;s<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Arthur Young (1741&#8211;1820; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Travels During the Years 1787,

          <p rend="indent1"> I have an invincible dislike to saying the same things in two different letters, and yet you must own it is no
						easy matter, to write half a dozen different ones, upon the same subject. I am at Lisbon, and therefore all my friends expect
						some account of Portugal; but it is not pleasant to reiterate terms of abuse, and continually to present to my own mind
						objects of filth and deformity. By way of improving your English cookery, take the Portuguese receipt for dressing rabbits.
						The spit is placed either above the fire, below the fire, by the side of the fire, or in the fire; (this is when they have a
						spit, and that is little better than an iron skewer, for they <hi rend="ital">roast</hi> meat in a <hi rend="ital">jug</hi>,
						and <hi rend="ital">boil</hi> it in a frying-pan;) to know if it is done they crack the joints with their fingers, and then
						lay it aside till it cools, then they seize the rabbit, tear it piecemeal with their fingers into rags, and fry it up with
						oil, garlic, and aniseed. I have attempted sausages made of nothing but garlic and aniseed; they cut off the rump of a bird
						always because they dress it, and neither prayers nor entreaties can save a woodcock from being drawn and quartered. R&#8212;&#8212;<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Mr Raynsford (first name and dates unknown), a companion of Southey&#8217;s during some of

						toasted cheese &#8212; to the no small amusement of those who knew he could get neither, and to his no small disappointment when he

						one whom I am so intimate with, or with whom I wish intimacy. Here is as much visiting and as little society as you can wish;
						and a Bristol alderman may have his fill of good eating and drinking; yet is this metropolis supplied only from hand to mouth,
						and when the boats cannot come from Alentejo, the markets are destitute; at this time there is no fuel to be bought! Barbary
						supplies them with corn, and that as so low a rate, that the farmers do not think it worth while to bring their corn to
						market, so that the harvest of last year is not yet touched. They cannot grind the Barbary corn in England: it is extremely
						hard, and the force and velocity of English mills reduce the husk as well as the grain to powder. I learnt all this from the
						Vice Consul,<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> who has written much to Lord Grenville<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Lord Grenville (1759&#8211;1834; <title level="m">DNB</title>),
							Foreign Secretary 1791&#8211;1801, Prime Minister 1806&#8211;1807.</note> on the subject, and proposed damping the corn previous to
						grinding it, so as to prevent the bran from pulverising. Lord G. has even sent for grindstones to Lisbon, in hopes they might
						succeed better. It is melancholy to reflect on what a race possesses the fertile coasts of Barbary! Yet are these Portuguese
						not a degree above them. You may form some idea how things are managed in this country from the history of the present war: by
						treaty the Portuguese were to furnish the English with a certain number of ships, or a certain sum of money; and the Spaniards
						with troops or money; the money was expected, but the Secretary of State, Mello,<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">Martinho de Melo e Castro (1716&#8211;1795), Secretary for the Navy and Overseas Affairs 1773&#8211;1795.</note> argued that it was
						more politic to lay it out among their own countrymen, and make soldiers and sailors. The old boy&#8217;s measures were vigorous; he
						sent for the general of one of the provinces, appointed him commander in Brazil, and ordered him to be ready at an hour&#8217;s
						notice; but old Mello fell ill, and the general, after remaining three months at Lisbon (for during Mello&#8217;s illness the other
						party managed affairs,) he found no more probability of departing than on the first day, and he accordingly sent for his
						furniture, wife, and family to Lisbon. Soon after they arrived the secretary recovered, &#8212; every thing was hurried for the
						expedition, &#8212; and the wife, family and furniture, sent home again. Mello fell ill again, every thing was at a stand, and the
						general once more called his family to Lisbon. The old fellow recovered; sent them all home again; put everything in
						readiness, fell ill again, and died. The measures of the government have ever since been uniformly languid; and, though the
						stupid hounds sent ships to England, and troops to Spain, they never believed themselves at war with France till the French
						took their ships at the mouth of the river!</p>
          <p rend="indent1"> The meeting of the two Courts<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">A meeting between the Spanish and

						Portugal into an alliance with France: they, however, parted on bad terms. War with Spain is not improbable, and, if our
						minister knew how to conduct it, would amply repay the expenses of the execrable contest. The Spanish settlements could not
						resist a well-ordered expedition, and humanity would be benefited by the delivery of that country from so heavy a yoke. There
