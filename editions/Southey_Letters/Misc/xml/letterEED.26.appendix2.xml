        <p>We here reproduce for the first time Southey&#8217;s light-hearted &#8211; but unsent &#8211; 1818 response to an anticipated challenge to a duel from
               Henry Brougham. Southey suggests that such a challenge would be provoked by the appearance of his own &#8216;Tender Epistle&#8217;, which had been
               written in reaction to Brougham&#8217;s reported criticism of Southey during the Westmorland election of 1818. In fact, the &#8216;Tender Epistle&#8217;
               was not completed and only part of it was ever published as an Appendix (without mentioning Brougham&#8217;s name) to the second edition of
               Southey&#8217;s <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp. 45&#8211;53. </p>

          <p rend="indent0">Sir </p>
          <p rend="indent1">I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of your letter, &amp; do myself the pleasure of replying to it without
                  delay.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">In affairs of this kind, the parties ought to meet upon equal terms. But to establish such an equality between you
                  &amp; me, there are three things which must be previously done; &amp; then a fourth also becomes necessary, before I can meet you in
                  the field.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">First, you must marry &amp; have four children. Please to be particular in having them all girls.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s only children alive at this time were <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel
                  Southey</ref>.</note>
          </p>
          <p rend="indent1">Secondly you <del>can</del> must prove that the greater part of the provision which you make for them depends upon
                  your life: &amp; you must be under a bond of 4000&#163; not to be hanged, not to commit suicide, &amp; not to be killed in a duel, which
                  are the conditions upon which I have effected an insurance on my own life, for the benefit of <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my wife</ref> &amp; children.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s life was insured
                     for &#163;4000 &#8211; he had invested his salary as Poet Laureate in increasing the coverage to this sum.</note>
          </p>
          <p rend="indent1">Thirdly, I must tell three direct falsehoods concerning you, upon the hustings, or in some other not less public
                     assembly.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to the newspaper reports of what Brougham had said about Southey
                     from the hustings at Appleby on 30 June 1818.</note> And I shall never be able to do this, nor to meet you afterwards in the
                  manner you propose, unless you can perform the fourth thing, which is, &#8211;&#8211;</p>
          <p rend="indent1">That you must convert me from the Christian religion.</p>
          <p rend="indent1">Till all this be accomplished, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Brougham, our disputes must be carried on without the use of
                  any more iron than is necessary for blackening our ink &amp; mending our pens, &#8211; or of any more lead than enters into the
