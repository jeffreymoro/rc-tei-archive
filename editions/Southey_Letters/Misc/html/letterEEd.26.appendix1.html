                     out of which, in going and returning, five days must have been spent, and time flies
                     so rapidly at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MountsfieldRye">Rye</a>, that it is needless to shorten his career.

                     exercise I excel in; you likewise know how little time my wise brain gives to consideration.
                     I accepted the offer, and off we set. We breakfasted at Woodstock, seven miles from
                     Oxford, and passed the environs of Blenheim

                  <p>I have an invincible dislike to saying the same things in two different letters, and
                     yet you must own it is no easy matter, to write half a dozen different ones, upon
                     the same subject. I am at Lisbon, and therefore all my friends expect some account
                     of Portugal; but it is not pleasant to reiterate terms of abuse, and continually to
                     present to my own mind objects of filth and deformity. By way of improving your English
                     cookery, take the Portuguese receipt for dressing rabbits. The spit is placed either
                     above the fire, below the fire, by the side of the fire, or in the fire; (this is
                     when they have a spit, and that is little better than an iron skewer, for they <span class="ital">roast</span> meat in a <span class="ital">jug</span>, and <span class="ital">boil</span> it in a frying-pan;) to know if it is done they crack the joints with their fingers,
                     and then lay it aside till it cools, then they seize the rabbit, tear it piecemeal
                     with their fingers into rags, and fry it up with oil, garlic, and aniseed. I have
                     attempted sausages made of nothing but garlic and aniseed; they cut off the rump of
                     a bird always because they dress it, and neither prayers nor entreaties can save a
                     woodcock from being drawn and quartered. R——
