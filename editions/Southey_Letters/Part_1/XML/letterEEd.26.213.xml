          <salute>My dear Thomas</salute>

        <p rend="indent2"> I have been regretting that you were not at Portsmouth in the
                    great insurrection,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The naval mutinies at
                        Nore and Spithead of April&#8211;June 1797.</note> that I might have had a full
                    true &amp; particular account of that extraordinary business; a business at
                    which every body is astonished, for how such a body of such people could so have
                    concerted &amp; carried into execution a well organized mutiny is
                    incomprehensible. where its effects will end too &#8212; is difficult to guess; for as
                    all authority depends upon the opinion the governed entertain of the power of
                    the governors, when they discover that the power is in their own hands, the very
                    foundation of <del rend="strikethrough">gov xx</del> subordination, &amp;
                    consequently of authority must be shaken.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As I have no business in London (except indeed to dine at Grays
                    Inn once at the latter end of June) till November, we intend spending the summer
                    &amp; autumn somewhere by the sea. where is not yet determined, but most
                    probably somewhere in Hampshire &amp; this you will learn from <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref>. we go about the middle
                    of May &#8212; &amp; it will shorten your journey to see us. London is a place for
                    which I entertain a most hearty hatred, &amp; <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> likes it as little as myself &#8212;
                    &amp; as for the sea &#8212; I like it very much when on shore.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had a letter from Lisbon yesterday. <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncles</ref> family has been very
                    unfortunate. his poor old woman is dead, &amp; so is his dog Linda. his mare
                    who was lame he had given away to be turned into the woods &#8212; she has not been
                    seen lately &#8212; &amp; he thinks the wolves have eat her. twas an account that
                    made me melancholy &#8212; I had been long enough an inhabitant of his house to become
                    attached to every thing connected with it &#8212; &amp; poor old Ursula<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A servant in Herbert Hill&#8217;s household at
                        Lisbon.</note> was an excellent woman. he will never find her equal: &#8212;
                    &amp; I shall never think of Lisbon again without some feelings of regret.
                    my letter was from my friend <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref>, now an inmate of my Uncles. I have learnt from other quarters
                    that my Uncle is made Chaplain to our troops there.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My acquaintance here are more than are convenient &#8212; &amp; I
                    meet with invitations unpleasant to refuse &amp; still more unpleasant to
                    accept. this is another motive to me to wish for a country residence as long as
                    possible. I find the distances in this foul city very inconvenient &#8212; tis a
                    mornings work to call upon a distant friend &#8212; &amp; I return from it
                    thoroughly fatigued. We are going to dine on Wednesday next with <ref target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Wollstonecraft</ref>, of all
                    the literary characters the one I most admire. my curiosity is fully satisfied,
                    &amp; the greater part of these people after that wish is satisfied leave no
                    other remaining. this is not the case with her &#8212; she is a first rate woman &#8212;
                    sensible of her own worth, but altogether without arrogance or affectation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have two reasons for preferring a residence near the sea. I
                    love to pickle myself in that grand brine tub &#8212; &amp; I wish to catch its
                    morning evening &amp; mid day appearances for poetry, with the effect of
                    every change of weather. fancy will do much &#8212; but the Poet ought to be an
                    accurate observer of nature &#8212; &amp; I [MS torn] shall watch the clouds
                    &amp; the rising &amp; setting sun &amp; [MS torn] the sea birds
                    with no inattentive eye. I have remedied one of my deficiencies too since a boy
                    &#8212; &amp; learnt to swim enough to like the exercise. this I began at Oxford
                    &amp; practised a good deal in the summer of 1795 at Baptist Mills.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The River Frome ran through Baptist-Mills,
