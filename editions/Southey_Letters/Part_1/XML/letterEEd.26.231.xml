          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My Mother</ref> was a good deal puzzled by receiving a letter in French, dated June 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, directed to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southey, which neither or any of her acquaintance could understand. <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</ref> was coming here to be my guest &amp; she sent it by him. it is from the Captain of the Zoe, now a prisoner at Plymouth. I immediately answered it in very bad French, explained to him why it had remained so long unnoticed, &amp; told him that we would employ all the little interest we possessed to get him exchanged or out upon parole as soon as possible. I have put all my friends in requisition to do something for this man; his name I could not make out, it is either Soutet or Boutet. nothing would give me more pleasure than the procuring him his exchange, or even receiving him here if he can get out upon parole.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The French naval officer Captain Boutet (first name and dates unknown), who had once been kind to Southey&#8217;s brother Thomas.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Your adventures have furnished me with an excellent story for every company into which I fall. Phillips,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Richard Phillips (1767&#8211;1840; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> the proprietor of the Monthly Magazine requested me if I could to get him a full account of the prison, treatment, &amp; of the kindness you experienced to insert in his Magazine,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"> See Southey to the Editor of the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title> [c. August 1797] (Letter 241).</note> a very good &amp; respectable publication in which I occasionally write. if you approve of this &amp; will send me the necessary documents, I <del rend="strikethrough">will</del> shall receive enough from him to purchase for you the two volumes which are already published of the world, &amp; will continue it for you &amp; send the volumes as they are compleated by such opportunities as may offer. you may affix your name or not as you think proper <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> &#8212; for my own part I think the behaviour you received there cannot be too generally known. if you think this right (&amp; you only can tell whether there be any possible objection to publishing such a statement), write me the French names very legibly as they puzzle me in your hand writing, describe me the theatre &amp; what you saw there, be as full as possible, I can easily compress but I cannot enlarge.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	When ever you visit Kingsbridge again enquire for a clergyman there, usher to a school. his name is <ref target="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</ref>. he was a fellow collegian of mine &amp; a very dear friend, whom I have not now seen for three years, but with whom I occasionally correspond. I shall tell him what I have said to you, &amp; am very sure that it will highly gratify him to see a brother of mine. I am sorry this reaches you too late &#8212; he might &amp; would have been a friend in need had you known this a few weeks earlier. but I knew nothing of the situation of Kingsbridge, or that it was likely you might ever pass thro it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I wish you could come to us. we are only two miles from Christ Church, &amp; therefore within reach of you even from Plymouth. I was not much alarmed for your safety, because Captain Barlow,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Barlow (1757&#8211;1843; <title level="m">DNB</title>), captain of Thomas Southey&#8217;s ship the <title level="m">Aquilon</title>.</note> wrote word that there was no danger, as the vessel was new &amp; sound. an account which by the blessing of God I will remember, &amp; if we should ever meet, thank him for.</p>

I do not understand why your imprisonment should make you less wise than formerly. look at the situation you are in &#8212; look at the wickedness of the ranks above you, &amp; the vice &amp; wretchedness of those below you, &amp; then ask if that system can be good which creates such misery! for me &#8212; I have little respect for men as they are, nor would I lose one drop of blood for them &#8212; but I would drain my heart to make them what they ought to be.</p>
