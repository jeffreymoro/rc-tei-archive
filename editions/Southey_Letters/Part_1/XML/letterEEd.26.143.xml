        <p>MS untraced; the text is taken from Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey, 6 vols (London, 1849&#8211;1850), I, p. 258..  Previously  published: Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey, 6 vols (London, 1849&#8211;1850), I, p. 258 [in part, with an indication that the last part of the letter has been omitted]. Also published in part and with minor variants in Joseph Cottle, Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey (London, 1847), p. 190; variants in this version have been recorded in the footnotes, but variants in capitalisation, spelling and punctuation have not been noted. Cuthbert Southey&#8217;s text has been chosen as copy-text on the grounds that he is &#8212; marginally &#8212; more reliable as an editor than Cottle.Dating note: Southey was in Falmouth at the end of November 1795, waiting to set sail for Portugal. He departed c. 1 December, so the letter must have been written by that time.</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>
