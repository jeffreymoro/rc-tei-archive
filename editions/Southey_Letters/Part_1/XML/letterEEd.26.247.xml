          <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref> left me yesterday. I
                    took leave of him with regret. his gaiety is inoffensive, &amp; our intimacy
                    at Lisbon created many ideas &amp; associations which he only partakes. this
                    evening he will be at Bath; &amp; I hope <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</ref> affairs will now be
                    settled comfortably; the plan of settling them once fixed, I expect her
                    here.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We were surprized on Sunday by seeing <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#LambCharles">Charles Lamb</ref>, names with which you
                    must be well acquainted if you have seen <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref> last edition. I
                    think I told you the very melancholy history of poor Lamb,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1796, Mary Anne Lamb (1764&#8211;1847; <title level="m">DNB</title>) killed her mother.</note> of all I ever heard of
                    the most distressing. he tells <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> he is happy, a state of resignation almost incredible. can you
                    believe it possible that within a fortnight after the dreadful death of his
                    mother, the head of his office at the India house almost turned him out of the
                    room because he had not shaved! assuredly I fear that if Society had not very
                    bad materials to work upon, it could not produce the beings it does. but
                    physical evil is in great part produced by moral evil, the germ of existence is
                    cankered oftentimes, &amp; the sins of the father are indeed visited upon
                    the children. that all moral evil may be removed may, I think, be deduced from
                    all we know of the nature of the human mind, &amp; of the attributes of the
                    Creator. Atheism were piety to the belief that God can have made one being
                    necessarily &amp; irremediably bad. but surely Society is so constituted as
                    to encourage every evil propensity. the straight path of rectitude is rugged
                    &amp; difficult &amp; every possible allurement used to draw us from the
                    painful way. it is most like a whitened sepulchre. Go to the haunts of
                    amusement; to the evening fire side of affluence what so gay so happy as
                    civilized society? <del rend="strikethrough">return</del> &lt;go&gt; to
                    the streets of London what so wretched! the Crisis is approaching, &amp; tho
                    I perish in the storm I would gladly see it scatter the fogs of this
                    pestilential calm.</p>

                    abusing our wicked Henry the fifth, whom I take to be as bad a man as ever wore
                    a crown. I have not seen the lines myself</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I use the expurgatory pen with no sparing hand in preparing for

                    his stay will be short. he is a very interesting young man. I love his poetry
                    because it is wholly written from the heart. in a world such as we live in it is
                    unprofitable &amp; unwise to give way to our feelings. it is the business of
                    a wise man to check &amp; regulate them, to become despotic over his own
                    mind. I am fond of great part of the Stoical system, &amp; there are few
                    characters that I contemplate with more reverence than the slave Epictetus.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Stoic philosopher Epictetus (c. AD

                    I think I am the better for it. our language, &amp; perhaps every other,
                    wants a name for that pride which every man ought to possess, &amp; without
                    which he can never be compleatly respectable. the Stoic doctrines tend to make

                    such too is the end of Christianity when well understood, but among its many
                    corruptions is the wretched doctrine that we ought to be vile in our eyes &#8212;
                    alas! if we are not respectable to ourselves to whom shall we be so?</p>
