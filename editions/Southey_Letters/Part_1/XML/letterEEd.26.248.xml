Sir Harry Neals ship<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Harry Burrard-Neale, (1765&#8211;1840; <title level="m">DNB</title>), naval officer and politician who, in 1797, commanded the <hi rend="ital">San Fiorenzo</hi>.</note> is full. Admiral Mann<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Mann (d. 1813), in 1797 a Rear Admiral of the Red.</note> has been applied to by letter &#8212; his answer has not yet arrived. should it be unfavourable we will apply to other quarters; you may certainly be easy for removed you will be. you may be easy too as to being made a Lieutenant. <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</ref> has interest enough. if the World remains as bad as it is we shall do well. if it is mended we shall do better.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">My Uncle</ref> has commissioned <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref>, a friend whom I made at Lisbon, to take <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</ref> affairs in hand, give security for her debts, &amp; get her out of her house. <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref> left me yesterday to go to Bath. I wish her much to live with me &#8212; but to this <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> will be the obstacle. in that case the greater part of what <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</ref> would allow her might support <ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</ref> for a couple of years at school so as to fit him either for law or physic, in which professions I could forward him. his attributes are too good to be wasted upon trade. he may live with me while he is studying physic, which I think the best line for him, or law if he prefers it, &amp; two years education would fit him to begin either study.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I have sent your narration to the Magazine, &amp; it will probably appear in the next Month.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Southey&#8217;s account of his captivity had already appeared; see Southey to the Editor of the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title>, [c.

        <p rend="indent1">	how very unfortunate it is that we cannot meet on account of your rascally Captain.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Barlow (1757&#8211;1843; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> you must however make yourself as comfortable as you can be in your present situation by the expectance of speedily exchanging it. <del rend="strikethrough">it</del> in November we shall return to London. that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref> will live with us, knowing <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunts</ref> influence over her mind, I rather hope than expect. after Christmas I go to a Special Pleaders office where my employment will be drawing out pleadings, &amp; a years hard application there will qualify me for doing business <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> myself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I am become a tolerable fish, &amp; am now going to pickle myself in the sea.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	You shall hear again from me as soon as we get any news from Admiral Mann. the application is not likely to fail &#8212; &amp; if it should, it will succeed elsewhere.</p>
