<p rend="indent1"> Your exordium is the worst part of the translation.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Throughout this letter Southey provides a
                        detailed critique of Grosvenor Charles Bedford’s translation of Musæus (fl.
                        c. early 6th century), which was eventually published in 1797 as <title level="m">The Loves of Hero and Leander</title>.</note> &amp; in the
                    two last lines the word <hi rend="ital">death</hi> is not applicable to the
                    light &amp; lover. quench in night or extinguish are words that equally
                    affect both.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> The <hi rend="ital">lofty</hi> towers opposd of Sestos stood — is
                    a good transposition of your line.
                    Ηιθεον
                    φλεξας
                    και
                        παρθενον<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Greek translates as ‘having excited
                        the youth and the maiden’.</note> — the epithet <hi rend="ital">faithful</hi> is prematurely given. &amp; pleasing woe is too trite an
                    antithesis. the four lines Ah with what art the wily youth essayd to — mutual
                    ardor melt — are by no means the meaning of the original — nor consonant to the
                    story — “enquire Stranger the sea-echoing straits of Abydos <del rend="strikethrough">yet</del> &lt;now&gt; moaning the love
                    &amp; death of Leander. <del rend="strikethrough">but for</del> but whence
                    (or how) came Leander of Abydos to the love of Hero, &amp; won her too to
                    love?” Your translation is very different — he used no arts to win the Lady but
                    impudence, nor is there any part of the piece to which “across the sea to
                    breathe the flame he felt” can refer. well done Aristarchus! “grew beneath her
                    parents eyes” is a meaning opposite to the text. she dwelt <hi rend="ital">απο
                        προγονων</hi>
<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Greek translates as ‘at a distance
                        from her ancestors’.</note> — this you have rendered too laxly in <hi rend="ital">secluded from the world</hi>. “Where jealous Weakness points
                    Detractions tongue” is a line eminently beautiful &amp; entirely your own.
                    the flames of Loves dart — is a metaphor incongruous tho common custom has
                    familiarized — you should avoid &lt;it&gt; for both reason. it is
                    improper &amp; hackneyd. “ambrosial shade” I understand not. ambrosia is an
                    aristocratic liquor that the Deities have monopolized, &amp; poor mortal
                    cannot even get a smell. — find out what made the odors of Libanus — (Qy.
                    Cedars?) &amp; give an appropriate epithet. Cyprus isle that rises from the
                    deep is a pleonasm — you must omit isle — or the end of the line. fade in the
                    whiteness of surrounding snow — is very happy. “<hi rend="ital">throughout her
                        form</hi> the varied flowers appear — the first part of this line is
                    awkward.
                    Οφθαλμος
                        γελοων<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Greek translates as ‘a laughing eye’.</note>
                    — is weakly rendered. you have paraphrasd too much — Sparta renownd for
                    beauty.</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent2">Oer all her charms has roved my eager sight</l>
<l rend="indent2">Yet no satiety attends delight — </l>
</lg>
<p>is a better couplet than either of the two — at any rate keep the <hi rend="ital">marked words</hi>. Wrapt in her arms to breath my soul away — is not the
                    meaning — “If I might ascend the couch of Hero — I would then willingly die —
                        ”.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Footnote inserted in another hand:
                        ‘Southey has mistaken this.’</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> that flame possession only could assuage — is not in the original
                    &amp; has no merit to plead for its preservation. a la lanterne with it — it
                    needs <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> neither judge nor jury. the following
                    lines to the end of her speech are very good. you may still add another couplet
                    to express
                    Παρθενικης
                    επι

                        the girl’s bed’.</note> your concluding line have a different meaning but I
                    cannot wish them removed. Excellent Critic! <hi rend="ital">the signs of
                        conquest &amp; of Love he knew</hi>. a bad translation. <hi rend="ital">When Leander heard the anger of her womanish threats he knew them to be
                        signs of consent</hi>. people talk big when they can do little — exemplum

                        June 1795. He was, of course, unable to enforce his claim.</note> — that

                        throne.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1"> is not <hi rend="ital">hymenæal</hi> a more appropriate phrase

                        your suppliant, and your bedfellow, if you will’.</note>
</p>
<p>you must translate this better &amp; nearer the original meaning. the two
                    lines on Hercules are very flat.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Another
                        hand has inserted: ‘send the original Southey’.</note>
<del rend="strikethrough">t</del>he her lovers pains — it is always better to
                    avoid these trite phrases. &amp; if we analize the meaning of easing a
                    lovers pains — we shall not find it to be the most delicate. the phrase would be
                    proper for a brothel — as a man goes to <hi rend="ital">ease</hi> himself at a
                    necessary. love &amp; lust must not be confounded — or to use better terms
                    affection &amp; appetite — I own Leanders comes under the last class. the
                    meaning is —<hi rend="ital"> you know</hi> how <hi rend="ital">Atalanta fled her

<p rend="indent1"> thy words o Stranger soon the rocks might raise — the Devil they
                    might! this however Musæus must answer for. I have too good an opinion of our
                    modern female to think an Irish man from the other side the water would have
                    succeeded so well without pleading better. you have just above this used <hi rend="ital">pleasing pain</hi>

                    in English — but it is very beautiful &amp; your line totally unlike it. I
                    object to that line particularly. I wish you could avoid a triplet — perhaps an
                    alexandrine may contain the meaning.</p>

                    Love makes wounds he cures them likewise. a pestilence on the fellow who
                    invented the jargon of wounds &amp; arrows. your lines fall short of the
