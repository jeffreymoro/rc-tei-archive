I will therefore thank you to send me six of each with the parcel. (directed here. <ref target="places.html#ProspectPlaceLondon">20. Prospect Place. Newington Butts</ref>.)</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Perhaps you will be surprized to hear that of all the Lions or Literati that I have seen here, there is not &lt;one&gt; whose countenance has not some unpleasant trait. <ref target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Imlay&#8217;s</ref> is the best &#8212; infinitely the best. the only fault in it is an expression somewhat similar to what the prints of Horne Tooke<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"> John Horne Tooke (1736&#8211;1812; <title level="m">DNB</title>), radical and philologist.</note> display; &#8212; an expression indicating superiority, not haughtiness &#8212; not conceit &#8212; not sarcasm in <ref target="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Imlay</ref> &#8212; but still it is unpleasant. her eyes are light brown, &amp; tho the lid of one of them is affected by a slight paralysis they are the most meaning I ever saw. her complection is dark, sun-burnt, &amp; her skin a little cracked &#8212; for she is near forty, &amp; Affliction has borne harder upon her than years. but her manners are the most pleasing I ever witnessed &#8212; they display warm feelings &amp; strong understanding, &amp; the knowledge she has acquired of men &amp; manners ornaments, not disguises, her own character.
