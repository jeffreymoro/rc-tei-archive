        <p>MS untraced; text is taken
                        from Warter .  Previously  published: John Wood Warter, Selections From the Letters of Robert Southey, 4 vols (London,
                        1856), I, pp. [1]&#8211;3. Warter, I, p. [1] n. * implies that his text was taken

                        [i.e. Caroline Bowles]&#8217;. Although many of these inherited MSS are now in the
                        British Library, these papers are not included. </p>

                            unlikely given that in a letter to his daughter Edith May Warter, 5 June
                            1838, Southey recalled only two holidays at Rye, both at Whitsun, in
                            1791 and 1792. The description of the journey from Rye to London given
                            here does not match that sent to Grosvenor Charles Bedford on 11 June
                            1792 (see Letter 13). This letter to Lamb was therefore probably written
                            after Southey&#8217;s visit to Rye at Whitsun 1791, and should be dated c.
