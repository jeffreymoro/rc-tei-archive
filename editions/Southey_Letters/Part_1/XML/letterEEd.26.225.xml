        <p rend="indent1"> It is long since I have been so greatly fatigued &#8212; &amp; yet
                    it has no effect upon my spirits. they are as regular as ever. this nasty dinner
                    to day will occasion me a needless walk, but I shall never bear the name of
                    Broad Street Buildings again for <ref target="people.html#AikinJohn">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Aikins</ref> sake. the distance is terrible. you will
                    however have the comfort of supposing by the time this reaches you that all my
                    jobs are over, &amp; that I am at rest for the rest of my stay in London. if
                    it be possible I hate it worse than ever; &amp; feel already a horrible
                    &amp; loathing reluctance ever again to inhabit so detestable a place. God
                    bless you my dear <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>. I am tired
                    &amp; vexed but in a very few days all the fatigue &amp; vexation will
                    be over &amp; I shall be comfortably settled. now &amp; then when my
                    feet give an extraordinary ache or I tread upon a rough stone I think I am the
                    happiest fellow living when at home &#8212; &amp; curse the Grays Inn dinner.</p>
