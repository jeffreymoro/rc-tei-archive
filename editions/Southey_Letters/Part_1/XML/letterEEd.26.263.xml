He was a frequent contributor to the <title level="j">Bath Journal</title> and his numerous publications included <title level="m">Illustrations of the Roman Antiquities at Bath</title> (1797) and a <title level="m">History of Bath</title> (1801).</note> tho somewhat ashamed to call upon him after so long a delay. the first time that I set out with that intent a previous call delayed me till too late an hour. the second time I found he had changed his quarters &#8212; &amp; it was not till Thursday last that I made a third &amp; successful attempt. they tell me he has made some curious discoveries among the records of Bath, &amp; I likewise hear that he calculates upon the certain sale of a number of copies to Libraries &amp; the purchasers of topographical history, a branch of literature which certainly has its use, but which no human genius can make tolerably agreable. I hope some day to find him at his books &amp; get among his old chronicles.</p>
