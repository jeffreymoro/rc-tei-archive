        <p rend="indent1">	When do I come to London? a plain question. I cannot tell &#8212; is as plain an answer. my books wil be out before Xmas. &amp; I shall then have no further business in Bristol. yet <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> this is not saying when I shall leave it &#8212; the best answer is &#8212; as soon as I can &#8212; &amp; the sooner the better. I want to be there. I want to feel myself settled &#8212; &amp; God knows when that will be. for the settlement of a lodging is but a comfortless one. to compleat comfort a house to oneself is necessary for I do not like living in the same den with the beast.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	however I expect to be as comfortable as it is possible to be in that cursed city &#8212; &#8220;that huge &amp; hateful sepulchre of Men&#8221;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Quotation unidentified.</note> &#8212; I detest cities &#8212; &amp; had rather live in the fens of Lincolnshire or on Salisbury plain than in the best situation London could furnish. the neighbourhood of you &amp; <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> can alone render it tolerable. by the Lord <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> I fear the air will wither me up like one of the miserable myrtles at a &lt;town&gt; parlour window the noise the smoke the filth the Beast &#8212; oh for the house in the woods &amp; the great dog!</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I already feel intimate with <ref target="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</ref>. but I am a very snail in company <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> &amp; pop into my shell whenever I am approachd or roll myself up like a hedge hog in my rough outside.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	it is strange but I never approached London without feeling my heart sink within me. an unconquerable heaviness oppresses me in its atmosphere &#8212; &amp; all its associated ideas &#8212; are painful. with a little house in the country &amp; a bare independance how much more useful should I be &#8212; &amp; how much more happy! it is not talking nonsense when I say that the London air is as bad for the mind as for the body. for the mind is a cameleon that receives its colours from surrounding <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> objects. in the country every thing is good. every thing in Nature is beautiful &#8212; the benevolence of Deity is every where presented to the eye, &amp; the heart participates in the tranquillity of the scene. in the town my soul is continually &lt;disgusted&gt; by the vices &amp; follies &amp; consequent miseries of mankind.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	my future studies too &#8212; now I never read a book without learning something &#8212; &amp; never write a line of poetry without cultivating some feeling of benevolence &amp; honesty. but the law &#8212; a damned jargon &#8212; a quibbling collection of voluminous nonsense &#8212; but this I must wade thro &#8212; aye &amp; I will wade thro &#8212; &amp; when I shall have got enough to live in the country you &amp; I will make my first Xmas fire of all my law books. oh <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> what a blessed bonfire! the Devil uses the Statutes at large for fuel when he gives an Attorney his house-warming.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Your boy is a miracle &amp; his sister &#8212; what can be done for her? &#8212; Zounds <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> is it not a pity that the boy cannot <del rend="strikethrough">exx</del> marry her? for I am woefully afraid any cross breed will be a degenerate one!
