        <p rend="indent1"> In sober sadness my dear friend you deserve a letter as little as
                    any lazy mortal ever yet did &#8212; but perhaps there is one waiting for me at Oxford
                    &#8212; I will think so at least &#8212; it is easy to deceive ourselves when we wish to be
                    deceived &#8212; I expect to find one upon my return in acknowledgement of this</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> my philosophy which has so long been of a kind peculiar to myself
                    neither of the school of Plato Aristotle Westminster or the Miller<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The traditional song sometimes known as &#8216;The
                        Miller of Dee&#8217;, particularly its lines &#8216;I care for nobody, no not I,/If
                        nobody cares for me&#8217;.</note> is at length settled. I am a peripatetic
                    philosopher far however from adopting the tenets of any self sufficient cynic or
                    puzzling sophist my sentiments will be found more enlivened by the brilliant
                    colours of Fancy Nature &amp; Rousseau than the positive dogmas of the

                    refinements of his antagonist &#8212; I aspire not to the honourary title of subtle
                    disputant or divine Doctor &#8212; I wish to found no school to drive no scholars mad
                    &#8212; ideas spring up with the scenes I view &#8212; some pass away with the momentary
                    glance &#8212; some are engraved upon the tablet of memory &amp; some infixed upon
                    the heart you have told me what Philosophy is not &amp; I can give you a
                    little more information upon the subject &#8212; it is not plunging in debauchery

                        disapproved of Augustus for putting an end to the Roman republic.</note> &#8212;

                        and executed his son Crispus, a subject Southey treated at length in his
                        prose romance &#8216;Harold&#8217; (1791); see Bodleian Library, Eng. Misc. e.
