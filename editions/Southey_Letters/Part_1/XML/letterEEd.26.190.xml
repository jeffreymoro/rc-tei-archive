<p rend="indent1">	I was at Bristol when your letter arrived — the inclosed was immediately written, I have spoken of Robert Haynes<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; a friend of the Bedford family who was going to Lisbon.</note> as your character of him taught me he deserved to be spoken of — he will need no other introduction. if my friend <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref> revisits Lisbon &amp; I shall by this post assure him there is no danger in so doing — you may send any thing by him to introduce him to Haynes — who may then supply my place to <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref>.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	you mistook me about Madoc. I had neither the intention or wish of immediate publication. twas a forlorn hope for the future. I wrote to <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> about five days ago — &amp; told him the only remora that would detain me here after Christmas. I am as little content with the world as you are, but I do not like <ref target="people.html#AllenRobert">Allens</ref> gunpowder plot. the world must be mended by the total reorganization of society. &amp; as a Christian I believe this must take place. if I did not — I should join the Atheism of <ref target="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</ref> — without embracing his plans for the improvement of a rascally public. you call yourself an aristocrat — &amp; before God I know no man whose opinions &amp; feelings are more anti-aristocratical!</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I shall probably visit London a week before <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> — to look about me &amp; fix. will you house me for that time? your plan makes some alteration in mine — I meant to live about Newington to be in the road between <ref target="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</ref> &amp; the Exchequer — now the nearer we are to Lincolns Inn the better — &amp; the nearer to each other.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	But why so anxious <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> as to injure your health? a little stoicism amalgamates well with human affections &amp; virtues &amp; methinks you are too anxious: you have already enough for all wants — &amp; all necessary comforts — &amp; your heart is now your own. a single man needs only good raiment &amp; shelter. if his affections be not engaged &amp; these fail to make him happy — nothing can. that man should ever want these!</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Do you expect to find me altered much? I feel myself the same now as when I first began to feel: &amp; can trace the developement of my character thro every stage. it is tranquilized — not changed. remember you the first of March 1792?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The first issue of <title level="j">The Flagellant</title>, a collaboration between Southey and schoolfellows, including Grosvenor Charles Bedford, appeared on 1 March 1792.</note> how we stalked thro London streets — higher than all we met — I was then not quite eighteen when I begun the career of an author running plenum sed<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Latin translates as ‘full butt’.</note> against a great block with a wig on it —. five years produce strange changes in the little world of our own affairs!</p>
<p rend="indent1">	fare you well! the day is short. the work is long<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">An adaptation of ‘The Tale of Beryn’ (present in some variants of <title level="m">The Canterbury Tales</title>), line 3631.</note> — said Ali.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	I have just read Carlyles Arabic Translations<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Dacre Carlyle (1758–1804; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Specimens of Arabian Poetry, From the Earliest Time to the Extinction of the Kaliphat, with some Account of the Authors</title> (1796).</note>  — Zounds what stuff is called Poetry!</p>
