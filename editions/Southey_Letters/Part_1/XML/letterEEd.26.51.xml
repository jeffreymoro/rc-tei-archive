<p rend="indent1"> It is seldom <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> that I have felt any thing like reluctance in writing to you,
                    nor indeed ought I to feel it now. your invitation kind &amp; attractive as
                    it is, cannot be accepted by me <hi rend="ital">at the time you mention</hi>. on
                    the 18th of January I left home &amp; since that period have not seen any
                    one of my own family. it is now necessary to give some time to them &amp;
                    this it is my duty to do. as for inclination I must learn on many occasions to
                    bridle it. home is far from being to me the comfortable retreat you enjoy. I
                    have been so long inured to misery there that the idea of it when it comes
                    across happier scenes clouds them. keen as my relish is for the pleasures of
                    domestic life I have experienced them but little — perhaps I never may more but
                    my present disposition is not the most chearful &amp; I will hope better
                    scenes in store. some time this year however <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> I will pleasure
                    myself by visiting you, as I think of missing Michaelmas term &amp; will
                    then if you permit me make <ref target="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</ref> in my
                    road to <ref target="places.html#MountsfieldRye">Rye</ref>. after saying so much
                    you will not attempt to press me farther &amp; pain me to refuse. we shall
                    meet at the Installation. I have seldom looked to any period with greater
                    pleasure it is more than twelvemonths since we have seen each other &amp; in
                    despite of the various transactions which have <del rend="strikethrough">since</del> passed during that period I do not fancy myself altered in any
                    great respect. I am as visionary &amp; childish, or indeed more so, than
                    ever as noisy as wild &amp; sometimes as melancholy. you <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> are peculiarly
                    fortunate in escaping the four years purgatory of an University. to live so many
                    months without seeing one female being, or rather without speaking to one —
                    totally confined to the intercourse of men or boys your own age, is miserable.
                    here we have none of that mixed intercourse which polishes down our rough edges
                    &amp; renders us human. if the consequences of this defect can be good I
                    much wondering am much mistaken — the old fellows vegitate among their books —
                    the undergraduates take to the bottle for resourse, or the “mercenary retailers
                    of iniquity”<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is quoting a letter
                        written by Thomas Chatterton (1752–1770; <title level="m">DNB</title>) to a
                        Mr. Clayfield, as published in William Barrett (1727?–1789; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">The History and Antiquities of the City
                            of Bristol</title> (Bristol, 1789), p. 647.</note> — for me who am alike
                    disgusted by both when the clock strikes nine I generally get to bed &amp;
                    really find that the happiest time. in sober sadness (for I am both sad
                    &amp; sober) it were better both for me &amp; you, were I there now — so
                    good night. after my daily exercise I need not invoke Sleep. so you may perhaps
                    get a hymn in the morning when my faculties are awake for the undertaking. </p>

                    since I began <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</ref> is arrived
                    from Lisbon so you see another bar to my visiting you. you do not know how
                    unpleasantly I feel or how I force my own inclinations in refusing what you so
                    kindly &amp; so strongly request.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> as to <ref target="people.html#RoughWilliam">Rough</ref> it was
                    not with any idea of pressing you to engage in his schemes that I mentioned it.
                    he requested me to inform you &amp; in compliance I wrote. but <ref target="people.html#RoughWilliam">Rough</ref> is not a man upon whom either
                    you or I can place any dependance. he is all warmth &amp; kindness when you
                    see him but turn your back &amp; you are forgotten. for myself I would not
                    wish again to attempt as yet. twelve months hence or as much later as you please
                    &amp; I shall be ready without fear to venture upon the public. once a
                    fortnight I write an essay but this rule has been but lately adopted &amp;
                    when I have this letter I shall copy only the third produced in obedience to it.
                    it is upon [MS obscured] &amp; pleases me much, the subject is so copious
                    that it will fill another paper. have you seen my ode upon the same? as a
                    companion to Poetry which I believe you have with you.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have unfortunately forgotten your caution of leaving space for
                    the wafer. the word most likely to be obliterated is Romance.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> do not bring a horse with you. it will be expensive troublesome
                    &amp; useless. we have planned many delightful days. one to Blenheim one to
                    Godstow — to Abingdon &amp;c &amp;c. one evening to drink tea with <ref target="people.html#ThorpMr">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thorp</ref> who has
                    invited me when you come. but I shall receive no greater pleasure than from
                    seeing you once more. it is a long while since we met. <ref target="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Lamb</ref> will be with his <ref target="people.html#CombeEdward">Majesty</ref> at the Installation. Sir
                    Watkin herds with his brother.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Watkin
                        Williams Wynn (1772–1840; <title level="m">DNB</title>), elder brother of
                        Charles Watkin Williams Wynn.</note> let me hear from you soon &amp;
                    mention if you will come Tuesday. I should recommend a stage as the best mode if
                    you are too delicate to walk. &amp; indeed walking might fatigue you. I will
                    make <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> deliver his sentiments
                    upon this important subject. I recommend travelling in the stage. <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">C Collins</ref> will I think coincide in
                    opinion with me. by the by you must lecture him upon beastiality in
                    conversation. it is very strange than in a large party he should endeavour so to
                    attract notice. I shall set to him again when next we meet.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have &lt;seen&gt; your letter relative to <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref>. against him I feel no
                    resentment &amp; must only lament that I was too sincerely his friend ever
                    to think of him without regret. reconciliation I should be far from opposing,
                    but I doubt whether it would be worth the trouble. <ref target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">George</ref> can be firm in a case like
                    this &amp; perhaps he never would esteem me as he once did. I am not
                    conscious of having acted improperly &amp; can almost say with Job ‘oh that
                    my words were written in a book’<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey
                        is paraphrasing <title level="m">Job</title> 19: 23–24.</note> words
                    thoughts &amp; actions I need not blush for either. but notwithstanding this
                    rather than oppose a reconciliation I would rather part with my firmness founded
                    as it is upon rectitude than with affection perhaps not so well chosen.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> will you inform your father &amp; mother how much I feel
                    obliged by their invitation &amp; how much I regret the total impossibility
                    of accepting it. I know you will not press me farther. but rest assured that the
                    first moment I find it in my power I will please myself by visiting you.</p>
