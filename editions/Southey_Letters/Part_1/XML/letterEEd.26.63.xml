        <p rend="indent1">Whenever I sit down to write to you a thousand different subjects are so jumbled
                    in my strange brain &#8212; that the one confuses the other &amp; I wander from
                    all. your letter arrived to day &amp; relieved me from a great weight &#8212; the
                    apprehension that my baggage was lost &#8212; tho I jested upon the subject made me
                    very uneasy &#8212; when <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> seemd
                    anxious I laughd but my laugh (as it often is) was artificial &#8212; the rogue who
                    would wear my cloaths would do, what the erudite abomination of Israel never
                    did, with my papers &#8212; &amp; <del rend="strikethrough">I</del> far advanced
                    as I am in the science of Apathy &#8212; that would severely have afflicted me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">For once in my life I rejoiced that <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor Bedfords</ref> paper
                    was small &amp; his letter at the end &#8212; to suppose I felt otherwise than
                    grieved &amp; indignant at the fate of the unfortunate Queen of France<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Marie Antoinette was executed on 16
                        October 1793.</note> &#8212; was supposing me a brute &amp; to request an
                    avowal of what I felt, implied a suspicion that I did not feel. you seemd glad
                    when arguments against the system of Republicanism had faild &#8212; to grasp at the
                    crimes of wretches who call themselves Republicans &amp; stir up my feelings
                    against my judgment. it is as just as if you should urge the existence of the
                    Inquisition as an argument against Xtianity. for your feelings I make every
                    allowance &#8212; but tho you may indulge them in conversation you might be more cool
                    when you take up the pen. the infamous accusation hurt me certainly as much as
                    it did you &#8212; perhaps (from obvious reasons) more &#8212; but I have been too long
                    accustomed to brood over painful reflections in silence, ever to give vent to
                    passion. at this moment <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward</ref> is
                    crying for poor Antoinette &#8212; I could have done the same but tears lie as near
                    the eyes as curses do to the tongue &amp; there is as much reason in
                    indulging the one as the other. you have mentioned Hollefear<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably William Mainwaring Hollefear, educated
                        at Hertford College, Oxford, BA 1774, later Vicar of Wolvey.</note> in a
                    manner mysteriously disrespectful &#8212; why I know not but I perceive that without
                    knowing him I am following his example &amp; (perhaps <del rend="strikethrough">from the xxxxxxxxxx</del>) sinking into the same
                    eccentric philosophical &amp; miserable being. excuse me if I have said too
                    much relative to the Queen &#8212; I felt hurt at the supposition implied in your
                    letter &#8212; &amp; it seemed hard that you &lt;should&gt; apply to me to
                    execrate her death &#8212; when I heard the murder of the Mayor of Toulon<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> in silence. you will accuse
                    me of an undue partiality &#8212; act impartially &amp; you must acquit me. I can
                    condemn the crimes of the French &amp; yet be a Republican nor am I as you
                    have often stiled me merely a theoretical one.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Present my compliments to <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">your brother</ref> &amp; tell
                    him if I <del rend="strikethrough">tal</del> regulate thy intervals of my

                    punctuality but he I suppose has begun a new language &amp; in the course of
                    another week when he is tired of it &#8212; he may vouchsafe a line to me. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">So far in reply to part of your long expected &amp; his still expected
                    letter. it is a lamentable knowledge my dear friend, that the guilt must entail
