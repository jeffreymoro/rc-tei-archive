          <time>9 o clock at night</time> a most unusual date for me <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref>. but my mind is
                    full of indignation &amp; I generally keep a sheet of paper in readiness for
                    your benefit. I had dedicated this evening in idea to a serious versification to
                    conclude this letter when an old woman arrived (or rather old Lady for it is
                    wrong to profane the other name) <del rend="strikethrough">arrived</del>
                    &amp; spoilt my harmony of sentiment &amp; your letter. scandal religion
                    &amp; loyalty made up the conversation of the evening. the former most
                    ungrounded &amp; illiberal. for loyalty &#8212; nothing could equal the crime of
                    keeping the hat on whilst God save the King <del rend="strikethrough">on</del>
                    &lt;was sung&gt; &amp; to call a man a Democrat was more than
                    synonimous to villain. I had been introduced in the morning at a house where I
                    had long wishd an acquaintance. Mr H<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">His
                        identity is unknown.</note> the owner was pronounced a bad man of no
                    principles &amp; no religion. is he a good husband? the best of husbands. is
                    he a good father? it is impossible to be a better. such were the answers I
                    received &amp; yet this man is bad &amp; unprincipled. there
                    &lt;are&gt; a set of females in this world who pique themselves upon
                    going regularly to church &amp; exult in the possession of a certain virtue
                    which has not fallen because it never was attempted. whose whole conversation
                    consists of the politics of a card table &amp; that worst species of
                    licentiousness indiscriminate scandal. these are the people who would exclaim so
                    vehemently against Rousseau &#8212; who would bring faggots to an auto da fe &amp;
                    act with all the ferocity of Parisian Poissardes, in a worse cause if possible.
                    with such a one have I wasted three hours &#8212; &amp; now sick of the
                    illiberality of virtue I am almost ready to turn champion for vice. society is
                    in a very bad state &#8212; the inequalities between the sexes is dreadful. man may
                    plunge in guilt of the most atrocious nature &amp; not only escape uncensurd
                    but in some degree derive estimation from his crimes &#8212; but woman, framd perhaps
                    by nature of more delicate materials &amp; exposd to more temptations if
                    once she gives way to a very pardonable weakness is excluded from the pale of
                    society as if infected with some disorder fatal to virtue. you remember a

                    claim priviliges for indulging appetites which it is the province of Reason to
                    subdue? My dear friend Man is the most inconsistent of animals &#8212; he despises
                    woman when fallen &amp; yet employs every artifice to ruin her. many a
                    villain far more infamous than the Conventionists is respected &amp; courted
                    in this kingdom &#8212; whilst there are women worn out with famine &amp; disease

                    to that small circle in which the truest happiness is to be found. my dear <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> I often reflect
                    that there are women in the streets of London who might have made you &amp;
                    I happy &#8212; &amp; I never see the leer of vice upon a beautiful face without

                        whole of man dies, body and soul - a belief which our reason forbids us -
                        fame is nothing at all, since the man who is said to have won it doesn't
                        exist. But if the mind stays conscious when it is freed from the earthly
                        prison and seeks out heaven in freedom, surely it will despise every earthly
                    affair. In the experience of heaven it will rejoice in its delivery from earthly
                    things.'</note> yet Boethius inserted this very sentiment in a
                    work which he intended for immortality. would not this subject make a good paper
                    &#8212; immortality desired for its own sake is but a splendid failing but to seek it
                    by benefitting others is not only innocent but laudable. our old minstrels had
                    this merit. &amp; tho the Allegory may accuse the classical judgement of
