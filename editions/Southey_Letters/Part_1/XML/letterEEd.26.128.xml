        <p rend="indent1">	Some few weeks ago I was introduced to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Perkins<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey met Mr and Mrs Perkins (first names and dates unknown) in Bristol in 1795 and visited them at their home near Bradford-on-Avon.</note> here. they were on a visit &amp; I saw them frequently. he pleases me very much for his mind was active &amp; judicious &amp; benevolence written in every feature of his face. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Perkins was worthy of him. I never saw a woman superiour to her in mind &#8212; nor two people with a more rational affection for each other. on their quitting this place, they urged me to visit them at Bradford. a few days ago I was with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> at Bath &amp; resolved to walk over to tea. it is but six miles distant &amp; the walk extremely beautiful. I got to Bradford &amp; enquiring for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Perkins was directed two miles in the country to Freshford. my way lay by the side of the river. the hills around were well wooded the evening calm &amp; pleasant &#8212; it was <del rend="strikethrough">perf</del> quite May weather, &amp; as I was alone &amp; beholding only what was beautiful &amp; looking on to a pleasant interview &#8212; I had relapsed into my old mood of feeling benevolently &amp; keenly for all things. a man was sitting on the grass tying up his bundle, &amp; of him I askd if I was right for Freshford. he told me he was going there. does M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Perkins live there? yes. he buried his wife last Tuesday. I was thunder struck. Good God &#8212; I saw her but a few weeks ago. aye Sir. ten days ago she was as well as you are &#8212; but she is in Freshford churchyard now!</p>

          <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> I cannot describe to you what I felt. the man thought I had lost a relation. it was with great difficulty I could resolve in proceeding to see him &#8212; however I thought <del rend="strikethrough">brought</del> it a kind of duty &amp; went. guess my delight on finding another M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Perkins to whom I had been directed by mistake.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	You do not know what I suffered under the impression of her death or the relief I felt at discovering the mistake. strange selfishness. this man too had lost a wife &#8212; a young wife but lately married &#8212; who perhaps he loved. &amp; I &#8212; I rejoiced at his lost because it was not my friend </p>
        <p rend="indent1">	yet without this selfishness Man would be an apathir an animal below the ouran outang. it is mortifying to analize our noblest affections &amp; find them all bottomed on selfishness. I hear of thousands killed in battle &#8212; I read of the young &#8212; the virtuous dying &amp; think of them no more. why if my very dog died I should weep for him. if I lost you &#8212; I should feel a lasting affliction. if <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> were to die I should follow her.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I am dragged into a party of pleasure tomorrow for two days. an hours hanging would be luxury to me compared with these detestable schemes. party of pleasure!
