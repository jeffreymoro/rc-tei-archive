                        mothers</ref> affairs <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</ref>
                    has no reason to think me inattentive or neglectful. I could indeed have advised
                    her to quit her present situation, but <del rend="strikethrough">of</del> what
                        <del rend="strikethrough">avail</del> would that advice have availed, barren
                    of assistance as it must have been? &#8212; it would have been like advising a <del rend="strikethrough">debtor</del> sick prisoner to change the air. as to my
                    reserve towards him &#8212; here indeed he is justly displeased. I do not wish to
                    excuse or palliate what I know to have &lt;been&gt; wrong. yet there
                    &lt;were&gt; many powerful motives that occasioned this. a young man
                    easily opens his heart to those of his own age who are endeared to him by a real
                    or imagined similarity of sentiment; but the same feelings that in that case
                    induce a hasty &amp; credulous confidence, occasion a reserve towards those
                    of whose approbation he is doubtful. I had informed <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</ref> by letter, before he thought
                    of taking me abroad with him, of all my future expectations. I could not enter
                    upon this subject in conversing with him, because I had frustrated all his plans
                    for me. I feard he would disapprove my plan of making a book, when my knowledge
                    must necessarily be so little of the subject &#8212; but that I should make a book was
                    absolutely necessary to my support. I would have sent him the manuscript,
                    &amp; wished to do it; but I had a Counsellor more importunate than wisdom,
                    &#8220;malesuada Fames&#8221;,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Virgil (70&#8211;19 BC),

                        as &#8216;crime-provoking Hunger&#8217;.</note> &amp; it went to the press sheet by
                    sheet as it was written: indeed it is not strange that I have written
                    incorrectly. I could develope to you the motives for every part of my conduct,
                    but this were useless. I have written to <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</ref> without reserve; henceforth he shall have no cause for
                    displeasure</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of your friendly offer of assistance I have fortunately now no
                    need. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</ref> affairs will
                    now I hope be settled. I am very anxious to have her live with me, it would
                    increase her happiness &amp; very much lessen <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncles</ref> expences. I thank you
                    likewise for what you tell me respecting <ref target="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</ref>; I was never with him a fortnight, till my journey to
                    Lisbon; by letter I had always been unreserved towards him, but there <del rend="strikethrough">is</del> were a thousand causes to prevent the
                    confidence of unembarrassed conversation. all this I hope is over, I have
                    followed your advice in my letter as closely as was possible, &amp; said
                    every thing for the past as well as for the present. I can write to him with
                    pleasure now that I have a subsistence, &amp; am embarked in a profession
                    which promises independance.</p>

                    thought ill of me. he was very kind to me at Lisbon, but it was a house in which
                    I never felt wholly at ease. I fancied M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Burn<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Jane (dates unknown), wife of William

                    can mingle in a common mob &amp; look over their heads, but a crowd of
                    company is to me a very sad solitude.</p>

                    I have procured his release by the first cartel. we hear a very high account of
                    him from the gentleman who interested himself for us at Plymouth in this
                    business. I have a letter from him to thank me &amp; he gives me his address
                    at Nantes. one day I hope to see France, &amp; I would go a long way there
                    to see this man.</p>

          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">My brothers</ref> Captain<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Robert Barlow (1757&#8211;1843; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> is a worthless wicked man &amp; behaves very
                    unkindly &amp; insolently to Tom because he thinks him friendless. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref> has that proud spirit which
                    every man who knows his own conduct to be irreproachable ought to have. I
                    respect him as much as I love him &#8212; he received ten pounds prize money only a
                    few weeks ago, &amp; sent half of it to <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">his mother</ref>. how little my friend
                    are acts of private virtue known or rewarded in this world! the Jews ought to
                    have been a very good people because their rewards were temporal. I feel very
                    angry at reflecting that such a life as my brothers should be at the mercy of a
                    sea captain. it is not many months since he was sent to board a <del rend="strikethrough">prize</del> vessel in such weather that the boat must
                    inevitably have sunk in attempting to reach her &#8212; &amp; yet he could not
                    refuse or remonstrance, &amp; would have perished if a Lieutenant with him
                    had not ordered them to give over the attempt. this is called discipline. there
                    was no man on board his vessel would have risqued his life in the leaky prize
                    for the prize money <del rend="strikethrough">they</del> &lt;he&gt;
                    might share. if <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref> had
                    brought her into port his share would not have exceeded five guineas, but the
                    Captains would have been considerable, &amp; his loss nothing if those he
                    sent on board had been drowned. I have made application to have my brother
                    removed to another ship. tis a horrible life. I had rather associate with the
                    Botany Bay colonists than with the crew of a man of war. Some of the
                    Swedenbourgians <del rend="strikethrough">have</del> believe that every man will
                    meet the kind of heaven he imagined in the next world, &amp; that the
                    enjoyment of <del rend="strikethrough">this</del> &lt;it&gt; will be
                        <del rend="strikethrough">their</del> &lt;his&gt; hell till <del rend="strikethrough">they are</del> &lt;he is&gt; fully sensible of
                        <del rend="strikethrough">their</del> &lt;his&gt; error &amp;
                        has<del rend="strikethrough">e</del> learnt to form the wish of wisdom. I
                    wonder what strange place they allot for sailours! they have every thing good to
                    learn, &amp; what is the more difficult task, a great deal to forget. the
                    ancients had a comfortable fiction in their waters of Lethe<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">In classical mythology, a river in the
                        underworld bringing forgetfulness to anyone who drank there.</note> &#8212; I have
                    a more comfortable belief that the remembrance of error will be wisdom.</p>
