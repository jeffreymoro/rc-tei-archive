                    with adventures. you may sometimes fall in with striking characters but if you
                    go from Oxford they will in general be strikingly bad. Radford<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Arundel Radford (d. 1824), a student at Exeter

                    as good as the rest so you may guess the capacities of my fellow travellers. in
                    short the journey was hot &amp; unpleasant. the horses were obliged to be
                    bled &amp; I was brute enough to remain in the coach.</p>

                    disappointment soon checked them &amp; the rest of the evening passed
                    heavily &amp; sadly. the next morning I rose at five &amp; walked
                    thirteen miles home to breakfast. here I am the most insulated being existing

                    practicable &amp; I almost fear, too good to be general. yesterday night I
                    saw a woman digging a grave &amp; every hour I see others, like so many
