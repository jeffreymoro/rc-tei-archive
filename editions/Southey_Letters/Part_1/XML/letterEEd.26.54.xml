                    author-ity or-ship) so much for Humes life from one who knew him. I do not

                    prostituted by villains &amp; disgraced by fools. Xtianity is the purest of
                    moral systems. Deism &#8212; will do well for the philosopher whose cool calm passions
                    may be governed by the principles of Reason &amp; Morality &#8212; but the minds
                    of the million require a more powerful tie. they must be actuated by hope
                    &amp; fear two master springs admirably touchd by religion. even a Deist
                    will not deny this. the best &amp; wisest of mankind have believed this
                    religion; upon a subject where Reason fails to reason is absurd. it is
                    impossible in favour of any thing where every thing must rest upon supposition.
