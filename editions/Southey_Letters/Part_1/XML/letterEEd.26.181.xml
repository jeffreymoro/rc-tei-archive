<p rend="indent1">	The Duke of Northumberland<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland (1742–1817; <title level="m">DNB</title>), a soldier and politician.</note> is a man of remarkable arrogance. &amp; his pride &amp; his folly are equally manifest by what you mentiond of his placing his pedigree among the tombs of his ancestors. he found himself very awkwardly situated at Lisbon thro this aristocratic spirit. the English merchants there associate with the first nobles of the country. but the Duke thought fit to draw a line of distinction between them, &amp; always invite the tiers etat by themselves. they were of course offended &amp; he found himself without society.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	as for the MSS at <ref target="places.html#Wynnstay">Wynnstay</ref> you are my authority. I think you mentioned it in a letter from Elton. if I have only dreamt this the dream must have made a strange impression, for it is a circumstance which I have frequently mentioned, &amp; laid some stress upon. at any rate Geoffrey of M.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The historian, and Bishop of St Asaph, Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154/1155; <title level="m">DNB</title>), whose works included <title level="m">The Historia Regum Britanniae</title>; see Southey to the Editor of the <title level="m">Monthly Magazine</title>, 6 September 1796 (Letter 175).</note>

<p rend="indent1">	the verdant copy puzzled you. know then that for the accommodation of such of my friends as are curious or <del rend="strikethrough">are</del> troubled with weak eyes, I &lt;can&gt; get the books died to any shade of green: to me infinitely more agreable than the dazzling reflection from white paper. my little volume of poems<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title level="m">Poems</title> (1797).</note> are just begun &amp; you shall have them in six weeks. the Triumph of Woman the B Bay Eclogues &amp; a Hymn to the Penates form the chief features.
