                    you do not want support. a half-hearted man can never succeed in any-thing.
                    whatever we would do well, we must do with all our hearts &amp; with all our
                    strength. the study of law you would also find irksome. you would <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> have little time &amp; less inclination,

                    know he wishes you to persevere &#8212; but you may convince him that you have no
