                    disputes have more frequently been owing to a difference in terms than in
                    opinion. when you speak of the mercenary motives to action you are but one step
                    from the ground on which I build my principles. if virtue be sought for in the
                    present system of things it must be for its own sake &amp; its reward as
                    being most pure is likewise abstract. riches titles places &amp; pensions

                    recompense of virtue upon earth. this lamentable prejudice is early inculcated
                    &amp; strongly supported. as you observe gain is the chief engine of
                    education, &amp; pride the first sentiment taught. my own experience tells
                    me this. I was early warned not to play with dirty little boys &amp;
                    caressed &amp; corrected with equal injustice. the catechise has given me
                    many a weary hour. forgive egotism if I mention one circumstance which happened
                    above twelve years ago. I was struck with the apparent falshood in &#8220;I believe in

                    reprimanded for impiety, but the passage was never explained &amp; I was
                    silenced instead of convinced till Greek gave the information. fortunately I
                    escaped utter ruin from such an education of which more particulars would be as

                    could look into my mind &amp; read it thro. perhaps you little think that

                    antient Greece over the rest of the world. perhaps this may in some measure be
                    imputed to the philosophers but more I believe to the conscious dignity of
                    independance. where abilities command more respect than wealth or titles &#8212;
                    &amp; virtue is more honourd than a long pedigree, it is morally impossible
                    that the mercenary motives should prevail. Socrates did he live now would be
                    treated as an itinerant field preacher &amp; Plato would be transported for
                    sedition. Athens as yet is unrivalld in the history of the world for astonishing
                    virtue &amp; as astonishing folly &#8212; yet it may be doubted whether its
                    advantages did not counterbalance its defects.</p>
