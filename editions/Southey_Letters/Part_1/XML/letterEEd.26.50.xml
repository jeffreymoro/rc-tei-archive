<ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Seward</ref> after taking his degree left
                    Oxford yesterday. I accompanied him with <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnet</ref> twelves miles on his road &amp; there took leave of a man
                    with whom I have past some part of every day since the 30<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
                    of January. as we past by a church <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnet</ref> mentioned that the Sexton had been a soldier. I replied by an
                    easy transition — he — has spent one half his life in murdering his fellow
                    creatures &amp; the other in burying them. — the circumstance appeared odd
                    &amp; whilst considering in what mould some peoples hearts were cast I fell
                    into a reverie or waking dream if you like the term better, for which you will
                    the better or the worse as it may please your fancy. when any thing strikes me I
                    always think of a paper.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I was wandering in the store house of Nature &amp; wondering
                    at the various strange objects that presented themselves to me. (fill up the
                    antichambers &amp; rooms as you will for this must one day make a paper give
                    me likewise whom you please for a guide) at length I reachd the laboratory where
                    the several guides of man were fashioning hearts. a stern broad figure whom we
                    knew for Ambition was hewing some out of marble. &amp; near him stood a
                    little haggard wretch busily employed in melting gold for the same purpose yet
                    much alloyed by Lead. Caprice was moulding hearts of clay in a thousand
                    different forms. painting butterflies — genealogies — coins — mutilated statues
                    — &amp; monsters — one figure I observed endeavouring to form some of sponge
                    — but these were no sooner filld with wine than they lost all resemblance to the
                    human heart. in a dark corner of the room sat a sullen sad faced figure with a
                    broad phylactery a large band &amp; an immense wig. as this workman had just
                    begun with infinite pains to form a heart I had an opportunity of observing the
                    whole process. it was a block of black marble &amp; the figure of a mitre
                    most indelibly impressd in various parts of it. the gibbet the rack &amp;
                    the scourge were plentifully pourtraied on it. imagining this was almost
                    finished I was about to have retired when my conductor stopt me to see the
                    conclusion — for added he this heart is by no means yet compleated. the workman
                    casd over this innermost block with a kind of plaister &amp; upon this I saw
                    paper Lexicons &amp; Scholiasts. over this was a thin viel inscribed
                    moderation fatherly love affection, liberality. to whom this belongs I think
                    Bedford you will want no information. opposite this figure Liberality &amp;
                    Genius were busied in tempering the finest earth of Paradise with the milk of
                    human kindness. science was polishing &amp; true religion adding the last
                    refinement. perhaps Bedford the Modesty with which it was mixed will tempt you
                    to disown this heart. but Truth &amp; Experience both <del rend="strikethrough">told</del>affirmed it &amp; Reason &amp;
                    Friendship were too well convinced even to doubt. here said Nature taking down
                    an urn is a heart upon which I bestowed more than ordinary pains. Parnassus<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mount Parnassus, mythical home of the
                        Muses.</note> furnished the clay &amp; the font of Helicon<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In Greek mythology, the waters of mount Helicon
                        were sacred to the Muses.</note> tempered it — &lt;with&gt; dew from
                    the violet that grew upon the grave of Sappho.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The lyric poetess Sappho (b. c. mid C7 BC).</note> but I
                    instilled too much Sensibility the heart was too yielding — it was too much my
                    own, &amp; Rousseau was unhappy. here is another too with materials equally
                    good but unhappily the due mixture of Piety was forgotten &amp; the fatal
                    draught chilled the heart of Chatterton.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Chatterton (1752–1770; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> here is
                    a heart composed with wonderful skill but for want of sufficient moist the pores
                    are always thirsty &amp; incapable of retaining any thing else — as fast as
                    friendship makes an impression Intemperance blots it out. you have known the
                    owner said Reflection. are you acquainted this said Nature. shewing me one of
                    Plaister of Paris in its pulverized state. this was easily impressed &amp;
                    easily lost the impression but look how changed — in a moment it was grown hard
                    &amp; she held it out — as I gazed upon the impression — I recollected
                    &amp; began to feel if my own heart was in my bosom.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> when once <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> you begin to reflect rationally a reverie is over. Reason has
                    clipped the wings of Imagination. I was jogging along the road &amp;
                    forgetting the hearts looked for a milestone.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> I have walked to and from Cambridge since last I wrote to you. we
                    made Stowe in our way — &amp; passed thro Bicester — Buckingham — Old
                    Stratford — Stoney Stratford Newport Pagnel. Bedford. Buckden. Huntingdon —
                    Godmanchester &amp; Fen Stanton in our road there. this route made the walk
                    exactly one hundred miles which we performed in two days &amp; a half. 33
                    the first. 41 the second &amp; 26 the other half. from Cambridge we went by
                    water to Ely (where I had a most strange adventure) &amp; returned the same
                    &lt;way&gt; rowing almost 40 miles in one day. we returned through
                    Royston Baldock Hitchen Dunstable Tring Aylesbury &amp; Thame 83 miles
                    &amp; reachd Oxford on the twelfth day from our departure in as good health
                    &amp; better spirits than we left it.</p>

<ref target="people.html#BunburyCharlesJohn">Bunbury</ref> passed me once or
                    twice &amp; looked the other way. at length we met by a gate way &amp;
                    he was obliged to speak but so confounded he was that I pitied him. our
                    conversation lasted about one minute &amp; I relieved him of my presence. I
                    saw <ref target="people.html#RoughWilliam">Rough</ref> there &amp; he wished
                    much to engage in a periodical paper saying that he would manage the printing at
                    Cambridge &amp; did not doubt its succeeding there. I told
                    &lt;him&gt; that provided a good plan was laid down &amp; we had
                    enough to undertake it I had no objection &amp; indeed rather wished it than
                    otherwise. I likewise promised to mention it to you. are you Bedford any ways
                    inclined once more to venture in such unlucky company? I will not pretend to
                    manage the helm in so perilous a sea but I can tug at the oar &amp; sing as
                    I pull till my arms drop off with fatigue. tho’ I have still some little
                    cacoethes remaining I hope I have lost much of those sanguine expectation with
                    which Vanity had once so inflated me. not that the failure of the Flagellant
                    damped them for of that I am still proud — but to my ideas the pleasure of
                    gratifying a few friends with those productions which partiality will make them
                    esteem is infinitely more delightful than the applause of critics or the echo of
                    popular praise. will you write soon upon this subject &amp; believe
