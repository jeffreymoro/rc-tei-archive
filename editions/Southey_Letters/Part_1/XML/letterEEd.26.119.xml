        <p>My dear Grosvenor. If I were not very well acquainted with your disposition I
                    should apprehend by your long silence that you were offended with me. in one
                    letter I spoke perhaps too warmly but you know my affections are warm &#8212; I was
                    sorry at having so done &amp; wrote to say so. the jolting of a rough cart
                    over rugged roads is very apt to excite tumults in the intestinal canal &#8212; even
                    so are the rubs of Fortune prone to create the gizzard-grumblings of temper.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Now if you are not angry with me (&amp; on my soul I believe
                    you &amp; anger to be perfectly heterogeneous) you will write to me very
                    shortly. if you are &#8212; why you must remain so for a fortnight &#8212; then it is
                    probable I shall pass two days in London on my way to Cambridge &#8212; &amp; as
                    one of them will be purely to be with you if I do not remove all cause of
                    complaint you have against Robert Southey &#8212; you shall punish him with your
                    everlasting displeasure.</p>

                    too I hear nothing. were I on the Allegany mountains or buried in the wilds of
