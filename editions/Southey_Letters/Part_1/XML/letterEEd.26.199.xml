<p>Now, my dear Edith, ... am I of Gray’s Inn; where I this day paid twelve pounds fifteen shillings for admission. ... <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, you must come to me. I am not merely uncomfortable, I am unhappy without you. I rise in the morning without expecting pleasure from the day, and I lie down at night without one wish for the morning. This town presents to me only a wilderness. ... I am just returned from ——— ; they can receive us for 40<hi rend="ital">l</hi>. a year: — two rooms, they are not large, but they are handsomely furnished, and there is a good book-case, and every thing looks clean. ... Direct to me at <ref target="people.html#Peacockunknown">Mr. Peacocks</ref>, <ref target="places.html#ProspectPlaceLondon">No. 20, Prospect Place, Newington Butts</ref>, near London; but, my dear <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>, there is ‘no prospect’ in this vile neighbourhood.</p>
