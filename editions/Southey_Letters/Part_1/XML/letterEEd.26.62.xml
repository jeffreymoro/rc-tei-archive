                    buried the money in two places — then went to Crœsus the emperor &amp; told
                    him that they dealt with the Devil &amp; would discover him subterranean

                    makes me very uneasy — the loss of what is intrinsically worth only the price of

<p rend="indent1"> this may perhaps pass one of yours or of <ref target="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">your brothers</ref> on the road —
                    I have been long expecting to hear from you — the history of Philosophy tho
                    amusing &amp; replete with instruction is yet too mystical to dwell upon for
                    any length of time — is it not one proof of human absurdity that men possessed
                    of the talents of Plato Aristotle &amp; Epicurus should rather advance
                    nonsense respecting theology &amp; cosmogeny than fairly

                    that Deity otherwise than perfect — were contradictory to Reason. thus far
                    Reason can lead us with safety — she can likewise judge from the benignity of an
                    all good creator in what manner Man may act most gratifying to all-mighty
                    benevolence — this is real Philosophy — but when Fancy thrusts herself into the
                    throne of Reason &amp; boldly leads into the regions of abstraction
                    metaphysics &amp; absurdity — instead of admiring the ingenuity we should
                    rather lament abilities so perverted.</p>
<p rend="indent1"> Of the various sects that once adorned the republic of Athens to
                    me that of Epicurus whilst it maintained its original purity appears most
                    consonant to human Reason — I am not speaking of his metaphysics &amp;

                    when the Philosopher declared that the ultimate design of life is happiness
                    &amp; happiness consists in virtue — he laid the foundation of a system
                    which might have benefitted mankind — his life was the most temperate — his

                    people with Philosophers governed by the laws of Plato — from whom the city
                    should be called Platonopolis. Gallienus who was himself an elegant scholar —
                    was pleased with the plan but his friends dissuaded him from the experiment. the
                    design would certainly have proved impracticable in that declining &amp;
                    degenerate age — most probably in any age — new visionary enthusiasts would have
                    been continually arising — fresh sects formd &amp; each would have been
                    divided &amp; subdivided till all was anarchy — yet I cannot help wishing
                    the experiment had been tried — it could not have been productive of evil

                    would have been granted — despotism is perhaps a blessing under such men — but
