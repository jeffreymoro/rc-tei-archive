                    amusing &amp; replete with instruction is yet too mystical to dwell upon for
                    any length of time &#8212; is it not one proof of human absurdity that men possessed
                    of the talents of Plato Aristotle &amp; Epicurus should rather advance
                    nonsense respecting theology &amp; cosmogeny than fairly
                    &lt;confess&gt; their ignorance &amp; the unimportance of the
                    subject? to deny the existence of a Deity were impossible &#8212; &amp; to suppose
                    that Deity otherwise than perfect &#8212; were contradictory to Reason. thus far
                    Reason can lead us with safety &#8212; she can likewise judge from the benignity of an
                    all good creator in what manner Man may act most gratifying to all-mighty
                    benevolence &#8212; this is real Philosophy &#8212; but when Fancy thrusts herself into the
                    throne of Reason &amp; boldly leads into the regions of abstraction
                    metaphysics &amp; absurdity &#8212; instead of admiring the ingenuity we should
                    rather lament abilities so perverted.</p>
