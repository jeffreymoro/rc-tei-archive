        <p rend="indent3"> I write to you upon the subject of the vignettes again, because
                    it has been recommended from many quarters, &amp; by those who know how
                    books sell. they tell me that ornaments of this kind accelerate the sale of a
                    book; &amp; as far as my own observations go &#8212; I may say my own <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxxx x xxxxx</del> feelings &#8212; they agree with the
                    remark. I have been calculating what the surplus would be to expend in prints,
                    if the book were sold at six shillings &#8212; &amp; I find the 500 nine pences
                    amount to &#163;18&#8211;17&#8211;0. now two vignettes &amp; the Gaspar Poussin<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The French-Italian painter Gaspard Dughet
                        (1615&#8211;1675), who assumed the surname Poussin when he was adopted as the heir
                        of Nicholas Poussin (1594&#8211;1665). Southey is possibly referring to Poussin&#8217;s
                            <title level="m">The Cascade</title>.</note> would be enough. I am told
                    the vignettes <del rend="strikethrough">for Cookes</del> such as Cookes<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a member (or members) of the

                    be had for five guineas each; &amp; the engravings of the landscape will
                    then come within the sum allotted. the point is &#8212; will it accelerate the sale? &#8212;
                    think you upon this &#8212; &amp; let me speedily know the result of your thoughts
                    &#8212; that &#8212; if they incline toward tickling the public eye &#8212; I may see something
                    about it personally. we leave town in a fortnight. but I have now access to
                    &lt;the&gt; artists thro Opie.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Opie (1761&#8211;1807; <title level="m">DNB</title>), Cornish-born artist,
                        who specialised in portraiture and history painting.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Opie is indeed a very extraordinary man. I have now twice seen
                    him. without any thing of politeness, his manners are pleasing, tho their
                    freedom is out of the common; &amp; his conversation, tho in a half-uttered
                    half-Cornish half-croak, is interesting. <del rend="strikethrough">perhaps</del>
                    there &lt;is a&gt; strange contrast between his genius, which is not
                    confined to painting, &amp; the vulgarity of his appearance &#8212; <del rend="strikethrough">perhaps</del> of his manners &amp; language
                    sometimes. you will however easily conceive that a man who can paint like Opie
                    must display the same taste on other subjects. he is very fond of Spenser &#8212; no
                    author furnishes so many pictures he says &#8212; You may have seen his Britomart
                    delivering Amoret. he has begun a picture from Spenser which he <del rend="strikethrough">says</del> himself thinks his best design &#8212; but it has
                    remaind untouchd for three years. the outline is wonderfully fine. it is the
                    delivery of Serena from the Salvages by Calepine. you will find the story in the
                    sixth book of the Faery Queen somewhere about the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or

                        Gregory&gt;: Inserted in another hand. Dr George Gregory (1754&#8211;1808;
                            <title level="m">DNB</title>), Church of England clergyman and author;
                        his writings included a life of Thomas Chatterton (1752&#8211;1770; <title level="m">DNB</title>), published in 1789.</note> to day. a very brawn
                    looking man &#8212; of most episcopal pinguitude &#8212; &amp; full moon cheeks. there
                    is much tallow in him. I like his wife.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Gregory had married a Miss Nunes (dates unknown), daughter of a Liverpool
                        merchant.</note> &amp; perhaps like him too &#8212; but his Xtianity is of an
                    intolerant order &#8212; &amp; he affects a solemnity when talking of it which
                    savours of the high priest. when he comes before the Physiognomical Tribunal, we
                    must melt him down: &#8212; he is too portly. &#8212; I sup with him on Sunday next.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> &#8212; I left my letter unfinished &#8212; in case I might hear from you by
                    this days post. but the hour is gone by.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Will you be good enough to send me the plan &amp; rules of
                    one of your reading societies for <ref target="people.html#Peacockunknown">Mr
                        Peacock</ref>?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have made many enquiries for the Pucelle of Chapelain<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">An account of Jean Chapelain&#8217;s (1595&#8211;1674)
                        epic poem <title level="m">La Pucelle ou la France D&#233;livr&#233;e</title> was
                        included in the second edition of Southey&#8217;s <title level="m">Joan of
                            Arc</title>, published in 1798.</note> &#8212; but still in vain. this is very
                    unfortunate &#8212; as I can begin no systematic alteration of Joan of Arc till I see
                    what he has done. you know likewise my intention of giving an analysis of his
                    work. about the ninth book I am puzzled by opposite opinions &#8212; so probably it
                    will remain &#8212;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall expect to hear from you soon about the prints. am I ever
                    to expect the parcel?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> farewell. you will hear from me again before we leave town. the
                    spring comes on rapidly &#8212; &amp; I repine at every day we lose. but the state
                    of hope &#8212; unalloyed by fear &#8212; is a pleasant one,</p>
