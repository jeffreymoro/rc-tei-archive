          <salute>Dear Bedford </salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I ought certainly to have returned you my best thanks as well for your letters as your giving up the Flagellant. I would have wrote sooner but I have no longer the consolation of having acted either properly or consistently &#8212; what had happened from malice &amp; tyranny I could bear but when I have stooped to mean&lt;n&gt;ess &amp; falshood I cannot find that pride in reflection necessary to comfort. I look upon myself with contempt &amp; fly from the hideous retrospect. <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> I have been obliged to write to <ref target="people.html#VincentWilliam">Vincent</ref> to confess myself wrong &#8212; I deserve to be despised I deserve to be shunned but I do not think you will despise me &#8212; more than once have I approachd the very brink of destruction still however I live in the hope of revenge &amp; that hope is the only thing which can render life supportable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> your last leaves me in an unpleasant suspense you have some <hi rend="ital">virtuous</hi> &amp;c action to tell me &#8212; accustomed as we are to such complicated meanness &amp; villany it must be something very bad to surprize me &#8212; I am not quite eighteen &amp; few men of eighty have been more persecuted &#8212; but disappointment &amp; misery are the portion of all my family &amp; I must bear my part &#8212; were I to lay open the whole history of these misfortunes you would think it scarcely credible, still less so that I could survive them &#8212; hope &amp; the firm dignity of conscious merit have hitherto supported me, the last of these is gone &#8212; I am despicable in my own eyes &amp; criminal in those of my friends where then can I look for assistance &#8212; hope can bring little.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> the Flagellant is gone &#8212; still however do I think that our joint production may acquire some credit &#8212; the sooner we have a volume &lt;published&gt; the better &#8212; the Medley &#8212; the Hodge Podge &#8212; the Whatdoyoucall it &#8212; or to retain our old plan Monastic lucubrations any of these titles or any better you may propose will do. shall we dedicate it to Envy Hatred Malice &amp; all Uncharitableness?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Powerful arbitrators of the minds of men &#8212; ye twin sisters who have already honoured us with your marked attention &#8212; ye who can convert innocence into treason &amp; shielded by the arm of power remain secure &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <del rend="strikethrough">x</del> shall we dedicate it to the Shade of Elizabeth<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth I (1533&#8211;1603; reigned 1558&#8211;1603; <title level="m">DNB</title>) had re-founded Westminster School in 1560.</note> &#8212; or to the <ref target="people.html#VincentWilliam">Doctor</ref> or to the Devil or to the King or to Ourselves &#8212;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Gentlemen</p>

        <p>I see no reason why we should not publish pretty soon it will be at least four months before we can prepare it for the press &amp; surely by that time we may venture again upon the world</p>

          <l rend="indent2">Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders</l>
