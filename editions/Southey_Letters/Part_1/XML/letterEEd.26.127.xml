                    probability of erring if I answered in the affirmative. perhaps the female heart
                    is more alive to affection than mans &#8212; &amp; the dangerous error entailed
                    upon them by education is &#8212; that they almost always act from their feelings
                    &amp; not from fixed principles. you may be assured that no fixed principles
