          <ref target="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</ref> left us on Thursday morning last for Manchester, where he will study two years before he mounts the pulpit. I have a longer course of study to look on to &#8212; my rhyming days are almost over &#8212; &amp; considering how much I have done I have not been very long about it. tho I am thrown back a year or two I do not regret the time thus occupied &#8212; Joan of Arc may give pleasure, &amp; cannot do harm.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</ref> has been at the Hot Wells with his wife. she is dying in a consumption. perhaps you may know something of her &#8212; her father is D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Forster of Oxford &amp; she had a brother at <ref target="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</ref>. she was a widow with two children when <ref target="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</ref> married her, her fortune enough for herself &amp; them &#8212; but he was to support himself. an odd bargain. he behaves to her with the utmost attention. she is a woman of accomplishments &#8212; but I hear of dissipation &#8212; her physiognomy is bad, &amp; tho he will of course severely feel her loss &#8212; I do not think it can be deemd a severe misfortune.</p>

          <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> has been lately with me. I had not seen him since I left Oxford &#8212; &amp; you may easily guess what a thousand things we had mutually to communicate. he is at present with great industry &amp; the fairest prospects studying the Law. he enquird for you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I expected <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> &#8212; but an abscess near the os coccygis unfortunately confined him. the knife of a skilful surgeon has cured him &#8212; &amp; he is now going to Hastings for the benefit of Sea Air.</p>

I believe no man has more knowledge &#8212; &amp; no man makes a less parade of it. his brother is lately made Governor of Canada,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Elmsley&#8217;s brother, John Elmsley (1762&#8211;1805), was Chief Justice of Upper Canada from 1796 to 1802, and of Lower Canada from 1802 to 1805.</note> &amp; he thinks of travelling in America for two or three years.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">	my Joan of Arc has been very succesful. I sold the copy-right to <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</ref> &#8212; than whom there does not exist a more excellent man. my own profits have been about eighty guineas. the book has had no friends to assist it &#8212; it has however acquired reputation enough. my Letters<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> was published in 1797.</note> are in the Press &#8212; &amp; with a small volume of Poems will finish my literary career &#8212; which I shall thus have concluded at an age when others usually begin. among the Poems will be The Triumph of Woman which I believe you have seen &#8212; &amp; the Botany Bay Eclogues. a Hymn to the Dii penates<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title level="m">Poems</title> (1797), published in December 1796.</note>  is to conclude it.</p>
