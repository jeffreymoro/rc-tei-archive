        <p rend="indent2">		After exploring the treasures of <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottles</ref> parcel I sit down to what I have for some days intended to do. your letter has arrived in time for me to reply to it. What <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> has repeated to me of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</ref> expressions, was related to explain his own conduct towards me at Bristol, why he shunned me, &amp; &lt;why&gt; when with me &lt;he&gt; was silent &amp; reserved. <del rend="strikethrough">he had</del> it was after <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; I were in habits of speaking that these expressions were used: the only effect they will produce upon me will be to prevent the visit to Stowey, which I had before two motives for wishing, that <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> might see <ref target="people.html#FrickerSarah">her sister</ref>, &amp; that I might see <ref target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> whose guests we were to be &amp; from whom the invitation came. for refusing to go I have ostensible pleas enough. to what you say of the propriety of being on tolerable terms with him I compleatly assent, nor have I any intention of breaking them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyds</ref> opinion of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> is what I apprehend yours to be &#8212; a perception of his inconsistencies but a belief that he never acts wilfully wrong: he has the opinion of his talents which every body must have, &amp; that love for him which <del rend="strikethrough">nobody else</del> few others possess. this state of mind I have no wish to alter. I never did &amp; I never shall make <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> a single enemy. I never attacked his character, but I have defended my own, tho seldom, &amp; never of my own accord. for the opinion of the world I have acquired a thorough contempt, &amp; the experiences of the last five or six years has taught me not to be anxious for that <del rend="strikethrough">friendship</del> of individuals. I would willingly be of service to <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref>, therefore I went to Birmingham, &amp; now give him a home do not suppose I am in the high frenzy fever of friendship, for I would do the same for any man who wanted my assistance &amp; who I thought deserved it: from a general principle, not a particular feeling. he is well in health &amp; spirits; the way is straight before him &amp; he says he never was so happy as at present. the having him with me is rather unpleasant than otherwise &#8212; I do not want a companion; his habits of untidiness do not assort with mine, &amp; he will most probably prevent me from spending that time at Bath &amp; Bristol which would been very agreable to <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> &amp; myself, &amp; which I should find of very great use to my revisal of Joan of Arc,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> appeared in 1798.</note> from the command of the Library.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</ref> is with us, &amp; very greatly mended by the <ref target="places.html#Burton">Burton</ref> air. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> too is here, so that I have a large family.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I am sorry you have your book bound as it will be spoiled. a book ought never to be bound till it has been printed at least a year; the oiliness of the ink requires that length of time to dry, &amp; unless it be dry <del rend="strikethrough">x</del>must spoil the opposite page.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I have blundered in the third book of Madoc for want of books to refer to. the Hirlas horn<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">See Evan Evans (1731&#8211;1788; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Some Specimens of the Poetry of the Antient Welsh bards</title> (London, 1764), pp. 10&#8211;11.</note>  belonged to the chiefs of Powys &#8212; not those of Gwynedd.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I very much wish to pass a month at Bath. my revisal comes on well &#8212; I have met with some books here of infinite use, but I ought to have access to every book that possibly could be useful, &amp; every hour I feel the want of some. the alterations will be many, &amp; the new notes very numerous. Joan of Arc will perhaps be a more popular poem than Madoc. but I think what I have written of Madoc my best production, the emotions of the human mind are well observed &amp; the language chaste.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	What I have said of <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> is written only to yourself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is not very well. I wish to diet her with bark, or some tonic medicine &#8212; but this is not the place [MS obscured] advice or drugs. this is another reason why I wish to <del rend="strikethrough">xx</del> visit Bristol.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Have you observed a very extraordinary phenomenon &#8212; a star &#8212; or <del rend="strikethrough">cle</del> body of fire larger &amp; brighter than any planet that rises every night E.S.E. &amp; travels westward at a great rate? <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The appearance of the Bouvard-Herschel comet.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1">	God bless you. Madoc is again at a stand. for the new edition occupies me. God meant me for a Poet &#8212; but Society suffers nothing to be what God meant it &#8212; &amp; I have no right to complain.</p>
