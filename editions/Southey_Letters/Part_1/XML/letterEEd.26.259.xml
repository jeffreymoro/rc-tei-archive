                    visit, which was often or rather always &#8212; I was at 8 o clock put into the Maids,
                    &amp; then removed when she returned. a hideous transportation! there was I
                    to be without moving head or foot till eleven the next morning. luckily fingers
                    were at liberty &#8212; &amp; I used to play with them from six o clock &#8212; for wise
                    Nature woke me betimes. or else fancy pictures in the green squares of the check

        <p rend="indent1"> I must tell you two quaint dreams of this period, because they
                    have made a deeper impression upon my memory than any circumstances of infancy.
                    I thought my head was cut off for cursing the King &#8212; &amp; after it was done
                    I laid my head down in <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my
                        mothers</ref> lap &#8212; &amp; every now &amp; then lookd up &amp;
                    cursed &lt;him&gt; &#8212; <del rend="strikethrough">xxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxx
                        xxxx</del>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the other I was in a room with only <ref target="people.html#PalmerMiss">Miss Palmer</ref>. you know her by name,
                    this is not the place for a character of that good Lady. I was sitting with her
                    when the Devil came to pay her a morning visit. she put him a chair &#8212; &#8220;dear M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Devil &#8212; pray sit down M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Devil&#8221;
                    &amp; smirked &amp; smiled all politeness while I sat &amp; looked
                    at his cloven foot, &amp; perspired at every pore.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My time was mostly passed at Bath with <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref>. I had no playmates there.
                    if <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> was writing letters, I
                    was to sit silent. there was a garden &#8212; but in playing there my cloaths might be
                    soiled, <del rend="strikethrough">&amp; perhaps</del> all this must
                    necessarily have injured the young animal. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref> once when he came to
                    see me found me pale &amp; thin. I had just recovered from a fever &amp;
                    have not yet forgotten the tea-cup in which the bark was given me, &amp; a
                    foul sweet medicine, I have the resurrection of its cursed maukishness now on my
                    minds tongue. he returned home in a rage &#8212; swore <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> would kill &#8220;the boy&#8221;
                    &amp; in consequence I was transported to Bristol. this was great joy to me.
                    I had a play-mate in poor <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEliza">Eliza</ref> &#8212;
                    my sister a year younger than myself. I could dirt my cloaths &#8212; &amp; might
                    play in my grandmothers garden at Bedminster.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> they sent me to school &#8212; to Ma&#8217;am Powell<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Mrs Powell (dates unknown) ran a Dame School in Bristol,
                        which Southey attended between the ages of 3&#8211;6 years old.</note> &#8212; an old
                    woman who had no eye lashes. my nurse maid Pat took me there &#8212; I loved her
                    dearly; she had neither temperance soberness or chastity &#8212; but she was fond of
                    me, &amp; stood behind the school door to watch my behaviour with a heart
                    ready to break. I was in a passion &#8212; the old womans face did not please me &#8212;
                    &#8220;wheres Pat &#8212; take me to Pat &#8212; I don&#8217;t like ye&#8221; &#8212; &amp; this was accompanied
                    by an angry jig or stamping which I inherited, &amp; which my maternal
                    relations call the Southey jig.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> here I was at intervals till my sixth year, &amp; formd a
                    delectable plan with two school-mates for going to an island &amp; living by
                    ourselves. we were to have one mountain of gingerbread &amp; another of <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> candy. at the age of 23 I think of
                    Utopia.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had a great desire to be a soldier. Colonel Johnes<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably the translator, agriculturist and
                        colonel of the Cardigan militia, Thomas Johnes (1748&#8211;1816; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> once gave[MS torn] me his sword &#8212; I took it to bed
                    &amp; went to sleep in a state of most compleat happiness. in the morning it
                    was gone. once I sat upon the ground in what we call a brown study &#8212; at last out
                    it came with the utmost earnestness to my <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> &#8212; &#8220;Auntee Polly &#8212; I sould like to have all the weapons of

                    &amp; all the weapons of war.&#8221; once I got horsewhippd for taking a walk with

                    took a strange turn when I was about nine years old. I had been reading the
                    historical plays of Shakespere &#8212; concluded that there must be civil war in my
                    own time &amp; resolved to be a very great man, like the Earl of
                        Warwick.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Neville, Earl of

                    prudent to begin to make partizans. so I told my companions at school that my
                    mother was a very good woman &amp; had taught me to interpret dreams; they
                    used to come &amp; repeat their dreams to me, &amp; I was artful enough
                    to refer them all to great civil wars &amp; the appearance of one very great
                    man who was to appear &#8212; meaning myself. I had resolved that <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> should be a great man too,
                    &amp; actually dreamt once of going into his tent to wake him the morning
                    before a battle, so full was I of these ideas.</p>

                    her. I was very fond of the theatre &amp; by the time I was seven years old
                    thought that tho it was a great thing to be a warrior it was still greater to
