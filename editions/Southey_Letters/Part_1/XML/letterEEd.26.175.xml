<salute>SIR,</salute>

<p rend="indent1">	PERMIT me to make a few remarks on the observations of your correspondent <ref target="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">MEIRION</ref> upon the Welsh Language.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
<title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>, 2 (September 1796), 609–611.</note>
</p>
<p rend="indent1">	There are in the Welsh (he says) words perfectly similar in sound, to the mythologic names of the ancient world, answering exactly to most of the explanations given by Gebelin and Bryant.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Antoine Court de Gebelin (1725–1784), French philologist and author of an incomplete study of ancient language and mythology; Jacob Bryant (<hi rend="ital">c.</hi> 1717–1804; <title level="m">DNB</title>), antiquary and classical scholar, author of <title level="m">A New System, or, An Analysis of Ancient Mythology</title> (1774–1776).</note> Mr. Bryant is a very learned man, but though his system may amuse us by its ingenuity, it is not accurate enough to convince. Sanconiathon, Manetho, and Berosus, afford but bad premises on which to erect a demonstration. The explanations which Mr. Bryant has given of what he calls the Ammoniat particles, and on which he founds his system, are entirely conjectural; and his conjectures have been proved by Mr. Richardson,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Richardson (1740/41–1795; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">A Dissertation on the Languages, Literature, and Manners of Eastern Nations</title> (1778), a response to Jacob Bryant, <title level="m">An Apology to John Richardson, Esq.</title> (1778).</note> the ablest of our oriental scholars, to be totally unfounded.</p>
<p rend="indent1">
<ref target="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">Meirion</ref> says, “there is not the least difference between the language of the laws of Howell in the tenth, or Geoffrey of Monmouths history in the twelfth century, and that now spoken in Wales;” but, Geoffrey of Monmouth<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The historian, and Bishop of St Asaph, Geoffrey of Monmouth (d. 1154/1155; <title level="m">DNB</title>), whose works included <title level="m">The Historia Regum Britanniae</title>.</note> wrote in latin, and the British History which he is said to have translated, was brought from Armorica, by Walter Mapæus,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Mapaeus was supposedly Archdeacon of Oxford and a contemporary of Geoffrey of Monmouth. See Richard Brooks, <title level="m">A Dictionary of the World: or, A Geographical Description of the Earth; With an Historical and Biographical Account of its Principal Inhabitants</title>, 2 vols (London, 1772) [unpaginated].</note> the celebrated archdeacon of Oxford, and at that time carried marks of great antiquity. A copy of this original history is said to exist at <ref target="places.html#Wynnstay">Wynnestay</ref>; if <ref target="people.html#PugheWilliamOwen">Meirion</ref> means this copy, he has confounded the original with the translation, consequently his dates are wrong, and this proof of the stability of the Welsh language invalidated.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	Dr. PERCY in his preface to his very valuable translation of Mallet’s Northern Antiquities, has given the Pater-Noster in the ancient and the modern British languages.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Percy (1729–1811: <title level="m">DNB</title>) (transl.), <title level="m">Northern Antiquities: or, A Description of the Manners, Customs, Religion and Laws of the Ancient Danes, and Other Northern Nations</title>, 2 vols (London, 1770), I, pp. xxvi–xlv.</note> I know nothing myself of the language, but the difference to the eye is as evident, as the difference between Chaucer and Dryden’s translation<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Dryden’s (1631–1700; <title level="m">DNB</title>) <title level="m">Fables</title> (1700) included translations of five stories by Geoffrey Chaucer (<hi rend="ital">c</hi>.1340–1400; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> would appear to a man who understood neither.</p>
<p rend="indent1">	The advocates of Welsh poetry have extolled it too highly. The fair Pilgrim, which EDWARD WILLIAMS<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The Welsh poet and forger, Edward Williams (1747–1826; <title level="m">DNB</title>), wrote under the pseudonym ‘Iolo Morganwg’. His translation appeared in <title level="m">Poems, Lyric and Pastoral</title>, 2 vols (London, 1794), I, pp. 74–84.</note> has translated from Dafydd ap Gwilym, is the best specimen I have seen; and a few detached sentences in Llywarch Hen<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">William Owen (1759–1835; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">The Heroic Elegies and Other Pieces of Llywarç Hen, Prince of the Cumbrian Britons</title> (1792). Southey’s copy is in the Houghton Library.</note> are very beautiful; but these must not be compared with the wild majesty of the Runic poems,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Gray (1716–1771; <title level="m">DNB</title>), <title level="m">Five Pieces of Runic Poetry</title> (1763).</note> or the remains of Ossian,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Ossian, the supposed author of a cycle of Celtic heroic poems, probably composed by James Macpherson (1736–1796; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> whose exquisite merit has ever been, and ever will be acknowledged, by those who possess, “the eye that can see nature, and the heart that can feel nature.”<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Williams, <title level="m">Poems, Lyric and Pastoral</title>, 2 vols (London, 1794), I, p. 176.</note>
