        <p rend="indent1"> There is a passage in Don Quixote relative to the Spanish drama,
                    which for a considerable time excited the curiosity and regret of the lovers of
                    poetry in Spain. &#8220;You will allow (said the curate) that there were three
                    tragedies represented in Spain, a few years ago, composed by a famous poet of
                    these realms, which astonished, delighted, and suspended all who heard them,
                    simple as well as gentle, vulgar as well as learned, and brought more money to
                    the actors than thirty of the best plays which had been written before them.&#8221;
                    &#8220;Undoubtedly (replied the actor) you must speak of the Isabella, Phillis, and
                    Alexandra.&#8221; &#8220;I speak of them (replied the curate); see if they do not observe
                    the rules of art, and in consequence of observing them, please all the

                    unjust and ungrateful to mention without high approbation; an analysis of one of
                    these tragedies will give an idea of the state of the Spanish drama, in the
                    golden age of their poetry.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The scene lies in Zaragoza, and the piece opens with a
                    conversation between Alboacen, king of that city, and his minister Audalla. It
                    appears, that Alboacen is on the point of going to war with Pedro, the Spanish
                    monarch; this, however, alarms him not, his anxiety proceeds from an enemy
                    within the walls of Zaragoza. By this enemy, Audalla understands the Christians,
                    and the Moors are represented as intolerant in his speech; a right Catholic idea
                    of the religion of Mohammed. Here too he relates the history of our Lady of the
                    Pillar, and this relation must have secured the favour of a Zaragozan audience.
                    &#8212; The king refuses to expel the Christians; he will favour them for Isabella&#8217;s
                    sake, the cause of his anxiety, because the object of his fruitless love. This
                    resolution of the king soon changes, when he learns, that Muley Albenzayde, his
                    friend and favourite, is the favoured lover of Isabella, and her convert to
                    Christianity. A soliloquy of Isabella follows, her fears and prayers are
                    interrupted by the arrival of Muley, now returned from the Christian territories
                    adjoining, where he has been baptized by the name of Lupercio. It is somewhat
                    singular, that the author should have given his own name to the heroes of both
                    his plays.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Isabella appears much distressed at the rumour that the
                    Christians are to be expelled the city. Muley endeavours to quiet her
                    apprehensions, and says, that as he is intimate with the king, he will make him
                    delay this measure, under the pretext that it would inform Pedro prematurely of
                    his hostile intentions; he will persuade Alboacen to promise tribute to Pedro,
                    that he may have time to prepare for war. In the mean time, the Christians in
                    Zaragoza may prepare themselves for resistance; and, when the king refuses
                    tribute, he may be attacked or overpowered by foreign and domestic enemies.
                    Satisfied that the end sanctifies the means, Muley departs with this
                    intention.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the following scene, Audalla informs himself and the audience,
                    that he is desperately in love with Isabella; that it is very foolish, and very
                    unfortunate, but he cannot help it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The servant of Muley tells Isabella that he has seen his master
                    thrown into a dungeon among venomous serpents. Her sister enters, and tells her,
                    that the house is surrounded by a crowd of Christians, that they know the king&#8217;s
                    love for her, and that they come, led by her father, to intreat mercy from
                    Isabella.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The second act opens with the supplications of the Christians to
                    Isabella: her parents and her sister join them in intreating that she will
                    supplicate the king for them. Isabella yields at last.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A scene follows between Adulce, the exiled king of Valencia, and
                    Selin, his friend. He expresses his hope of being restored, by the aid of
                    Alboacen, to his kingdom; but complains heavily of his love for that prince&#8217;s
                    inexorable sister, Aja. He is now about to ride to see her, and Selin tells him
                    his horse is ready:</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Alboacen and Audalla are discovered in the palace; the king
                    deeply laments the perfidy of Muley, whose death Audalla demands. Isabella
                    enters; in answer to her intreaties, Alboacen states, that he had applied to a
                    holy man, to know the will of heaven, who had declared that the prophet could
                    only be appeased by the sacrifice of that person whom the king loved best; that
                    person is Isabella; but, willing to save her, he had banished the Christians
                    that Isabella might depart with them, and chosen Muley for the victim. She
                    attempts to convince him that he ought to sacrifice her, because this very
                    attempt to save her, proves her to be the person he loves best. Provoked, at
                    length, by jealousy, the king exclaims, that she shall have the death she
                    desires, with the dog she loves.</p>

        <p>By the same privilege, we may class the term by which the king addresses
                    Isabella, in the polite vocabulary of vituperation. She is committed to the
                    custody of Audalla, and the old minister tells her not to dread severity from
                    him.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The sister of the king now declares her love for Muley, in a long
                    speech to herself. She commands Adulce to save him by force; in vain he
                    represents to her the ingratitude of exciting an insurrection against his
                    protector. She insists upon it, and leaves him to lament his fate in a long
                    soliloquy, concluding the second act.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Audalla, finding that no means can subdue the virtue of Isabella,
                    shows her the dead bodies of her father, mother, and sister, and sends her to
                    execution. Aja is discovered upon the top of a tower, eagerly watching for
                    Adulce, to save her beloved Muley. A messenger comes and informs her, that the
                    Christians have lost two columns of their faith &#8212; but gained two martyrs. She
                    listens to the long detail of their deaths, vows vengeance in a soliloquy, and
                    departs to execute it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Azan and Zauzalla, two characters introduced only in this scene,
                    now enter; and the one tells the other that he had overheard Audalla making love
                    to Isabella, informed the king of it, and seen the old minister put to
                    death.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Aja and Selin meet. Selin tells Aja that his master has killed
                    himself, because he could not obey her injunctions. Aja tells him that she has
                    killed Alboacen to revenge Muley, and then she kills herself. The tragedy is
                    concluded by the ghost of Isabella, she says, that, like the phoenix, she rises
                    from the funeral pile to heaven, and hopes, that whenever her history shall be
                    represented on the stage, the audience will applaud it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The characters in this piece are fourteen, and ten of them are
                    killed. The Alexandra has eleven characters, and nine of these are killed,
                    without reckoning children. The editor has annexed some just and judicious
                    remarks upon these tragedies, but they exceed my limits, and would not be new to
                    an Englishman. Ill planned and ill executed as they are (the one which I have
                    analysed is the best) they will reflect no disgrace on Lupercio Leonardo, when
                    we recollect, that he could be but twenty years old when they were represented,
                    and that they were superior to any his countrymen had then produced. The variety
                    of metres in which they are written, though altogether improper for tragedy,
                    advantageously display his powers in versification; and, if he had left no other
                    works, there are passages brilliant enough in these, to entitle him to a high
                    rank among the poets of Spain.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Bartholome survived his brother many years; he continued the
                    annals of Zurita, and I hope and believe that he is included in the praise
