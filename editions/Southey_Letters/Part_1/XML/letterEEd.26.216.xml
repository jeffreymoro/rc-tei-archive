        <p>MS untraced; text is taken
                        from Joseph Cottle, Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor
                            Coleridge and Robert Southey (London, 1847)..  Previously 
                        published: Joseph Cottle, Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor
                            Coleridge and Robert Southey (London, 1847), pp. 212&#8211;213 [in
                        part, with omissions at beginning of the letter indicated]. In editing the
                        text for publication, Cottle pieced together extracts from at least two
                        letters. The contents of the first paragraph suggest it was written [c. 8
                        May 1797]. The second paragraph is taken from the letter sent by Southey to
                        Joseph Cottle, 2 May [1797] (Letter 214). The third paragraph may be from
                        the letter of [c. 8 May 1797] or from some other letter from the same period
                        of which there is no other trace.Dating note: The dating of this letter is from internal evidence,
                        in particular the mention of Southey&#8217;s meeting with Dr Gregory (1754&#8211;1808;
                            DNB), which took place on 7 May 1797 (Letter
                        215).</p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Carol Bolton, Tim Fulford and Ian Packer</p>

                        became a public battle. In 1799, Southey proposed a new edition of
                        Chatterton in a letter to the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>, 8
                        (July 1799), 770&#8211;772. His letter also touched on Croft&#8217;s conduct. Croft
                        replied in letters published in the <title level="j">Gentleman&#8217;s
                            Magazine</title>, 70 (February&#8211;April 1800), 99&#8211;104; 195; 222&#8211;226;
                        322&#8211;325. Southey responded in the <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>,
