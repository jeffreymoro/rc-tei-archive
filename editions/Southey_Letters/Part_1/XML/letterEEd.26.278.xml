                    have his authority for her prediction of her &lt;own&gt; death —
                    &amp; that he has given me matter for a noble speech in Book 3. (I write in
                    the spirit of prophecy for its nobleness.) by saying that her first vision was
                    in a ruined church, where the weather drove her to pass the night with her
                    flock. there are more treasures in this library — &amp; I go there again on

                    it is to be called the Convalescent Asylum, &amp; intended to receive
                    persons who are sent <hi rend="ital">from</hi> the hospitals — as the immediate
                    return to unwholesome air — bad diet — &amp; all the loathsomeness of
                    poverty, destroys a very great number. the plan is to employ them in a large
                    garden — &amp; it is supposed that the institution in about three years will
                    support itself. on a small scale — for 40 persons — but the success of one will
                    give birth to many others. <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>
