                    letters to my wish of alleviating suspense as much as possible. you would be
                    disgusted with my hand-writing were I to continue this &#8212; so from henceforth I
                    will write no more on so unpleasant an occasion &#8212; if he comes you shall know.
                    excuse me for having troubled you so often.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> this state of expectation totally unfits me for any thing. when I
                    attempt to employ myself the first knock at the door wakes all my hopes again

                    to write because in hourly hopes of seeing him &amp; then visiting you &#8212; so
                    here I am &#8212; alone &#8212; &amp; without the half-compensation of
