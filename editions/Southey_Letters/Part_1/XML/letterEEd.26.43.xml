            <date when="1793-03-15">Friday. 15 March. yesterday</date> &#8212; was one of the
                        pleasantest days I ever recollect to have passed. <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Collins</ref>
            <ref target="people.html#LewisRichard">Lewis</ref> &amp; myself went on
                        the water to Godstow. we were conducted over the ruins by an old man to whom
                        Ld Abingdon<note n="23" place="foot" resp="editors">Willoughby Bertie, 4th
                            Earl of Abingdon (d. 1799).</note> had given the liberty of showing the
                        old nunnery &amp; thus earning a scanty pittance for the support of age
                        &amp; indigence. we afterwards walked over the adjacent woods &amp;
                        dingles &#8212; were I so disposed I might fill a sheet of description but that
                        task remains for <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Collins</ref>. we
                        dined at a house on the bank upon craw fish mutton chops &amp; eggs
                        &amp; bacon (have you forgotten our mutton chops at <ref target="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</ref>?) immediately after dinner we
                        embarked &amp; I rowed down to Oxford. the remainder of the day though
                        very different was not upon the whole unpleasant. I was engaged to a wine
                        party &amp; reachd it just at five not yet cool from the labour of the
                        oar &amp; with every nerve strained to the highest pitch. there was no
                        restraint &#8212; we drank as we pleased &amp; I was thirsty. tea followed
                        &amp; about seven we went to walk. Arundel<note n="24" place="foot" resp="editors">Arundel Radford (d. 1824), a student at Exeter College,
                            Oxford, BA 1796.</note> &amp; myself were foremost. we walked to
                        Maudlin Bridge &amp; returning heard a noise &amp; saw a bustle. we
                        went to it &amp; found one of our party in the hands of a gownsman
                        &amp; followed him to the college where to our surprize we discovered
                        him to be the Pro Proctor. to us he was very civil, but upon our going again
                        to see for the rest of the party begged we would remain in the college
                        &amp; at the same time promised that no harm should accrue to any of our
                        friends. I have seen said he nothing improper in your conduct but the
                        unfortunate animosity between the gownsmen &amp; townsmen renders it
                        particularly necessary to be careful. I do not ask your names &#8212; in short we
                        went home &amp; I got to bed. this morning I learnt the origin of the
                        whole business. some children were noisy in the street. the <hi rend="ital">Mayor of Oxford</hi> &amp; his men were apprehending them &amp;
                        our party (only three) though staunch aristocrats were delivering the
                        children. the right worshipful the Mayor collared Tucker<note n="25" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly William Comyns Tucker (d. 1838), a

                        him across the street to the Proctor said here is the most impudent little
                        dog in the University. Whedbourne<note n="26" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; presumably a contemporary of Southey&#8217;s at Oxford.</note>
                        in the mean time beat three of the Mayors men &amp; in this juncture
                        Arundel &amp; myself found them. this morning Tucker &amp; Wedbourne
                        called on the Proctor &amp; only met a slight reprimand whilst the
                        behavior of the Mayor was reprehended as childish.</p>
          <p rend="indent1"> the morning I passed like a pupil of Rousseau. the evening
                        like an Oxonian.</p>
