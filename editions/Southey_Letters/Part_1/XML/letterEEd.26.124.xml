                        started publication on 30 December 1794. Southey certainly contributed to it
                        (for example, a complete version of his &#8216;Race of Banquo&#8217; appeared in 1797),
                        but the patchy survival of copies of <title level="j">The Telegraph</title>
                        makes it impossible to determine the full extent of his involvement. The
