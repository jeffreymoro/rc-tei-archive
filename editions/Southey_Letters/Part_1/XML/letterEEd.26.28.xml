        <p rend="indent1"> Since my last I have been continually journying backwards
                    &amp; forwards upon business which would not allow me to fix sufficient
                    attention upon any thing else. it is now over &#8212; I have time to look about
                    &amp; I hope with fairer prospects for the future. one of my journeys was to
                        <ref target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">my fathers brother</ref> at Taunton to
                    request him to assist <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref>
                    &amp; enable him to recover that situation whence the treachery of his
                    relations &amp; injustice of his friends had thrown him. I had never seen
                    this uncle &amp; you may easily conceive how unpleasant so humiliating an
                    errand must prove to so proud a spirit. he was absent I left a letter &amp;
                    two days ago received an answer &amp; refusal. fortunately <ref target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</ref> had prevented the
                    necessity but her goodness does not extenuate his unnatural parsimony. he is
                    single &amp; possessed of property to the amount of 100,000 pounds without a
                    child to provide for. that part of his fortune which he inherited must one day
                    be mine &#8212; it will I hope enable me to despise the world &amp; feel myself
                    independant.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I expect <ref target="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Lamb</ref>
                    every minute &amp; have expected him since Thursday. I need not say I shall
                    be glad to see him as there are very few persons whose presence can give me so
                    much pleasure &#8212; I shall certainly detain him as long as possible &amp; when
                    he departs set off to enter at <ref target="places.html#BalliolOxford">Baliol</ref>. it wants not long to Xmas &amp; these occupations will
                    shorten the time till I proceed to London on my way to <ref target="places.html#MountsfieldRye">Rye</ref>. Your good friend the <ref target="people.html#VincentWilliam">Reverend Doctor Vincent</ref> may
                    perhaps visit his friends at Rye &#8212; our meeting would be curious &#8212; worse I am
                    sure for him than me &#8212; I should only feel indignant. that man may probably one
                    day be stiled the Right Reverend Father in God<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">That is, be made a Bishop.</note> &#8212; unlike other titles this
                    conveys some meaning. it conveys the idea of humility of charity of piety of
                    Christianity &#8212; I cannot help fancying to myself the Doctor entering his allotted
                    habitation in a more equitable world &amp; the gentleman usher introducing
                    him as a Right Reverend Father in God &#8212; &amp; as one deputed to instruct the
                    rising generation by his learning &amp; edify them by his example &#8212; he
                    &amp; I may perhaps appear upon a more awful trial than that for a libel
