        <p>Did I Robert Southey &#8212; the Apostle of Pantisocracy &#8212; depart from the city of Bristol my natal place &#8212; at the hour of five in a wet windy evening on the seventeenth of October 1794 wrapt up in my fathers old great coat &amp; my own cogitations. Like old Lear I did not call the elements unkind<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>King Lear</title>, Act 3, scene 2, line 16.</note> &#8212; &amp; on I past musing on the lamentable effects of pride &amp; prejudice &#8212; retracing all the events of my past life &#8212; &amp; looking forward to the days to come with pleasure. three miles from Bristol &#8212; an old man of sixty &#8212; most royally drunk &#8212; laid hold of my arm &amp; beggd we might join company as he was going to Bath. I consented for he wanted assistance &amp; dragged the foul animal thro the dirt wind &amp; rain! he calling &lt;me&gt; his good comrade his companion &#8212; fellow traveller &amp; dear friend! blessing God that he had met with a young gentleman after his own heart &#8212; &amp; exclaiming what would have become of me if I had not found such a good friend as you! in vain did I attempt to house him on the road &#8212; he would cry dont leave me my dear dear friend! I shall die if you leave me. &#8212; think of me &#8212; with a mind so fully occupied &#8212; leading this man nine miles &#8212; &amp; had I not led him he would have lain down under a hedge &amp; probably perished.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I reached not Bath till nine o clock. when the rain pelted me most unmercifully in the face I rejoiced that my friends at Bath knew not where I was &#8212; &amp; was once vexed at thinking that you would hear it drive against the window &amp; be sorry for the wayworn travellers. here I am &#8212; well &#8212; &amp; satisfied with my own conduct.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I have heard from <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</ref>. his letter contained little more than what he wrote to Bristol. <ref target="people.html#FavellRobert">Favell</ref> goes certainly with us &amp; (I trust) <ref target="people.html#LeGriceSamuel">Le Grice</ref>. I write to them both by this days post.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	my cloaths are arrived. &#8220;I will never see his face again &#8212; &amp; if he writes will return his letters unopened&#8221;. to comment on this would be useless. I feel that strong conviction of rectitude which would make me smile on the rack. the two children<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The MS has an insertion in Sara Coleridge&#8217;s hand: &#8216;<ref target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry Herbert</ref>, &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Ed Southey</ref>.&#8217;</note> are to come to Bath on Wednesday evening. I fetch them &amp; meet them at the long coach. so if you be in the Old market about four o clock we may have an hours conversation. I purpose being in Bristol at that hour.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	the crisis is over &#8212; things are as they should be. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> vexes herself much yet feels she is right. hostilities are commenced with America! so we must go to some neutral port. Hambro or Venice.</p>
