        <p rend="indent1"> Thus far my dear Cottle are we advanced on our peregrination. we <del rend="strikethrough">are</del>
					&lt;intend&gt; to remain here a week &#8212; this we had resolved upon &#8212; &amp; indeed must have done whether we had resolved
					so or no. for <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has been very unwell; most probably in consequence of fatigue. We
					arrived here Wednesday evening, &amp; she has not yet been out of this house. but thank God she is greatly recovered.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You know not how heartily I hate moving: &amp; yet we are far from being settled. when our week is up here we
					purpose going in the stage to Lymington &amp; staying a week there. from thence I can explore Christ Church &#8212; as the distance
					is but 12 miles. there I hope to fix. if you write to me on Monday direct to the Post Office here. between that &amp; the
					Monday following &#8212; to the Post Office Lymington Hampshire. by that time I hope to give you a permanent address.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is near nine &amp; I am writing without a candle. this light is not pleasant to me &#8212; &amp; I do not love
					a summer evening on that account &#8212; darkness begins when the animal spirits require to be recruited by sleep &amp; those
					spirits die away with the day light. there is another reason why I do not like this time of day at this time of year. there is no
					fire. I am ashamed to have one &#8212; &amp; yet it constitutes a very large portion of my comfort.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This is a foul place. full of aristocrats sailours &amp; all the wretches connected with them. the water not so
					fine <del rend="strikethrough">at</del> as at the passages &amp; as ugly at low tide. the inhabitants are imposing &#8212; <del rend="strikethrough">xxx</del> because they have the rich &amp; foolish to deal with. I shall be glad to get away. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is much better; &amp; as I have not her illness to engross &amp; oppress
					my mind I shall set to my employments.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd</ref> is going to be married; a Mr Reed,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; a friend of the Lloyd family.</note> brother to an intimate friend of his told me this, to a <ref target="people.html#PembertonSophia">Miss Sophia Pemberton</ref>. I am astonished to hear it. with such fits as he is subject
					to I think he is very wrong in marrying.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We are utter strangers here &#8212; knowing nobody &#8212; seeing nobody &#8212; &amp; hearing nothing. this nasty bay does not
					even furnish a polypus with which I can form an acquaintance. [MS torn]</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will see The Martyrdom of Joan of Arc announced in the next Monthly Magazine.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;A Tragedy may be expected upon &#8220;The Martyrdom of Joan of Arc.&#8221; It is only intended for the closet&#8217;, <title level="j">Monthly Magazine</title>, 3 (May 1797), 384.</note> I have written some &#8212; twenty lines. but I have every scene
					sketched out in my mind, &amp; expect to proceed rapidly. it is now Sunday &#8212; so long has my ignorance of the Post hours
					delayed this. Wednesday we go, &amp; probably straight to Christ Church. so you had better direct there. remember us to <ref target="people.html#DanversCharles">Danvers</ref> &#8212; &amp; tell him where he may write. when we are settled he shall hear
