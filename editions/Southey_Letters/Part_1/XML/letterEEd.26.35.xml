        <p rend="indent2"> I hoped to have seen you before this day. that hope like most of
                    mine is disappointed. <ref target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref>
                    is now in heaven. on Monday week I attended him to the grave. who knows but my
                    next visit thither may be final &#8212; I ought to have written to you before but the
                    subject was painful &amp; you will excuse me. he had been long declining.
                    evident however as this was I still deceived myself. when I passed thro Bath to
                    Oxford I staid at my fathers &amp; saw him in his bed &#8212; he prest my hand
                    with affection &amp; for the only time in his life blest me. why it was I
                    know not but it struck me that I never should see him more. I never did. in a
                    better world I shall.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of this no more &#8212; the subject is painful to me &amp; cannot
                    be agreable to you. to his loss I am resigned. I am even thankful for it when I
                    consider how grievous a burden is a heart opprest by injustice &amp;
                    misfortune. our meeting you see is thus deferrd &amp; the melancholy silence
                    of sorrow wears away with me that season appropriated to festivity. I have
                    however resources in my own reflexions &amp; solitude I have never found
                    irksome &#8212; one book succeeds another &#8212; I take the pen for relaxation &amp; at
                    least possess negative happiness.</p>

                        as Chancellor of the University of Oxford on 1 July 1793.</note> I hope.
                    there will be a great chair a good fire &amp; a bottle &amp; I flatter
                    myself with the hope of introducing you to the only man upon earth whom I at
                    once love &amp; respect.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">It is

                    company. I depend upon yours &#8212; the opportunities of happiness are so rare that
                    we ought to snatch them eagerly ere they disappear. where is young <ref target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>? he never will write to me
                    &amp; I am tired with expostulating. I asked him to send <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Collins&#8217;s</ref> letter long before the
                    end of term &amp; he has never noticed the letter perhaps he never received
                    the letter. this government trick of opening private correspondence is very
                    unpleasant. next come lettres de cachet Bastille &amp; good night to poor

          <p rend="indent1"> &lt;Of these epistles a few words. four years back I
                        wrote one from B. to Titus &amp; began an answer. the only copy I had
                        was with all my earliest pieces in a foul book, I lent this to one whom I
                        conceivd would take care of it. the book was lost to my eternal sorrow for
                        all in it is bad. &amp; I have reason to think it is still preservd &#8212; so
                        some time hence these cursed rhymes will rise up in judgement against me.
                        the epistle was very bad &amp; I could only recollect the beginning &#8212;
                        the two first lines as they now stand are all that remain of it. </p>
