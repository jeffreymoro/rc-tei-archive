                        for Lady Cobham (d. 1760), wife of the owner of Stowe, and was known
                        informally as &#8216;the ladies temple&#8217;. In 1790, it was renamed &#8216;The Queen&#8217;s

                    perhaps appear so unnatural. by this time you have had enough of Stowe Gardens.
                    we slept at Buckingham a town for nothing remarkable that I saw except the
                    castle or gaol. our accommodations were not excellent at the Inn but we needed
                    no rocking to sleep. next morning up we were at five &amp; proceeded on thro
                    Old Stratford to breakfast at Stoney Stratford. leaving this we passed a village
                    called Wolverton where I observed many walls covered with cow dung dried
                    &amp; stuck on. for what purpose unless to prevent the cattle from licking
                    the walls we knew not. at Newport Pagnell an ugly small town we laid in a new
                    stock of oranges &#8212; &amp; took some bread &amp; cheese at a very pretty
                    village called Chichvey. soon after about two o clock we washed our feet in a
                    brook. it was one of the highest luxuries you can imagine &amp; I felt quite
                    refreshed by it. we reachd Bedford soon afterwards which made our days journey
                    29 miles &amp; there whilst dinner was preparing I began this letter to
                    you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Bedford is by no means a pretty town yet the church is handsome
                    &amp; there is a free school with a very good statue of the founder over the
                    door. the bridge is very remarkable for its antiquity &amp; strength.
                    formerly there were two forts upon it which stood a long siege during the reign

                    dispatchd we enquird how far to Cambridge? 30 miles. this seemed so much for the
                    third days walk that in order to shorten it we girded our loins &amp;
                    immediately proceeded 12 miles on to Eaton. a village upon the London &amp;
                    York road where there is an excellent inn. 41 miles had gained us an appetite.
                    we rose not till six next morning but instead of proceeding straight forwards
                    resolved upon a circuit of 8 miles to make Huntingdon in our way. fortunately
                    Buckden where the Bishop of Lincoln has a palace lay between. here we made a
                    most capital breakfast &amp; proceeded thro Huntingdon &amp;
