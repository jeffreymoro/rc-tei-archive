          <salute>My dear friend</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent2">		You will be somewhat surprized to hear that we are about to remove from <ref target="places.html#Burton">Burton</ref>, &amp; take up our abode with <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref> for the residue of my reprieve from London. for this I had a strong motive independant of <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</ref> wish, &amp; the inclination I feel to be near a few Bristol friends. I want access to books which I can neither buy or borrow, &amp; which are almost necessary to elucidate my second edition. Lloyd accompanies us. he will be a boarder at <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</ref>. But I shall leave <ref target="places.html#Burton">Burton</ref> with regret. I begin to take root here, &#8212; novelty is to me less a source of delight, than the kind of friendship which I contract with scenery that has interested me repeatedly, &amp; awakened those emotions which defy expression, &amp; which are almost too subtle for Remembrance to retain. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I almost wish that I believed <del rend="strikethrough">tho</del> in the local divinities of the Pagans &#8212; but without becoming a pagan or a fool. we may allow Imagination to people the air with intelligent spirits, &amp; animate every herb with sensation, for wherever there is the possibility of happiness, infinite Power &amp; infinite Benevolence will produce it. the belief of a creating Intelligence is to me a feeling like that of my own existence, an intuitive truth: it were as easy to open my eyes &amp; not see, as to meditate upon this subject &amp; not believe. I know not whether you can follow associations that appear so unconnected upon paper but the recollection of scenery that I love recalls to me those theistic feelings which the beauties of Nature are best fitted to awaken. the hill &amp; the grove would be to me holier places than the temple of Solomon; man cannot pile up the quarried rock <del rend="strikethrough">with mxxx xxxx</del> to equal its original grandeur, &amp; the cedar of Lebanon loses all its beauties when hewn into a beam.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</ref> is much better since her arrival here. it is somewhat hard that they who wish only for quietness <del rend="strikethrough">in the world</del>, cannot attain to it. Anxieties warp the mind as well as destroy the health, &amp; too frequently misery in this world seems <del rend="strikethrough">only</del> to render the soul less fit for another.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I ought to congratulate you upon the addition to your family. I should do it with more pleasure were it <del rend="strikethrough">tx</del> on your own account, for tho the wise man, in a period like this, would perhaps keep himself wholly without a tie, I do not wish either myself or my friends that cold wisdom. I have no idea of single blessedness. if a man goes thro life without meeting one with whom he could be happy, I should think strangely ill of him &#8212; he wants the capability of happiness &#8212; &amp; if he has not the pumpkin-head, must have the pippin-heart. young men are sad cattle now &#8212; &amp; when I reflect how they are educated it appears wonderful that they are not worse. young women are somewhat better &#8212; that is they are more to be despised than detested. domestic happiness is a rare jewel &#8212; &amp; thank God I have found it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</ref> set off for the Isle of Wight the morning after you left us. we think of removing about Thursday next. <ref target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> accompanies <ref target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> &amp; <ref target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref>, I &amp; <ref target="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</ref> shall walk &#8212; &amp; we mean to make a pilgrimage to Stonehenge on the way. direct your next to <ref target="places.html#WestgateBath">8. Westgate Buildings Bath</ref>. I have laboured hard at revising Joan of Arc since you were here, &amp; with success I think. Froissart<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean Froissart (c. 1337&#8211;c. 1410), <title level="m">Le Premier (-Quart) Volume De Messire Jehan Froissart Lequel Traicte de Choses Vingts de Memoire Advenues Tant es Pays de France, Angleterre, Flandres, Espaigne que Escoce, ets Aus Tres Lieux Circonvoisins</title> (1530), which Southey used for the second edition of <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> (1798).</note> will give me the information I want for the costume of dress &#8212; banquets &amp;c, &amp; my notes will assume a learned appearance.</p>
