        <p rend="indent1"> The Gentleman who brings this letter must occupy a few lines of
                    it. his name is <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovel</ref>. I know him
                    but very little personally tho long by report. you must already see
                    &lt;he&gt; is eccentric. perhaps I do wrong in giving him this, but I
                    wish your opinion of him. those who are superficially acquainted with him feel
                    wonder &#8212; those who know him love. this character I hear, he is on the point of
                    marrying a <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">young woman</ref> with whom I
                    spent great part of my young&lt;er&gt; years. we were bred up together I
                    may almost say; &amp; that period was the happiest of my life. <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lovel</ref> has
                    very great abilities. he writes well &#8212; in short I wish his acquaintance myself
                    &amp; as his stay in town is very short, you will forgive the introduction.
                    perhaps you may rank him with <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref>. &amp; supposing excellence to be at 100 <ref target="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</ref> is certainly much above
                    50.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> now my dear <ref target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</ref> I doubt I am acting improperly. it was enough to introduce
                    myself so rudely but abilities always claim respect &amp; that <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovel</ref> has these is I think very
                    certain. characters if anyways markd are well worth studying &amp; a young
                    man of two &amp; twenty who has been his own master since fifteen &amp;
                    who owes all his knowledge to himself is so far a respectable character. my
                    knowledge of him I again repeat is very confind. <ref target="people.html#FrickerMary">his intended bride</ref> I look upon as
                    almost a sister &#8212; &amp; one should know ones brother<del rend="strikethrough">s</del> in law.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> by the time you receive this I shall once more be vegetating at
                    Bristol so direct there as soon as you please. I fancy <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">Charles Collins</ref> is offended with
                    me &#8212; as tho he delivered the messages I troubled him with he has never vouchsafd
                    one line. now I shall write again &amp; if he still continues obstinate in
                    resentment there let him continue. if <ref target="people.html#CollinsCharles">CC</ref> can shake off my acquaintance upon such no grounds at all, he
                    becomes unworthy of it. but these suspicions are wrong. he shall have a pretty
                    letter &#8212; &#8220;period round &amp; period witty&#8221;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is quoting a letter sent by himself and Grosvenor

                    upon gilt paper &amp; then if his anger is not appeasd I will een do like
                    the Doctors give a purge to cure a purge on, &amp; namby-pamby him week
                    after week till laughter conquers resentment. I am in a fine way with my
                    correspondents. <ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</ref> is
                    preparing for orders. &amp; I cannot persuade him that the testament only,
                    should qualify him. the fathers were either mere men or below mere men &#8212; human
                    authority is not be followed with passive obedience, but <ref target="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund</ref> is as fearful of
                    heterodoxity, as oppression is of truth. what is to become of me at ordination
                    heaven only knows. after keeping the straight path so long, the test act will be
                    a stumbling block to honesty. so chance or providence must take care of that
                    &amp; I will fortify myself against chance. the wants of man are so very few
                    that they must be attainable somewhere &amp; whether here or in America
                    matters little. I have long learnt to look upon the world as my country. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> now if you are in the mood for a reverie fancy me in America.
                    imagine my ground uncultivated since the creation &amp; see me wielding the
                    axe now to cut down the tree &amp; now the snakes that nestled in it. then
