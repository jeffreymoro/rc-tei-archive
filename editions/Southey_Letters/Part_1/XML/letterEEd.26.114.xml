Horace the question was &#8212; will you abandon all your relations for me &#8212; or me for your sisters &amp; mother? whether hell has <del rend="strikethrough">more</del> &lt;keener&gt; agonies in store than that of the half hour I waited an answer I know not. Heaven surely has no higher delight than I experienced at last from the answer &amp; the manner that accompanied it. my head throbs at these recollections. do you wonder that my mind has been agitated? almost to frenzy. but I have past all &#8212; &amp; all is again fair.</p>
