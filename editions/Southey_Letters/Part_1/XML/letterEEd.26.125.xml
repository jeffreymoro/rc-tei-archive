        <p rend="indent2"> Hot with walking &amp; warm repentance I do sit me down to
                    repair the apparent coolness of neglect. my dear brother when I have been
                    writing as hard as is necessary to furnish two lectures a week an hour each in
                    recitation, I have been tempted to fling all down &amp; write to you. I am
                    giving a course of historical Lectures at Bristol, teaching what is right by
                    showing what is wrong. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                        &#8216;Historical Lectures&#8217; &#8216;Unconnected with the Politics of the Day&#8217; were
                        advertised &#8212; in a printed &#8216;Prospectus&#8217; (Bodleian Library, Autogr. b. 7 (9))
                        &#8212; to take place in the Card Room, Assembly Coffee House, Prince&#8217;s Street,
                        Bristol. The tickets cost one guinea for the whole series, or one shilling
                        per lecture. The lectures were not published and seem not to have
                        survived.</note> my company of course is sought by all who love good
                    Republicans &amp; odd characters. <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; I are
                    daily engaged. &amp; moreover my heart has engagements of a dearer nature
                    which it knows not how to dispense with. for the future it shall come in the
                    routine of my writing desk to write you every ten days &amp; tell you how I
                    go on.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> my Joan of Arc goes to the press in about three weeks. a new
                    letter is casting for it. it will be a most elegant volume &amp; you shall
                    receive one as soon as it is out. I shall publish another volume of Poems<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s next verse collection was <title level="m">Poems</title> (1797).</note> most probably before that will be
                    printed. <ref target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</ref> the Bookseller (who
                    remembers you when he lived with Bulgin<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Bulgin (dates unknown), a Bristol printer, bookseller and
                        stationer.</note> &amp; often enquires for you) is to buy the copy right
                    &amp; they will be printed more elegantly than the last.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> John Scott has got me a place of a guinea &amp; half per week
                    for writing in some new work called the Citizen.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably John Scott (dates unknown), editor of the <title level="j">Morning Advertiser</title>. Nothing seems to have come of the
                        &#8216;Citizen&#8217;.</note> of what kind I know not save that it accords with my
                    principles. of this I daily expect to hear more.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> if <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> &amp; I can get 150 pounds a year between us, we
                    purpose marrying &amp; retiring into the country as our literary business

                    for America &#8212; still the grand object in view.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So I have cut my cables &amp; am drifting on the ocean of
                    life &#8212; the wind is fair &amp; the port of happiness I hope, in view.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> tis possible that I may be called on to publish my historical
                    Lectures: this I shall be unwilling to do, as they are only splendid
                    declamation. you will however receive whatever I or <ref target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</ref> publish, as soon
