I clapt it on &#8212; swallowed a glass of brandy &#8212; &amp; off set I. met a old drunken man three miles off &amp; was obliged to drag him all the way to Bath &#8212; nine miles! oh Patience Patience thou hast often helped out poor Robert Southey but never didst thou stand him in more stead than on Friday the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of October 1794.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">	I expect some money in a few days &amp; then you shall not want. yet as this is not <hi rend="ital">quite</hi> certain cannot authorize you to draw on me. <ref target="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</ref> is in London &#8212; he will return Tuesday or Wednesday &amp; I hope will bring me some ten or twenty pounds.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Exactly which works by Southey were being hawked by Lovell is unclear.
