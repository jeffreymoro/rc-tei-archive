                    should like to redeem this negligence. may we not expect soon to see you in

                    him, &amp; it is rumoured (I know not with what truth) that <ref target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Godwin</ref> himself means to notice the
                    circumstance. I am sorry for all this. no person could have been more angry with
                    Warner than I was, had I heard his sermon I would have contradicted him in the
                    church, but his confession that he had been mistaken satisfied me &amp;
                    should have satisfied every body.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My book proceeds very slowly owing to the printers delay. this
                    has in one view been advantageous to me, as the new knowledge I am constantly
                    acquiring collateral to the subject, is not too late to be made use of. There is
                    a Library in Red Cross Street, belonging to the Dissenters, from which by
