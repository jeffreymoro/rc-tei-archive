        <p rend="indent1">	I give you joy of your safe arrival &#8212; if the Dutch-man had not been as heavy in his head as he is in his tail you would have been snug in a French port. it may perhaps be sometime before the Phoebe arrives for you &#8212; to which you will probably have little objection being now Commander in Chief &amp; of course able to give yourself leave to go on shore.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Miss Russell<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a reference to Southey&#8217;s landlady during his stay in Falmouth in late November 1795.</note> is a pleasant old Lady. I wishd to have sent some &lt;copies of&gt; Joan of Arc to Lisbon by her means, but she could not serve me so &#8212; so I wait for <ref target="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</ref> to carry them &#8212; a 99<hi rend="sup">th</hi> cousin of ours whom I found at Lisbon &#8212; he returned to England with me &amp; is going again to Lisbon. I hope you may not left Falmouth till he arrives there, in which case I shall commission him to call on you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	what is the name of the Lieutenant of the Pomona who has orderd Joan of Arc? <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title level="m">Pomona</title> was a frigate in the British navy. The name of the officer who ordered a copy of <title level="m">Joan of Arc</title> is not recorded.</note> tis a strange book for a Sailor to order &amp; I therefore apprehend that he must have some knowledge of me &#8212; how &#8212; God knows.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	I hope to send you a couple of volumes<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title level="m">Poems</title> (1797) and <title level="m">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</title> (1797).</note> by Christmas. one of poems, &amp; one of my letters from Spain &amp; Portugal. they are both in the press &amp; the latter far advanced.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">	Of the probability of peace I can give no opinion. I cannot suspect our minister<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Prime Minister, William Pitt, the Younger (1759&#8211;1806; <title level="m">DNB</title>).</note> of inconsistency enough to be sincere; yet he must want peace &#8212; he must want to terminate a war so <del rend="strikethrough">xxxxx</del> disgraceful in its cause &amp; conduct. if it continues the commerce of England will receive a deadly blow. the Mediterranean is already shut upon us &#8212; so is every port in the Bay &#8212; &amp; so will be the three Portuguese Ports &#8212; Lisbon Porto &amp; Setuval. Hambro will likewise be shut. &amp; thus the most important branches of trade will be annihilated.</p>

        <p rend="indent1">	You have seen Coru&#241;a then. is it not a striking situation? the Tower of Hercules the town almost islanded &#8212; &amp; the rocky mountains of Galicia <del rend="strikethrough">from</del> down to Cape Ortegal form a bold &amp; beautiful prospect. if you ever put in there call on <ref target="people.html#JardineAlexander">Jardine the Consul</ref> &#8212; he perfectly fraternized with me. &amp; will be glad to see you.</p>
