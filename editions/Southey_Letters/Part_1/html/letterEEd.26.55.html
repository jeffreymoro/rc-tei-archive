                  upon all &amp; forming a letter upon a different subject every hour. the most agreable
                  part of this to myself &amp; I dare to think to you is that in the course of a fortnight
                  I ramble to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a>. my next letter shall fix the day. as I rode along now fast now slow now wet now
                  dry before I joined <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a> I ran over your thoughts upon religion &amp;c a thousand times. every inn I came to I
                  refreshed my memory. religion is a subject upon which so much may be said that wiser
                  heads than ours have been puzzled how to decide. rogues have made it a pretence for
                  every enormity fools have trembled or despised whilst the wiser part of mankind have
                  revered &amp; obeyed. were I a Legislator — I would build a temple to the One Eternal
                  Universal God. my national creed should be God is one — Christ is the Saviour of Mankind
                  — for the metaphysical disquisitions of subtle disputants — divine Doctors — schoolmen
                  whose brains are intricate as a bale of raw silk — mad monks — &amp; drunken divines I
                  would reject them all, &amp; every man who acknowledged a deity might worship him unmolested
                  under my establishment. the human race would soon be fraternized by a system so liberal
                  &amp; those atrocious animosities which prompt the orthodox to revile their dissenting
                  brethren would be forgotten. a churchman will speak with temper of a Jew a Hottentot
                  or a Moslem — but when he names a Presbyterian or a Socinian all the rage of persecution
                  glows in his zealous breast &amp; for want of stronger mental arguments he seems ready
                  to adopt the convincing ones of fire &amp; faggot. I am an enemy to an establishment.
                  church &amp; state produce but a mulish kind of barren religion. tho we turned out the
                  scarlet whore we kept her red petticoat. what is the national religion of America?
                  test acts I abhor. the scrupulous sectary is prevented from entering the pale of the
                  church whilst the door is open to the Deist or the Libertine who can swallow an oath
                  as easily as a bumper. at Oxford I have seen the destined pillars of the church wallowing

                  comment des campagnards, et sur-tout des solitaires, peuvent ne pas avoir de foi;
                  comment leur ame ne s’eleve pas cent fois le jour avec extase a l’auteur des merveilles
                  qui les frappent. Dans ma chambre je prie plus rarement &amp; séchement, mais a l’aspect
                  d’un beau paysage, je me sens emu. Une vielle femme, pour toute priere, ne savoit
                  dire que ô! L’eveque lui dit: Bonne femme continuez de prier ainsi, votre priere vaut
