               why did I not write sooner? excuses are bad things. I have much to employ me — tho
               I can always make a little leisure — if you were married <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> you would know the luxury of sitting indolently by the fire side, at present you

               the mind admits no sensation but that of mere existance. such a sensation I suppose
               plants to possess, made more vivid by the dews &amp; gentle rains. to indulge in fanciful

               are of a pleasanter nature — by the Lord I should be the happiest man in the world
               if I possessd enough to live with comfort in the country. but in this blackguard world
               we must sacrifice the best part of our lives to acquire that wealth which generally
