                  this — you are not an easy man to understand, &amp; tho I have the best grammar of you
                  of anyone living, I sometime think I shall &lt;never&gt; learn all your moods.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Your birth day is coming on. I shall assumes the old Poetical privilege &amp; give you
               some good advice in some good blank verse, God willing.</p>
            <p class="indent1">for the lodgings. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> will not live with me. she will however so often visit me as to make a second bedroom
               necessary wherever we lodge. I should add that I cannot furnish my own bed room, it
               were useless to add why — therefore we must be in furnished lodgings — therefore you
               see we cannot be with you — which I regret — &amp; should still more so, if you did not
               seem already induced by circumstances to find town lodgings more burthensome than
               convenient.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As for the Law I will give you my advice fairly in few words — give it up. you never
               will make any thing of it. you want resolution, &amp; you do not want support. a half-hearted
               man can never succeed in any-thing. whatever we would do well, we must do with all
               our hearts &amp; with all our strength. the study of law you would also find irksome.
               you would <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> have little time &amp; less inclination, &amp; no compulsive necessity to make you swallow
               the dose patiently. give it up at once. shew <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> this. I know he wishes you to persevere — but you may convince him that you have
