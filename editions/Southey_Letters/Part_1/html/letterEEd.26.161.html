Lett. c. 22<br>Previously published: Kenneth Curry (ed.), <em>New Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), I, pp. 109–110.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Curse this little sheet! I have no other.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I expected such a letter notwithstanding the vauntful prophecies of Old Batchelorship.
               I renew my first advice — persevere &amp; prosper. she was agitated but not angry. if
               I know the human heart — she will be yours if you have courage to ask her.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> this is a ridiculous world — &amp; a beastly world — &amp; a worthless world — notwithstanding
               it is the best of all possible worlds. &amp; I dont know how the devil you &amp; I &amp; half
               a dozen more dropt into it. but such as it is we must make the best of it. if you
               marry you may be happy. if you live single you cannot be even comfortable. I hate
               the world as much as is possible for a man who thoroughly despises it — yet I would
               once have sacrificed all to the prospect of amending it — aye I would now.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Persevere &amp; prosper. no one can resist the assiduity of affection. apathy is only
                  attainable by a heart hard by nature or rendered callous by misfortune — by the wisdom
                  of Diogenes or the experience of Timon.

               I would see HER. if I could but be in her company one evening I would make her think
               seriously &amp; yet she should not suspect my drift.</p>
            <p class="indent1">my threatened letter is untouched! you shall have it in a fortnight — if I sit up
               the whole time.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You have a plan of making some 50 or 100 very happy — do you include yourselves in
               the number? I have plans of that kind too — but shall probably never have leisure
               or power to execute them. what a game of chance is the world. happiness is the stake
               &amp; I could play well enough to win it — but my cards are good for nothing — Zounds
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> you have a hand full of trumps — why should you lose?</p>
            <p class="indent1">I tell you again if she does not love any one else — she will love you. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">if xxx xxxx</span> as for her father &amp; mother — if they do not like it — what is that to you? down with
               paternal tyranny. that sacred guardianship must never be perverted into oppression.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You say my style is altered. a sombre assumption of gravity at two &amp; twenty — true
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> but look back on the two last years of my existence — count by events not minutes
               — &amp; you will find me an old man. what vicissitudes have I not experienced? I have
               even now the millstone of dependance hanging round my neck. show this to no one —
               not to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a>. <span class="ital">he it is who gives me my future support</span>. there —</p>
