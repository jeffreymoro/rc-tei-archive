               <p>I have sketched out a tragedy on the Martyrdom of Joan of Arc which is capable of
                  making a good closet drama my ideas of tragedy differ from those generally followed.
                  there is seldom <span class="ital">nature</span> enough in the dialogue. even Shakespere gets upon the stilts sometimes. the dramatist
                  ought rather to display a knowledge of the workings of the human heart, than his own
                  imagination. high straind metaphors can rarely be introduced with propriety — similies
                  never —. do you think I shall strip tragedy of all its ornaments? this time must discover
                  — yet look at the dramatic parts of Joan of Arc they are best — the dialogue is impassioned
