                  </div> on what pretext is he confined but as the prisoner of the allies? he cannot be supposed
                  the prisoner of the Emperor individually. therefore instead of seeing any impropriety
                  in the interference of England, I think for its own honor this country should wash
                  its hands of so infamous a transaction. La Fayette is not amenable to the Emperor
                  for aught he may have done. I am glad to see the French are opening their eyes to
                  his conduct. how did you like M<sup>r</sup> Wyndhams speech
