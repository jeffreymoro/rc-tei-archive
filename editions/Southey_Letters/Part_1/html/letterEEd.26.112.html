                  &amp; rogue enough to be odious. ten years knowledge of her enables me to speak with the
                  asperity of truth. I think you should go to her but not alone. I should be frenzied
                  at the idea that you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> were exposed to her insults, — take <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> with you. he will remain one day in Bristol for that purpose — tell him it is my wish
                  &amp; tell him likewise why. — if this seems foolish to you act as you think best. I am
                  a good deal agitated at the circumstance — that detestable woman insulted <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">your sister</a> once — my blood boils at the recollection. would it not be better to take <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> with you? she would not admit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</a>. — <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Bra xxxxxxxx sapey xxxxxxx xxxx &lt;only&gt; while?

                  </div> tells me so in a letter — the woman who could so insult <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">your sister</a> is capable of any thing. for Gods sake do not let <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> expose herself to a repetition. do not expose yourself.</p>

            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Your sister</a> is like the lilly of the valley lovely in humility but like that delicate &amp; lowly
               flower she would bend before the storm of pride. if error can be amicable the error
               of too much humility is so. I wish <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> would think more highly of herself. tis the only fault I have discovered in her &amp;
               that is almost a virtue!</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am lonely &amp; dull. poetry is again the employment of a heavy hour — I fall into the
               daydreams of fancy &amp; sorrow to be roused from their delusions. but a few months &amp;
               we shall part no more — would I could sleep over the interval.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have begun another letter to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">your sister</a> — for in fact I have been unfitted to day for any other employment. but perhaps I
               am too assiduous — if she felt pleasure at receiving a letter she would communicate
               it by writing herself — but she <span class="ital">suffers</span> me to write rather in compliance to my wishes than her own. I must not trespass on
               this sufferance by writing as often as my heart would dictate. you smile at my weakness
               — at the weakness of the stern serious philosophic Robert Southey. but mine is the
               philosophy of the heart — &amp; to indulge its virtuous affections has been always a favourite
               maxim with me.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Concerning <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> I have written by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a>. thank God he is coming — most ardently do I long to see him.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The people talk strangely of us! so let them. can you not smile at the envy &amp; absurdity
               of the many?</p>
            <p class="indent1">my dear sister I cannot write to you upon any subject but my own reflections. a trifling
               incident to day has called up a long train of recollections. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">your sister</a> is not fond of writing — &amp; why indeed should I plague others with the emotions of
               this strange mind.</p>
            <p class="indent1">farewell. this is a dull egotistic letter. my heart is heavy — but I should spare
               your patience.</p>
