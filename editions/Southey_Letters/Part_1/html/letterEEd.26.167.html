            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Why is your letter delayed? I am anxious &amp; apprehensive. it is nearly a week since
               you told me to expect it in four &amp; twenty hours.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> is at the Hot Wells with his wife who is consumptive. she understands French &amp; Italian
               — &amp; has the manners of the world — but her physiognomy is not good &amp; whether or no
               she may be pleasing in health, I cannot determine in sickness. to me — she never would.
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> is the same as when I left him, except that he is now a confirmed Atheist, &amp; to my
               great surprize tells me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</a> is so.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am sorry for this, not that I think any error in judgment criminal, nor do I think
               the Atheist necessarily a fool &amp; necessarily unhappy. I am a very tolerant man, even
               to indifference. but certainly he loses the highest source of happiness.</p>
            <p class="indent1">tell me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> the state of your mind upon religion. but tell me the state of your body first.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> agrees with me that Man is a Beast. he verges towards misanthropy &amp; says that a years
               crusade to benefit mankind will cure any man of his prejudices in their favor. so
               say I — for I have been a Crusader. &amp; so say you who have the benefit of my experience.</p>
            <p class="indent1">but of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</a>. you have given me a very good opinion of him, for your applause is a ticket of admission
               to mine. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">NOW</span> I do not like him a whit the less for his Atheism, but I have forsworn all metaphysics,
               from my soul abhorring so barren a study. now if the majority of your club are necessarians
               materialists &amp; atheists (as I believe they are) I, who am neither the one or the other,
               have no inclination to be in a state of continual argumentation. to tell you the truth,
               I dislike periodical engagements. I love to pass my evenings at home with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, &amp; methinks no other company can make me happier or better. besides I am become a
               very reserved man, never unbending except to those whom I love, consequently to any
               but my friends I am not an agreable companion.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> I despise the world. I hate the mob — I do not love the soi-disant Philosophers —
               &amp; I have a thorough contempt for the aristocratical part. I shall mingle in the world,
               but it will be only with the view of enabling myself to get out of it. I must pass
               a very dirty road to get into the path of quiet life. now with these intentions —
               being without ambition, &amp; alike indifferent to applause or abuse — why should I make
               acquaintance? I have a few friends but they <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> &lt;are&gt; enough. you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> — &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">your brother</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Robert Allen</a>. then I will have <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</a> for my philosopher. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</a> may be my surgeon. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp;</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> is to be my physician &amp; I shall be my own lawyer. now I want only an apothecary —
               &amp; then what the Devil do I want to make more acquaintance for?</p>
            <p class="indent1">as for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">Charles Collins</a> my opinion of him is settled. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp;</span> his opinion of me will be determind by my success in life, &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span> his conduct by my appearance. he is one of the many men of whom I have thought too
               well. but he has no heart.</p>
            <p class="indent1">no <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> when I come to London I will live to myself &amp; to you. I will enter into no clubs,
               no literary societies — I will use no literary arts. when I have done with the world
               I will give Madoc to posterity. I shall get the applause of the present generation
               which I care not for — but I believe that I may benefit the future.</p>
            <p class="indent1">things will be better in another world. tell me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> is there not more real pleasure in that belief — more consolation in that little
               sentence &lt;than&gt; in all the systems &amp; maxims of Philosophy?</p>
