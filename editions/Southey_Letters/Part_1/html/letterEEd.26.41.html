               [The meaning of the Greek is obscure, it possibly represents a transliterated English
               name, perhaps a nickname used in Southey’s circle, if so the most likely candidate
               is Richard Duppa.]/[upper fold] Variorum P. 2/ sit grata/ [lower fold] tibi/ Indute

               ‘little in much’; ‘may she please you, dressed as you are in appropriate colours’.]
