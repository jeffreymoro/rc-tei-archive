               <p>There was a time <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> when my life was heavy in listlessness — when I lookd forward &amp; all was darkness without
                  one ray to which I might guide my steps. strange alteration! now my soul never rests.
                  in the tumult of emotion I have neglected to thank you for Piers Plowman

                  </div> — or if I did thank you, have forgotten it. I know not. never was individual placed
                  in a situation more important — never did man experience more heart-rending scenes.
                  they are past — the energies of my mind have been all exerted &amp; I look back with astonishment
                  at what they have endured.</p>

            <p class="indent1">direct to me at Bath.

               I had depended on <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</a> going. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ariste</a> did the same — &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Frickerfamily">her mothers</a> accompanying us depended on that. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> seemd to change her resolution. Horace the question was — will you abandon all your
               relations for me — or me for your sisters &amp; mother? whether hell has <span style="text-decoration: line-through">more</span> &lt;keener&gt; agonies in store than that of the half hour I waited an answer I know not.
               Heaven surely has no higher delight than I experienced at last from the answer &amp; the
               manner that accompanied it. my head throbs at these recollections. do you wonder that
               my mind has been agitated? almost to frenzy. but I have past all — &amp; all is again
