               you know that I neither lightly undertake any scheme, or lightly abandon what I have
               undertaken. I am happy because I have no want, &amp; because the independance which I

               the structure is compleat in my mind, &amp; my mind is stored likewise with appropriate
               images. should I delay it, these images may become fainter — &amp; perhaps — age does

               absent from her so long before, &amp; sincerely hope &amp; intend never to be &lt;so&gt; again.
               on Tuesday we shall be settled — [MS torn] Wednesday my legal studies begin in the
               morning, &amp; I shall begin with Madoc in the evening. of this, it is needless to caution
               you to say nothing — as I must have the character of a Lawyer — &amp; tho I can &amp; will
               unite the two pursuits no one would credit the possibility of the union. in two years
               the poem shall be finished; &amp; the many years it must lie by will afford ample time
