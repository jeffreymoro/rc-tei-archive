            <p>MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850).<br>Previously published: Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), I, pp. 301–302 [in part, with indications that only
               a portion of the letter is reproduced].<br>Dating note: Dating is from a stamp duty receipt in the Gray’s Inn Library, confirming
               that Southey paid his fee for admission at Gray’s Inn on 7 February 1797, the day
               this letter was written.</p><br><p>Now, my dear Edith, ... am I of Gray’s Inn; where I this day paid twelve pounds fifteen
               shillings for admission. ... <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, you must come to me. I am not merely uncomfortable, I am unhappy without you. I
               rise in the morning without expecting pleasure from the day, and I lie down at night
               without one wish for the morning. This town presents to me only a wilderness. ...
               I am just returned from ——— ; they can receive us for 40<span class="ital">l</span>. a year: — two rooms, they are not large, but they are handsomely furnished, and
               there is a good book-case, and every thing looks clean. ... Direct to me at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Peacockunknown">Mr. Peacocks</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#ProspectPlaceLondon">No. 20, Prospect Place, Newington Butts</a>, near London; but, my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>, there is ‘no prospect’ in this vile neighbourhood.</p>
