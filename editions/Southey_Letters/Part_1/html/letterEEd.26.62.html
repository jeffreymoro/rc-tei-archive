               tho amusing &amp; replete with instruction is yet too mystical to dwell upon for any length
               of time — is it not one proof of human absurdity that men possessed of the talents

               cosmogeny than fairly &lt;confess&gt; their ignorance &amp; the unimportance of the subject?
               to deny the existence of a Deity were impossible — &amp; to suppose that Deity otherwise
               than perfect — were contradictory to Reason. thus far Reason can lead us with safety

               Man may act most gratifying to all-mighty benevolence — this is real Philosophy —
               but when Fancy thrusts herself into the throne of Reason &amp; boldly leads into the regions
               of abstraction metaphysics &amp; absurdity — instead of admiring the ingenuity we should
               rather lament abilities so perverted.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Of the various sects that once adorned the republic of Athens to me that of Epicurus
               whilst it maintained its original purity appears most consonant to human Reason —
               I am not speaking of his metaphysics &amp; atomary system they are (as all cosmogonies
               must be) ridiculous, but of that system of ethics &amp; pleasure combined which he taught
               in the garden — when the Philosopher declared that the ultimate design of life is
               happiness &amp; happiness consists in virtue — he laid the foundation of a system which
               might have benefitted mankind — his life was the most temperate — his manners the
               most affable displaying that urbanity which cannot fail of attracting esteem.</p>
