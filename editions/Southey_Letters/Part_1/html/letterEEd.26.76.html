                  </div> are beautiful — you promised me some information relative to a late edition. the other
                  remark is that two more letters will probably grow out of this. the last stanza has
                  given birth to a train of thoughts which wait your next for maturity. your last letter
                  I found on my return from Bath — I had prolonged my stay there to enjoy <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovells</a> company. you know the no-ceremony I stand upon when I wish to make a friend — it may
                  be singular but I am sure to me singularly fortunate. as a poet in some walks I do
                  not know his equal — in the plaintive &amp; soft kinds — elegy &amp; sonnet for instance but
                  this is not his only merit — epistles &amp; various other species he has handled with
                  peculiar delicacy. I do not scruple to say that for elegance &amp; simplicity of versification
                  I know no Author in our language that surpasses him. most probably we shall soon publish
                  together. I am apprehensive he will miss <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">your brother</a> by calling as last Saturday.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">and now to the subject of your letter. recollect <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> that Love is a perishable passion &amp; however we may paint its immortality with the
               vivid colors of youth — must ultimately mellow with friendship. I say must — for it
               is physically impossible that it should endure. Honor my dear friend is everlasting
               &amp; immortal &amp; inspires that conscious dignity which will dilate the soul when the less
               pure flame of Love shall have consumed itself. past errors are always the best future
               guides. a strong head &amp; a good heart have almost miraculously rescued you from vice
               &amp; folly — you have experience at eighteen — a constitution naturally good which exercise
               will brace. tho you have errd that error is reparable. I am more &amp; more convinced
               that Oxford would be of essential service to you — solitude is the mother of melancholy
               — hourly experience tells me so too forcibly. the college life is not what I delight
               in — female society is wanting there but any damnd soul would be happy to avoid hell
               by flying to purgatory &amp; so I look forward with comparative pleasure to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</a>. indeed with positive pleasure when I reflect that I am going to a society of men
               who are temperate &amp; liberal — who return my friendship for them &amp; perhaps expect our
               meeting with the same pleasure felt by me. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Seward</a> resides with us six months longer &amp; that &lt;as being&gt; unexpected is doubly agreable.
               you will seldom <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> find a better acquaintance not to mention your friends at XChurch or mine at Corpus.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have accomplishd a most arduous task. transcribing all my verses that appear worthy
               the trouble (except letters). of these I took one list. another of my pile of stuff
               &amp; nonsense &amp; a third of what I have burnt &amp; lost, upon an average 10-000 verses are
               burnt &amp; lost — the same number preservd — &amp; 15-000 worthless consider that all my
               letters are excluded &amp; you may judge what waste of paper I have occasiond. three years
               yet remain before I can become any way settled in life &amp; during that interval my object
               must be to pass each hour in employment. the million would say I must study divinity
               — the Bishops would give me folios to peruse little deeming that to me every blade
               of grass &amp; every atom of matter is worth all the fathers. I can bear a retrospect
               — but when I look forward to taking orders a thousand dreadful ideas crowd at once
               upon my mind. oh <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> my views in life are surely very humble — I ask but honest independance &amp; that never
