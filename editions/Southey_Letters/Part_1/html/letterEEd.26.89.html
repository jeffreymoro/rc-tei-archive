                  </div> who died in 1768. hope &amp; fear have almost lost their influence over me. if my reversion
                  can be sold for any comfortable independance, I am sure you would rather advise me
                  to seize happiness with mediocrity than lose it in waiting for affluence. my wishes
                  aspire not above mediocrity. they are superior to the desire of tinsel appearances.
                  to look forward to taking orders is but a miserable prospect — tis a profession against
                  which all my principles militate most strongly — but no choice is left me. I am dependant
                  upon my relations for daily bread, &amp; every day do I repine at the education that taught
                  me to handle a lexicon instead of a hammer — &amp; destined me for one of the drones of
                  society. add to this that had I a sufficiency in independance, I have every reason
                  to expect happiness. the most pleasing visions of domestic life would be realized.
                  knowing this I may be allowed sometimes to repine at the situation which debars me.
                  do not show this to any one you know not how dull &amp; inanimate this collegiate life
                  appears. poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> too is lamentably in the dumps. he has left his heart in London possibly you may know
                  with whom — but do not mention this to any one, not even to himself. I never laugh
                  at well placed affection. &amp; I know you too well to be apprehensive of ridicule. —
                  should not you be sorry to see me one of an order which I believe pernicious. preaching
                  a religion which I cannot comprehend &amp; earning a scanty subsistence at the expence
                  of integrity? should you not despise me? you ought to — &amp; if such must be my fate
                  I shall despise myself. I shall lose that high sense of integrity &amp; justice &amp; sink
                  even below my own contempt. you see how much of my future tranquillity depends on
                  selling this reversion — yet I am so much in the dark about it that I dare not place
                  any hope where disappointment would wound so severely. tis now three years since a
                  man applied to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a> to purchase it. the offer was made at such a time &amp; in such a manner as to rouse his
                  feelings (naturally strong) &amp; he turned the man out of the house. I have since regretted
                  my absence at the moment, as it might have procured me much information on the subject.
                  when I think on this topic tis rather to cool myself with philosophy than indulge
                  in speculation. twenty is young for a Stoic you will say — but they have been years
                  of experience &amp; observation. they have shown me enough of what is insolently calld
                  the world to disgust me with it — they have shown me that happiness is attainable
                  but withal taught me by repeated disappointments never to build on so sandy a foundation.
                  twill be all the same a hundred years hence is a vulgar adage which has often consoled
                  me. now do I execrate a declamation which I must make. oh! for emancipation from these
                  useless forms this useless life these haunts of intolerance vice &amp; folly!</p>

               two days. I rather expect <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</a> tomorrow. but my disappointment at not hearing from him this morning rather cools
               my expectation. we lose <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</a> very soon. Act term begins the 18<sup>th</sup> of June. he may take his degree immediately &amp; depart — but if you will come about
