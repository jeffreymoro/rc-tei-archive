                  made a third &amp; successful attempt. they tell me he has made some curious discoveries
                  among the records of Bath, &amp; I likewise hear that he calculates upon the certain sale
                  of a number of copies to Libraries &amp; the purchasers of topographical history, a branch
                  of literature which certainly has its use, but which no human genius can make tolerably
                  agreable. I hope some day to find him at his books &amp; get among his old chronicles.</p>
