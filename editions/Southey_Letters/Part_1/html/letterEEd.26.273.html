               know <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> this would so puzzle the philosophers on the other side; &amp; we might see them making
               experiments upon the atmosphere — to the great annoyance of dogs whom they would scientifically
               torture. besides — if we had any refractory inmate we might push him into the void.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But how could you blunder about Tuesday so egregiously. did not I say expressly dine
               at Grays Inn with me? look you. I am <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MayJohn">John Mays</a> guest for some 24 hours. now in common civility I must dine one day with him; &amp; we
               hope to be lodged on the Wednesday. so I hold myself engaged to the blackguard mess
               on Tuesday &amp; the next day to him. you do not know him — but he is one whom I greatly
               respect — &amp; I should like to have him on the right side of the vacuum. I have written
               to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> to explain this &amp; call you an ideot. &amp; now remember to meet me at his rooms on Tuesday

               feelings are too susceptible of neglect or kindness. they are not so blunt as we could
