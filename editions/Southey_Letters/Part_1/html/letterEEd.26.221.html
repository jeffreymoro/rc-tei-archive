            </div><br><p class="indent1">We were a week at Southampton, &amp; that week was an unpleasant one. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> was unwell for the first part, &amp; the weather wet &amp; windy for the last. at Lymington
               we only changed chaises. I wanted retirement &amp; a bold coast, neither of which were
               to be found at Lymington, &amp; the scenery of that part of the Forest appeared comparatively
               uninteresting after we had seen the road from Winchester to Southampton. here we are
               in a flat watry country. sufficiently retired, for the place is little better — or
               worse — than a village. but we are two miles from the beach, &amp; the only object in
               sight from the windows which can associate an idea of being in the country is a <span class="ital">thatched</span> house opposite.</p>
            <p class="indent1">flat however as the country is, it is not altogether uninteresting. two hills near
               the town rise immediately from the plain, barren &amp; dark. I know not how many little
               streams wind in all directions, &amp; tho the windings of a stream thro a naked plain
               present no temptation to follow them, their distant gleaming relieve the uniformity
               of the prospect. here is one of the finest churches I ever saw; the ruins of a small
               priory washed by a clear rivulet stand almost in the churchyard. I shall remain here
               six or seven weeks &amp; then migrate westwards.</p>

                  he was on the road. my regular time for study has no room left for a new undertaking,
                  &amp; my poor tragedy must wait for a vacancy unless I steal the morning hours from sleep.
                  this I hope to do. I have now to correct the Poem — &amp; these are my purposed alterations.
                  to omit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a> lines &amp; the 9<sup>th</sup> book. the Maids knowledge of her future fate may be told to Conrade in the 4<sup>th</sup>. &amp; the 9<sup>th</sup> may be supplied by a midnight expedition to the tent of Burgundy to detach him from
                  the English interest. She is said to have cut off the head of Franquet d’Arras, a
                  Burgundian, &amp; I can inweave this fact.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
                           (7)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Franquet d’Arras (d. 1430) was a Burgundian mercenary. He was not, as some hostile
                           accounts claimed, beheaded by Joan of Arc. Instead, he was executed by the authorities
                           to whom Joan handed him over after his capture at Lagny-Sur-Marne.</span></div>
                  </div> the manner in which the arms are discovered in the 4<sup>th</sup> book resembles clock work too much. it is miracle enough to find them, &amp; mysterious
                  events suit the Poet better than miraculous ones. The English ordered the herald who
                  brought the first summons to them to be burnt. this is a fact too important to be
                  past over, &amp; yet I cannot spare my herald. It is very unfortunate that I cannot meet
                  with Chapelains book.

                  </div> I must not be sparing of notes. the costume is strictly observed in all the battles
                  sieges &amp;c; but this should be pointed out, otherwise no perspicuity in the text can
                  make the meaning obvious. The 9<sup>th</sup> book extends now to 50 pages. some of my lines [MS cut] in the beginning of the 2<sup>nd</sup> — may be inserted there — &amp; the whole extended so as to publish seperately — the Tragedy
                  will be printed in the same size, &amp; both together form a volume.</p>
