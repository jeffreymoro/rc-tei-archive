                  I have read in this manner. it is very seldom that I am without a book in my pocket.
                  &amp; the half &amp; quarters of hours wasted so often in waiting amount to a great deal in
                  the year. ten to one but I read all the way to Bath &amp; should the sun shine it makes
                  glad the heart of man spout vociferously to the edification of all the stage coachmen.
                  this however only happens in abstraction. Shall you join our party at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</a>? if not what do you do with yourself? another year should not pass in solitude &amp;
                  what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">CC</a> calls originalizing. with us you are sure of society &amp; employment &amp; I may say you
                  will seldom find a better set tho Christ Church may furnish a genteeler. it is time
                  you should determine. this seclusion of yourself you have already practised too long.
                  experience shows me its ill effects. you must mix more with the world — study men
                  &amp; manners &amp; forget melancholy in employment. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</a> will be at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</a> till June next &amp; if you enter there our party will be six in that college. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">your brother</a> knows how we live &amp; upon what friendly unceremonious terms. I will venture to affirm
                  that we live there as agreably as any young men can live at college — come &amp; try —
                  put on a cap &amp; gown break your spectacles &amp; come to chapel with me twice a day. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">CC</a> has invited me to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MaizeHill">Maize Hill</a> but it was impossible to accept his invitation. my life here is as bad as yours with
