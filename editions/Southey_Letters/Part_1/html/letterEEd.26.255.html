               <div class="salute">My dear friend</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent2">You will be somewhat surprized to hear that we are about to remove from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Burton">Burton</a>, &amp; take up our abode with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> for the residue of my reprieve from London. for this I had a strong motive independant
               of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mothers</a> wish, &amp; the inclination I feel to be near a few Bristol friends. I want access to
               books which I can neither buy or borrow, &amp; which are almost necessary to elucidate
               my second edition. Lloyd accompanies us. he will be a boarder at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</a>. But I shall leave <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Burton">Burton</a> with regret. I begin to take root here, — novelty is to me less a source of delight,
               than the kind of friendship which I contract with scenery that has interested me repeatedly,
               &amp; awakened those emotions which defy expression, &amp; which are almost too subtle for
               Remembrance to retain.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I almost wish that I believed <span style="text-decoration: line-through">tho</span> in the local divinities of the Pagans — but without becoming a pagan or a fool. we
               may allow Imagination to people the air with intelligent spirits, &amp; animate every
               herb with sensation, for wherever there is the possibility of happiness, infinite
               Power &amp; infinite Benevolence will produce it. the belief of a creating Intelligence
               is to me a feeling like that of my own existence, an intuitive truth: it were as easy
               to open my eyes &amp; not see, as to meditate upon this subject &amp; not believe. I know
               not whether you can follow associations that appear so unconnected upon paper but
               the recollection of scenery that I love recalls to me those theistic feelings which
               the beauties of Nature are best fitted to awaken. the hill &amp; the grove would be to
               me holier places than the temple of Solomon; man cannot pile up the quarried rock
               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">with mxxx xxxx</span> to equal its original grandeur, &amp; the cedar of Lebanon loses all its beauties when
               hewn into a beam.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</a> is much better since her arrival here. it is somewhat hard that they who wish only
               for quietness <span style="text-decoration: line-through">in the world</span>, cannot attain to it. Anxieties warp the mind as well as destroy the health, &amp; too
               frequently misery in this world seems <span style="text-decoration: line-through">only</span> to render the soul less fit for another.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I ought to congratulate you upon the addition to your family. I should do it with
               more pleasure were it <span style="text-decoration: line-through">tx</span> on your own account, for tho the wise man, in a period like this, would perhaps keep
               himself wholly without a tie, I do not wish either myself or my friends that cold
               wisdom. I have no idea of single blessedness. if a man goes thro life without meeting
               one with whom he could be happy, I should think strangely ill of him — he wants the
               capability of happiness — &amp; if he has not the pumpkin-head, must have the pippin-heart.
               young men are sad cattle now — &amp; when I reflect how they are educated it appears wonderful
               that they are not worse. young women are somewhat better — that is they are more to
               be despised than detested. domestic happiness is a rare jewel — &amp; thank God I have
               found it.</p>
