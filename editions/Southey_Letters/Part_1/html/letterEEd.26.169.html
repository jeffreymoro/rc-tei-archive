            <p class="indent2"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnett</a> left us on Thursday morning last for Manchester, where he will study two years before
               he mounts the pulpit. I have a longer course of study to look on to — my rhyming days
               are almost over — &amp; considering how much I have done I have not been very long about
               it. tho I am thrown back a year or two I do not regret the time thus occupied — Joan
               of Arc may give pleasure, &amp; cannot do harm.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> has been at the Hot Wells with his wife. she is dying in a consumption. perhaps you
               may know something of her — her father is D<sup>r</sup> Forster of Oxford &amp; she had a brother at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</a>. she was a widow with two children when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> married her, her fortune enough for herself &amp; them — but he was to support himself.
               an odd bargain. he behaves to her with the utmost attention. she is a woman of accomplishments
               — but I hear of dissipation — her physiognomy is bad, &amp; tho he will of course severely
               feel her loss — I do not think it can be deemd a severe misfortune.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> has been lately with me. I had not seen him since I left Oxford — &amp; you may easily
               guess what a thousand things we had mutually to communicate. he is at present with
               great industry &amp; the fairest prospects studying the Law. he enquird for you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I expected <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> — but an abscess near the os coccygis unfortunately confined him. the knife of a
               skilful surgeon has cured him — &amp; he is now going to Hastings for the benefit of Sea
               Air.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">Charles Collins</a> is to be married at Christmas. all the friends who once so highly esteemd &amp; loved
               him, have now but one opinion of his character — that he is equally vain impertinent
               cold-hearted &amp; selfish. I know nothing of him but from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a>.</p>
