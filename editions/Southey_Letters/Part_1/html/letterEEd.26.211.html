                  </div> I have read it with much pleasure &amp; much attention. it is a subject often present
                  to my mind, for I see <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx of</span> &lt;many&gt; Atheists &amp; Sceptics, &amp; as I never decline controversy, seldom see<span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> them without an argument. your discourse does not touch upon what appears to me the
                  principal cause of Atheism, the existence of physical &amp; moral evil, &amp; the difficulty
                  of reconciling its existence with that of a God powerful &amp; benevolent. The system
                  of Optimism, to which I assent &amp; which I therefore profess, is not without difficulties,
                  great &amp; many. but every other system appears to me to have more &amp; greater, &amp; therefore
                  I assent to this; to have used the word <span class="ital">believe</span> would have been perhaps expressing myself too strongly. Many of my friends &amp; acquaintance
                  believe these difficulties insuperable; I find them atheists or sceptics not because
                  they are vain &amp; conceited, not because the texture of their minds is coarse, but because
                  there is evil in the world. the contemplation of the misery of others, or the endurance
                  of their own, without giving <span class="ital">an unnatural asperity</span> to their characters induces them to doubt or to disbelieve the existence of that Being,
                  who if he exists must be benevolent &amp; powerful, &amp; whose power could execute what his
                  benevolence must prompt. this I believe to be the principal cause of Atheism. To answer
                  these arguments so as effectually to overthrow them is beyond my power, such is the
                  tyranny of the present over the future; &amp; when I would direct the attention from individuals
                  to the whole, I am told that an individual is every thing to himself. my mind is not
                  adapted for methodical reasoning, &amp; like Rousseau the answer to a question always
                  recurs to me too late.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The eternal series is the common basis of Atheism. I always attempt to prove the necessity
               of an intelligent first cause, &amp; deduce his attributes from his existence. this fort
               I find impregnable. the arguments from the evil in the world then become weaker when
               the present is merged in futurity. but the existence of a future state depends upon
               the benevolence of God &amp; those arguments attack that basis.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Your work will not in all probability be read by those who are decidedly Atheistical.
               they are in general self-satisfied, &amp; no man likes to have his settled opinions shaken.
               but it will fall into the hands of many whose scepticism inclines that way, &amp; there
               I think &amp; hope it will be useful. I will not wish you to examine the arguments upon
               the origin of evil in a second edition, because the subject deserves a seperate discussion,
               &amp; I should gladly see another work from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EstlinJohnPrior">M<sup>r</sup> Estlin</a>.</p>

                  </div> too highly? the ablest man of my acquaintance rose from its perusal with the full

            <p class="indent1">The Christian world will probably ere long be divided into two classes — the Roman
               Catholics, &amp; the Socinians or Low Arians — those who allow every thing — or nothing
               to authority. I have heard from one who lives much with the more able Catholics that
               they despise the reformed sects heartily — but are very much afraid of the Socinians.
               this is a curious fact.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will I hope excuse the liberty I have taken. gratified &amp; instructed by both your
               publications, forgive me if I suggest a subject that deserves a third.</p>
