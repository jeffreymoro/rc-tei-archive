               New attribution to Southey; in a letter to John May, 12 January 1798, Southey referred
               to ‘some reflections upon public schools’ which he had composed shortly after leaving
               Westminster School in 1792 and had ‘printed since in the Monthly Magazine’.</p>

               <p>An ancient Greek author, whose name has perished, after expatiating on the advantages
                  of knowledge, concludes with a sentiment not unlike that of the royal wise one. “Learning,”
                  says he, “is a possession of which no force can bereave us. It renders us placid;
                  it is the staff of life.” He enumerates more of its advantages, but he adds, “he who
                  has not been flogged is not learned.”

               </p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Our seminaries for the promulgation of sound and orthodox learning, as they open to
               us the stores of ancient literature, seem to have adopted the prejudices of ancient
               scholasticity.</p>
            <p class="indent1">At a time when the young mind becomes capable of receiving what form the mould of
               instruction shall apply, it is deemed improper to suffer it to remain in ignorance,
               or gather ideas which might possibly differ from the maxims of polished society. A
               well judged precaution; for ill will he be fitted to “make his way in the world,”
               who is permitted to imbibe those principles of benevolence, humanity, and independence,
               inseparable from goodness of disposition and quickness of perception. Usually therefore,
               at this age, and on this account, the child is taken from his parents.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I will not inspect the various seminaries and academies, whose sign-posts stare us
               in the face on every road from London, and whose bills of fare adorn the chimney-pieces
               of every inn in the country: I shall examine the education of a public school. Let
               it be remembered that, in using this word, I do not include such as combine the evils
               of both, without possessing the advantages of either.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The child, at eight, ten, or twelve years of age, if his education till that period
               has been any-wise tolerable, may be imagined at least free from vice; but if he has
               been fostered in his mother’s bosom, and accustomed to receive the lessons of paternal
               affection, it is reasonable to suppose, that the only ideas yet impressed upon his
               mind are those of piety, duty, and love. He has been taught to blush at falsehood,
               to feel for the worm he may unwittingly have trodden on; and is perhaps unwilling
               to lie down at night without thanking that power who has protected him through the
               day.</p>
            <p class="indent1">With a mind thus trained, behold him placed at a public school. Scarcely has he taken
               possession of his new habitation, than the summons of some despot of sixteen calls
               him from his rational and innocent employments, to make a fire or clean shoes; an
               aukward discharge of offices to which he is so totally unaccustomed, is recompensed
               by blows and curses. A lye may perhaps save him from this; and thus the child has
               to encounter the strongest possible temptation to falsehood. Accustomed to the purity
               of domestic life, his ear is assailed by gross and horrible ribaldry. If he can blush,
               the conversation is renewed with added obscenity; if he cannot, he has already profited
               by public education.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The persecution of decency is followed by that of humanity. The impaled cock-chafer,
               and the mangled cat, are daily presented to his eyes; and these barbarities, which
               at first agonize the human heart, lose that effect by frequent repetition.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Learning is made altogether a task to him. Steep as is the path of science, ought
               the difficulties of the ascent to be increased? ought the path to be perplexed by
               needless intricacies? if, however, he is diligent, he is assailed by ridicule. They
               who are destitute of emulation, the most paltry of virtues, are yet possessed of envy,
               its closely-connected vice. Youth must naturally be averse to harsh and unpleasant
               duties. To counteract his own playful propensities, and his comrades’ malicious railleries,
               what inducements are held out by the fatherly attention of the preceptor? Is the cup
               sugared? one argument is used, be he idle, be he stupid; proceed the fault from disgust,
               negligence, or inability, the rod is the panacea.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Suppose we him, however, possessed of industry and genius; his genius is fettered
               in dactyls and spondees, and his eloquence exercised in languages which none but the
               learned can understand, and which, when produced by a modern, the learned themselves
               care not to examine. Shall I lead on the pupil through many a scene of riot and brutality?
               Shall I paint the leisure hours of a boarding-school, where every one is taught to
               become the tyrant, by being treated as the slave? our time will be better employed
               in enquiring how far such an education is consonant with the prudence supposed to
               recommend it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The child, as soon as he can use his limbs, pants for exercise: it is the instinct
                  that seeks future welfare in present gratification; he flies with eagerness from the
                  nursery to the garden; so Nature wisely stimulates to firm the limbs, and brace the
                  whole system of the future man. But Man, forsooth, knows better! he can improve upon
                  Nature, or, rather, Nature is out of fashion! The poor victim of custom is dragged
                  to school; his temper probably to be soured; his health probably to be injured; his
                  morals inevitably to be sullied. He, indeed, will be reading the Metamorphoses of
                  Ovid, or the Eclogues of Virgil,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> whilst the pupil of Nature would be roaming the field, or climbing the precipice;
                  he, indeed, will feel himself perfectly at ease among strangers, when the pupil of
                  Nature shall be embarrassed and aukward; he, indeed, can converse upon fashionable
                  topics, upon the theatres, the opera dancers, horse-racing, and the other rational
                  amusements of the age, when the pupil of Nature would be silent. But look again; survey
                  the nerveless limb, the emaciated frame, the lewd lack-lustre eye, the debilitated
                  physiognomy of voluptuousness; compare these with the sinewy arm; and the clear cheek
                  that modesty has crimsoned; and see if even Ovid can exhibit a more detestable metamorphosis.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">But, at a public school, he will form connections that will be of service to him in
               life. As if he may not likewise form connections that will be ruinous! as if, amid
               such a crowd, friendships improperly formed are not more rationally to be dreaded,
               than those upon the ground of mutual goodness are to be hoped. May not the indolent
               meet with his fellow-loiterer? may not the intemperate join the drunken party? may
               not the libertine find associates in vice? Nay, more than this; the votary of voluptuousness
               glories to initiate the inexperienced.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thus it is, that the majority of our senators, our peers, and our priests, are educated.
                  Hence it is, that we recruit our army with officers, who escape from the rod of their
                  schoolmaster, to tyrannize over their soldiers; who show their loyalty, by calling
                  for “God save the King,” at the theatres; and their courage, by drawing their swords
                  upon those who will not “bow the knee to Baal.”

            <p class="indent1">As for private academies and seminaries, for “Pleasant Halls, Health Houses, and Paradise
               Lodges,” they differ only, in these respects, from the royal foundations of immorality,
               because the <span class="ital">herd</span> is smaller, the quantum of evil and of good must be less; and because the power of
               the master is greater, he is likely to make a worse use of it.</p>

               <p>That female education is better than the methods I have been exposing, I may wish,
                  but I do not believe. Woman, however, has not yet thrown off the restraints of decency;
                  and much as our sex labour to verify the illiberal sarcasm of Pope, at present it
                  is only disgraceful to its author.
