               an Atheist. mark you — his speculative <span style="text-decoration: line-through">fancies</span> &lt;tenets&gt; will neither make him rise or fall in the barometer of my opinion: but as

               know him, Christians as well as Atheists, considered as a disbeliever of Deity — you

               him, if he be indeed a Theist, not to give his sanction to principles, which, to say
               the best of them, can produce no good. you may, if you like it, show him what I have
