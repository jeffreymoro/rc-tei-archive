                  Zoe, now a prisoner at Plymouth. I immediately answered it in very bad French, explained
                  to him why it had remained so long unnoticed, &amp; told him that we would employ all
                  the little interest we possessed to get him exchanged or out upon parole as soon as
                  possible. I have put all my friends in requisition to do something for this man; his
                  name I could not make out, it is either Soutet or Boutet. nothing would give me more
                  pleasure than the procuring him his exchange, or even receiving him here if he can
                  get out upon parole.
