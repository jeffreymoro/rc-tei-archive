            <p>My dear Grosvenor. If I were not very well acquainted with your disposition I should
               apprehend by your long silence that you were offended with me. in one letter I spoke
               perhaps too warmly but you know my affections are warm — I was sorry at having so
               done &amp; wrote to say so. the jolting of a rough cart over rugged roads is very apt
               to excite tumults in the intestinal canal — even so are the rubs of Fortune prone
               to create the gizzard-grumblings of temper.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Now if you are not angry with me (&amp; on my soul I believe you &amp; anger to be perfectly
               heterogeneous) you will write to me very shortly. if you are — why you must remain
               so for a fortnight — then it is probable I shall pass two days in London on my way
               to Cambridge — &amp; as one of them will be purely to be with you if I do not remove all
               cause of complaint you have against Robert Southey — you shall punish him with your
               everlasting displeasure.</p>
            <p class="indent1">From <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> too I hear nothing. were I on the Allegany mountains or buried in the wilds of Caernarvonshire
               I could not have less intercourse with you. perhaps you are weaning me like a child!</p>
