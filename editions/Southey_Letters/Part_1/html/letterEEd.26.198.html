            <p class="indent2">Whether I shall be with you on Thursday or Friday next cannot be determined to day.
               your book arrived yesterday. the translation is much improved since you sent me the
               manuscript. perhaps an entertaining supplementary half sheet might be added containing
               a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">his</span> poetical history of the story — probably the multiplicity of poems written on the
               subject might furnish some idea good enough or bad enough to merit preservation.</p>

                  </div> yesterday. some of the sheets of the fine copies have been mislaid by the printer
                  — who I think has compleatly disgraced himself by the blunders he has made. I was
                  obliged to cancel sixteen leaves. I have reserved fine copies for you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a>.</p>
