            </div>
            <p class="indent1">“In my first edition,” says he, “I informed my readers of a new and famous translation,
               published at London, by the celebrated poet, William Julius Mickle. At that time I
               knew nothing more of the version, and contented myself with thus slightly noticing
               it; now, however, I have the pleasure to give the public a complete analysis of all
               that the celebrated translator has written in his several dissertations and tracts
               upon the subject; for all this, I am obliged to the most reverend father Michael Daly,
               a man, as all know, signally accomplished in every kind of erudition, and more a Portuguese
               in his affections, than many who are so by birth. I could enlarge in well deserved
               encomiums upon this sage, did not my intimate knowledge of his modesty prevent me.
               This, however, I will always publish with a grateful mind, that in the general reformation
               of studies which took place in the reign of our lord the king, Don Joseph the First;
               he it was who principally revived Greek literature, which had been for so many years
               dead in Portugal; and he likewise it was, who, with an ardent and indefatigable zeal
               for religion, laboured in the re-establishment of the college, which the Irish have
               here, <span class="ital">for the educating of missionaries, and the preservation of the Catholic religion in
                  Ireland</span>.” He now gives in the words of Father Daly, an analysis of all the tracts prefixed
               to the English Lusiad, with several extracts. “After these preliminary disquisitions,”
               says he, “comes the translation of the poem, which may be pronounced the most poetical
               that has yet appeared.” The translation is accompanied with notes, historical and
               critical, in which he displays great knowledge of the history of Portugal, and a sound
               critical judgment.</p>
            <p class="indent1">“Yet, though it be not our intention to criticise the English translator, who has
               done so much honour and justice to Camoens, we ought not to pass over in total silence,
               the various liberties which he has taken with the original, some which he has confessed,
               and others which he has not confessed. Of those which he has not confessed, we will
               give two examples, leaving it to others to determine how far a translator is justified
               in so altering and foisting interpolations on his text.</p>
            <p class="indent1">“In the fiction of Adamastor, Camoens makes that giant relate his history, and that
               of his amours, to Gama himself: the translator, however, takes another way; for he
               makes the spectre disappear after breathing out prophetical threats against the Portuguese,
               and the king of Melinda; then relates, that they had among them this tradition, that
               in the war of the giants, one had fallen upon their kingdom, whose groans were nightly
               heard; that by the incantations of a holy man, the spectre had been obliged to declare
               who he was; and then the history follows. The other place is in the beginning of the
               ninth book:— According to Camoens, the Zamorim releases the Portuguese goods, which
               in the 8th book had been landed; and he simply relates in the ninth, that Gama, impatient
               to depart for Europe, commands his factors to embark with their goods, but he receives
               intelligence, that his factors are detained: Gama immediately orders some merchants
               to be seized who had come on board his ship to sell precious stones, and prepares
               to depart. The wives and children of the merchants who are thus seized on board the
               ships, go to the Zamorim, and complain that their husbands and fathers are lost. Moved
               by their cries, the Zamorim releases the Portuguese factors, and restores the goods,
               and Gama departs from Calicut. But the translator relates all this differently: according
               to his account, in the ninth book, Gama is a prisoner at the court of the Zamorim,
               who in an arrogant speech commands that commander to make his ships draw nearer to
               the shore and to deliver up to him their sails. Gama refuses to consent, perceiving
               the evil intentions of the Zamorim. Immediately he makes a signal for his fleet to
               attack the Portuguese ships: a description of the engagement follows, and a tempest
               arises which totally destroys the fleet of the Zamorim. The victorious armada now
               draws nearer to the shore, and begins to thunder with its artillery upon the city.
               The terrified populace clamour around the palace, and demand the release of the factors;
               and their prince, alarmed by the destruction of his fleet, the insurrection of his
               people, and the intrepidity of the Portuguese, releases Gama, and permits him to embark.
               This account occupies more than three hundred lines, to which not one corresponding
               line is to be found in the original.</p>
            <p class="indent1">“I point out only these two instances, for the sake of brevity; but the reader who
               is versed in the English language, as well as in the Portuguese, will find many others
               in which the translator has either suppressed passages that are in the original, or
               inserted passages that are not.</p>
            <p class="indent1">“Mr. Mickle has, indeed, in his preliminary Dissertation, confessed, in general terms,
               that his intention was to give an English Lusiad in a free poetical spirit; and he
               says truly enough, that a “literal translation of poetry is in reality a solecism.
               You may construe your author, indeed; but if with some translators you boast that
               you have left your author to speak for himself, that you have neither added nor diminished,
               you have, in reality, grossly abused him, and deceived yourself. Your literal translation
               can have no claim to the original felicities of expression, the energy, elegance,
               and fire of the original poetry. It may, indeed, bear a resemblance, but such a one
               as a corpse in the sepulchre bears to the former man when he moved in the bloom and
               vigour of life.</p>

               which this precept gives, will, therefore, in a poet’s hands, not only infuse the
               energy, elegance, and fire of his author’s poetry into his own version, but will give

               <p>“But notwithstanding this, a translation ought to be a faithful representation of
                  the original, which it may be, without rendering word by word, as is evidently proved
                  by the various versions of Homer and Virgil in the European languages, and particularly
                  in the English. They preserve the spirit of the original, without suppressing or interpolating
                  entire passages. Nor can the translator avail himself of the authority of Horace;
                  for it clearly appears from the context, that this precept is entirely for <span class="ital">imitators</span>, and not for translators; and certainly there is a wide difference between an imitation
                  and a translation. A translation, in which such great liberties are taken, may very
                  easily deceive the reader. — Let us suppose, for instance, that some future Voltaire,
                  without knowing the Portuguese language, should wish to form some idea of the poem
                  of Camoens, by means of Mr. Mickle’s version: if he should imagine that the description
                  of the battle and tempest in the ninth book, is in a very inflated style, and abounds
                  with false sublime, he would naturally attribute all these faults to the original,
                  notwithstanding not a trace of this description is to be discovered there. Thus would
                  he be deceived, as Voltaire himself was, by imputing to Camoens the absurdities of
                  Fanshaw.

               <p>“It might have been hoped, too, that in a work of this nature no place could have
                  been found for introducing controversies upon religion; but he has taken care to show
                  his hatred and aversion for the Catholic faith. He repeats over and over again, the
                  old and almost forgotten calumnies of idolatry, and other similar charges which have
                  been so completely refuted a thousand and a thousand times, and of which now all sensible
                  Protestants are themselves ashamed. He falsifies facts and makes ridiculous and absurd
                  allusions, which prove nothing except the malignity of the author. This he does, no
                  doubt, to accommodate his book to the taste of his countrymen, and increase its sale.”
