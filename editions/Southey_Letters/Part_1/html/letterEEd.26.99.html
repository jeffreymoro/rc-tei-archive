               mankind. think well my dear friend. of the propriety of emigrating I can convince
               you. of the practicability of your marriage you must judge. I never enquired deeply
               into the subject for fear of giving unnecessary pain. excuse my mentioning it now

               my Mother without being unhappy — yet I will go with you — staying or going I must
               be miserable.” did I not know her strength of mind &amp; how ardently I shall endeavour
               to make her happy, this would drive me beyond the bounds of reason. but we must be
               most happy there. would you could come with us — do <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> consider well — what prospects have you in England? were it not better to marry now
