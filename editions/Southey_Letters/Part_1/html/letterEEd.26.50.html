            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Seward</a> after taking his degree left Oxford yesterday. I accompanied him with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnet</a> twelves miles on his road &amp; there took leave of a man with whom I have past some
               part of every day since the 30<sup>th.</sup> of January. as we past by a church <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnet</a> mentioned that the Sexton had been a soldier. I replied by an easy transition — he
               — has spent one half his life in murdering his fellow creatures &amp; the other in burying
               them. — the circumstance appeared odd &amp; whilst considering in what mould some peoples
               hearts were cast I fell into a reverie or waking dream if you like the term better,
               for which you will the better or the worse as it may please your fancy. when any thing
               strikes me I always think of a paper.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I was wandering in the store house of Nature &amp; wondering at the various strange objects
                  that presented themselves to me. (fill up the antichambers &amp; rooms as you will for
                  this must one day make a paper give me likewise whom you please for a guide) at length
                  I reachd the laboratory where the several guides of man were fashioning hearts. a
                  stern broad figure whom we knew for Ambition was hewing some out of marble. &amp; near
                  him stood a little haggard wretch busily employed in melting gold for the same purpose
                  yet much alloyed by Lead. Caprice was moulding hearts of clay in a thousand different
                  forms. painting butterflies — genealogies — coins — mutilated statues — &amp; monsters
                  — one figure I observed endeavouring to form some of sponge — but these were no sooner
                  filld with wine than they lost all resemblance to the human heart. in a dark corner
                  of the room sat a sullen sad faced figure with a broad phylactery a large band &amp; an
                  immense wig. as this workman had just begun with infinite pains to form a heart I
                  had an opportunity of observing the whole process. it was a block of black marble
                  &amp; the figure of a mitre most indelibly impressd in various parts of it. the gibbet
                  the rack &amp; the scourge were plentifully pourtraied on it. imagining this was almost
                  finished I was about to have retired when my conductor stopt me to see the conclusion
                  — for added he this heart is by no means yet compleated. the workman casd over this
                  innermost block with a kind of plaister &amp; upon this I saw paper Lexicons &amp; Scholiasts.
                  over this was a thin viel inscribed moderation fatherly love affection, liberality.
                  to whom this belongs I think Bedford you will want no information. opposite this figure
                  Liberality &amp; Genius were busied in tempering the finest earth of Paradise with the
                  milk of human kindness. science was polishing &amp; true religion adding the last refinement.
                  perhaps Bedford the Modesty with which it was mixed will tempt you to disown this
                  heart. but Truth &amp; Experience both <span style="text-decoration: line-through">told</span>affirmed it &amp; Reason &amp; Friendship were too well convinced even to doubt. here said
                  Nature taking down an urn is a heart upon which I bestowed more than ordinary pains.

            <p class="indent1">I have walked to and from Cambridge since last I wrote to you. we made Stowe in our
               way — &amp; passed thro Bicester — Buckingham — Old Stratford — Stoney Stratford Newport
               Pagnel. Bedford. Buckden. Huntingdon — Godmanchester &amp; Fen Stanton in our road there.
               this route made the walk exactly one hundred miles which we performed in two days
               &amp; a half. 33 the first. 41 the second &amp; 26 the other half. from Cambridge we went
               by water to Ely (where I had a most strange adventure) &amp; returned the same &lt;way&gt; rowing
               almost 40 miles in one day. we returned through Royston Baldock Hitchen Dunstable

                  was obliged to speak but so confounded he was that I pitied him. our conversation
                  lasted about one minute &amp; I relieved him of my presence. I saw <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RoughWilliam">Rough</a> there &amp; he wished much to engage in a periodical paper saying that he would manage
                  the printing at Cambridge &amp; did not doubt its succeeding there. I told &lt;him&gt; that
                  provided a good plan was laid down &amp; we had enough to undertake it I had no objection
                  &amp; indeed rather wished it than otherwise. I likewise promised to mention it to you.
                  are you Bedford any ways inclined once more to venture in such unlucky company? I
                  will not pretend to manage the helm in so perilous a sea but I can tug at the oar
                  &amp; sing as I pull till my arms drop off with fatigue. tho’ I have still some little
                  cacoethes remaining I hope I have lost much of those sanguine expectation with which
                  Vanity had once so inflated me. not that the failure of the Flagellant damped them
                  for of that I am still proud — but to my ideas the pleasure of gratifying a few friends
                  with those productions which partiality will make them esteem is infinitely more delightful
                  than the applause of critics or the echo of popular praise. will you write soon upon
