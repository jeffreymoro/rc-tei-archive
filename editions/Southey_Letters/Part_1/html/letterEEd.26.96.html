            </div><br><p class="indent1">I much regret leaving your letters at Oxford. in the last but one were some passages
               on which I wish to reason. tis my opinion that Vice is not natural to Man, by Vice
               I understand the perpetration of such actions as are injurious to society. in fact
               it is an atrocious blasphemy to assert the Deity has made any one creature vicious
               as you thereby make him the author of evil, &amp; either Malignism or Dualism must be
               establishd. mind is the child of observation &amp; experience. we are certain that innate
               ideas cannot exist, of course the infant is capable of any impression. that some men
               have more vigorous passions to combat with than others I readily allow, but you will
               agree with me that the indulgence of the passions is only vicious as the organization
               of society renders it so. man cannot act without motives, give him the strongest motives
               for virtue &amp; take away all motives for vice &amp; Man would approach very near perfect.
               the many judge of man by what he is in his present degraded situation; this is very
               unfair, you might as well judge of a persons complexion when he is jaundiced. do you
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> ponder well in your mind how far vice is generated by situation. I think we may one
               day meet in sentiment; even our difference is a proof how far situation operates.
               for had we been uniformly together the same coincidence which we feel on other subjects
               must have taken place in politics. when the storm bursts on England you may perhaps
               follow us to America. I will get thee a house like my own simple &amp; convenient, &amp; when
               thou hast once seen the aspheterizing system realized, thou wilt gladly fraternize
               with us. — do not my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> run away with the idea that I am mad in these schemes. surely you will not think
               Edmund Seward likely to be led away by fairy visions. I have many &amp; powerful motives
               for quitting this country, nor will my mind ever be totally free from despondence
               whilst I remain in it. whether Lovell will accompany us or not is doubtful — the leaving
               him will be one more cord of Affection to break, but Resolution is like Samson &amp; no
               cords could detain him. —</p>
            <p class="indent1">I do not entertain so high an opinion of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">CC</a> as I did twelve months ago, he has modelled his mind to the Christ Church fashion,
               &amp; allows no merit to any thing differing from it. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">CC</a> has frequently told me he never knew a rich Republican, that they were all needy
               men who wishd a change merely to better themselves. in this is much illiberality,
               particularly when I mentioned three of my own friends — of whom one has sacrificed
               1000 a year, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</a> 800 — &amp; the third has uniformly refused many places under government which his friends
               offered to procure for him. when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">Collins</a> says this he must either judge from his own heart or from the Republicans whom he
               knows. if he entertains such an opinion of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> &amp; me why does he not shun us like contagion? if he himself is above such mean motives,
               why should he not believe that we likewise may be superior to them? if he be not above
               them, let him not reduce other minds to a level with his own. — <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CollinsCharles">Collins</a> has more coldness of heart than any man I ever met with. his wish in company is always
               to shine, &amp; to attain this he will sacrifice every thing. we carry our hearts in our
               hands, our merits &amp; faults are soon discovered; but these cold hearted Temporizers

               in print. I expect a host of petty critics will buz about my ears but must brush them

               spent at sea have improved his bodily strength &amp; corrected many little failings without
               corrupting his mind. twas not without some apprehensions that I saw him after so long
