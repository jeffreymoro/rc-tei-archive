            <p class="indent2">After exploring the treasures of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottles</a> parcel I sit down to what I have for some days intended to do. your letter has arrived
               in time for me to reply to it. What <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> has repeated to me of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a> expressions, was related to explain his own conduct towards me at Bristol, why he
               shunned me, &amp; &lt;why&gt; when with me &lt;he&gt; was silent &amp; reserved. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">he had</span> it was after <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> &amp; I were in habits of speaking that these expressions were used: the only effect
               they will produce upon me will be to prevent the visit to Stowey, which I had before
               two motives for wishing, that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> might see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">her sister</a>, &amp; that I might see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> whose guests we were to be &amp; from whom the invitation came. for refusing to go I
               have ostensible pleas enough. to what you say of the propriety of being on tolerable
               terms with him I compleatly assent, nor have I any intention of breaking them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyds</a> opinion of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> is what I apprehend yours to be — a perception of his inconsistencies but a belief
                  that he never acts wilfully wrong: he has the opinion of his talents which every body
                  must have, &amp; that love for him which <span style="text-decoration: line-through">nobody else</span> few others possess. this state of mind I have no wish to alter. I never did &amp; I never
                  shall make <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> a single enemy. I never attacked his character, but I have defended my own, tho seldom,
                  &amp; never of my own accord. for the opinion of the world I have acquired a thorough
                  contempt, &amp; the experiences of the last five or six years has taught me not to be
                  anxious for that <span style="text-decoration: line-through">friendship</span> of individuals. I would willingly be of service to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a>, therefore I went to Birmingham, &amp; now give him a home do not suppose I am in the
                  high frenzy fever of friendship, for I would do the same for any man who wanted my
                  assistance &amp; who I thought deserved it: from a general principle, not a particular
                  feeling. he is well in health &amp; spirits; the way is straight before him &amp; he says
                  he never was so happy as at present. the having him with me is rather unpleasant than
                  otherwise — I do not want a companion; his habits of untidiness do not assort with
                  mine, &amp; he will most probably prevent me from spending that time at Bath &amp; Bristol
                  which would been very agreable to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> &amp; myself, &amp; which I should find of very great use to my revisal of Joan of Arc,
