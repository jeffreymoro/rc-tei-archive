            <p class="indent1">I am sorry that any expression in my last gave you one uncomfortable thought. certainly
               you appear to me to want perseverance, but so far am I from blaming you on that point
               as it regards the law, I again advise you to abandon the study. you have not time
               for it, &amp; before you could professionally acquire independance, according to all human
               probability it will devolve to you. the hours of leisure from your office may be better
               employed than in plodding thro a science which its end <span style="text-decoration: line-through">can</span> only <span style="text-decoration: line-through">make</span> can make tolerable. is not this enough to say to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a>? &amp; why should you feel a moments pain in abandoning what you cannot pursue? my dear
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> what have &lt;you&gt; to care for the opinion of others? my <span class="ital">best</span> opinion you know you possess. it is now nearly six years since you have known my
               feelings as they passed — I believe none of my old friends are so intimately with
               me as you are — &amp; I neither wish or expect to make new ones.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But you ought to be indifferent of my opinion. I think it of high importance to be
               careless of the applause or censure of any existing being, &amp; to act wholly in reference
               to <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> our own judgement. how happy should I be <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> with some half a dozen others to erect the standard of defiance!</p>
