            <p>Address: Miss Fricker/ Redclift Hill/ Bristol/ Single<br> Stamped: BATH<br>MS: Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas, Austin<br> Previously published: E. L. Griggs (ed.), <em>Collected letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em>, 6 vols (Oxford, 1956–1971), I, p. 148 n. 2 [in part].<br>Dating note: Dating is from evidence within this letter and others written by Southey
               and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in January 1795. Coleridge was expected to arrive in Bristol
               on Wednesday 7 January and this letter is written on Friday 9 January, by which time
               he had still not appeared. Southey left Bath on Saturday 10 January, arriving in London
               the following day.</p>
            <div class="opener">
               <div class="dateline"><span class="date">Friday night</span> — no <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>!</div>
            </div>
            <p>I believe I should be very angry were it not for the hope that he has written to Bristol.
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Frickerfamily">your sister</a> desired me to let you know when he arrived, &amp; you must attribute these repeated letters
               to my wish of alleviating suspense as much as possible. you would be disgusted with
               my hand-writing were I to continue this — so from henceforth I will write no more
               on so unpleasant an occasion — if he comes you shall know. excuse me for having troubled
               you so often.</p>
            <p class="indent1">this state of expectation totally unfits me for any thing. when I attempt to employ
               myself the first knock at the door wakes all my hopes again &amp; again disappoints them.
               tis a very unpleasant state — I cannot ask you to write because in hourly hopes of
               seeing him &amp; then visiting you — so here I am — alone — &amp; without the half-compensation
               of correspondence.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>the looking glass represents me most melancholy in my sable suit. if my eyes were

                  employment. strange my dear sister that writing to you should be unpleasant! yet so
                  it is — I cannot give pleasure — &amp; to communicate disappointment is hateful. M<sup>rs</sup> Selwood goes tomorrow morning — she begs to be rememberd to your sister. remember
                  me likewise — tell her that I found much pleasure in writing to her — but rather abandoned
                  it than would run the risk of fatiguing her. —</p>

            <p class="indent1">for mercys sake console me here with a letter — I shall have it tomorrow night or
               Sunday morning — I am so heavy so dull so solitary! this vile expectation unhinges
               me so lamentably. they laugh at my punctuality — so it is — man delights to ridicule
               the virtue he does not possess that he may learn to despise the want of it! punctuality
               — why it is the very prominent feature in my character. I never have been laughed
               out of principles yet.</p>
            <p class="indent1">truly I am ashamed to write — &amp; yet think I ought to. tis the last letter. you have

               positively to you? I told you about the middle of the week. why will he ever fix a
               day if he cannot abide by it. — the quarter boys at Christ Church were the most respectable
               characters I have met with for they never disappointed me.</p>
