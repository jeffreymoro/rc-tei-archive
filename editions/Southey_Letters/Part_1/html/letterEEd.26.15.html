               <p>I am selfish enough to be sorry at your preference of travelling to Oxford — &amp; whilst
                  I commend your choice must lament it — to see the manners of different countries is
                  certainly of the utmost utility &amp; what no university can teach — Homer may tell us
                  of the method to cut up an ox three thousand years ago, or give a specimen of Penelopes
                  politesses when she calls her maid bitch — or Ulysses decency when he threatens to
                  leave Thersites in the situation of the man who cut off his hairs

                  </div> — but Homer can give no information either of men or manners as they are now — knowledge
                  of the world is unattainable from books you have made a judicious choice — your ranking

                  at Oxford it will be some recompense to hear often from you &amp; as you are not (like
                  a certain Monarch who shall be nameless) sparing of time when you write, I shall acquire

                  respecting the general behaviour of the fellows which was answered the following day.
                  one strange circumstance you have neglected to explain — I suppose <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">Combe</a> was there but you do not mentioned his being wounded — now how could <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">Combes</a> nose possibly escape? this I own astonished me for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">Combes</a> nose is much more conspicuous than Joe Collins
