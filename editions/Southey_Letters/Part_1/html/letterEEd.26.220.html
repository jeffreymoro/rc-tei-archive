            <p class="indent1">I do not know whether you were ever at this place. between this &amp; Dover there certainly
               is not a quieter spot. there are not half a dozen lodgings here, — &amp; I am as compleatly
               secluded as I can wish. the price of every thing is nearly doubled since the commencement
               of the war — but as this advance has been general, provisions &amp;c bear the same <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxx</span> proportion as usual to their price in town.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We were one week at Southampton. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> was very unwell — &amp; when she recovered we were confined by bad weather — so that
               I saw little of the place. enough however not to like &lt;it&gt;. the road from Winchester
               thither is remarkably beautiful; so much so as to make the New forest about Lyndhurst
               &amp; Lymington appear comparatively uninteresting. here we are in a very different country.
               I have no map — but I conceive that these flats <span style="text-decoration: line-through">extend</span> communicate with the low parts of Somersetshire &amp; extend quite across the island
               to the Channel. You must not however suppose the scenery here unpleasant. it is of
               a kind that I have not been accustomed to — &amp; will furnish several hints to a very
               valuable <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> &lt;department&gt; in my pocket book, where I set down such of the appearances of nature
               as may be introduced with good effect in poetry. the country has no undulation of
               hill &amp; dale — but the hills rise immediately from the plain, dark &amp; bold. here is
               one of the finest churches in the Kingdom; a pile of ruins stands close to the church
               yard, &amp; a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">very</span> clear &amp; rapid little stream washes one of the walls. a very rude — odd — massy ruin
               on an artificial eminence <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx into</span> stands above the other — &amp; the whole forms a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx</span> fine groupe. we are two miles from the beach — a longer walk than I could wish.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We know no human being here. — I never see a newspaper — &amp; never think of one. we
               arrived here on last Wednesday night, &amp; I now feel myself settled.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Basil Montagu (1770–1851; DNB), lawyer and author, illegitimate son of John Montagu,
                           4th Earl of Sandwich (1718–1792; DNB), and the actress Martha Ray (d. 1779; DNB).
                           Montagu, like Southey, was a member of Gray’s Inn, and was called to the Bar in 1798.
                           He was a friend of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and in 1795, Wordsworth
                           and his sister, Dorothy, undertook the upbringing of his two-year-old son by his first
                           wife.</span></div>
                  </div> — who has chambers in the Square at Lincolns Inn. he asked me if I meant to go to
                  a Special Pleader — &amp; on my answer said if he could save me a hundred guineas — he
                  should feel more than <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> a hundred guineas worth of pleasure in doing so. you know I am a very awkward fellow
                  at thanking any one — but I <span style="text-decoration: line-through">had</span> knew most of his friends — &amp; knew his character well, &amp; so made a better hand than
                  usual. I however am bridled &amp; curbed &amp; you have the reins.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">With regard to what branch of the law I must follow — I would say something. You spoke
               of the common law as a nearer road to eminence I think; of chancery as equally advantageous.
               But is it not probable that in practising common law I may be called upon in criminal
               cases — to plead against the life of a man? if so — I should decidedly prefer chancery.
               I do not expect — I do not desire to be eminent. my only wish is to obtain enough
               to retire into the country — &amp; that by means which I might look back upon without
               regret. But were I to be instrumental in bringing a murderer to the gallows — I should
               ever after feel that I had become a murderer myself.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have not that quickness of mind necessary for cross examinations &amp;c. no man is more
               easily disconcerted than myself. the right answer to an argument never occurs to me
               immediately. I always find it at last — but it comes too late. a blockhead who speaks
               boldly can baffle me. is not this of less consequence in chancery.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>fare well. let me hear from you. are you M.P.?
