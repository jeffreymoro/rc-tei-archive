               mile out the way, so that we found your father &amp; mother drest for church &amp; troubled
               them for a second breakfast. we returned to dinner in spite of the friendly intreaties
               of M<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> C &amp; indeed of &lt;our&gt; own wishes but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> had promised to return &amp; as I had prophesied, repented of his promise. the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Doctor</a> was not with us.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am in hopes to see Horace at Balliol the next term — he seems to have fixd his choice
               unalterably. in fact for what profession is he fit but the church? at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a> he is ruining himself as you well know — contracting habits peevishness &amp; particularities
               all which a little society would cure him of. I want to rub him down — you to perform
               the same friendly office upon me &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> upon you — each sees his neighbours mote — thus wags the world away. when you write
               to him<span style="text-decoration: line-through">self</span> &lt;touch&gt; upon this subject &amp; tell him what service a few years at college would do
               him. he will sweat away his consitution &amp; abilities in the collection room unless
               he very soon is settled.</p>
            <p class="indent1">if you should happen to meet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">Burnet</a> I will be much obliged to you to enquire if any letters are expecting me at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BalliolOxford">Balliol</a>. I expect one which I wish much to receive. will you be good enough if you chance
               to see him, to take the letters &amp; direct them — scratch out the old direction &amp; put

            <p class="indent1">remember me to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> &amp; tell him of the Gesta Romanorum which I will bring to Oxford next term. I have
               much for his perusal. perhaps all my writings are owing to my acquaintance with him
               he saw the first &amp; I knew the value of his praise too much to despise it — for head
               &amp; heart I do not know his equal. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> will like many parts of my Joan but he will shake his head at the subject, with propriety
               if I had designd it for publication — but as the amusement of my leisure I heeded
               no laws but those of inclination. he will be better pleasd to hear I have waded thro
               the work of correcting &amp; expunging my literary rubbish. there is something very vain
               in thus writing of myself, but I know the regard which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> entertains for me whilst he sees the vanity will make him pleasd with the intelligence.</p>
            <p class="indent1">is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Lamb</a> arrived at Oxford — desire <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">his Majesty</a> to give me a little information relative to our friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambThomasDavis">Tom</a>. I wrote <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">the King</a> a long letter but whether he ever receivd it I know not. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">his Highness</a> will honour Bath with his presence at Xmas I suppose if so we may perhaps meet. &amp;
               now when I have enquired for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PeckwellRobertHenry">Peckwell</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ButtJohnMarten">Martin Butt</a> I have run thro the list of my friends</p>
            <p class="indent1">let me hear from you as soon as you can spare time. you have at last if not a rational
               certainly a harmless letter, &amp; did you know the self satisfaction we felt at our joint
               production you would certainly endure a little horse raillery for the sake of so delighting
