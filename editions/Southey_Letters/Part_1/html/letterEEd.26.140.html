               Coleridge, and it is reasonable to assume he also read the Southey letters sometime
               around this period.<br>Unpublished.<br>Dating note: James Dykes Campbell’s transcript is misdated 16 November 1795. The same
               transcript is headed ‘Tuesday’ (which was 17 November) and the letter bears marked
               similarities of subject and phrasing to one sent by Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford
               on 17 November 1795 (Letter 139). It is possible that this and the fragment to Cottle,
               dated ‘Falmouth, 1795’ (Letter 143), are part of the same letter. Campbell’s note
               on Southey’s ‘duty’ might imply so.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
