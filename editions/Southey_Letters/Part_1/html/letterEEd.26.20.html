            <p class="indent1">By this post I write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> &amp; beg house room for my unfortunate books till I go to Oxford — will you be kind
               enough to direct them to old Donkey &amp; send them all there.</p>
            <p class="indent1">in your tour you must take the western parts of England &amp; if you will contrive it
               whilst I am either at Bath or Bristol you know I shall be very happy to see you. I
               do not go to Oxford till October &amp; at Christmas I shall be again at Bath but come
               when you will I shall hope to see you before you leave England.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I shall always be glad to hear from you &amp; the oftener the better — how I am to write
               to you when you are travelling? you must inform me at what town you intend to be upon
               a fixed day &amp; I will direct to be left at the post office till called for — if you
               can fix upon a better method pray inform me.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am ready to run mad over the mathematics! which I have just begun &amp; wish I had just
               concluded — all your drudgery is over. I have five years more to look &lt;forwards&gt; &amp;
               at the expiration of that time look forward to nothing more agreeable.</p>
            <p class="indent1">when does <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CombeEdward">Combe</a> leave school? I wish to write to him before he goes. this day week I was within seven
               miles of the palace at Earns hill &amp; had not time to visit it &amp; see the Lions!</p>
            <p class="indent1">our western country may well claim your attention — we have in Somersetshire three
               cities (which no other county in England has &amp; of which you have only seen Bath. I
               saw Wells &amp; Wokey hole Monday last but will not anticipate by a description the pleasure
               you will find in visiting one of the finest Gothic buildings in England. the cavern
               &amp; Glastonbury Abbey &amp; Tor will please you but we saw Battle Abbey together &amp; after
               that what ruins in England are to be mentioned as worthy of comparison?</p>
            <p class="indent1">you must be busy in preparation &amp; though really I am disposed to lengthen my letter
               I consider your time as well disposed of — all I shall further say is that I hope
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VincentWilliam">Dr V</a> will give you a better character than your sincere friend</p>
