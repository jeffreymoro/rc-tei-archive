               <p>as I do not know when I may again find so excellent an opportunity of beginning —
                  I seize old Time by the forelock &amp; there will I hold him till I want him. so no more
                  at present from your sincere friend. where my letter is destined to be finished I
                  know not but the continuation comes from Reading where I am writing in a small room
                  with a good fire &amp; two London Riders dissertating upon robberies &amp; the most likely
                  places for such adventures. as one of them is at the same table I cannot versify as
                  I intended &amp; had begun so plain prose must tell how I got this far. the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Doctor</a> left me at Brentford I proceeded on sad &amp; solitary to Hounslow &amp; there gave one shilling

                  I took a dinner. but I found the day growing late &amp; myself unwilling to be fatigued
                  against tomorrow so I first mounted the Maidenhead Stage &amp; then the Reading. as evening
                  approachd got in the last &amp; here I am at a most execrable Inn in not the most agreable

            <p class="indent1">I know nothing so unpleasant as leaving the friends we love &amp; — yet such is the state
               of society that life is hardly any thing than continual parting. you are an exception
               — but observe the general tenour of life — school &amp; college occupy what ought to be
               &lt;the&gt; happiest ages — then comes business &amp; perhaps the opportunity of happiness when
               the relish is gone. Universities might certainly be made useful institutions but at
               present they are pernicious to individuals &amp; to the nation at large. the morality
               of Oxford you know how to estimate but with respect to the polishing which I know
               I want but fear I shall never attain — is it to be found there? steel receives its
               last polish from a womans hand I believe — &amp; my rugged ore requires the same management
               — this I shall never meet with. three years must be spent in studies which lead to
               nothing — &amp; the remainder of my life in forming theories of happiness which I never
               can practise<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span>. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</a> says very truly that &lt;a&gt; man who indulges himself in literature merely for self amusement
               deserves no more respect from the public than the glutton or the voluptuary. this
               is very true but selfishness is deeply implanted in the human heart so deeply that
               even the strong hand of Philosophy cannot root it up. you &amp; I may indulge ourselves
               in theories of reforming the taste &amp; morals of a corrupt age &amp; perhaps our theories
               are not wholly visionary — but is our disinterestedness such as might prompt us to
               this against our inclination?</p>

                  upon reading Sir Launcelot Greaves on the road. broad coarse humour seems to be the
                  chief excellence of Smollet incidents almost too gross to please &amp; too strange to
                  be probable happen at every inn his heroes stop at &amp; we are sure to find the sailors
                  dialect &amp; the clowns broad Scotch or broad Yorkshire in the place of humour. when
                  he gets upon those subjects which perhaps none but Rousseau knew how to treat he rhapsodizes
                  about charms angels &amp; Hymens &amp; thinks passion &amp; nonsense mean the same. some strange
                  discovery of birth comes in at the end &amp; all the dramatis personæ are tacked together
                  at the altar. yet with all these faults you are not soon tired of Smollets novels.
                  they insensibly lead you on &amp; if they do not come near the heart certainly play round
