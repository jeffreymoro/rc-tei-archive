                  says there is no spectacle more grateful to the Gods than a good man struggling with

                  prefers that the many should in some degree partake of the virtue of one by recompensing
                  it or that one should be aggrandized by misfortune &amp; the guilt of the many. it were
                  only wasting words to show the unequal &amp; unjust distribution of worldly goods — an
                  innocent man can never feel the worm of remorse gnaw his heart but he may be tormented
                  with regret whose sting is as sharp as a wasps &amp; less easily cured. how it would be
                  doing such a man a favour to make a calf of him — for ten to one if the roasting does
                  not destroy the canker worm — &amp; the agonies of one great blister render him forgetful
                  of even mental pain — he would call up all the consolations of conscious Virtue &amp;
                  rejoice in death. now put a villain in this said bull &amp; see how differently roasting
                  will operate upon him. the mental torments he will feel will exceed his bodily sufferings
                  — the bull will appear a specimen of the kitchen of Lucifer &amp; his end will be damnable
                  indeed. Honesty is indeed the best policy. the good man will be happier in prosperity
