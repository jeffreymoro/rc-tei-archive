               <p>Hot with walking &amp; warm repentance I do sit me down to repair the apparent coolness
                  of neglect. my dear brother when I have been writing as hard as is necessary to furnish
                  two lectures a week an hour each in recitation, I have been tempted to fling all down
                  &amp; write to you. I am giving a course of historical Lectures at Bristol, teaching what
                  is right by showing what is wrong.
