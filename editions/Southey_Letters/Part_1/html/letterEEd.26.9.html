               <div class="salute">Dear Bedford </div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I ought certainly to have returned you my best thanks as well for your letters as
               your giving up the Flagellant. I would have wrote sooner but I have no longer the
               consolation of having acted either properly or consistently — what had happened from
               malice &amp; tyranny I could bear but when I have stooped to mean&lt;n&gt;ess &amp; falshood I cannot
               find that pride in reflection necessary to comfort. I look upon myself with contempt
               &amp; fly from the hideous retrospect. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> I have been obliged to write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#VincentWilliam">Vincent</a> to confess myself wrong — I deserve to be despised I deserve to be shunned but I
               do not think you will despise me — more than once have I approachd the very brink
               of destruction still however I live in the hope of revenge &amp; that hope is the only
               thing which can render life supportable.</p>
            <p class="indent1">your last leaves me in an unpleasant suspense you have some <span class="ital">virtuous</span> &amp;c action to tell me — accustomed as we are to such complicated meanness &amp; villany
               it must be something very bad to surprize me — I am not quite eighteen &amp; few men of
               eighty have been more persecuted — but disappointment &amp; misery are the portion of
               all my family &amp; I must bear my part — were I to lay open the whole history of these
               misfortunes you would think it scarcely credible, still less so that I could survive
               them — hope &amp; the firm dignity of conscious merit have hitherto supported me, the
               last of these is gone — I am despicable in my own eyes &amp; criminal in those of my friends
               where then can I look for assistance — hope can bring little.</p>
            <p class="indent1">the Flagellant is gone — still however do I think that our joint production may acquire
               some credit — the sooner we have a volume &lt;published&gt; the better — the Medley — the
               Hodge Podge — the Whatdoyoucall it — or to retain our old plan Monastic lucubrations
               any of these titles or any better you may propose will do. shall we dedicate it to
               Envy Hatred Malice &amp; all Uncharitableness?</p>

               us with your marked attention — ye who can convert innocence into treason &amp; shielded
