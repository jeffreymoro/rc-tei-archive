               <p>These lines are very beautiful, but not a single image contained in them is to be
                  found in the Portuguese; there is scarcely a passage in the translation from which
                  similar instances might not be produced. “He who can construe (says Mr. Mickle) may
                  perform all that is claimed by the literal translator. He who attempts the manner
                  of translation prescribed by Horace, ventures upon a task of genius; yet, however
                  daring the undertaking, and however he may have failed in it, the translator acknowledges
                  that, in this spirit, he endeavoured to give the Lusiad in English. Even farther liberties,
                  in one or two instances, seemed to him advantageous; but a minuteness in the mention
                  of these will not, in these pages, appear with a good grace. He shall only add, in
                  this new edition, that some of the most eminent of the Portuguese literati, both in
                  England and on the continent, have approved of these freedoms, and the original is
                  in the hands of the world.” In the note to this passage, he points out two of these
                  farther liberties; one of them trifling, the other of importance; and adds, “it was
                  not to gratify the dull few whose greatest pleasure in reading a translation is to
                  see what the author exactly says, <span class="ital">it was to give a poem that might live in the English language</span>, which was the ambition of the translator.”

                  Homer, in the manner of Virgil: by diversifying the scene, he has made the description
                  his own.”

               him all due praise as a poet; and a complete statement of what belongs to him, what
               to Camoens, would increase his reputation instead of impairing it. I never read a
               rhyme poem of any considerable length, that wearied me so little as the English Lusiad;
               the versification has the ease of Dryden without his negligence, and the harmony of
               Pope without his cloying sweetness.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The translator’s admiration of his author, has sometimes made him lavish commendations
                  upon passages wholly undeserving of them. In the second book, a Moorish pilot is steering
                  the Portuguese ships upon a ridge of rocks, from which they are saved by the sea nymphs.
                  This, Mr. Mickle says, is in the spirit of Homer; but, whatever the allegory may be,
                  the agency is disgustingly violent; the nymphs are represented as toiling and straining
                  and panting to push off the vessels, and Venus, who leads them on, puts her breast
                  against the prow of Gama’s ship, and thus thrusts it off. In the speech of Inez de
                  Castro, he says, “the beautiful victim expresses the strong emotions of genuine nature;”

                  </div> now it is absurd to represent a women agitated with such agonizing terror as Inez,
                  making a long speech: the poet, as well as the painter, should know where to draw
                  the veil. It is the story only that has made this part of Camoens popular; when the
                  reader pictures to himself the situation of Inez, he does not attend to the nonsense <span class="ital">she</span> talks about Romulus and Remus, the burning plains of Lybia, and the snow-clad rocks

                  losing one eye, in the service of his country, he left it for the Indies, and exclaimed,
                  as he looked back upon Lisbon from the vessel, “<span class="ital">Ingrata patria, non possidebis ossa mea</span>.”
