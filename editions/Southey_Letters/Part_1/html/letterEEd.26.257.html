                  </div> a man ought to repress painful feelings — or I would tell you my own upon this occasion. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">She</a> has left no equal. The world can ill spare such a woman — but I am sometimes tempted
                  to think that the best of us were designed for a better place, &amp; dropt here by some
                  unlucky mistake. if however this be not our punishment, a better world must be our
                  reward. if mankind were all disbelievers in a hereafter the earth would soon be thinned
                  by suicide.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Something odd came into my head a few hours since. I was feeling that the love of
               letter-writing had greatly gone from me &amp; enquiring why. my mind is no longer agitated
               by hopes &amp; fear, no longer doubtful, no longer possessed with such ardent enthusiasm.
               it is quiet — &amp; repels all feelings that would disturb that state. when I write I
               have nothing to communicate — for you know all my opinions &amp; feelings, &amp; incidents
               none can occur to one settled as I am. what followed these reflections? I have long
               intended to write my own history — or rather to trace the development of my own character
               which I can accurately recollect. will you be my Confessor — &amp; will you with most
               Catholic secresy receive the detail of the past? not that I have one sin to confess,
               tho follies enough — but I would not have such letters seen by persons who cannot
               understand them — perhaps by nobody save yourself.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Now <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> here will be matter enough for me to write long letters &amp; when I am dead — you will
               have a series more interesting then than now.</p>
