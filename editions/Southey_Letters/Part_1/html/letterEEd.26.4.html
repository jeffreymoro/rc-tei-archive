                  misfortunes — Common Sense said the Deity will warn them of approaching ills &amp; the
                  gentle hand of Philosophy will at least soften the misfortunes it cannot prevent —
                  such were the sentiments of the cloud-compelling God but they were disappointed by
                  Fate, for to Fate even Jove himself must yield. wandering over the world in vain did
                  Common Sense seek wherein to rest her head, when she perceived a form stalking slowly
                  along with his eyes fixed upon the ground. his head was enveloped in a mass of hair
                  his brows knit &amp; his arms folded in contemplative semblance — ever was he muttering
                  ancient saws which few could understand &amp; fewer still thought worth the understanding.
                  need I say it was Ignora&lt;nce.&gt; in vain did she resist for power aided Ignorance &amp;
                  the offspring of the union was Pedantry a child whose small portion of his mothers
                  wisdom was buried in all his fathers folly. a happier lot was destined was Philosophy
                  she was destined for the wife of Freedom the vigorous daring Freedom. but possessd
                  of his fathers fire &amp; his mothers strength of mind Presumption viewd himself as a
                  being nearly equal to the Gods. provoked at length by the folly of Pedantry &amp; the
                  arrogance of Presumption Jupiter sentenced the latter to become the pupil of the former
                  — thus the one conscious of his superiority viewd his master with indignant contempt
                  whilst the other beheld his pupil as ridiculous &amp; rebellious. the punishment of Presumption
                  has attended his descendants &amp; they feel its force — but the folly of Pedantry serves
                  as an antidote &amp; amongst all the SCHOOL-MASTERS there exists not one who does not
                  think himself a paragon of wisdom.</p>
