                  the English here unite the spirit of commerce with the frivolous amusements of high

                  he charges high — but when he comes the next day the feeling is gone — &amp; he asks only
                  half the money.” and the author of this philosophical scheme is worth 200,000 pounds!!
                  this is a comfortless place, &amp; the only pleasure I find in it, is in looking on to

                  upon the most unequal ground — with heaps of ruins in the middle, &amp; large open places.
                  the streets filthy beyond all English ideas of filth — for they throw every thing
                  into the street, &amp; nothing is removed. dead animals annoy you at every corner — &amp;
                  such is the indolence &amp; nastiness of the Portuguese that I really believe they would
                  let one another rot in the same manner, if the Priests did not get something by burying
                  them. some of the friars are vowed <span style="text-decoration: line-through">never</span> to wear the same clothes without changing for a year — &amp; this is a comfort to them.
                  you will not wonder therefore that I always keep the windward of one of these reverend
                  perfumers. the streets are very agreable in wet weather — if you walk under the houses
                  you are drenched by the water spouts. if you attempt the middle — there is a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">little</span> river. would you go between both — there is the dunghill. the rains here are very
                  violent, &amp; the streams in the streets on a declivity so rapid as to throw down men.

               &amp; with great reason, for one night he knockd at the door of S<sup>t</sup> Roques church, &amp; there they would not admit him; upon this he walked to the other
               end of the town to the Church of Grace, &amp; there they took him in. but a dispute now
               arose between the two churches, to which the image belongd, whether to the church
               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">to</span> which he first chose, or the Church that first chose him. the matter was compromised
               — one church has him, but the other fetches him for their procession, &amp; he sleeps
               with them the night preceding it. the better mode of deciding it had been to place
               the Gentleman between both, &amp; let him walk to which he liked best. what think you
