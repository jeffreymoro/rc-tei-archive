               on the same journey — &amp; if one of us or both be not knocked up on the road, I trust
               we shall arrive together at the end. I shall see you soon — probably within a month
               or three weeks —.</p>
            <p class="indent1">how is it that we have changed characters? you so anxious — I so tranquil. is it that
               I am advanced one stage beyond you in the way of the world? that I have seen more
               &amp; suffered more? you have been settled comfortably at home trotting from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a> to Palace Yard after breakfast, &amp; from Palace Yard to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a> before dinner, your relations happy in you, happy in yourself, without wants, almost

            <p class="indent1">So you are at your mysteries again! for my part I never dive into darkness. I shall
