                  from those polluted shores with wealth &amp; honors — I have heard of one great man &amp;

                  than I am — &amp; I have not yet set out on my “way of life.”</p>

            <p class="indent1">tell me my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> would not the frequent company of a friend whose mind met yours — remove half the
               gloom that darkens the morning of your days? <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> is not that friend — because you live with him. the food of Love is the poison of

               that disquiet you. for <span class="ital">I have disbelieved</span>. perhaps I could cure your heresy as to Women for I am married.</p>
            <p class="indent1">in other points we should probably agree. I think as badly of the mob of mankind as
               you can do — but perhaps admit more exceptions to the general rule. you likewise must
               know how many of our vices &amp; miseries spring from existing institutions. I believe

            <p class="indent1">in all the anxiety that has fallen to my lot — &amp; I have had my share — literary occupations
               have afforded me a resource. poetry has been with me a passion &amp; I am indebted to
               it as well for happiness, as for bread. whilst employed about Joan of Arc I was tempest-tost
               on the ocean of life — but at the moments of composition — I soard eagle like into
               the regions of tranquillity above the storm. I was no longer R.S. pennyless — &amp; doubtful
               of tomorrows dinner with all my &lt;own&gt; feelings I was transplanted into the wise wildness
               of Conrade — or the dignified resignation of the Maid of Orleans. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> these pleasures are in your power: I have long laid aside the hypocritical language
               of compliment. the poetry which you have ever sent me evinces powers capable of greatness.
               cultivate them <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a>. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">after xx</span> &lt;let us&gt; have ploughed our fields &amp; manure our pasture grounds — but let not the

               employ it, till you are more settled, in writing a book if the book be bad burn it
               when it is done — you will have at least exercised your mind &amp; by exercise only can
               the mind as well as the body be kept healthful. the water that stagnates will corrupt.</p>
            <p class="indent1">no <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> Ignorance &amp; Vice shall not eternally coexist with Folly. for Folly &amp; Vice are the

               convince you no medium can exist between Optimism &amp; Atheism — &amp; Atheism is a self-evident
