                  satire, as indeed the indulgence of any kind of wit, insensibly injures the moral
                  character &amp; disposes it to sacrifice any thing to a good point; yet Boileau

                  </div> must have had some reason for the extreme contempt in which he held this unfortunate
                  production. I am inclined to think it better however than it has always been represented;
                  Chapelain stood high in poetical reputation when he published this, the work on which
                  he meant to build his fame; he is said to have written good odes, certainly then his
                  epic labours cannot be wholly void of merit, &amp; for its characteristic fault, extreme
                  harshness, it is very probable that a man of genius writing in so unmanly a language
                  should become harsh by attempting to be strong. the French never can have a good epic
                  poem till they have republicanized their language; it appears to me a thing impossible
                  in their metres; &amp; for the prose of Fenelon Florian &amp; Bitaubè

                  mankind in a mass. there was a time when I believed in the persuadibility of man &amp;
                  had the mania of man-mending; experience has taught me better. after a certain age
                  the organs of voice cannot accommodate themselves to the utterance of a foreign pronunciation;
                  so is it with the mind, it grows stiff &amp; unyielding like our sinews as we grow older.
                  the ablest physician can do little in the great lazar-house of society. it is a pest-house
                  that infects all within its atmosphere; he acts the wisest part who retires from the
                  contagion; nor is that part either a selfish or a cowardly one; it is ascending the
                  Ark like Noah to preserve a remnant which may become the whole.</p>

               <p>As to what is the cause of the incalculable wretchedness of society &amp; what is the
                  panacea, I have long felt certified in my own mind. the rich are strangely ignorant
                  of the miseries to which the lowest &amp; largest part of mankind are abandoned — &amp; even
                  of those who see &amp; pity &amp; relieve their distresses, you will scarcely find one who
                  has ever felt shocked at the reflection that God has given to the poor mental capabilities
                  that might have infinitely benefited mankind — &amp; given them in vain, — only to be
                  stifled by society. there is not upon this earth one spot where man enjoys “the unfettered

                  the necessity of another revelation I do not see myself. what we have had with the
                  right exertion of our own reasoning faculties appears to me sufficient. but in a Millenarian
                  this opinion is not ridiculous, &amp; the many yet unfulfilled prophecies give it an appearance
                  of probability. opinions of this kind may amuse &amp; comfort the solitary speculatist,
                  but something more is required to act upon. were it possible I would immediately retire

               success — &amp; not three of those persons have persevered in rejecting it. this is perfectly
               astonishing to me — &amp; what can be expected from those who will &lt;not&gt; remedy so horrible
               an iniquity by so easy an exertion!</p>
            <p class="indent1">The future presents a dreary prospect — but all will end in good &amp; I can contemplate

               feelings &amp; excite those reflections in others, from whence virtue must spring. in
