               <p>early the next morning we rose after a curious division of the bed for we slept together
                  he took all the bed &amp; I took all the cloaths but we did not need rocking — over Camden
                  downs to Broadway — the hill above the town presented me with a most delightful view
                  equally rich &amp; far more extensive than that from Madams court<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> hill, yet not so very beautifully diversied — you see the fertile vale of Evesham
                  — the town of the same name — Broadway just below — &amp; at a distance the smoke of Pershore
                  &amp; Worcester. Malvern hills melting into distance. a man of Exeter

                  two toe nails — he was mounted but though we left Oxford together, we kept up with
                  him even unto Worcester. the abbey at Evesham is wonderfully grand — in a very different
                  stile from Battle but equally beautiful. a tower, a perfect sample of the simple Gothic
                  fronts the skeleton of the church, whose roof in many places fallen in affords light
                  enough to show distinctly the inside &amp; casts a shade in many places — the grass grows
                  in the high archd windows — desolation makes it more striking but unless some admirer
                  of antiquity gives assistance very shortly it will I fear fall entirely. we reachd
                  Worcester to dinner having never rested for 21 miles — here as you may easily imagine
                  we were not sorry to rest — to proceed 12 miles thro a very clayey wet country was
                  tho not impossible very unpleasant — we remained that night &amp; the next morning being
                  wet breakfasted with a clergyman. the day cleared up — I bought a trusty stick — threw
                  on my old bear as the luggage had arrived &amp; on we proceeded — the country had been
                  pleasant before it now become [MS torn]lly beautiful &amp; I rejoiced in having journied
                  to it but the wet ground &amp; roads such [MS torn] in Sussex would be deemed impassable
                  made the travelling not good th[MS torn] trifle beneath consideration but we grew
                  hungry for speed was impossible &amp; alehouses [MS torn] nondescript in our journey.
                  the bread &amp; cheese cold pigs face tongue tarts &amp; cyder were most agreable — it may
                  seem strange but I never found such pleasure in travelling as in this expedition —
                  the highest pride is couched under humility &amp; in truth I was proud of travelling so
                  humbly.</p>

               <p>I have since visited Abberley Bewdley Kidderminster &amp; Malvern each well worth seeing
