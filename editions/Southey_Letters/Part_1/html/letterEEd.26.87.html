            <p class="indent1">The pointed sentence &amp; the well rounded period my dear friend are proper &amp; pretty
               in declamation, but the stile of letter writing should flow from the heart, not from
               the deliberate musing of the head. I remained at old <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#BalliolOxford">Ball. Coll.</a> till the Friday morning after your departure, &amp; great part of my time passed in all
               the luxury of democratic converse. my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> is an excellent republican. his manners urbane &amp; liberal — in short never did countenance
               more truly pourtray disposition than his does — if you know the mans appearance you
               will feel the force of this. we democratized gloriously nor did I quit Oxford without
               feeling something like regret notwithstanding the prospect of revisiting some of my
               dearest friends. even at school I have perceived this sentiment intrude itself on
               breaking up. tis the local patriotism the heart contracts from habit — the residence
               of any length of time recalls so many &amp; such various scenes — every spot calls to
               mind some particular incident which once pleased &amp; still is recollected with pleasure,
               that I soon domesticate anywhere. Cats have the same attachment to place. do not you
               regard every rats hole round the fish pond at Souldrey?</p>

                  Rousseau may paint so exquisite a scene of visionary perfection that when Reason wakes
                  it to human fallibility, disgust attends the contrast. Hawkesworth argues very strongly
