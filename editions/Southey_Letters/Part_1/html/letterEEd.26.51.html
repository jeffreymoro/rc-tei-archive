               <p>It is seldom <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> that I have felt any thing like reluctance in writing to you, nor indeed ought I to
                  feel it now. your invitation kind &amp; attractive as it is, cannot be accepted by me <span class="ital">at the time you mention</span>. on the 18th of January I left home &amp; since that period have not seen any one of
                  my own family. it is now necessary to give some time to them &amp; this it is my duty
                  to do. as for inclination I must learn on many occasions to bridle it. home is far
                  from being to me the comfortable retreat you enjoy. I have been so long inured to
                  misery there that the idea of it when it comes across happier scenes clouds them.
                  keen as my relish is for the pleasures of domestic life I have experienced them but
                  little — perhaps I never may more but my present disposition is not the most chearful
                  &amp; I will hope better scenes in store. some time this year however <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> I will pleasure myself by visiting you, as I think of missing Michaelmas term &amp; will
                  then if you permit me make <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a> in my road to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#MountsfieldRye">Rye</a>. after saying so much you will not attempt to press me farther &amp; pain me to refuse.
                  we shall meet at the Installation. I have seldom looked to any period with greater
                  pleasure it is more than twelvemonths since we have seen each other &amp; in despite of
                  the various transactions which have <span style="text-decoration: line-through">since</span> passed during that period I do not fancy myself altered in any great respect. I am
                  as visionary &amp; childish, or indeed more so, than ever as noisy as wild &amp; sometimes
                  as melancholy. you <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> are peculiarly fortunate in escaping the four years purgatory of an University. to
                  live so many months without seeing one female being, or rather without speaking to
                  one — totally confined to the intercourse of men or boys your own age, is miserable.
                  here we have none of that mixed intercourse which polishes down our rough edges &amp;
                  renders us human. if the consequences of this defect can be good I much wondering
                  am much mistaken — the old fellows vegitate among their books — the undergraduates
                  take to the bottle for resourse, or the “mercenary retailers of iniquity”
