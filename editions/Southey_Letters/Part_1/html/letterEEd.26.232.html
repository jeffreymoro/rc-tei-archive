                           young (under nineteen) and most remarkably handsome. She went to a linen-draper’s
                           shop, took some coarse linen off the counter, and slipped it under her cloak; the

                  horrible business was enough to have made every honest man sick of &lt;a&gt; society to
                  whose abuses she fell a victim. but had her guilt exceeded that of the most detestable
                  murderer, what must the executioner have been who could tear her infant from her breast,

               may sweep me away, or the few individuals who would commit themselves with me to that
               little Ark. I suffer no gloomy presages to disturb the tranquil happiness with which
               God has blest me now, &amp; which I know how to value because I have felt what it is to
