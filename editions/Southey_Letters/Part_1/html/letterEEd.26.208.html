                  honoured with his name; nor will he, who peruses the version of Villegas, remember
                  to its disadvantage the harmony of Grecian cadence. He has likewise introduced hexameters
                  and Sapphics, with success, into his native language; and even the critic, who so
                  severely attacks the Eroticas, calls his Sapphic ode to Zephyrus most beautiful (<span class="ital">bellissima oda</span>).

               <p>As these lines indicate, Villegas now bade adieu to poetry, and applied himself to
                  such studies as were likely to be more esteemed, and better rewarded. Two folio volumes
                  of classical criticism, entitled <em>Variæ Philologiæ</em>, yet remain in manuscript, to witness his learning and industry; and he began the
                  more laborious task of commenting upon the Theodosian Code.

                  vanity of his hopes, he employed the latter days of life in translating the Consolations
                  of Philosophy, fully participating, perhaps, the proud and melancholy feelings that
                  comforted Boethius.
