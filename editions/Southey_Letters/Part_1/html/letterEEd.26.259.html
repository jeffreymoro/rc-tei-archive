               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunts</a> bed room was a sanctum sanctorum accessible to none. so when she went out to &lt;an&gt;
               evening visit, which was often or rather always — I was at 8 o clock put into the
               Maids, &amp; then removed when she returned. a hideous transportation! there was I to
               be without moving head or foot till eleven the next morning. luckily fingers were
               at liberty — &amp; I used to play with them from six o clock — for wise Nature woke me
               betimes. or else fancy pictures in the green squares of the check curtains.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I must tell you two quaint dreams of this period, because they have made a deeper
               impression upon my memory than any circumstances of infancy. I thought my head was
               cut off for cursing the King — &amp; after it was done I laid my head down in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</a> lap — &amp; every now &amp; then lookd up &amp; cursed &lt;him&gt; — <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx xxxxxxx xx xxxxx xxxx</span>.</p>

               was sitting with her when the Devil came to pay her a morning visit. she put him a
               chair — “dear M<sup>r</sup> Devil — pray sit down M<sup>r</sup> Devil” &amp; smirked &amp; smiled all politeness while I sat &amp; looked at his cloven foot,
               &amp; perspired at every pore.</p>
            <p class="indent1">My time was mostly passed at Bath with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a>. I had no playmates there. if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> was writing letters, I was to sit silent. there was a garden — but in playing there
               my cloaths might be soiled, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp; perhaps</span> all this must necessarily have injured the young animal. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a> once when he came to see me found me pale &amp; thin.

               &amp; have not yet forgotten the tea-cup in which the bark was given me, &amp; a foul sweet
               medicine, I have the resurrection of its cursed maukishness now on my minds tongue.
               he returned home in a rage — swore <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> would kill “the boy” &amp; in consequence I was transported to Bristol. this was great
               joy to me. I had a play-mate in poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEliza">Eliza</a> — my sister a year younger than myself. I could dirt my cloaths — &amp; might play in

                  we call a brown study — at last out it came with the utmost earnestness to my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</a> — “Auntee Polly — I sould like to have all the weapons of war — the gun &amp; the sword
