            <p class="indent1">Since my last I have been continually journying backwards &amp; forwards upon business
               which would not allow me to fix sufficient attention upon any thing else. it is now
               over — I have time to look about &amp; I hope with fairer prospects for the future. one
               of my journeys was to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">my fathers brother</a> at Taunton to request him to assist <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a> &amp; enable him to recover that situation whence the treachery of his relations &amp; injustice
               of his friends had thrown him. I had never seen this uncle &amp; you may easily conceive
               how unpleasant so humiliating an errand must prove to so proud a spirit. he was absent
               I left a letter &amp; two days ago received an answer &amp; refusal. fortunately <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> had prevented the necessity but her goodness does not extenuate his unnatural parsimony.
               he is single &amp; possessed of property to the amount of 100,000 pounds without a child
               to provide for. that part of his fortune which he inherited must one day be mine —
               it will I hope enable me to despise the world &amp; feel myself independant.</p>
