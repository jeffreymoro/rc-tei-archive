            <p class="indent1">They do not order these things quite so well in England. We arrived at Southampton
               at 6 last evening. “Lodgings” were hung out at almost every house. but some would
               not let less than eleven rooms — some 7 &amp; so on — &amp; we walked a very long &amp; uncomfortable
               hour before we could buy hospitality — &amp; that at a very dear rate. I mean to walk
               tomorrow thro Lyndhurst &amp; Lymington to Christ Church. that is if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> be better — for she is now very unwell. she is feverish. I hope &amp; believe it is only
               the temporary effect of fatigue. — but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> a single man does not know what anxiety is.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is not well enough to walk out — I therefore have seen only enough of this place
               to dislike it. its inhabitants are people connected with shipping — &amp; sharking shopkeepers
               — its visitors the very top scum of aristocracy. the carrion that these vultures feed
               upon. I want a quiet lonely place. in sight of something green. surely in a walk of
               thirty miles this may be found — but if I find the whole coast infected by visitors
               I will go to Bristol — where I shall have the Printer on one side, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DanversCharles">Charles Danvers</a> on the other, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> in front — the woods &amp; rocks of Avon behind — &amp; be in the centre of all good things.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Our journey was hot &amp; dusty. but thro a lovely country. at one time the coach was
               full — &amp; all — but me asleep. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I</span> something fell off the roof — &amp; I had the unutterable pleasure of waking all of them
               by bellowing out to bid the Coachman stop.</p>
            <p class="indent1">the idea of my lonely expedition is not very agreable. it is thirty miles to Christ
               Church. I could go 18 by coach. but the coach sets out at 3 in the evening — so that
               as it would not be well to walk the other 12 after 7 o clock — it would occasion an
               absence of 3 days. I hope <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is better (it is now near 6) — two days of solitude will be unpleasant to her.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Would we were settled — aye &amp; for life in some little sequestered valley — I would
                  be content never to climb over the hills that sheltered me, &amp; never to hear music
                  or taste beverage but from the stream that ran beside my door. Let me have the sea
                  too — &amp; now &amp; then some piece of a wreck, to supply me with firewood &amp; remind me of
                  commerce. This New Forest is very lovely. I should like to have a house in it — &amp;
                  dispeople the rest like William the Conqueror.

                  feelings are those of the highest delight. they pass over the mind like the clouds
                  of the summer evening — too fine &amp; too fleeting for Memory to detain.</p>

            <p class="indent1">And now <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> would I wager sixpence that you are regretting my absence, because you feel disposed
               to come to tea with us. I could upbraid you — but this is one of the follies of man
               — &amp; I have my share of it — tho thank God — but a small share. what we can do at any
               time is most likely not to be done at all. We are more willing to make an effort.
               is this because we feel uneasy at the prospect of labour — of something to be done?
               &amp; so are stimulated to industry by a love of indolence. I am a self observer, &amp; indeed
               this appears to me the secret spring.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I shall however act in opposition to it now — &amp; stay here probably till Monday — tho
               the idea of going is very uncomfortable &amp; clings like birdlime to every thought. this
               is because I do not like to leave <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> to the double evil of solitude &amp; indisposition.</p>
            <p class="indent1">farewell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a>. I shall sally forth — &amp; look for the Post Office. whereunto Write. When I tell you
               that Southampton has <span class="ital">a Quay</span> instead of a beach — I need not abuse the blackguard place.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I wish THE Tribunal was established. it would make provisions cheaper. there are so
