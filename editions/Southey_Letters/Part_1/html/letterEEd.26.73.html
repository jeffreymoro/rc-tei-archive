            </header><br><p class="indent1">The Gentleman who brings this letter must occupy a few lines of it. his name is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovel</a>. I know him but very little personally tho long by report. you must already see &lt;he&gt;
               is eccentric. perhaps I do wrong in giving him this, but I wish your opinion of him.
               those who are superficially acquainted with him feel wonder — those who know him love.
               this character I hear, he is on the point of marrying a <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerMary">young woman</a> with whom I spent great part of my young&lt;er&gt; years. we were bred up together I may
               almost say; &amp; that period was the happiest of my life. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">M<sup>r</sup> Lovel</a> has very great abilities. he writes well — in short I wish his acquaintance myself
               &amp; as his stay in town is very short, you will forgive the introduction. perhaps you
               may rank him with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a>. &amp; supposing excellence to be at 100 <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DuppaRichard">Duppa</a> is certainly much above 50.</p>
            <p class="indent1">now my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> I doubt I am acting improperly. it was enough to introduce myself so rudely but abilities
               always claim respect &amp; that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovel</a> has these is I think very certain. characters if anyways markd are well worth studying
               &amp; a young man of two &amp; twenty who has been his own master since fifteen &amp; who owes
               all his knowledge to himself is so far a respectable character. my knowledge of him
               I again repeat is very confind. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerMary">his intended bride</a> I look upon as almost a sister — &amp; one should know ones brother<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> in law.</p>

                  never vouchsafd one line. now I shall write again &amp; if he still continues obstinate

                  that &amp; I will fortify myself against chance. the wants of man are so very few that
                  they must be attainable somewhere &amp; whether here or in America matters little. I have
