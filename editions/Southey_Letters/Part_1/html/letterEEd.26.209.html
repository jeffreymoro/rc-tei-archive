                  rate of sixteen pages a day; as hard going as sixteen miles for a hack horse. About
                  sixteen days more will complete it.</p>

            <p class="indent1">There is no necessity for my residing in London till the close of the autumn. Therefore
               after keeping the next term, which may be kept the first week in May, I intend to
               go into the country for five months; probably near the sea, at the distance of one
               day’s journey from London, for the convenience of coming up to keep the Trinity Term.
               This will not increase my expenses, though it will give me all the pleasure of existence
               which London annihilates. God bless you,</p>
