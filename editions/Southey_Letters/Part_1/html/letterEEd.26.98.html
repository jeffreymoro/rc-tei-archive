            <p class="indent1">I have this day written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">your brother</a>. your letter arrived since. to a few points I can immediately reply. my resolution
               with regard to America is taken. &amp; the principles which guide me there are so powerful
               that tho <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LovellRobert">Lovell</a> was strongly prejudiced against them he has totally changed his opinion &amp; will go
               with me.</p>
            <p class="indent1">suffer me <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> to decline answering you when you attack republicanism. think of republicans with
               candor for my sake when I am gone, &amp; when you are tempted by the contagion of aristocracy
               to declaim against Levellers &amp; Jacobines remember you knew one at least disinterested
               &amp; sincere. you can now conform to the opinion of those you live with, &amp; of the multitude
               without dissimulation. I will not attempt to disturb this, tho so fully have I digested
               all my principles that I firmly believe it in my power to stagger you in yours. if
               at any time the dissentions in this country should occasion moderate men to abandon
               it, I shall hope you will join us in Kentucky. upon what plan we go you shall know
               hereafter. it is different from what you can imagine. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> partakes my nature as well as name &amp; is not happy in the navy. it is his wish to
               quit it &amp; share my fate — <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> you must send me huge letters over to Kentucky — &amp; now &amp; then <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> a good book. but we cannot go before next spring certainly.</p>

               body but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a>. when I am gone let them shrug their shoulders &amp; pity me. for yourself think of every
               motive most powerful over the human mind — &amp; do not condemn me upon suspicion. many
               of my dearest friends go with me. except <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> &amp; yourself I shall leave nothing that can grieve me. but I would rather go alone
               &amp; abandon every dearest tie than remain dependant, without even hope.</p><br><p><span class="date">August 5</span></p>

            <p class="indent1">Time has fled rapidly since I laid down the pen. the unexpected arrival of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> agreably surprized me. we have been constantly together. when your ode reachd me
               it reminded me of neglect &amp; I blushed as I read. so it is — to repent &amp; still sin
               on! this day week we walked together to Bath. passed the day there. &amp; after breakfast
               the next morning departed staff in hand for Huntspill. to visit <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George Burnett</a> in the road to a friend of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a>. Rover accompanied us. “tis nineteen miles to Wells. Huntspill must be about ten
               or eleven miles farther &amp; we can reach it by night.” at Wells we dined. how far to
               Huntspill? why you must go to Bridgewater. how far to Bridgewater? 18 miles! &amp; 8 from
               thence to Huntspill. we rose to look at the map in the room &amp; found it shorter to
               go by Chedder &amp; see the cliffs. how far to Chedder? about seven miles. off we set.
               we met a coachman. how far to Chedder ten long miles. we askd every person we met
               — &amp; received successively 5 — 7 — 4 — 2 ½ — 6 — 4 — 4 — 5 &amp;c — the night began to
               darken. but we talked philosophy like two poets &amp; often paused one while to drink
               at a clear spring — another while to encourage poor Rover now quite lame — &amp; sometimes
               — to mark the glow-worms paley ray. we reachd Chedder about ten anticipating the delights
               of a good supper &amp; comfortable bed. we enquired the best inn — &amp; arrived at a poor
               pothouse in a little village. can you give us a bed. no. all engaged. we went to the
               other house. mine host was asleep in his chair — can you give us a bed? he snored
               no &amp; turned round again. we agreed to go back to the other inn — get some supper &amp;
               sleep in the stable. down we sat. demolished the bread cheese &amp; cold a la mode beef
               — &amp; petitiond for straw in the stable. they said they would make us up a bed. it was
               in a garret the only piece of furniture except another bedstead — on which lay a bed
               &amp; quilt. poor Rover was condemned to the stable much against his inclination — it
               being one of his whims always to sleep in the room with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a> or me. but the landlady was inexorable I tied up with a halter locked the door upon
               him &amp; went to bed. my eyes were half sunk in slumber &amp; the dreams of the past day
               floating round my head — when open came the door — in rushd Rover &amp; the landlady declaring
               he had broken the halter crawld under the door &amp; must sleep in the room with me. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> is a vile bedfellow &amp; I slept but ill. in the morning I rose — &amp; lo — we were fastend
               in! they certainly took us for footpads, &amp; had bolted the door on the outside for
               fear we should rob the house.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Chedder cliffs amply repaid us. never did I see a grander scene — immense rocks rising
               perpendicularly from the glen to such a height <span style="text-decoration: line-through">that</span> as pains the neck of the spectator, &amp; terminating in the most bold &amp; fantastic manner.
               large trees grew from the interstices of the stone &amp; the sheep browzed on the edge
               of every precipice. a stream of water cold &amp; clear flows from under the rocks where
               we paused to drink &amp; pour libations to the Naiad.</p>
