                  a senator. Having observed that it was customary among periodical writers, to display
                  their abilities by criticisms on poets either of acknowledged or obscure merit, he
                  declares his intention of expatiating on “an object as yet untreated of, by any of

                  and, consequently, creditable to himself. But you may not have heard that there has
                  long existed in the French language, a composition precisely the same in design, and
                  in execution very nearly corresponding with Mr. Canning’s, as far as the latter goes.

                  in the present century. The fictitious <span class="ital">approbations</span> of the censors of the press, are dated in 1714. The fourth edition was published in

                  style. Here it is. The scarcity of the work will, I believe, justify you in reprinting

               <p>For two pieces thus similar in conception, EPIC honours are claimed, on the grounds
                  of their having a <span class="ital">beginning</span>, <span class="ital">middle</span>, and <span class="ital">end</span>; and both commentators confidently appeal on this head to the established canons
                  of criticism. The freedom from the incumbrance of episodes is noticed by both. In
                  speaking of the beginning, “can any thing,” exclaims Mr. C. “be more clear; more natural;
                  more agreeable to the true spirit of simplicity? Here are no tropes; no figurative
                  expressions — not even so much as an invocation to the muse. He does not detain his
                  readers by any needless circumlocution; by unnecessarily informing them what he <span class="ital">is</span> going to sing; or still more unnecessarily enumerating what he <span class="ital">is not</span> going to sing.”

                  </div> In the same vein the French writer: “What beginning can be more simple than that of
                  our author? It is more simple than Homer’s. It is more modest than Virgil’s, who,
                  with all his simplicity, sets himself foremost. I <span class="ital">sing</span>. <span class="ital">Cano</span>. What need to tell that one sings? Is it not self-evident?”

                  </div> Both critics remark, how their poets come to the point at once; and both on this occasion
                  quote from Horace <span class="ital">in media res</span> — <span class="ital">auditorem rapit</span>. If Mr. C. presses the morality of his poem, his predecessor, with greater boldness,
                  lays claim also to this praise. “The fable, he asserts, is reasonable and probable,
                  it imitates a complete and important action, and besides involves a point of morality,
                  which may serve the purpose of instruction.”

                  </div> Mr. C. comments on the studied felicity of the phrase, <span class="ital">All on a summer’s day</span>; and so does Mr. ——— on <span class="ital">L’autre jour</span>. The latter has, moreover, a profusion of annotations, in ridicule of heavy commentators
                  on the classics, like those of Martinus Scriblerus.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>‘Martinus Scriblerus’ was the name of a fictional antiquarian and pedant invented
                           by members of the Scriblerus club, including Alexander Pope (1688–1744; DNB) and Jonathan
                           Swift (1667–1745; DNB).</span></div>
                  </div> But the general remarks, as well as the style of the poems themselves, have that degree
                  of difference and of resemblance, which perfectly suits the hypothesis of Imitation.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">An independent coincidence which would naturally follow from a single leading idea,
               is certainly possible. Mr. Canning, when he assisted in writing the <em>Microcosm</em>, may neither have read French, nor have had any acquaintance capable of furnishing
               a suggestion from the <span class="ital">chef d’ouevre</span>. In this case, he will be the person most surprised at the circumstances I have stated.
               It would not degrade him to explain. He knows that the propensity ascribed to the
               knave of hearts is not unexampled among authors; and here are special appearances
               sufficient to induce many a grand jury to send a bill into court. Should he and his
               friends be silent, the public will have to choose between the opposite improbabilities,
               a schoolboy meeting with a scarce book, or of his inventing a new mode of composition.
               I have no enmity to Mr. C.; of his public conduct, I do not think with respect. But
               this feeling I venture to believe that I have in common with some of those, whom he
               calls his friends. Nor is it any disparagement to his abilities, to affirm, that his
               other essays, his university prize poem, and his speeches, exhibit more of imitative
               than of inventive talent.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It is always curious to trace the origin of ideas; and this communication, if it serve
               no other purpose, may excite some more learned correspondent to produce an earlier
               specimen of this species of burlesque criticism.</p>
