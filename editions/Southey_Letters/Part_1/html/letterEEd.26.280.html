            <p class="indent2">I went yesterday with this folded sheet to get it franked but <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> had left town for the Xmas, &amp; was not expected to return till Thursday next, &amp; I
               was not willing to delay longer a letter already delayed too long. We are about to
               remove our quarters. the people of this house are shamefully dishonest. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> slept with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> whilst he was here, &amp; they even charged a shilling &lt;a&gt; night for that! we think of

               air as we can. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> leaves us in consequence of this arrangement, as the distance does not suit him.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have also another motive for wishing to live out of the town, to avoid the swarm
                  of acquaintance who buz round me &amp; sadly waste my time, an article I can but little
                  afford to throw<span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> away. I have my law — which will soon occupy me from ten in the morning till 8 in
                  an office, excepting the dinner time. my Joan of Arc takes up more time than you would
                  suppose, for I have had a mine of riches laid open to me in a library

            <p class="indent1">You will be surprized to hear that I have been planning a charitable institution which

               scanty &amp; bad food, cold &amp; filth. we mean to employ them in a large garden, for every
               person may be usefully employed in some manner here, &amp; their <span style="text-decoration: line-through">x</span> health will be established by such employment. when in good order the produce of
               the garden will support the institution. in the long winter evenings the people will
               be employed in making nets, baskets &amp; matting, &amp; the women in making sheeting, all
               things that will be wanted at home, &amp; for the overplus a ready sale will be had among
               the supporters of this Convalescent Asylum. my name will not appear in this business
               &amp; tho in fact I shall be one of the main springs, I leave the credit to Lords &amp; Esq<sup>rs</sup>. I will send you our printed plan as soon as it is ready. six hours labour will be
               the utmost time required from the strongest persons. for extra work they will be paid
               — &amp; thus they may leave the Asylum with some little money, &amp; with some useful knowledge.
               We are much pleased with this scheme, as it will make every body useful whom it benefits.
