               <h1><span class="head">The Collected Letters of Robert Southey: Part One</span></h1>
            </header>
            <p><em>Part One</em> is the first-ever collected edition of the letters written during the earliest period
               of Southey’s career. It begins with Southey as a rebellious pupil at Westminster School
               and ends with him attempting to balance his writing life with the legal career forced
               on him by his patron, Charles Wynn. Part One follows the editorial conventions described
               in About this Edition and publishes newly transcribed, annotated texts of all the
               surviving letters written by him between 1791 and 1797, bringing together in one place
               correspondence scattered between 28 archives in North America and the United Kingdom.
               <em>Part One</em> comprises 280 letters, of which 92 are published for the first time, and 68 are published
               in full for the first time. In addition, 6 letters that appeared pseudonymously in
               the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> are here newly attributed to Southey.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s surviving letters from 1791-1797 are written to some 25 extremely diverse
               individuals, some familiar from literary history, others not. They include friends
               from childhood (John James Morgan, Charles Danvers, Sarah and Edith Fricker); from
               school (Grosvenor Charles Bedford and Charles Watkin Williams Wynn); from university
               (John Horseman); and from professional life (John Aikin and William Owen Pughe). Some
               correspondents – such as Charles Collins –would rapidly disappear from Southey’s orbit;
               others (notably Bedford and Wynn) would remain lifelong friends. A third group, including
               Joseph Cottle and Robert Lovell, are reminders of the inevitable overlap in the letters
               between his personal and professional, private and public lives. The letters Southey
               sent to Cottle, who from 1795 was simultaneously his friend and his publisher, combine
               gossip about mutual acquaintances with literary business, returning proofing corrections,
               detailing financial concerns, and complaining about incompetent printers. They also
               provide evidence of his response to other writers, including his admiration for Bowles
               and Sayers and his reaction to controversial novels like Matthew Lewis’s <em>The Monk</em>: ‘I do not think the Monk can be praised too highly, or blamed too severely’ (Letter
               195). Further, though different, less personal, evidence of Southey’s engagement in
               a cultural public sphere can be seen in the letters he contributed from 1796 to the
               pages of the newly-founded <em>Monthly Magazine</em>. Some signed, others pseudonymous, these reveal that from the very earliest stages
               of his career Southey disseminated his views on larger national stages, participating
               in wider, sometimes highly controversial, debates.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The correspondence on Spanish and Portuguese literature, Chatterton, the Welsh language
                  and the treatment of English prisoners of war, sent by Southey to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> in 1796 and 1797 may, in fact, not have been his first appearance in the metropolitan
                  periodical press. Letter 124 suggests that he sent earlier, politically driven correspondence
                  signed with the republican pseudonym ‘Harrington’ to the short-lived London radical
                  newspaper <em>The Telegraph</em>. The absence of any surviving copies of the newspaper from the period in question
                  makes it impossible to prove his claim. The traces of these earlier, radical, public
                  communications draws attention to another feature of the letters published here: that
                  Southey’s surviving correspondence provides important information about the letters
                  that have not come down to us. ‘Missing’ letters revealed by Part One of include those
                  from Southey to Joseph Cottle between late 1794 and November 1795; any correspondence
                  exchanged before 1798 by Southey and the metropolitan radical George Dyer; and all
                  of Southey’s letters to his parents, to his fellow Pantisocrat George Burnett,

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The most conspicuous absences are the letters sent by Southey to two key individuals
                  in his early literary career: Coleridge and Robert Lovell. Coleridge and Southey met
                  in Oxford in summer 1794 and subsequently corresponded. None of the letters Southey
                  sent Coleridge between 1794-1797 have survived, though some of the latter’s replies
                  have. 
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (4)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For Coleridge’s letters to Southey from 1794-1797, see Earl Leslie Griggs (ed.), The
                           Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 6 vols (1956-1971), I, pp. 82-90; 97-100;
                           101-106; 109-110; 112-120; 121-124; 132-143; 145-150; 157-159; 163-173; 248; 290-292;
                           332-337; 345-346; 358-359. [Hereafter Griggs.]</span></div>
                  </div> The result is an imbalance of information. Coleridge’s letters to Southey give us
                  his views on crucial events such as the collapse of Pantisocracy, making a powerful
                  case for Southey as ‘lost to Virtue’, as ‘one who had <span class="ital">fallen back into the Ranks</span>’.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> This incomplete correspondence has led to assumptions that Coleridge was the more
                  energetic partner in the enterprise, and that he was badly let down. The latter’s
                  lost replies might have shown another, equally compelling, side to the argument. The
                  one-sided nature of the surviving letters also impacts on our sense of Southey as
                  a writer. Coleridge’s letters create an image of Southey that has proved, until recently,
                  to be surprisingly resiliant and unquestioned:</p>
            </div>
            <blockquote class="quote">You sate down and wrote – I used to saunter about and think what I should write. And

               </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Coleridge constructs an image of Southey’s writing as prolix, unreflective, radically
               different and, by implication, inferior to his own. His rhetoric was calculatedly
               one-sided, designed to suit his own agenda, to combat his own fears and demons. Yet
               his relationship with Southey was a two-way exchange between equals – something that
               the absence of Southey’s replies makes it easy to overlook. We can use Coleridge’s
               part of the correspondence to guess at what Southey had said or written, but we cannot
               be certain. The most detailed picture of Southey’s views on Coleridge in the mid 1790s
               has to emerge, then, not from the intimacy and immediacy of their one-to-one exchanges,
               but from what Southey had to say in letters to others. It is here that we can map
               his movement from enchantment to disillusionment. We can follow his excitement at
               meeting ‘one whom I very much esteem &amp; admire’ (Letter 94), ‘a man of the first genius
               &amp; abilities, &amp; ... my friend’ (Letter 100). As relationships between the two soured,
               we can also chart Southey’s growing disillusionment and determination to sever their
               connections, including creative links. We learn of his decision to ‘expunge every
               line of Coleridges ... all he <span class="ital">wrote</span> not all he <span class="ital">claims</span>’ from the second edition of <em>Joan of Arc</em> (Letter 148). We also discover that by 1797 Southey had reached a point where he
               could describe Coleridge as</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">one who has neither the feelings nor habits of honest independance, &amp; who always indulges
               himself careless of consequences ... it is not possible to think too highly[MS torn]
               Coleridges abilities, or too despicably of him in every other character. (Letter 250)</blockquote>
            <p>His opinion was not to alter radically in the coming years.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Another less familiar, but equally central literary relationship of the 1790s can
               also only be glimpsed in part: that between Southey and Robert Lovell. The two Bristol-born
               poets met in late 1793, introduced by their mutual friends the Fricker sisters. (Lovell,
               like Southey and Coleridge, was to marry one of the Frickers.) Their relationship
               was ended by Lovell’s premature and sudden death in 1796. Only a tiny fraction of
               what was probably a substantial correspondence survives, consisting of one complete
               (Letter 85) and one fragmentary letter (Letter 147) from Southey to Lovell; none from
               Lovell to Southey is extant. This gap in the correspondence means that it is easy
               to underestimate the importance of their friendship. The letters published here –
               both those sent to Lovell and those written about him – allow his importance to Southey,
               particularly in the period 1793-4, to emerge for the first time. Letter 85, the only
               complete one from Southey to Lovell extant, offers a tantalising glimpse of their
               friendship. Lovell emerges as a sharer in Southey’s politics and literary ambition,
               someone with whom he could exchange political news, a recently completed radical elegy
               ‘To the Exiled Patriots’, a series of sonnets and information about projected works,
               including the earliest summary of the Welsh-American epic <em>Madoc</em>. Lovell’s importance to Southey as a man of ‘very great abilities’, one who ‘writes
               well’ (Letter 73), emerges from other letters. It was Lovell who Southey praised in
               late 1793 as:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">... a poet in some walks I do not know his equal — in the plaintive &amp; soft kinds —
               elegy &amp; sonnet for instance but this is not his only merit — epistles &amp; various other
               species he has handled with peculiar delicacy. I do not scruple to say that for elegance
               &amp; simplicity of versification I know no Author in our language that surpasses him.
               most probably we shall soon publish together. (Letter 76)</blockquote>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Lovell was, to Southey, more than an example of a good, modern poet. His presence
                  seems to have spurred on Southey’s own literary ambitions. At the time of their meeting
                  Lovell’s career was slightly more advanced – he was author of the soon-to-be-published <em>Bristol, a Satire</em> – whereas Southey was barely recovering from the debacle of <em>The Flagellant</em> and the bankruptcy and death of his father. In 1794 it was Lovell who was pivotal
                  in helping Southey establish links with publishers and booksellers in Bath and Bristol.
                  It was Lovell who accompanied Southey to Bath on a visit to Richard Cruttwell, in
                  order to ask him he if would publish their joint collection.

                  </div> Moreover it was that ‘clever young man’ Lovell, who later in the same year, went to
                  see Joseph Cottle and attempted to convert the publisher to Pantisocracy.

                  </div> According to Cottle’s later account, Lovell seized the opportunity to read aloud from
                  ‘the MS. poems of his two unknown friends, which at once established their genius
                  in my estimation’.

                  </div> The ‘two ... friends’ were Southey and Coleridge; within weeks Lovell had brought
                  them to Cottle’s shop and a crucial relationship in early Romanticism had been forged,
                  one which led directly to the publication of Southey’s <em>Joan of Arc</em>, to Coleridge’s collections of 1796 and 1797 and – eventually – to <em>Lyrical Ballads</em>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Southey’s creative partnership with Lovell was short-lived but important, a precursor
                  to his more troubled relationship with Coleridge. The arrival of Coleridge in Bristol
                  in summer 1794 marked a turning-point, and Lovell’s position as Southey’s first-choice
                  collaborator was gradually eroded. His increasing lack of status was demonstrated
                  in Coleridge and Southey’s decision to exclude his one-act contribution from the topical
                  drama <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em>. Coleridge was openly critical of Lovell’s abilities, informing Southey that he had
                  ‘no <span class="ital">taste</span> – or <span class="ital">simplicity</span> of feeling’.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> In turn, Lovell did his best to undermine Coleridge’s standing, telling Southey that
                  Coleridge had claimed a substantial share in writing <em>Joan of Arc</em> (1796) (Letters 148 and 149). On hearing of his death in May 1796, Southey recorded
                  that Lovell ‘had sunk much in my esteem’ (Letter 156). However, as his correspondence
                  shows, in the coming years Southey tried to secure the financial positions of his
                  widow and child, proposing a memorial edition, including his poems in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799) and <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em>, and negotiating with Lovell’s family (for example, Letter 155). In spite of Southey’s
                  growing disenchantment with Lovell, the evidence provided here indicates that at least
                  in 1793-1794 Lovell was a crucial figure in making Southey realise his ambitions.</p>
            </div><br><p>Lovell’s death in 1796 was but one of a series of losses. The years 1791-1797 were
               turbulent, as well as formative, for Southey. The letters published in Part One cover
               traumatic experiences such as his expulsion from Westminster School in 1792 and failure
               to gain admission to Christ Church, Oxford; the imprisonment of his father, for a
               friend’s debt, and his subsequent release and death; and Southey’s struggle between
               duty to his family, who expected him to follow a suitable profession, and his desire
               to be a poet. Key personal events in this period include his total estrangement from
               his formidable maiden aunt Elizabeth Tyler, who disapproved of Southey’s relationship
               with Edith Fricker; his secret marriage to Edith in November 1795; his first visit
               to Spain and Portugal in 1795-1796; his friendship and alienation from Coleridge;
               the appearance of his earliest publications (including <em>Poems</em> (1795) and <em>Joan of Arc</em> (1796)); and the beginning in 1797 of his legal studies. The letters show Southey’s
               development into an adult and reveal patterns of behaviour that were to dominate his
               later life. In 1791 Southey was a boy, dependent on the financial good will of his
               bachelor uncle (Herbert Hill), by 1797 he was a married man, increasingly assuming
               the financial burdens of an extended family.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>As the letters disclose, Southey was unsettled personally and professionally during
                  1791-1797. After the debacle of <em>The Flagellant</em> and his expulsion from school, he was shunned by erstwhile friends as if, he later
                  explained, he were a ‘scabby sheep’.

                  </div> The extreme sense of emotional dislocation engendered by this and by the near-disintegration
                  of his family was matched by geographical rootlessness. The surviving letters from
                  1791-1797 reveal the beginning of a series of moves and relocations – particularly
                  in the West Country and London - that only ceased when Southey and his family moved,
                  reluctantly at first, to Greta Hall on the outskirts of Keswick in 1803. Southey’s
                  lack of a settled home is balanced in his correspondence by friendship. The letters
                  published here show the forging of lifelong connections with Grosvenor Charles Bedford,
                  Charles Watkin Williams Wynn and Joseph Cottle. They chart the progress of an intense,
                  but brief, relationship with Edmund Seward (who died suddenly in 1795), and trace
                  the origins of his equally influential - but more troubled - relationship with Coleridge.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s letters map his personal and domestic upheaval onto a period of political
               turbulence. They provide crucial new insights into his early radicalism, and responses
               to major contemporary events such as the executions of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette
               and Robespierre, the outbreak and progress of the war between England and France,
               and the repressive regime of William Pitt. They also make available fresh information
               about his friendships with individuals who did not share his radical beliefs, notably
               the rotten-borough monger Thomas Phillipps Lamb and Southey’s well-connected patron
               Charles Wynn, nephew of the foreign secretary Lord Grenville. A would-be poet from
               his earliest youth, it is not surprising that Southey’s political views translated
               into verse. The letters published here provide important poetic manifestations of
               his radicalism. Southey’s hatred of penal laws can be seen in the earliest surviving
               version of the ‘Botany-Bay Eclogue’ ‘Elinor’ (Letter 127); his love of political protest
               in ‘The Soldier’s Wife’ and the sonnet ‘Poor Wanderer of the Night!’ (Letter 127);
               his hatred of tyranny in the monodrama ‘Aristodemus’ (Letter 92); his disdain for
               the ‘spaniel fool’ ‘Man’, who ‘crouches down &amp; licks his tyrants hand/ And courts
               oppression’ in ‘To a College Cat’ (Letter 181); and his rediscovery of the political
               inscription in ‘For a Column at Truxillo’ (Letter 170). The letters also draw attention
               to new additions to the Southey canon. They highlight the radical poems he published
               in newspapers: including ‘a seditious ode in the ludicrous stile addressed to the
               Cannibals’ which appeared under the republican pseudonym ‘Caius Gracchus’ (Letter
               162).</p>
            <p class="indent1">As the sonnets, eclogues, monodramas, elegies, epic fragments and hundreds of lines
               of political and humorous verse sent to friends suggest, the letters published here
               show the coming into being of a literary career marked by eclecticism and experimentation.
               In 1791, Southey was a schoolboy versifier and imitator on a large scale. The classical
               models favoured at Westminster jostle for space in his correspondence with adaptations
               of Pope, Gray and Shenstone. However, as he moves beyond school and university days,
               classical allusions and adaptations fall away, and are replaced by other models, including
               Bowles and Akenside, and a significant new interest in comparative, post-Renaissance
               and contemporary European literature. Southey’s first visit to Spain and Portugal
               in 1795-1796 emerges from his surviving correspondence as a turning-point. It allowed
               him to acquire two new languages (he became fluent in Spanish and Portuguese) and
               opened up to him new cultural territories. Southey’s linguistic and cultural encounter
               with the Iberian Peninsula was to shape the remainder of his working life. It mapped
               out textual lands that he was to colonise and exploit throughout his career, as poet,
               historian and translator. In so doing, it laid the foundations of Southey’s interest
               in international cultures and his participation in – and shaping of – British Romanticism
               as a globalised enterprise.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As well as providing important information about Southey’s developing literary preoccupations,
               the letters also contain significant new details on the writing and publication of
               <em>Poems</em> (1795), <em>Joan of Arc</em> (1796), <em>Poems</em> (1797), <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em> (1797), and his magazine and newspaper contributions. They allow us to date individual
               poems and collections more precisely and to learn more about the process of composition
               and revision. We discover that Southey routinely circulated drafts of his poems to
               close friends, including Grosvenor Charles Bedford and Robert Lovell, and that he
               also distributed writings by other members of his circle, including poems by Coleridge
               (Letter 96). Moreover, we learn that from the earliest stages of his career, Southey
               was a concerned professional, haggling over terms with and complaining about the work
               of slow and careless printers and typesetters (for example, Letter 278). He cared
               about the physical appearance of his writing, and was interested in the aesthetics
               of publication. He took an interest in typography and the quality of paper, and had
               special large copies of his works struck off for friends by Cottle (Letter 252). He
               also had a strong visual sense. Convinced that ‘if a man<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> loves prints you have an excellent clue to his character’, Southey’s room at Balliol
               was adorned with engravings of the mythical Theban queen Niobe, the ‘Ruins of Rome’,
               the Byzantine general Belisarius, unfairly imprisoned by the Emperor Justinian, and
               Charles James Fox, a more contemporary political hero (Letter 189). He was well-acquainted
               with the works of the leading book illustrators and engravers of the time and was
               keen to have his earliest publications illustrated, suggesting Philippe Jacques de
               Loutherbourg be approached for a frontispiece to the first edition of <em>Joan of Arc</em> (Letter 132). The expense involved in commissioning artists proved prohibitive, and
               the illustrated editions did not materialise.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s published works were, though, to be illuminated in another way: by notes
               derived from his wide reading in world literatures. The letters published here shed
               light on his practice of annotation. They manifest in embryonic form the delight in
               antiquarian excavation and the collection of anecdotal information that were to be
               refined throughout his writing life, in particular in the notes to <em>Joan of Arc</em>, <em>Madoc</em>, <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em> (1801), <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (1810) and <em>Roderick, The Last of the Goths</em> (1814). Letters 196 and 197 provide ‘authentic’ accounts of Southey’s visit to Aveline’s
               Hole, a cavern full of skeletons discovered near Burrington Combe, Somerset. In true
               antiquarian spirit, Letter 196 requests the readers of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> write back, to ‘inform me, at what period these modes of sepulture were common’.
               Others record anecdotes about Richard Glover (Letter 179), or engage in public debates
               on the Welsh language (Letters 175, 185, 194). The letters also allow us for the first
               time to trace Southey’s reading, the researches that laid the foundations of his published
               writings. They show him buying books, often rare Spanish and Portuguese volumes, for
               his own growing collection (for example, Letters 229 and 240) and making use of libraries
               close to hand. The private collections he used included some ‘curious books’ belonging
               to the scandalous Lady Strathmore, Eleanor Bowes, caricatured by Gillray in c.1786
               as suckling her cats in preference to her son (Letter 237). Other encounters were
               less esoteric. Here is Southey’s response to a visit to Dr Williams’s Library in London,
               1797. His reason for going there was to hunt out books he regarded as essential for
               his revisions to the second edition of <em>Joan of Arc</em>:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">a hackney coach horse turned into a field of grass falls not more eagerly to a breakfast
               which lasts the whole day, than I attacked the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">fol</span> old folios so respectably covered with dust. I begin to like dirty rotten binding,
               &amp; whenever I get among books pass by the gilt coxcombs &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">yet</span> disturb the spiders. — But you shall hear what I have got ... there are more treasures
               in this library — &amp; I go there again on Monday next. (Letter 278)</blockquote>
            <p>His account gives a sense of the excitement he found in research and of the prodigious
               labours that went into the notes that adorned many of his poems. </p>
            <p>This first part of <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</em> therefore makes available important new information about the early career, relationships
               and opinions of a writer who was to become one of the most controversial, high-profile
               and important figures in Romantic period culture. In doing so, it presses Southey’s
               claims as an author crucial to an understanding of the Romantic period and of the
               discourses of Romanticism – as a correspondent and commentator on the times, as an
               initiator of new genres, and as a participant in regional, national and global cultures.</p>
