            <p class="indent1">Bedford — when I have a home, I will hang my Sans Culotte stick upon the wall, &amp; remain
               there till I become the tenant of a narrower habitation. the soul of a poor Jew let
               loose by the Inquisitorial fire, cannot feel more exquisite delight when it arrives
               in Abrahams bosom than will be mine if I ever set foot again upon English ground.
               were my heart cold or vacant I should not feel thus, for this soil would do well enough
               to vegetate in; the sole pleasure I have found in this country is in counting how
               many days before I shall leave it. I crossed the Bay of Biscay in such tempestuous
               weather <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxx xx</span> that for sixty hours I lay in momentary dread of sinking. we have broken down upon
               the road three times &amp; overturned once. the wind wrecked a Spanish vessel in the river
               at the time we crossed it here — a passage of twelve miles at night. I was happy to
               tread upon the ground at landing, for I thought myself upon Terra firma. before day
               break there was an earthquake. earth air &amp; water have all contributed to annoy me,
               &amp; God knows I suffered enough upon the road for want of the other element. the bugs
               &amp; muskitoes were gone into winter quarters &amp; I only suffered from a few stragglers
               — but every night upon the road was I regularly <span class="ital">flead</span>. we were eighteen days travelling to Madrid &amp; 15 from thence to Lisbon. I walked
               the greater part of the way by which means I kept myself warm &amp; escaped the overturn
               &amp; twice breaking down. on Xmas day the following thoughts occurred — &amp; if the lines
               do not possess much poetical merit, they will at least tell you what I felt.</p>

                  me that he trumped up an infamous story &amp; obliged me to quit the country. the English

                  the servants with his care of them. passing by them one day he heard his maid servant
