                  my natal place — at the hour of five in a wet windy evening on the seventeenth of
                  October 1794 wrapt up in my fathers old great coat &amp; my own cogitations. Like old

                  the events of my past life — &amp; looking forward to the days to come with pleasure.
                  three miles from Bristol — an old man of sixty — most royally drunk — laid hold of
                  my arm &amp; beggd we might join company as he was going to Bath. I consented for he wanted
                  assistance &amp; dragged the foul animal thro the dirt wind &amp; rain! he calling &lt;me&gt; his
                  good comrade his companion — fellow traveller &amp; dear friend! blessing God that he
                  had met with a young gentleman after his own heart — &amp; exclaiming what would have
                  become of me if I had not found such a good friend as you! in vain did I attempt to
                  house him on the road — he would cry dont leave me my dear dear friend! I shall die
                  if you leave me. — think of me — with a mind so fully occupied — leading this man
                  nine miles — &amp; had I not led him he would have lain down under a hedge &amp; probably
                  perished.</p>

               the face I rejoiced that my friends at Bath knew not where I was — &amp; was once vexed
               at thinking that you would hear it drive against the window &amp; be sorry for the wayworn
               travellers. here I am — well — &amp; satisfied with my own conduct.</p>
