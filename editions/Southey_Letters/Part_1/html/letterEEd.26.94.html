               I am ignorant. I wish much to see you. cannot you contrive to come speedily to Oxford?
               we leave it very early in July — about the 4<sup>th</sup> or fifth, &amp; time lags sadly till that period. I could explain more fully why this
               college life is so irksome to me, were you here, &amp; more clearly convince you of the
               propriety of my wishes. your last was calculated to raise my hope<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> tis a tormenting phantom which I fear to indulge.</p>
            <p class="indent1">my poor trullibubs are empty. a dose of salts yesterday &amp; another this morning has
               been scouring out my tripes. this may possibly remove indisposition for a little while,
               but I am not fool enough to hope it will remove the cause. continual anxiety will
               wear out a stronger frame than mine — oh that gripe —</p>
            <p class="indent1">one week has elapsed since my letter was so unpleasantly interrupted. in the interim
               the salts have worked &amp; your last arrived. at present my situation <span style="text-decoration: line-through">my situation</span> resembles that of a poor devil executing for high treason, at the interval when he
               is cut down from the gallows to have his heart torn out — for I am delaying the pickling
               of my tripes again till the departure of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">a Cantab</a> one whom I very much esteem &amp; admire tho two thirds of our conversation be spent
               in disputing on metaphysical subjects. the latter part of your letter leads to a wide
               &amp; interesting subject — I am as far from pleading the cause of incontinence as you.
               yet the philosopher should pardon in another what he would not pardon in himself.
               the passions are not vicious — tis society makes the indulgence of them so. they resemble
               an assemblage of waters destructive if they run wildly over the country, but the source
               of abundance if properly guided.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> has started an objection to the plan on which I presumed too much. — they will enquire
               &amp; find me a Republican. right. they ought to enquire &amp; they must know. perish every
               hope of life rather than &lt;that&gt; I should forfeit my integrity. I am a Republican &amp;
               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">thxx</span> did wrong in even thinking of the situation. twas a fallacious reasoning that said
               — there is no criminality in accepting a situation where for a certain salary I give
               up a certain portion of time. — the false hopes which deceived me are gone &amp; it is
               but turning adventurer at last. or be villain enough to take orders &amp; grow fat in
               ease indolence &amp; iniquity. blessed be God that my principles are notorious enough
               to keep me necessarily in integrity. who can answer for his perseverance in rectitude
               when every passion of the human heart prompts him to dissimulation?</p>
            <p class="indent1">they will enquire &amp; find me a Republican. even at the moment of disappointment — when
               every delightful hope melted away like the shadows of a dream — I exulted in the reflection.
               my practice flows from my principle. if the one be wrong the other must be so. if
               my first principles are vicious the actions resulting from them must be vicious likewise
               — &amp; where is the being who shall throw the first stone? I am already too much the
               victim of affection — my heart is too often consulted where the head should have determined,
               &amp; it is better to sacrifice happiness than integrity. had my situation been like yours
               tis more than probable that my theoretical principles had been the same. but I am
               too notorious to be tempted — &amp; when from the triumph of affections over honesty I
               had placed myself in the way of temptation — the character of Republican man saved
               me the trial.</p>
            <p class="indent1">So be it. I will hasten nothing. as I am I may yet remain two years — should any thing
               devolve to me then it will be well. &amp; if not why the same world will still lie before
               me, &amp; whether I linger out existence in England in America or among the convicts of
               New Holland is a matter of indifference. thus much (&amp; too much) for self.</p>
