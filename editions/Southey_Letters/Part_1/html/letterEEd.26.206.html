               collection of books. however now I have a home — &amp; the sooner you can come, &amp; the

               <p>I am not sufficiently acquainted with the subject of finance to hazard — or indeed
                  to form any opinion. certain however it is that the funding system cannot endure for
                  ever, whether this blow be the death-blow cannot be asserted upon the same grounds.
                  at any rate it must have one good effect, that of putting an end to the war, for how

                  were taken from Brest, put on board ship — &amp; landed in Wales. this answered a double
                  purpose. it transported fourteen hundred rogues from France — &amp; it alarmed England
                  — so much so indeed as to occasion the immediate run on the Bank, which made it stop

               <span class="strikehtrough">more</span> worth nothing more than their annual interest. but where is cash to answer these
               notes? because they had not cash to answer the notes already in circulation, they
               issued these pound notes. this is remedying the evil for the present, but certainly
               increasing it in the end. the quantity of species in the kingdom amounts but to 20
               millions. &amp; this has in all probability been of late years much lessened. for the
               English guinea is worth 23 shillings at Hamburgh, &amp; in consequence vast sums have
