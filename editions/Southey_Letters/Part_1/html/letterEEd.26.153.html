            <p>Horace — I rise from the perusal of your letters — powerfully have they affected me
               — I asked my own heart “why have I been estranged from this man?” I know not what
               changes Time may have produced in you, but if you are what you was — you will be as
               embarrassed as myself in answering the same question.</p>
            <p class="indent1">We have seen each other <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> but a very few hours since I spent so many weeks at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a>. &amp; &lt;during&gt; those few hours my heart was <span style="text-decoration: line-through">preoccupied</span> &lt;engrossed&gt; by many feelings. since that period I have been driven into the foremost
               ranks — I have experienced much of the villainy of mankind — but I have discovered
               virtues enough to set the balance even. &amp; if the falshood of a bosom friend sometimes
               induced a passing thought of misanthropy, the benevolence of others soon <span style="text-decoration: line-through">made me</span> reconciled me to human nature.</p>
            <p class="indent1">After all the trash of metaphysics our characters are born with us. for if they were
               totally formed by circumstances — how is it that mine has remained the same thro so
               many a vicissitude?</p>
