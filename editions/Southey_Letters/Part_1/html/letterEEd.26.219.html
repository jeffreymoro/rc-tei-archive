            <p class="indent1">Thus far my dear Cottle are we advanced on our peregrination. we <span style="text-decoration: line-through">are</span> &lt;intend&gt; to remain here a week — this we had resolved upon — &amp; indeed must have done
               whether we had resolved so or no. for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has been very unwell; most probably in consequence of fatigue. We arrived here Wednesday
               evening, &amp; she has not yet been out of this house. but thank God she is greatly recovered.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You know not how heartily I hate moving: &amp; yet we are far from being settled. when
               our week is up here we purpose going in the stage to Lymington &amp; staying a week there.
               from thence I can explore Christ Church — as the distance is but 12 miles. there I
               hope to fix. if you write to me on Monday direct to the Post Office here. between
               that &amp; the Monday following — to the Post Office Lymington Hampshire. by that time
               I hope to give you a permanent address.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It is near nine &amp; I am writing without a candle. this light is not pleasant to me
               — &amp; I do not love a summer evening on that account — darkness begins when the animal
               spirits require to be recruited by sleep &amp; those spirits die away with the day light.
               there is another reason why I do not like this time of day at this time of year. there
               is no fire. I am ashamed to have one — &amp; yet it constitutes a very large portion of
               my comfort.</p>
            <p class="indent1">This is a foul place. full of aristocrats sailours &amp; all the wretches connected with
               them. the water not so fine <span style="text-decoration: line-through">at</span> as at the passages &amp; as ugly at low tide. the inhabitants are imposing — <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> because they have the rich &amp; foolish to deal with. I shall be glad to get away. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is much better; &amp; as I have not her illness to engross &amp; oppress my mind I shall
               set to my employments.</p>
