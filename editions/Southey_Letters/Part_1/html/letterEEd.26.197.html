            <p class="indent1">I returned last night &amp; your letter arrived this morning. you say the sooner I come
               the better. I have little to arrange &amp; will be with you the end of the week.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Concerning these skeletons I have displayed a perseverance that would have done honor
               even to the scientific avidity of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CampbellHenry">Horse Campbell</a>. the weather prevented our journey for a fortnight. we got there however on Friday
               last. the accounts have been enormously exaggerated. the cavern (a natural one) descends
               steeply — from the number of human bones it has evidently been a place of burial.
               from the way in which the sculls lie I believe that the bodies were thrown carelessly
               down the descent, &amp; left to lie as they fell — another reason for my supposing this
               is that, tho the cavern <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx xxxx</span> &lt;penetrates&gt; 130 feet, there are no bones farther down than a body thrown in would
               have fallen. no entire skeleton was found — nor did I observe any of the smaller bones.
               these have mouldered away — &amp; the skulls crumbled with the slightest blow. the droppings
               of the cavern had encrusted them with stalactydes.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I had been directed to enquire of the clergyman of Blagdon (3 miles from <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Bxrr</span> Burrington Coombe where the cavern was discovered) for some tidings of a place of
               burial in his neighbourhood discovered about four years ago. he was dangerously ill
               &amp; of course I did not intrude upon the family with my questions. I enquired of the
               villagers — there was something at Nimlett — a sort of an imitation of that at Burrington
               — one girl said no — it was at Budcomb. we enquired again. it had been at Nimlett:
               it was built by [MS torn] &amp; had been pulld down for a neighbouring lime ki[MS torn]
               Budcomb was in our way home. we enquired there at last — a woman in a most wretched
               state of poverty gave us some information. one of her children showd us the way —
               we got candle &amp; matches — &amp; set off with firebrands for near half a mile. it was a
               rudely covered vault thus shaped</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">[Southey sketches a cross roads]</p>
            <p>about ten feet either way. there were many bones. it had been covered with stones
               — but the mound was low &amp; irregularly shaped — such as gave no reason to imagine a
               tumulus below.</p>
