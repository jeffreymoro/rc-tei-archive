               <p>Robert Southey was born in Bristol in 1774 and died at his home on the outskirts of
                  Keswick in 1843. The son of a bankrupt linen-draper, he was educated at Westminster
                  School and Balliol College, Oxford, which he left without taking a degree. He published
                  his first collection of poems in 1795 and in 1813 became Poet Laureate, a post he
                  held until his death. Southey was a prolific and influential poet, essayist, historian,
                  travel-writer, biographer, translator and polemicist, a dominant and controversial
                  figure in British culture from the mid-1790s through to the mid-1830s. His highly
                  experimental poetry, including the Islamic romance <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em> (1801), paved the way for writers such as Byron, Shelley, Thomas Moore and – later
                  in the nineteenth century – Browning and Tennyson. His essays, histories and reviews
                  articulated the issues confronting a period dominated by nascent imperialism and industrialisation,
                  and his biographies, including the best-selling <em>The Life of Nelson</em> (1813), participated in and helped to form a culture increasingly concerned with celebrity.
                  Southey was, throughout his career, someone his contemporaries found impossible to
                  ignore. His ambition and ability were widely acknowledged, with <em>Madoc</em> (1805) praised as ‘the second heroic production in the English language’, the first
                  being <em>Paradise Lost</em>.

                  </div> Yet Southey was also the butt of satire and invective, his politics, poetry and prose
                  attacked by opponents as diverse the <em>Anti-Jacobin</em>, Byron, Hazlitt and Macaulay. <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey</em> makes available for the first time complete, annotated, fully-searchable texts of
                  all of the surviving correspondence of this complex individual. In so doing, it allows
                  us to look anew at the writer described by Byron as ‘the only existing entire man
                  of letters’.

            <p>Writing letters was an important part of Southey’s life. It was an activity that linked
               the youthful radical leader of the ‘New School’ with the older conservative Poet Laureate.
               Between 1791 and 1839 he corresponded with leading figures in cultural, political,
               and religious life in Britain, Europe and North America. About 7000 of his letters
               are extant, and of these just under 3000 have never before been published. The surviving
               manuscripts are dispersed amongst over 200 individual, international archives: letters
               can be found in New York, London, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), and Tomsk (Siberia), testimony
               both to the global reach of his correspondence and to Southey as an active participant
               in cosmopolitan, international cultural exchange. </p>
            <p class="indent1">The surviving letters written by Southey between 1791 and 1839 are immensely varied.
               They range from short notes of a couple of lines to huge epistles of several thousand
               words. Several early letters are entirely or largely in verse, whilst letters from
               all periods of his career include transcripts of his poems and other writings. Southey
               was a talented modern linguist: fluent in French, Spanish and Portuguese, and able
               to read German and Dutch. Most of his surviving letters are in English. However, a
               handful of letters written in French and Portuguese, and the liberal scattering throughout
               the correspondence of foreign languages, are evidence of his internationalism, his
               involvement in and shaping of a global Romanticism.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey’s earliest surviving letter dates from 1791, his last from 1839. In 1791 he
               was sixteen years old, a pupil at Westminster School in the heart of London. Southey’s
               time at Westminster brought him into contact with boys from radically different backgrounds,
               scions of rich, powerful families. The first letter in this edition provides evidence
               of the elite circles into which school friendships drew the young Southey. It was
               sent in 1791 to Thomas Phillipps Lamb, the father of a fellow Westminster pupil, Thomas
               Davis Lamb. Written in the aftermath of a vacation visit to the Lambs home in the
               Sussex town of Rye, the letter testifies to both Southey’s high regard for his hosts
               and the relative ease with which he was assimilated into a wealthy, politically influential,
               family. It is also evidence of the complexity of his connections. In 1791, Southey
               was a discontented schoolboy, eager to rebel against the established order. In contrast,
               Thomas Phillipps Lamb, his correspondent, was an establishment figure, MP for the
               town of Rye and supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Southey’s final extant letter, to be published in Part Eight of this edition, also
                  looks back to his youth – and to the enduring nature of some of his earliest friendships.
                  It was sent on 6 September 1839 to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, younger brother of
                  a Baronet and scion of an Anglo-Welsh, Whig political dynasty. Southey and Wynn had
                  been friends since their schooldays at Westminster. This final letter is a poignant
                  close to Southey’s epistolary career. Brief, written in an uncharacteristic, poorly-formed
                  hand and accompanied by an apologetic note from his second wife Caroline, it provides
                  eloquent testimony to the dementia that made letter writing or letter reading impossible
                  for the final years of Southey’s life.

                  </div> Its confusion is shared by other late letters, including one to the poet and civil
                  servant Henry Taylor, which part-way through forgets the name and gender of its addressee
                  and concludes with a salutation to Bertha, Southey’s daughter.

                  </div> No letters survive after late 1839 and by the time he died on 21 March 1843, Southey
                  had long been dead to his correspondents.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The abrupt, tragic closing down of his correspondence in 1839 only throws into sharper
               relief the vitality and diversity of a lifetime of communication. Southey’s correspondents
               reflect his eclecticism and internationalism. They included family, friends, fellow
               writers, publishers, review editors, landlords, antiquarians, scientists, politicians,
               bishops, wine-merchants, people he had never met and – at times to his great irritation
               – autograph hunters. He exchanged letters and debated crucial issues of the day with
               prominent, sometimes equally controversial, figures, including: William Wilberforce,
               Thomas Clarkson, Humphry Davy, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, William
               Taylor, Percy Shelley, Walter Savage Landor, John Rickman, George Ticknor, Walter
               Scott, James Montgomery, Robert Bloomfield, Bernard Barton, Sir Robert Peel and the
               factory reformer Lord Shaftesbury. An active admirer of Mary Wollstonecraft and promoter
               of female literary endeavours, Southey corresponded with many women writers, including
               Caroline Bowles (who became his second wife), Anna Seward, Anna Eliza Bray, Margaret
               Holford Hodson, Maria Gowan Brooks, Mary Anne Watts Hughes, Amelia Opie, Mary Hays,
               and, most notoriously, Charlotte Brontë. Southey was a busy man, and the wide range
               of men and women he found the time to write to indicates what might be described as
               the promiscuous nature of his correspondence – his ability to write a letter to virtually
               anyone and everyone, on virtually every subject. It is also compelling evidence of
               the diversity of Romantic period letter-writing. </p>
            <p class="indent1">Southey wrote to individuals from very different walks of life and unsurprisingly
               the subject matter of his letters is extremely varied. It covers his domestic and
               professional lives, local matters and international affairs. It includes complaints
               about a difficult younger brother, tough financial negotiations with a publisher,
               regional events in Bristol or Keswick, and details of atrocities committed in Spain
               and Portugal during the Peninsular War. The letters give us access to the whole gamut
               of Southey’s experience, as we see him live through and respond to years of domestic,
               local, national and international upheaval. Here, for example, is Southey writing
               in December 1831 on the dangers to national well-being of a cholera epidemic:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">What I look to with most apprehension is the moral effect that this pestilence may
               produce when it gets to such places as Carlisle, - still more in Manchester &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">other such</span> wherever there are such tremendous assemblages of human creatures in the most loathsome

               <p>We see here the moralist and polemicist, the preacher against the evils of modernity
                  and the sickness spread by industrialisation, urbanisation and democracy, a Southey
                  familiar to the readers of both his <em>Colloquies</em> and his essays in the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. This is the man condemned by Macaulay as possessing in extraordinary measure ‘the
                  faculty of believing without a reason, and the faculty of hating without a provocation.’

                  </div> Yet Southey is, as David Simpson has recently observed, fundamentally more ‘elusive’
                  and less given to ‘wholeness’ than his peers.

               <p>Margaret’s death was a milestone. Southey and his wife immediately left their house
                  in Bristol for Greta Hall, Keswick, then occupied by Edith’s sister Sara, her husband
                  Samuel Taylor Coleridge and their three children. It was to become the Southeys’ home
                  for the remainder of their lives. In exchanging Bristol for the Lakes, Southey left
                  behind the city in which he had been born and spent much of his first three decades,
                  a city which by 1803 had become a spectral place, haunted by the ghosts of a dead
                  daughter, mother, cousin and father, and by the monitory shade of Thomas Chatterton,
                  summoned up by the teenaged Southey in ‘Bristol Church-Yard’, one of his earliest
                  surviving poems.

                  </div> In heading for the Lake District, Southey also left the city and the wider geographical
                  region which had been at the very centre of his literary life, both as subject and
                  as professional hub for his dealings with other writers, publishers, printers and
                  booksellers. He literally put himself on the road to being tagged by his contemporaries
                  as a member of the ‘Lake’ school.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Southey’s correspondence brings him into sharper focus. It charts his reading, maps
                  his changing views on politics and society, and describes his activities as a professional
                  man of letters, including drafts of poems and prose works. The letters published here
                  contain important evidence of the labour involved in writing. They remind us that
                  extensive planning, research and writing lay behind many of Southey’s published works
                  and contain ideas for ambitious projects (such as a tragedy on the martyrdom of Joan
                  of Arc, poems on all the major world religions and multi-volume history of Portugal)
                  that never materialised. As his ‘cholera’ letter of 1831 reveals, in his private and
                  public lives, Southey rarely pulled his punches. The letters contain violent denunciations
                  of opponents, including Byron and Hazlitt, and a disturbingly detailed description
                  of Shelley’s corpse, washed ashore in Italy. It was, Southey noted, ‘much mutilated
                  ... the fish had half devoured it’.

                  composing a letter with a family member or friend. This irregularity did not last.
                  After his move to Keswick in 1803, letter writing became a more regularised, solitary
                  occupation, pursued in Southey’s study at Greta Hall. Yet the impossibility of entirely
                  separating his correspondence from the rest of the household is witnessed by the traces
                  left, on the manuscripts that survive, by other people and other aspects of his life.
                  These include playful deletions or insertions in the hand of his first wife Edith;
                  and even the paw-prints of a kitten walking over a letter before the ink had dried.
                  Southey was, fortunately for the kitten, very fond of cats, in a letter of 1802 decrying
                  the nefarious conduct of a ‘Cat eater’, a man who had recently devoured ‘a large Tom
                  Cat alive’.

               evening which brought them.

               <p>In spite of the pressure of time, Southey took great pains over what was an important
                  channel of communication with friends, family and professional associates. This was
                  a quality recognised by Thackeray, who praised the ‘goodness and purity’ of Southey’s
                  ‘private letters’.

                  </div> Yet it is important to remember that Southey was the product of an epistolary culture
                  and that for him letter writing had private and public, domestic and professional
                  dimensions. His letters could be private documents, sent to friends and family and
                  intended to be read by the recipient and perhaps a close family circle. Yet they could
                  also be public texts, available for wider consumption. From the outset of his career,
                  Southey was keen to ‘correspond with the world’.

                  1822, he took on an even more formidable opponent, Byron, in the pages of <em>The Courier</em>. His advice to Byron ‘When he attacks me again let it be in rhyme’, did not quite

                  he returned to the epistolary travel book in a slightly different guise, publishing <em>Letters from England</em> under the pseudonym of Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella. <em>Letters from England</em>, which tapped into literary fashion, and into a culture keen to consume correspondence,
                  was one of Southey’s best-selling publications.</p>

               <p>As he grew older, Southey’s sense of his own letters, including those intended only

                  his legacy to posterity increased. It was a complex realisation. It could provide
                  him with the – somewhat self-righteous – solace that his political and cultural judgements
                  would be vindicated in the long term. As Southey explained to Caroline Bowles, his
                  correspondence with Shelley would, when published, expose Byron and his biographer
                  Thomas Medwin as ‘impudent liars’.

                  acknowledging that anyone who wanted to keep their private life private was fighting
                  a losing battle and that ‘in these days nothing can be kept from the joint demands

                  </div> Yet his own relationship to this culture of consumption was deeply ambiguous. He was,
                  after all, both a ‘personality’ and an editor of the correspondence of others. In
                  particular, his work on a biography and edition of William Cowper, brought him face
                  to face with how a writer’s correspondence could be manipulated. Southey was proud
                  that his life of Cowper had made extensive use of the poet’s ‘unpublished letters’
                  and in so doing ‘brought much to life which Hayley was not allowed to make known,
                  and of which none of his biographers knew any thing’. He not merely published new
                  information about Cowper, he also reinstated passages in individual letters that had
                  ‘formerly been withheld’.

                           Southey’s contemporaries agreed with his treatment of Cowper. An anonymous reviewer
                           in The Christian Observer, 429 (1837), p. 610 described his ‘detailed account of Cowper’s
                           attempted suicide’ as ‘revolting’ and accused Southey of lacking ‘good taste and right
                           feeling’ and ‘thinking of little but of literature and entertainment’.</span></div>
                  </div> Yet any sense of him as a modern scholarly editor needs to be tempered with the realisation
                  that Southey believed not everything in a writer’s life could be revealed – that some
                  information needed to be suppressed and that editorial intervention was necessary.
                  In the case of Cowper, this included correspondence relating to the poet’s belief
                  that he was an androgyne.

                  and literary remains of Coleridge, who had died in 1834. Southey knew that Coleridge
                  had frequently attacked him in letters, both to himself and to others. The possible
                  publication of Coleridge’s correspondence was therefore of considerable concern to
                  him. He cautioned Coleridgean memoirists such as Joseph Cottle against publishing
                  all they knew and also kept in reserve copies of Coleridge’s letters and his own to
                  use ‘for my own vindication’ if the need arose.

               <p>As his reaction to the Wilberforces’ book reveals, by the late 1830s, Southey was

                  and letters. He resolved to manage his own posterity. In the case of his poems, Southey
                  took charge , ‘setting ... [his literary] house in order’ and publishing a ten-volume
                  collected edition.

                  The intention was that Taylor would supervise the construction of Southey’s posthumous
                  reputation, collecting letters and recollections from family and friends and writing
                  an authorized life. However, all this careful planning came to nothing. On 4 June
                  1839 Southey married Caroline Bowles. Shortly afterwards, his health, which had been
                  declining for some time, completely collapsed. As a result, a train of events was
                  set in motion that ruined these well-laid plans, wrecking Southey’s attempts to manage

                  between the pro- and anti-Bowles camps intensified to an extent that Henry Taylor’s
                  position soon became untenable. Having tried and failed to get cooperation from the
                  warring factions, Taylor resigned his post. With his departure went any plans for
                  an official life of the late Poet Laureate.

                  The poetical remains were divided between Southey’s son-in-law Herbert Hill and widow.
                  In 1845 Hill published an edition of the unfinished North American tale <em>Oliver Newman and Other Poems</em>, which pointedly failed to mention the second Mrs Southey. Caroline Bowles responded
                  with <em>Robin Hood: A Fragment</em> (1847), emphasising her ‘intellectual union’ with the late Poet Laureate.

                  along similarly factional lines: divided between John Wood Warter, Southey’s son-in-law

               <p>In 1849-1850, Cuthbert published a six volume <em>Life and Correspondence</em> of his father, linking selections from Southey’s letters with a biographical commentary.
                  It is a highly problematic edition. Cuthbert not only misdated many letters, but in
                  order to sanitise what he believed to be the less palatable aspects of his father’s
                  career and opinions, he, as was customary practice at the time, censored his source
                  materials. His silent deletions covered Southey’s private and public lives, his views
                  on politics and on literature. For example, he passed over Southey’s marriage to Bowles,
                  whom Cuthbert loathed, and removed personal observations about friends and family,
                  including incautious comments on the ‘crazy humours’ of Charles Lamb and a description
                  of Wordworth’s letter to Mathetes as ‘a ... &lt;mouthful&gt; of moonshine’.

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Cuthbert’s edition is partial in other ways. Circumscribed by the family feud, he
               had access only to a fraction of the voluminous surviving correspondence, and could
               see only the letters sent to individuals who were on his side of the dispute. This
               meant that whilst he was able to call on letters sent to John Rickman, Sharon Turner,
               Walter Scott, Coleridge, Wordsworth, and the family of Henry Kirke White, he could
               not use those to other important figures in Southey’s life and career such as Charles
               Danvers, John King, Mary Barker and Anna Eliza Bray. The result was an incomplete
               sense of the range of Southey’s contacts – the sense of a part rather than a whole
               life.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The same problem also affected a second, rival edition: John Wood Warter’s four-volume
               <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, published in 1856. Warter was able to draw upon some of the major correspondences
               that Cuthbert had been refused access to, including those with Danvers and Mary Barker.
               Warter’s edition did not overlap with Cuthbert’s, rather it set out to be different:
               providing a completely new selection of Southey letters, minus any of Cuthbert’s biographical
               interpolations. By the time he came to work on the <em>Selections</em>, Warter was, in fact, an old hand at editing Southey, having produced editions in
               1847 of the final two volumes of <em>The Doctor</em> and in 1849-1850 of the <em>Common-Place Books</em>. His experience showed. His text is, as a rule, more accurate and reliable than Cuthbert’s.
               However, this does not mean that he reproduced everything he saw on the manuscript
               page. Even Warter was capable of editorial intervention and he made countless minor,
               cosmetic changes to Southey’s prose, altering punctuation and word order at will.
               More seriously, he occasionally - and silently - removed passages from letters. Most
               of his omissions were connected to family matters, or to persons still living. A letter
               of 25 October 1834 was published without a section describing the mental health of
               Southey’s first wife, Edith, then confined in The Retreat at York:</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">The accounts from York are hopeful. But a considerable time must elapse before bodily

            <p>The omission was not surprising, given that Warter was married to Edith’s eldest daughter.
               Nevertheless, it undermined the textual integrity of Southey’s original letter.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Warter was a vocal and capable supporter of Caroline Bowles. He inherited her papers
                  after her death in 1854 and his commitment to her reputation was such that he planned
                  to edit a selection of the correspondence exchanged by her and Southey.

                  author of the biography of Southey in the ‘English Men of Letters’ series. In 1881
                  Dowden published a selected edition of <em>The Correspondence of Robert Southey and Caroline Anne Bowles</em>, some 199 letters exchanged between April 1818 and January 1838. A further five letters
                  between Southey and Shelley were included in an Appendix. Dowden’s edition is unique,
                  as the only attempt so far to see a Southeyan correspondence in the round by publishing
                  both sides. It also made a case for Bowles’s own writing as ‘worthy of remembrance’
                  and for the importance to Southey of their creative exchange.

                  courtship and engagement. It was not that he had no letters to select from – evidence
                  of the letters Southey wrote to Bowles during this key period in their relationship
                  can be found in an account sent by Bowles to Anna Eliza Bray – but rather that he
                  chose not to include any.

               <p>This dispersal of the published correspondence continued into the twentieth century.
                  The importance of the letters of Southey’s direct contemporaries Coleridge and Wordsworth
                  was recognised and enshrined with the appearance of major scholarly editions. There
                  was, however, no attempt to do the same for Southey and to publish all his correspondence
                  in one place. This does not mean that the letters were neglected entirely, rather
                  that Southey’s liminal position in the twentieth century Romantic canon was seen not
                  as justifying a collected edition. Instead, letters continued to appear in scattered
                  publications. In 1960 Adolfo Cabral included 63 letters in his edition of Southey’s <em>Journals of a Residence in Portugal 1800-1801 and a Visit to France 1838</em>. Only 22 of these had previously been unpublished, the remaining 41 were reprinted
                  directly from the problematic editions of Cuthbert Southey and Warter. A more substantial
                  attempt to fill in the blanks left by unpublished or bowdlerised letters was made
                  in 1965, when Kenneth Curry published a two-volume <em>New Letters of Robert Southey</em>. This comprised 497 letters covering Southey’s entire writing life – beginning in
                  1792 and ending in 1838. It included both letters published for the first time and
                  complete versions of ones previously censored by interventionist editors such as Joseph
                  Cottle or Cuthbert Southey. Curry, the leading Southey scholar of the mid-twentieth
                  century, also stated the case for the centrality of the correspondence for an understanding
                  of the man and his writing, arguing ‘it is there he will find the whole range of Southey’s
                  life and career’.

                  </div> Another new edition followed in 1976, when Charles Ramos edited a group of 170 letters
                  sent by Southey to his friend John May. Both Curry and Ramos’s editions added to knowledge
                  of Southey, but they were also both highly selective. Ramos used only the collection
                  of letters from Southey to May held in the University of Texas, Austin, and not the
                  parts of their correspondence scattered in other archives throughout the world. Curry,
                  meanwhile, admitted that at least 2000 Southey letters still remained unpublished
                  and that several hundreds more were available only in unreliable texts.

                  </div> This selectivity was undoubtedly dictated by Southey’s non-canonical status and it

                  </div> Alongside the stirrings of this Southeyan critical renaissance has come the acknowledgement
                  of the need for scholarly editions of Southey’s poetry, prose and correspondence.
                  Those editions are now being produced and it is becoming once more possible to read
                  him. The on-going <em>Poetical Works</em> is helping to revolutionise understanding of Southey the poet.

                  </div> We hope that the <em>Collected Letters</em> will do the same for the correspondence. The letters published here restore wholeness
                  to this most fragmented of Romantic period writers, providing accurate texts of letters
                  that were previously unpublished or available only in censored versions. Taken individually
                  and as a whole, the letters reveal a more complete picture of Southey’s life, literary
                  relationships, opinions on politics and society and development as a writer. Southey
                  emerges from his correspondence as a consummate – even an ‘entire’ – man of letters,
                  intimately involved in the culture of his time. <em>The Collected Letters</em> therefore both contributes to what can be called the new Southey criticism and provides
                  the primary material by which future scholars can take that criticism in important
                  fresh directions.</p>
