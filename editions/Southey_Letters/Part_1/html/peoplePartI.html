                     is not clear. He could be one of: Edward Hale Adderley (1771–1870), admitted 1784;
                     George Augustus Adderley (dates unknown), admitted 1785; or Richard Boyle Adderley

In the mid-1790s, Southey and Aikin moved in the same circles in London. Aikin
                     was a regular contributor to periodicals and his review of <em>Joan of Arc</em> appeared in the <em>Analytical Review</em> in 1796. In 1797 Aikin and his son, Arthur Aikin (1773–1854; <em>DNB</em>), translated the first volume of Necker’s <em>On the French Revolution</em>. Southey translated the second. In the mid-1790s, Southey (using a variety of pseudonyms)
                     corresponded with Aikin in the latter’s capacity as literary editor of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e285"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="AllenRobert">Allen, Robert (1772–1805):</span> <span class="gloss">surgeon and journalist. Educated at Christ’s Hospital (where he was a contemporary
                     of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Lamb) and University College, Oxford (BA 1796,
                     MA 1803, MB and MD 1803). He first met Southey, who was flirting with a career in
                     medicine, at the Anatomy School in Oxford in early 1794. They became firm friends,
                     Southey later describing how in 1794 Allen had been his ‘bosom-companion’ and had
                     ‘rendered many hours delightful which would otherwise have passed in the destructive
                     daydreams of solitude’. Allen wrote poetry and, in Oxford in June 1794, introduced
                     Southey to Coleridge. In 1794–1795, Allen was possibly a convert to Pantisocracy.
                     In 1796, he enrolled at the Westminster Hospital and married a wealthy widow, Catherine,
                     daughter of Nathaniel Forster (1726–1790; <em>DNB</em>). She died within a year. In 1797, with the encouragement of Anthony Carlisle, he
                     became deputy surgeon with England’s Second Royals, then stationed in Portugal. He
                     was back in Britain by 1802 and from 1803 until his death worked as a journalist,
                     writing for (according to Charles Lamb) the London newspapers the <em>Oracle</em>, <em>True Briton</em>, <em>Star</em> and <em>Traveller</em>.</span></li>

                     In later life, Barnes held several livings in Devonshire.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e318"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BeddoesThomas">Beddoes, Thomas (1760–1808; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">chemist and physician. Born at Shifnal, Shropshire, son of Richard Beddoes and Ann
                     Whitehall. Educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School, by private tutor, and at Pembroke
                     College, Oxford (matric. 1776, BA 1779, MB and MD 1786), and Edinburgh. Reader in
                     Chemistry at Oxford from 1788. In the early 1790s, a growing reputation as a radical
                     led to his surveillance by Home Office spies and failure to gain the Regius Chair
                     in Chemistry. He left Oxford for Bristol in 1793 and married Anna Edgeworth (1772–1824),
                     sister of the novelist Maria (1768–1849; <em>DNB</em>), in the following year. Beddoes was involved in the political protest movements
                     of the mid-1790s and possibly first met Southey in 1795, during the latter’s immersion
                     in Bristol politics. In 1799, Beddoes opened the Pneumatic Institute (from 1802 the
                     Preventive Medical Institution for the Sick and Drooping Poor) in Hotwells, Bristol.
                     Southey participated in the experiments with gases carried out by Beddoes and Humphry
                     Davy, and recorded in <em>Notice of Some Observations made at the Medical Pneumatic Institution</em> (1799). Beddoes was a prolific writer on medical, political and educational reform.
                     He was also a poet: author of <em>Alexander’s Expedition</em> (1792) and a contributor to Southey’s <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799). Southey respected Beddoes’s medical judgment, consulting him on more than
                     one occasion. In 1809 he recorded that ‘From Beddoes I hoped for more good to the
                     human race than from any other individual’. However, disagreements about poetry ensured
                     that their personal relationship was not warm. Southey dismissed Beddoes as a ‘hypercritic
                     of the Darwin school’ and was furious when his ‘Domiciliary Verses’ (a parody of Samuel
                     Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth and Southey) found its way into the first volume
                     of the <em>Annual Anthology</em>. Joseph Cottle, who was responsible for the poem’s inclusion, was ordered by Southey
                     not to solicit any further contributions from Beddoes.</span></li>

                     parents, Charles and Mary Bedford, three sons (Grosvenor, Horace and Harry) and a
                     cousin, Mary Page. Southey was on good terms with the entire family. He made use of
                     the library in their Westminster home and wrote the first draft of <em>Joan of Arc</em> during an extended stay at their house in Brixton in summer 1793. Southey corresponded
                     with Grosvenor and Horace.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e358"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford, Grosvenor Charles (1773–1839):</span> <span class="gloss">civil servant and miscellaneous writer. The son of Charles Bedford (Deputy Usher of
                     the Exchequer, as Horace Walpole’s substitute). Educated at Westminster (adm. 1784),
                     but did not attend university. Assistant clerk in the Exchequer Office, 1792–1803;
                     clerk of the cash book, 1803–6; clerk of the registers and issues, 1806–22; chief
                     clerk in the auditor’s office, 1822–34. Admitted to Gray’s Inn, 26 January 1797. Bedford
                     did not marry, despite regularly seeking Southey’s advice on his love affairs. Bedford
                     and Southey met at Westminster School and their friendship endured for the remainder
                     of their lives. Bedford had literary inclinations. He was involved in the ill-fated
                     <em>Flagellant</em> (1792), contributed poems to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (1797) and the first volume of the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799), and privately published his translation of Musaeus, <em>The Loves of Hero and Leander</em> (1797). He worked with Southey on <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em> (1807) and contributed an unsigned notice of Southey’s <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814) to the <em>Quarterly Review</em>. His other publications included <em>A Letter to the Right Hon. William Pitt on his Political Experiments</em> (1804, anonymous) and a <em>Memoir</em> of Barré Charles Roberts (1814).</span></li>

               <li class="item" id="d31e404"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BedfordHoraceWalpole">Bedford, Horace Walpole (c. 1776–1807):</span> <span class="gloss">civil servant and miscellaneous writer. The younger brother of Grosvenor Charles Bedford
                     and named after his father’s patron. He was educated at Westminster School (adm. 1784),
                     where his nickname was ‘the Doctor’ or ‘Dr. Johnson’. He did not attend university
                     and later held a post at the British Museum. Like his older brother, he did not marry.
                     Southey’s friendship with Horace began at school and their correspondence (though
                     occasionally intermittent) lasted until at least 1797. Southey’s relationship with
                     Horace was slightly different from that with Grosvenor Charles Bedford. He treated
                     Horace as a younger brother: encouraging him and worrying about his tendency to laziness.
                     He also fostered the younger man’s literary ambitions. Horace’s poems appeared in
                     the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (1797) and the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799).</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e419"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BiddlecombeCharles">Biddlecombe, Charles (dates unknown):</span> <span class="gloss">neighbour and friend. Biddlecombe met Southey in summer 1797 when the latter moved
                     to the village of Burton in Hampshire. Southey described him as ‘rich enough to buy
                     books, and very friendly, all that a neighbour should be’. Biddlecombe married in
                     summer 1798. His wife had died in childbirth by April 1799, leaving him with an infant
                     daughter. During Southey’s numerous absences, Biddlecombe appears to have looked after
                     the cottage at Burton and when it was finally given up in 1802 arranged for a sale
                     of part of the furniture and stored some of Southey’s possessions, including books,
                     for a number of years. During his 1817 visit to France, Southey ran into Biddlecombe,
                     whom he had not seen for several years, and his invalid daughter, describing the latter
                     as ‘short and plethoric, with a countenance of prepossessing good nature’.</span></li>

                     Coleridge, Estlin and Southey, for congeries of publishers in London and the South-West
                     of England. In the mid-late 1790s, he entered into a business partnership with Joseph
                     Cottle, printing the Bristol edition of Coleridge and Wordsworth’s <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798), and the revised editions of 1800 and 1802.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e441"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BunburyCharlesJohn">Bunbury, Charles John (1772–1798):</span> <span class="gloss">soldier. Educated at Westminster School, where he was a friend of Southey’s, and Trinity
                     College, Cambridge. In 1789, Bunbury presented Southey with a copy of Thomas Warton’s
                     <em>Poems</em> (3rd edn, 1779), see <em>A Catalogue of the Printed Books Bequeathed by John Forster, Esq., LL.D.</em> (London, 1888), p. 525. Their friendship did not last. In 1793, Bunbury tried to
                     avoid Southey when the latter was visiting Cambridge. Southey, in turn, claimed that
                     Bunbury’s ‘debauchery’ was the direct result of his public school education. Bunbury
                     joined the army and died at the Cape of Good Hope. Bunbury’s father, the artist Henry
                     William Bunbury (1750–1811; <em>DNB</em>), and his younger brother, Sir Henry Edward Bunbury (1778–1860; <em>DNB</em>), later became close friends of Southey’s and members of his circle in Keswick.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e462"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="BurnettGeorge">Burnett, George (c. 1776–1811; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">writer. The son of John Burnett, a farmer, of Huntspill, Somerset. Educated at Balliol
                     College, Oxford (matric. 1793). His varied career included time spent as a student
                     at a dissenting academy in Manchester, pastor to a Unitarian congregation in Great
                     Yarmouth, medical student at the University of Edinburgh, assistant to John Rickman,
                     domestic tutor to the sons of Lord Stanhope, assistant surgeon to a militia regiment
                     and (in Poland) tutor to the family of Count Zamovski. Burnett was also a professional
                     writer, whose works included <em>View of the Present State of Poland</em> (1807; from essays originally published in the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>), <em>Specimens of English Prose Writers</em> (1807; a companion to George Ellis’s <em>Specimens of the Early English Poets</em>) and <em>Extracts from the Prose Works of Milton</em> (1809). Southey met Burnett at Balliol and the two became friends. Burnett was one
                     of the originators of Pantisocracy and in true Pantisocratic spirit proposed to Martha
                     Fricker, who turned him down. In 1795, he shared lodgings with Southey and Coleridge
                     in Bristol. From 1797–1798, he was minister to a Unitarian congregation in Great Yarmouth,
                     Norfolk, where he also tutored Henry Herbert Southey. Burnett moved in metropolitan
                     literary circles and was friendly with Charles Lamb and John Rickman. His relationship
                     with Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge became deeply ambivalent — by 1803 he was
                     accusing both of treating him badly. Burnett was an opium addict and his last years
                     were probably spent in poverty. He died in the Marylebone Infirmary.</span></li>

                     when Campbell was on his way to take up a living in Antigua.</span></li>

                     and his first wife Barbara (d. 1768). Studied medicine in York, Durham and London,
                     and was appointed surgeon to the Westminster Hospital in 1793. He married Martha Symmons
                     in 1800 and in the same year was one of the founding members of the Royal College
                     of Surgeons, serving as its president in 1829 and 1839. He moved in metropolitan literary
                     and scientific circles, attending Mary Wollstonecraft on her death-bed in 1797. He
                     was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1804, held the post of Professor of Anatomy
                     at the Royal Academy from 1808 and later that of surgeon-extraordinary to the Prince
                     Regent. Carlisle was knighted when George IV acceded to the throne. Carlisle and Southey
                     met in c. 1795, probably through their mutual friend Grosvenor Charles Bedford. In
                     c. 1798 Carlisle, Southey and John May collaborated on a scheme for a convalescent
                     asylum to assist the poor after their discharge from hospital. Although Carlisle and
                     Southey corresponded, their letters to one another seem not to have survived.</span></li>

                     and George Coleridge were — especially later in life, when the latter acknowledged

                     — four decade relationship with Coleridge had a major impact both on Southey’s life
                     and on his critical posterity. It began in Oxford in summer 1794 when Robert Allen
                     introduced Southey to a visitor from Cambridge — Coleridge. It was a fateful meeting,
                     leading to the failed scheme of Pantisocracy, literary collaboration, and — eventually
                     — mutual disenchantment. As Southey later recorded: ‘that meeting fixed the future
                     fortunes of us both ... Coleridge had at that time thought little of politics, in
                     morals he was as loose ... as men at a university usually are, but he was a Unitarian.
                     my morals were of the sternest Stoicism ... that same feeling which made me a poet
                     kept me pure ... Our meeting was mutually serviceable, — I reformed his life, &amp; he

                     Married Jane Forman, by whom he had one son. Died c. 1806. Collins’s biography is
                     difficult to reconstruct as <em>Records of Old Westminsters</em> and <em>Alumni Oxoniensis</em> both confuse him with his son, also named Charles Collins, and give a later date
                     of death. A note, now in the Huntington Library, written by an eponymous descendant
                     confirms that he died young. In 1815, Southey referred to Collins’s widow and in 1828
                     described him as long dead. Southey met Collins at Westminster and later described
                     him as ‘one of my most intimate school and college friends’. However, by early 1794
                     their friendship had cooled and they seem to have had no contact with one another
                     after Southey’s departure from Oxford later that year.</span></li>

                     were friends for a short time in Oxford, but by mid-1794 they were permanently estranged.</span></li>

                     Inn, January 1795. Perpetual Curate of Barrington, Somerset, 1810; Rector of Earnshill
                     from 1821 and of Donyatt, from 1821. Southey met Combe at Westminster and later described
                     him as one of his ‘most intimate acquaintances’ during his years at school. Combe
                     was known by the nicknames ‘His Majesty’ or the ‘King of Men’. Although their friendship
                     did not outlast Oxford, Southey did visit Combe in 1824.</span></li>

                     possibly as many as eight siblings in total. Southey seems to have been acquainted
                     with the entire Cottle family. After their secret marriage in November 1795, his wife
                     Edith lived with the Cottle sisters for some of the time Southey was absent in Spain

                     (matric. 1795, BA 1799). He then embarked on a legal training. He spent the final
                     year of his life in London, where he was a friend of George Dyer and Charles Lamb,
                     and died in his chambers at Clifford’s Inn. Author of <em>Icelandic Poetry, or, The Edda of Saemund, translated into English verse</em> (1797; published by Joseph Cottle and with dedicatory poem by Southey). Several of
                     his other poems were collected posthumously in the 1829 fourth edition of Joseph Cottle,
                     <em>Malvern Hills, with Minor Poems and Essays</em>. Southey probably met Amos Cottle through his younger brother Joseph. The two shared
                     an interest in Scandinavian literature and mythology and it was Southey who encouraged
                     Amos to produce a verse, rather than prose, translation of the <em>Edda</em> and who reviewed it in the <em>Critical Review</em>.</span></li>

                     Dykes Campbell joked ‘I never heard of ... [Cottle’s] having ... any [parents], and
                     think it very doubtful. I should think he was found under a booksellers counter wrapped
                     in Felix Farley’s newspaper’, Joseph was in fact the second child of Robert and Sarah
                     Cottle. He was educated at the school run by Richard Henderson (1736/7–1792) at Hanham,
                     near Bristol. In 1791 he opened a shop as a printseller, stationer, binder and bookseller
                     in Bristol. Cottle abandoned bookselling in 1798 but continued publishing. Between
                     1791–1800, he sold, printed or published 114 works, in congeries with Joseph Johnson,
                     Benjamin Flower, H. D. Symons and others. In 1800 he began to sell his copyrights
                     to the London firm of Longman. A poet and prose writer, his works included: <em>Poems</em> (1795), <em>Malvern Hills</em> (1798; with a prefatory poem by Southey), <em>Alfred</em> (1800), <em>The Fall of Cambria</em> (1808), <em>Early Recollections, Chiefly Relating to the Late Samuel Taylor Coleridge, During
                        his Long Residence in Bristol</em> (1837) and <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (1847). Cottle and Southey were introduced by Robert Lovell in 1794. Although not
                     wealthy, Cottle provided generous financial help to Southey throughout the 1790s,
                     even lending him money for his wedding ring. He published <em>Joan of Arc</em> and the majority of Southey’s earliest works, including <em>Poems</em> (1797) and <em>Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and Portugal</em> (1797). His professional collaboration with Southey also included contributing poems
                     to the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and co-editing the works of their fellow Bristolian Thomas Chatterton (1752–1770;
                     <em>DNB</em>). What Cottle did not know, was that Southey viewed his poetry with a merriment that
                     verged on contempt. The two men met less frequently after Southey’s move to Keswick
                     in 1803, but maintained their correspondence. Southey’s final tour of the West Country
                     in 1836–1837 included a visit to Cottle in Bristol. After Southey’s death, Cottle
                     was a central figure in the successful campaign to erect a monument to his memory
                     in Bristol cathedral. He recorded his association with Southey for posterity in his
                     controversial <em>Reminiscences</em> (1847), itself a reworking of the equally contentious <em>Early Recollections</em> (1837).</span></li>

                     related to the regicides Sir John Danvers (1584/5–1655; <em>DNB</em>) and General Thomas Harrison (c. 1616–60; <em>DNB</em>) and to the diarist Celia Fiennes (1662–1741; <em>DNB</em>). (Southey possessed a manuscript of Fiennes diary which he had been given by the
                     Danvers family and included unacknowledged excerpts from it in his and Coleridge’s
                     <em>Omniana</em> (1812)). Danvers’ father had ‘been a person of some property’, though the family’s
                     fortunes had since declined. Danvers seems to have had two brothers and two sisters.
                     He never married. A dissenter, he died in London ‘during a short tarriance there’
                     and was buried in Asplands Burial Ground, Hackney. Danvers knew Southey from childhood.
                     In 1797, their friendship flourished when Southey and his wife lodged in a house in
                     Kingsdown, next door to Danvers and his mother. In 1799, Southey finished the fifteen
                     book version of <em>Madoc</em> in Mrs Danvers’ ‘parlour on her little table’. When Southey went to Portugal in 1800–1,
                     he left a copy of his poetic magnum opus with Danvers and also delegated the task
                     of collecting materials for the third <em>Annual Anthology</em> to him and Davy. This volume did not appear. Danvers visited Southey at Keswick in
                     summer 1805 and kept a journal of his tour, now in the British Library, Add MS 30,929.
                     Extracts from this were published in Kenneth Curry, ‘A note on Wordsworth’s “Fidelity”’,

                     entered Middle Temple 1810; graduated LLB Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1814. His publications
                     included: <em>A Brief Account of the Subversion of the Papal Government in 1798</em> (1799), <em>A Selection of Twelve Heads from the Last Judgment of Michael Angelo</em> (1801), <em>Memoirs of a Literary and Political Character</em> (1803), and <em>The Life and Literary Works of Michael Angelo Buonarotti, with His Poetry and Letters</em> (1806). The latter contained translations by Southey and William Wordsworth. Southey
                     and Duppa were introduced by Edmund Seward in Oxford in 1793. Duppa was related to
                     Seward and, according to family lore, distantly related to Southey. Part of Southey’s
                     circle, he was at one time engaged to Mary Page, the cousin of Grosvenor Charles and
                     Horace Walpole Bedford. In the 1790s, Southey sought Duppa’s advice about projected
                     illustrated editions of his poems. Later, Duppa provided the material on art in Southey’s
                     <em>Letters from England</em> (1807).</span></li>

                     the late 1780s to mid 1790s he was active in reformist causes, a member of the Constitutional
                     Society and author of <em>An Inquiry into the Nature of Subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles</em> (1789, second revised edn 1792), <em>Complaints of the Poor People of England</em> (1793) and <em>A Dissertation on the Theory and Practice of Benevolence</em> (1795). After 1795, he abandoned active politics, turning instead to scholarship
                     and literature. He was a prolific poet whose works included, <em>Poems, Consisting of Odes and Elegies</em> (1792), <em>The Poet’s Fate</em> (1797), and <em>Poetics</em> (1812). Dyer met Southey in c. 1794–1795, probably through Coleridge. He was enthusiastic
                     about Pantisocracy and encouraged the publication of <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> (1794). He seems to have corresponded with Southey from the mid 1790s, but none of
                     these early letters survive, making it difficult to judge the actual extent of their
                     friendship. It is, however, fair to say, that this has probably been underestimated.
                     A handful of letters written by Southey to Dyer from later periods do exist. Dyer’s
                     close connections with Southey’s literary circle are evidenced in a letter sent to
                     him by Joseph Cottle, 22 April 1797 now in the Houghton Library (Autograph File: Cottle,

                     Vincent, the Head Master of Westminster School, the Egertons revealed that Southey
                     was its author. Southey was expelled and the Egertons’ involvement with <em>The Flagellant</em> ceased. The remaining four issues, 5–26 April 1792, were printed by the Pall-Mall

                     1823), he was described as ‘the fattest undergraduate of his day’ (<em>DNB</em>). Ordained and presented to the living of Little Horkesley, Essex, on his uncle’s
                     death in 1802 he relinquished his duties and income to a curate, though he continued
                     to hold the living until 1816. He made a brief move to Edinburgh, where he met the
                     founders of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, to which he became a contributor. He returned to London and in 1807 moved to Kent,
                     where he lived with his mother until 1816. During this time he produced editions of
                     Aristophanes, Sophocles and Euripides and a number of learned papers on classical
                     subjects, published in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> and other periodicals. He travelled at length in Europe c. 1816–1818 and settled
                     in Oxford in 1818. In 1823 (having been unsuccessfully proposed for the Regius Chair
                     of Divinity at Oxford and having turned down the See of Calcutta) he was elected Camden
                     Professor of Ancient History and Principal of St Alban Hall, Oxford, offices he held
                     until his death in 1825. Southey and Elmsley met at Westminster School and remained
                     lifelong friends, though relatively little of what seems to have been an extensive
                     correspondence survives. Elmsley was also a great friend of Charles Watkin Williams

                     Sarah, Mary, Edith, Martha (b. 1777), Eliza (b. 1778) and George (b. 1785). The failure
                     of his business speculations (including the manufacture of sugar pans) contributed
                     to Stephen Fricker’s early death and to a sharp decline in the fortunes of his family.
                     The family home was sold, Mrs Fricker moved into lodgings in Bristol and opened a
                     dame school, and her three eldest daughters became seamstresses, whose clients included
                     Southey’s mother and aunt, Elizabeth Tyler. Southey knew the Frickers from childhood
                     and was ‘partly educated’ with the three eldest girls. The similarity between their
                     situation and his own (Southey’s father was also a bankrupt) was perhaps an important
                     factor in what was to be a lifelong relationship.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e912"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="FrickerEdith">Fricker, Edith (1774–1837; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">Southey’s first wife. The third surviving child of Stephen Fricker and Martha Rowles.
                     Southey and Edith met as children in Bristol. They married in secret on 14 November
                     1795 at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. As her sister Sarah later explained, Southey ‘left
                     ... [Edith] at the Church door’ and the following day departed for Spain and Portugal.
                     Edith spent the early days of her marriage living with the Cottle sisters and using
                     her maiden name, only reverting to ‘Southey’ when the secret became public in early
                     1796. Recent biographers of Southey have questioned the state of his marriage, particularly
                     given his lively — even flirtatious — friendships with Mary Barker and Caroline Bowles,
                     who became his second wife in 1839. Compared to these other women, or to her sister
                     Sarah, Edith is a relatively shadowy figure, plagued by physical and mental illness.
                     The deaths of four of her eight children, in particular that of her daughter Isabel
                     in 1826, hastened her decline. She suffered a complete collapse in 1834 and was taken
                     to The Retreat, the pioneering, Quaker-run asylum in York, where she was diagnosed
                     as of ‘unsound mind’ and treated with ‘purgatives, remedies, [and] leeches’. She was
                     released in 1835 ‘as admitted’ — that is, uncured and incurable. Edith spent her final
                     years at her home, Greta Hall, where she was cared for by Southey and her daughters
                     Bertha and Kate. Southey described her death as a release from ‘a pitiable state of
                     existence’.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e924"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="FrickerMary">Fricker, Mary (1771–1862):</span> <span class="gloss">Southey’s sister-in-law. The second surviving child of Stephen Fricker and Martha
                     Rowles. In the early 1790s she worked as an actress in Bath and Bristol theatres.
                     She married Robert Lovell in January 1794, in spite of the disapproval of his family.
                     Their son, also called Robert, was born in 1795. After Lovell’s death in 1796, Southey
                     tried to persuade his family to provide for his widow and child. He was only partially
                     successful. The Lovells gave Robert Lovell Junior the occasional gift (for example,
                     £20 in 1802) and made some contribution to the boy’s early education, but they did
                     not provide consistent, long-term support. As a result, Mary and her son were dependent
                     upon Southey. They lived with or near to the Southeys for the rest of the 1790s and
                     early 1800s and in 1803 accompanied them to their new home, Greta Hall. Robert Lovell
                     Junior had few prospects (significantly less than those of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s
                     children, whose paternal relations were capable of greater generosity). By 1803, the
                     money paid by the Lovell family for the child’s education was about to cease, so Southey
                     and John May tried to get Robert Lovell Junior into Christ’s Hospital. They failed.
                     The boy was apprenticed to a London printer and effectively separated from his mother
                     and family in Keswick. The impact of this on his character seems to have been profound.
                     In 1836 his first cousin Sara Coleridge described Robert Lovell Junior’s lack of social
                     skills: ‘From nine years old he has had to shift and scramble a good deal for himself,
                     to bear up against a hard world which would have crushed &lt;or injured&gt; the frame it
                     did not render to a certain degree tough &amp; unyielding ... [he] never had the opportunity
                     of acquiring a taste for domestic, scarcely even for social enjoyment: we ought not
                     to wonder that he is deficient in many qualities which can only be fostered thereby.’
                     Mary remained at Greta Hall after her son’s departure for London, finally moving out
                     when it was given up after Southey’s death in 1843. She spent her final years living
                     with Kate, Southey’s unmarried daughter, and died on 10 August 1862. She was buried
                     in the Southey grave in Crosthwaite churchyard, on the outskirts of Keswick. Robert
                     Lovell Junior predeceased his mother. He disappeared whilst on a European walking
                     tour in 1841.</span></li>

                     Rowles. Sarah and Southey were childhood friends and it was through her that Southey
                     met Robert Lovell in late 1793. Sarah married Samuel Taylor Coleridge on 4 October
                     1795. Her relationship with Southey, who provided her with advice and support during
                     her later marital difficulties, was affectionate, and at times jokey and rumbustious.
                     Indeed, Sarah’s daughter and namesake recorded that Southey had been romantically
                     interested in Sarah Fricker first, only later turning his attentions to her sister
                     Edith.</span></li>

                     House of Assembly. In 1788 he came to England to work as a lawyer, but suffered a
                     mental collapse and was placed in an asylum run by Richard Henderson (1736/7–1792)
                     at Hanham near Bristol. (In an earlier career as a schoolmaster, Henderson had numbered
                     Joseph Cottle among his pupils.) Gilbert was released after a year and went to London,
                     where he worked as an astrologer and maker of magic talismans. In 1795 he went to
                     Bristol, where he became friends with Southey and Coleridge. In 1796 he published
                     <em>The Hurricane: a Theosophical and Western Eclogue</em>. He disappeared in 1798. It was thought he had left Bristol in search of the ‘Gilberti’,
                     an African tribe with whom he believed he had a spiritual affinity. Southey made enquiries
                     after him, but to no effect. Although by 1820 Southey spoke of Gilbert as long dead,
                     he was in fact probably still alive, dying c. 1825.</span></li>

                     and disliked him.</span></li>

                     father’s death was left short of money (even having to ‘pay his own school bills when
                     it was in his power’) and on extremely bad terms with his older half-brother. Hill
                     was educated at Christ Church, Oxford (BA 1772, MA 1774). From 1792–1807, he was chaplain
                     to the British factory at Lisbon. On his return to England, Hill took up a living
                     he owned at Staunton-Upon-Wye, remaining there until 1810 when the Duke of Bedford
                     presented him to a living in Streatham. In 1808 Hill married a woman twenty-five years
                     his junior, Catherine Bigg (b. c. 1775), a friend of Jane Austen (1775–1817; <em>DNB</em>). The marriage produced six surviving children, all of whom were on good terms with
                     Southey and his family. Hill’s son and namesake, Herbert Hill Junior (1810–1892),
                     married Southey’s daughter Bertha in 1839. Hill took a paternal interest in his nephews,
                     and helped finance Southey’s education. Hill’s concern about Southey’s refusal to
                     take the path mapped out for him (a path leading to ordination), his relationship
                     with Edith Fricker, and his politics, led him to visit England in 1795. He returned
                     to Portugal with Southey in tow. Oblivious to the fact that his nephew had married
                     Edith the day before their departure, Hill used every opportunity to introduce Southey
                     to more suitable women. Nevertheless, the time Southey spent with his uncle in 1795–1796
                     greatly strengthened their relationship, which remained close until Hill’s death in
                     1828. Hill encouraged his nephew’s interests in Spanish and Portuguese history and
                     literature, and later bought books and manuscripts on his behalf. Southey dedicated
                     his <em>Colloquies</em> (1829) to his uncle.</span></li>

                     whilst at school). Hook was one of the editors of the schoolboy magazine, <em>The Trifler</em>, and a keen musician and artist. He was a friend of Southey’s during his time at
                     Westminster, but their friendship did not last beyond schooldays.</span></li>

                     Little Chishill from 1810. He was a university friend of Southey’s. Although they
                     lost touch in the mid 1790s, in 1835 after a gap of ‘one and forty years’ Horseman
                     wrote to Southey recalling their old acquaintance. At the time of their reunion, Southey
                     was not aware that at the height of the <em>Wat Tyler</em> controversy in 1817, a ‘John Horseman’ — presumably the same one — had sent his political
                     opponent William Smith (1756–1835) a transcript of another production of the Poet
                     Laureate’s radical youth — ‘To the Exiled Patriots’. Horseman’s letter is now in the

                     during their visit to Exeter in 1799 and Hucks contributed three poems to Southey’s
                     <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1800). He died of consumption in 1800. In an unpublished preliminary notice to his
                     <em>Specimens of the Later English Poets</em> (1807) Southey recalled the ‘many pleasant &amp; rememberable hours’ he and Hucks had

                     to a Bristol apothecary in 1786. He contributed poems to the <em>European Magazine</em> and in 1794 published <em>The Times</em>, a satire. Jennings moved to London shortly after his marriage to Charlotte Sawier,
                     probably the only daughter of Southey’s landlady Mary Sawier, in 1795. He returned
                     to work in his family’s shop in 1801 and remained in Huntspill until the mid-1810s,
                     when economic depression led to the failure of the business. He continued with his
                     literary pursuits, contributing to the <em>Monthly Magazine</em> (from 1807) and publishing <em>Poems, Consisting of the Mysteries of Mendip, the Magic Ball</em> (1810). He returned to London in 1817 and worked as a professional writer, with some
                     support from Sir William Paxton, a wealthy banker. His works included the <em>Family Cyclopaedia</em> (1821), <em>Observations on Some of the Dialects of the West of England</em> (1825) and <em>Ornithologia</em> (1828). He founded the short-lived Metropolitan Literary Institution in 1823 and
                     was editor of the <em>Metropolitan Literary Journal</em> (1824). Jennings met Southey (and Coleridge) in Bristol in c. 1794. Although they
                     were not close friends, he and Southey corresponded (the correspondence has not survived)
                     and remained in contact until c. 1828. Jennings was a great admirer of Southey’s writing,
                     but the admiration was not reciprocated. Southey nicknamed him ‘poor Trauma’ and ‘the
                     traumatic poet’, though he admired Jennings’s ‘moral character’. Jennings shared Southey’s
                     interest in educational methods, and in 1813, in collaboration with the local rector
                     at Huntspill, established a school conducted on Lancaster and Bell’s monitorial system.
                     Jennings included anecdotes of Southey and Coleridge’s early careers in the <em>Metropolitan Literary Journal</em> (1824).</span></li>

                     well-connected. His father was the government manager at Rye, Sussex. Lamb’s career
                     benefited from the patronage of Lord Liverpool (1727–1808; <em>DNB</em>) and his eldest son, Lord Hawkesbury (1770–1828; <em>DNB</em>), a future Prime Minister. Lamb was private secretary to Hawkesbury, then Secretary
                     of State for Foreign Affairs, 1801–1802, and in 1802 was offered but rejected the
                     consulship at Lisbon, a post worth between £2000–2500 per year. He sat as an M.P.

                     he was Mayor of Rye from 1803–1804, 1809–1810 and 1816–1817. He never married. Southey
                     described Lamb as ‘one of my oldest — &amp; once one of my most intimate friends’. The
                     two met whilst pupils at Westminster and Southey stayed with Lamb’s family in Rye
                     on more than one occasion. They drifted apart (though, Southey later noted, ‘without
                     dissention’) during Southey’s time at Oxford. Lamb seems to have made an effort to
                     renew their acquaintance, seeking Southey out in London in 1802. In later years, however,
                     Southey’s opinion of him soured. He described him as one who had ‘discarded decency’
                     and on reading of Lamb’s death in a newspaper admitted that he had: ‘ ... thought
                     more of him, poor fellow, in consequence, than I had done for the last four-and-twenty
                     years ... [He] had become a mere idle heir of fortune, and not having his estates
                     to manage while his father lived, had not even that occupation to keep him from frivolities.
                     He was an old man at thirty, and that too being of a family in which it is degeneracy
                     to die at an age short of fourscore.’</span></li>

                     lived at Mountsfield Lodge, near Rye. By the mid-eighteenth century the Lamb family
                     had become the dominant force on Rye corporation and wielded great political influence
                     in the borough. Lamb was the government agent in Rye and sat as an M.P. for the town
                     1812–1816 and 1819, though (like his son) he is not known to have spoken in the House
                     of Commons. He was Mayor of Rye some 18 times between 1775–1817. Southey twice visited
                     the Lambs home in Rye in 1791 and 1792 and was on excellent terms with Thomas Phillipps
                     Lamb, perhaps seeing him as a surrogate father-figure. Their correspondence lapsed
                     during Southey’s time at Oxford and was briefly renewed in 1798.</span></li>

                     at Caius College, Cambridge in 1798 but did not take his degree. He married Sophia
                     Pemberton in 1799 and they moved to Ambleside in 1800. His works included: contributions
                     to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <em>Poems</em> (1797), <em>Blank Verse</em> (1798) (co-authored with Charles Lamb), the controversial roman a clef <em>Edmund Oliver</em> (1798), <em>Nugae Canorae</em> (1819), <em>Desultory Thoughts in London</em> (1821), <em>Poetical Essays on the Character of Pope</em> (1821), and <em>The Duke d'Ormond</em> (1822),. Lloyd’s later life was clouded by mental illness, he was briefly confined
                     in Quaker-run asylum The Retreat, York and died in a sanatorium near Versailles. Lloyd
                     met Southey at Burton in August 1797, when he and Charles Lamb unexpectedly turned
                     up on Southey’s doorstep. Lloyd remained with Southey and his family for several months.
                     Southey recognised in him a fellow man of strong emotions, a kindred — yet also unlike
                     — spirit, and worried that Lloyd’s ‘feelings ... are not so blunt as we could wish
                     them — or as they should be for his own happiness’. Indeed Lloyd’s continued presence
                     was increasingly unwelcome and in 1798 his tale-telling led to a major quarrel between
                     Southey and Coleridge which was not healed until 1799. After Southey moved to Keswick
                     in 1803, Lloyd was on the fringes of his circle. In his edition of Cowper (1836–1837),
                     Southey made his final public observations on Lloyd’s tragic history: ‘[his] intellectual
                     powers were of a very high order ... when in company with persons who were not informed
                     of his condition, no one could descry in him the slightest appearance of a deranged
                     mind.’</span></li>

                     Trinity College, Cambridge (BA 1786) and Lincoln’s Inn (called to the Bar 1789). He
                     visited Paris in 1792 and on his return to England moved in a circle of metropolitan
                     and Cambridge-based radicals and reformers that included George Dyer, William Godwin,
                     John Horne Tooke (1736–1812; <em>DNB</em>), John Tweddell (1769–1799; <em>DNB</em>), Felix Vaughan (dates unknown), and William Wordsworth. In 1795–1796, ill-health
                     forced his relocation to Bath, where he moved in the same circles as Southey. Losh
                     was amongst the earliest readers of the manuscript of the first complete version of
                     <em>Madoc</em> and had literary ambitions of his own, publishing an edition of Milton’s <em>Areopagitica</em> (1791) and a translation of Benjamin Constant’s <em>Observations on the Strength of the Present Government in France</em> (1797). He married Cecilia Baldwin in February 1798 and moved permanently to Newcastle
                     at the end of the same year. In later life he was a successful lawyer, businessman
                     and local politician.</span></li>

                     and Joseph), and numerous children. His first marriage to Edith Bourne (1741–1781)
                     had produced at least two sons, Joseph and Robert, and two daughters, whose names
                     are not known. Mr Lovell also had a substantial family by a second marriage. Southey
                     was on reasonable terms with all the Lovells, but their relationship was clouded by
                     struggles over adequate financial provision for the son and widow of Robert Lovell.</span></li>
               <li class="item" id="d31e1278"><br><span style="font-weight:bold" id="LovellRobert">Lovell, Robert (1771–1796; <em>DNB</em>):</span> <span class="gloss">poet. Born in Bristol, the son of a wealthy Quaker manufacturer (initially of cabinets
                     and later of pins), and his first wife Edith Bourne, a Quaker minister. Lovell possibly
                     entered the manufacturing business (on his death he was described as a pin manufacturer)
                     but was ill at ease in the commercial world. In 1794 he married Mary Fricker. His
                     family disapproved of the match as she was not a Quaker and had worked as an actress.
                     Their son, also named Robert, was born in 1795. Lovell died at Bristol on 3 May 1796
                     of a fever contracted on a trip to Salisbury and exacerbated by refusing to take medical
                     advice before returning home. One of his final letters to his wife is in the Huntington
                     Library, San Marino. Lovell’s father was reluctant to provide regular financial support
                     for his widow and child and both became part of Southey’s extended household. Lovell
                     and Southey were introduced by Sarah Fricker in Bristol in late 1793. Lovell was also
                     a poet, his <em>Bristol: a Satire</em> appeared in 1794, and he and Southey embarked on a period of collaboration: planning
                     two co-authored collections, only one of which was published under the pseudonyms
                     ‘Bion’ [Southey] and ‘Moschus’ [Lovell] in late 1794. Lovell was also involved in
                     the 1794 revisions to Southey’s <em>Joan of Arc</em>. The advent of Coleridge in summer–autumn 1794 seems to have led (at least temporarily)
                     to a reorientation of literary relationships. Lovell was pushed to the margins. His
                     contribution to <em>The Fall of Robespierre</em> was dropped and Coleridge was openly critical of his poetry. Lovell was, however,
                     involved in Pantisocracy and it was through him that Southey and Coleridge were introduced
                     to Joseph Cottle. After Lovell’s death, Southey tried — and failed — to produce a
                     subscription edition of his poems, to raise money for his widow and child. However,
                     Lovell’s writings were included in the <em>Annual Anthology</em> (1799 and 1800) and <em>Specimens of the Later English poets</em> (1807). In a notice published in <em>Literary Memoirs of Living Authors of Great Britain</em> (1798), David Rivers described Lovell’s poetry as being ‘entitled to considerable
                     distinction’. Southey described receiving the news of Lovell’s death as ‘the most
                     sudden check I ever experienced’. The full extent of their relationship is difficult
                     to gauge because of the survival of only two letters from what must have been an extensive
                     correspondence.</span></li>

                     he became lifelong friends. May went to Lisbon in 1793, in order to learn the family
                     trade, returning to England in 1796. May married Susannah Frances Livius in 1799.
                     The marriage produced four children. May and Southey met in Portugal in 1796. Their
                     friendship was to last until the latter’s death. May acted as a financial adviser
                     and agent to Southey, lending him money — including sums to finance Henry Herbert
                     Southey’s education — and purchasing goods on his behalf. Southey reciprocated when
                     May experienced a severe financial crisis in 1821 by lending him his life savings
                     of £620. May visited the Southeys on several occasions and acted as godfather to Southey’s
                     two eldest children — Margaret Edith (1802–1803) and Edith May (1803–1871), the latter

                     the Welsh language in the pages of the <em>Monthly Magazine</em>. Later in 1797, Southey consulted Pughe about details for his Welsh-American poem

                     at Guildford Grammar School (1781–1785) and Oxford (matric. Magdalen Hall, 1788, and
                     migrated to Lincoln College, BA 1792). After graduation he joined his father, who
                     had retired to live in Christchurch, Hampshire. Rickman worked as a private tutor
                     and read widely in economics. He edited the <em>Commercial, Agricultural and Manufacturer’s Magazine</em> (until 1801). In 1796 he wrote a private paper in which he argued for the benefits
                     to the nation of a census. George Rose, an M.P. for Christchurch, showed this to Charles
                     Abbot and in March 1801 the latter steered the census bill into law. Rickman was responsible
                     for the first four censuses (1801, 1811, 1821 and 1831) and paved the way for the
                     fifth (1841). In 1801 he became Abbot’s personal secretary whilst the latter was Chief
                     Secretary for Ireland. On Abbot’s election to the post of Speaker of the House of
                     Commons, Rickman became the Speaker’s secretary. In 1820 he became Clerk Assistant
                     to the Commons with a salary of £2500 per year. He married Susannah Postlethwaite
                     (d. 1836) in 1805. His friendship with Southey began at Burton in 1797 and endured
                     for the rest of their lives. Shortly after their first meeting, Southey described
                     him as ‘rough, coarse, well informed on all subjects, believing nothing, jacobinical’.
                     Later in life Rickman became high tory, anti-Malthusian and anti-semitic. He regularly
                     provided ideas and information (especially statistics) for Southey’s articles in the
                     <em>Quarterly Review</em> and authored the majority of Southey’s April 1818 <em>Quarterly</em> essay on the Poor Laws. Southey and Rickman planned to collaborate on a sequel to
                     the <em>Colloquies</em> (1829) but this was prevented by John Murray’s (1778–1843; <em>DNB</em>) financial problems.</span></li>

                     Southey’s close friend Edmund Seward in 1795 was followed by that of his brother John
                     (educated at St John’s College, Cambridge, MB 1795, and physician to the Worcester
                     infirmary) in December 1797. Some time afterwards, the eldest brother, William (a
                     lawyer, based in Ledbury, Herefordshire) shot himself. A fourth brother, whose name
                     Southey does not record, was a ‘mere farmer’ of a ‘methodistical turn’. Of the sisters,
                     one married Mr Severn (a clergyman) and two remained unmarried. In the mid 1790s,
                     Southey was on good terms with most — if not all — of the siblings and corresponded
                     with at least Edmund and one of the Seward sisters.</span></li>

                     Oxford (matric. 1789, BA 1793). Seward was one of Southey’s closest friends at Oxford,
                     and an important influence on him. An early enthusiast for Pantisocracy, Seward later
                     withdrew from the scheme and felt himself partly to blame for what he described as
                     ‘having contrived to bring [Southey] ... into ... a calamitous &amp; ruinous ... adventure,
                     from which I might at first perhaps have diverted him’. Southey was deeply shocked
                     by Seward’s death from a ‘fever’, and later addressed his elegy ‘To the Dead Friend’
                     to him. In a letter to James Montgomery, 6 May 1811, Southey recalled him as ‘an admirable
                     man in all things, whose only fault was that he was too humble ... In his company
                     my religious instincts were strengthened ... Sick of the college-chapel &amp; of the church,
                     we tried the meeting house, — &amp; there we were disgusted too. Seward left College,
                     meaning to take orders; — I who had the same destination, became a Deist after he

                     to send him to St Paul’s School did not work out. It is not certain where he was educated.
                     Southey despaired, noting ‘I never saw a lad with a better capacity or with habits
                     more compleatly bad’. Edward was to lead an increasingly rackety, disreputable life,
                     trying his hand at being a sailor, soldier and, eventually, a provincial actor.</span></li>

                     Robert Southey Senior, thus ensuring the latter’s imprisonment for debt in 1792, or
                     his nephews, to whom he left nothing in his Will. Southey visited his uncle in 1802,
                     describing his miserly existence to John May. In 1806, he recorded that his uncle
                     ‘had thanked God upon his death bed that he had cut me off’. Southey retaliated by

                     older half-sister, Elizabeth Tyler, with whom Southey spent a great deal of his childhood.
                     After the bankruptcy and death of her husband in 1792, Margaret moved to Bath, running
                     a boarding house in Westgate Buildings. Her continued financial difficulties — possibly
                     exacerbated by the extravagance of her half-sister — caused Southey great anxiety.

                     closest. Tom entered the navy as a midshipman at the age of 12, saw action in several
                     major battles of the French revolutionary wars (including Cape St Vincent and Copenhagen),
                     was captured on one occasion, wounded on several others, and was made a lieutenant
                     as reward for his bravery in the fight between <span class="ital">Mars</span> and <span class="ital">L’Hercule</span> on 21 April 1798. He made Captain in 1811, but never commanded a ship. After he retired
                     from the navy, he tried his hand at farming and as a customs officer. His last posting
                     was at Demerara, British Guiana, and he died on shipboard on the return voyage to
                     England. He married Sarah Castle in 1810 and produced a large family. Tom’s lack of
                     financial stability meant that some of the burden of supporting him fell on his brothers
                     Robert and Henry Herbert Southey. Tom’s knowledge of the navy and seafaring, and his
                     observations of foreign climes, provided important information for many of Southey’s
                     writings, including his poetry and <em>The Life of Nelson</em> (1813). Tom’s only publication was <em>A Chronological History of the West Indies</em> (1828), written with his brother Robert’s encouragement.</span></li>

                     into school rules and rituals) at Westminster School. During their schooldays, Strachey
                     (perhaps in response to the scandal surrounding <em>The Flagellant</em>) was one of many acquaintances who treated Southey ‘like a scabby sheep’, dropping
                     him. They were later only partially reconciled, but enough for Southey to commemorate
                     Strachey’s departure for India in 1798 with a sonnet (‘Fair be thy fortunes in the
                     distant land’) published in the <em>Morning Post</em>. Southey attempted to maintain their correspondence, but it had lapsed by April 1805
                     when he confessed that as Strachey had not replied to his letters, he would ‘not ...
                     write to him again, nor in any way force myself upon him.’</span></li>

He was also a prolific contributor to the <em>Annual Review, The Athenaeum, Monthly Magazine</em>, and <em>Monthly Review</em>. Southey and Taylor met in 1798, whilst the former was on a visit to Great Yarmouth,
                     where his brother Henry Herbert Southey was being tutored by George Burnett. Taylor
                     introduced Southey to his great friend Frank Sayers (1763–1817; <em>DNB</em>) — whose 1792 collection <em>Poems</em> had influenced Southey’s early work — and also to radical and dissenting circles
                     in Norwich. Taylor gave Southey the idea for the <em>Annual Anthology</em> and was an acute, if frequently blunt, critic of his work. From 1803–1804, he edited
                     the Norwich newspaper <em>The Iris</em>, to which Southey contributed poetry. Southey described Taylor as ‘one of the three
                     great men of my acquaintance ... the more I know him and the longer I know him, the

                     then spent on living the high life. Her extravagance was a source of great worry to
                     her relatives, in particular her half-brother Herbert Hill. Elizabeth Tyler was painted
                     by Joshua Reynolds and moved in cultural circles in Bath and Bristol, counting amongst

                     letters to John May. Southey quarrelled with his aunt over his relationship with Edith
                     Fricker and involvement in Pantisocracy, and on a wet night in 1794 she threw him
                     out. They never saw or spoke to one another again. Southey later speculated that Elizabeth
                     Tyler, whose grandmother had died ‘in confinement’, suffered from a form of insanity,
                     noting that ‘her habitual violence of temper is now increased by long indulgence absolutely
