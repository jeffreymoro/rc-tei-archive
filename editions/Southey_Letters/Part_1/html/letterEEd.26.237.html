                  — to make the Maid relate her knowledge of her own death to Conrade Book 4<sup>th</sup>. to alter the discovery of the arms, so as to reduce the story as much as possible
                  to a moral miracle, there is too much clock-work in it now. I would therefore if possible
                  omit the miraculous healing of Dunois but I have no idea yet how to alter the beginning
                  if this be done. the new ninth book will be the detachment of Burgundy from the English
                  interest by the Maid, which of course will be made <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xx</span> essential to the success of the whole. I annihilate all Isabels similies, because
                  country girls are not addicted to them. my verbal alterations will be numberless.

               <p>My Tragedy would advance rapidly if I stole time enough, for I have both brain &amp; back-bone
                  full of ideas for it. it comes on very slowly. of the three acts one is about three
                  parts finished. One fortnight given heartily to it would be enough &amp; then three months
                  correction would make it better than a seven years writing. The Maids martyrdom seems
                  almost a necessary supplement to the poem, &amp; the subject suits me. but if I had not
                  other employment than poetry I should scarcely venture upon the drama. I can manage
                  the Epic better, &amp; that has every dramatic advantage if well handled. perhaps Tassos

                  it, independant of their unequalld &amp; perhaps <span class="ital">unequalable</span> merit. But I will &lt;not&gt; allow this to Virgil. his story never can interest, &amp; this
                  is a grievous fault. I read all the obscure epic writers I can lay my hands on. there
                  is one advantage which a dull book possesses, no good thing is lost — like the dunghill
                  diamond you are sure to see it shine — or more like a farthing candle in a dark night.
                  These writers are sad imitators — I might say thieves, for I believe privately borrowing
