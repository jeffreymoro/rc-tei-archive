               <div class="salute">My dear Grosvenor</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter reached me this morning. before I proceed to reply to the objections you
               raise, tis necessary to mention my reasons <span style="text-decoration: line-through">for</span> for wishing a situation apparently so opposite to my education &amp; temper. To the church
               I have many &amp; insuperable objections. upon every religious system I deny the necessity
               of an etablished faith, &amp; of a religious establishment. upon my own principles I doubt
               (to say the least) the system my friends destine me to support. &amp; the hope of content
               in life would induce me to avoid a prospect which leads to starving in creditable
               celibacy upon 40 pounds a year. such are the reasons that militate against my taking
               orders. to this I am destined. but two years &amp; a half must intervene before I could
               forfeit my integrity &amp; self applause for so paltry an income — &amp; two years of dependance
               to one who already feels &amp; knows himself burthensome to his relations is a long &amp;
               dreadful period — in no other profession is there a possibility of my engaging. one
               only way remains to rid myself of such a melancholy view — by procuring some certainty
               in London which may afford a plausible cause for my residence there &amp; enable me by
               my own efforts to exist in expectation of future affluence. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> I will be sincere. there is no alternative I will not prefer to taking orders. I
               may forfeit happiness but God forbid that I should ever cease to deserve it.</p>
            <p class="indent1">the obstacles you alledge have in no ways altered my determination. is it better that
               I should suffer inconvenience myself or let my friends suffer it for me? is six hours
               misery to be preferred to wretchedness of the whole 24? <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> I have only one alternative. some such situation or emigration. tis not the sally
               of a momentary frenzy that says this. either in six months I fix myself in some honest
               means of living or I quit my country — my friends — &amp; every fondest hope I indulge,
               for ever. I may be wretched but never will I be a villain.</p>
            <p class="indent1">what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> can do for me he will. he approves most highly of the system I have adopted. the
               official situation is more an object of temporary convenience than future necessity.
               I want an obvious reason for abandoning Oxford &amp; a certainty of existence till my
               own ability allow me to marry. till I have a compentency twere absurd to think of
               marriage — when I have it twere criminal to think otherwise. my dear friend I both
               hope &amp; fear that the destiny of another depends on mine. tis easy to live on hope.
               but if despair be my food I will feed on it in a country where neither my name nor
               life can be known &amp; where in the society of mechanics I may gradually forget that
               I was ever qualified for or accustomed to a higher situation.</p>
            <p class="indent1">were I once settled in London I have not the smallest doubt of success. my abilities
               are only fixd in the principle of Justice. in application they are versatile. I can
               turn them from one species of composition to another &amp; experience tells me that my
               success is the same in all. I am above vanity — but I despise the affectation of modest
               Falshood. — pause for one moment &amp; reflect on my situation. I am &lt;at&gt; present burthensome
               to my friends &amp; weary of my own reflections — worn out with anxiety &amp; sensibly impaired
               by the ceaseless agitation that preys upon me. this state can only end in taking orders.
               on the contrary I have a possibility (&amp; but a possibility) of enjoying the company
               of my dearest friend &amp; by following my favourite pursuit of ultimately attaining my
               fondest wishes. the alternative is labour obscurity &amp; emigration. a solitary life
               embittered by remembrance — &amp; a premature death unalleviated by one comfortable reflection.</p>
            <p class="indent1">do not believe that I can shrink from even this prospect. &amp; do not my dear friend
               be sorry that I express myself so strongly. you see how I am situated &amp; tis yours
               to judge how I should act. I know my existence here distresses my relations. think
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> on the hours of anguish which that knowledge must occasion — &amp; judge if any alternative
               be not preferable.</p>

                  </div> I have little expectation therefrom. less indeed than I like to allow even to myself.
                  but my determination is made &amp; while that determination appears founded upon Justice

               happy — &amp; how probable it is that the very reverse must happen — my soul saddens at
