            <p class="indent1">Experience is &lt;said to be&gt; the Mother of Wisdom — I have been married to Experience
               nearly two years, &amp; if little Wisdom be not come yet the connection will be a barren
               one. of every event that has occurred to me I think I can behold the optimism, nothing
               less than the disappointment of my most ardent wishes, &amp; the villainy of the man I
               most trusted could have mellowed down that enthusiasm of disposition almost tottering
               on frenzy. nor should I have known what my own mind is capable of, if all its energies
               had not been put in requisition by the omnipotence of Necessity. when I left you in
               London my hopes were centred in the wilds of America. I had devoted myself to the
               establishment of a system which I still believe to be the panacea of all human calamities,
               &amp; &lt;in the future completion of which&gt; I expect a promised millennium, but in the ardent
               perception of the end — I glanced rapidly over the means.</p>
