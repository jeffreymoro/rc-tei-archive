               <p>with regard to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</a> affairs <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a> has no reason to think me inattentive or neglectful. I could indeed have advised her
                  to quit her present situation, but <span style="text-decoration: line-through">of</span> what <span style="text-decoration: line-through">avail</span> would that advice have availed, barren of assistance as it must have been? — it would
                  have been like advising a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">debtor</span> sick prisoner to change the air. as to my reserve towards him — here indeed he is
                  justly displeased. I do not wish to excuse or palliate what I know to have &lt;been&gt;
                  wrong. yet there &lt;were&gt; many powerful motives that occasioned this. a young man easily
                  opens his heart to those of his own age who are endeared to him by a real or imagined
                  similarity of sentiment; but the same feelings that in that case induce a hasty &amp;
                  credulous confidence, occasion a reserve towards those of whose approbation he is
                  doubtful. I had informed <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a> by letter, before he thought of taking me abroad with him, of all my future expectations.
                  I could not enter upon this subject in conversing with him, because I had frustrated
                  all his plans for me. I feard he would disapprove my plan of making a book, when my
                  knowledge must necessarily be so little of the subject — but that I should make a
                  book was absolutely necessary to my support. I would have sent him the manuscript,
                  &amp; wished to do it; but I had a Counsellor more importunate than wisdom, “malesuada
                  Fames”,

                  that I have written incorrectly. I could develope to you the motives for every part
                  of my conduct, but this were useless. I have written to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a> without reserve; henceforth he shall have no cause for displeasure</p>

            <p class="indent1">Of your friendly offer of assistance I have fortunately now no need. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</a> affairs will now I hope be settled. I am very anxious to have her live with me, it

I thank you likewise for what you tell me respecting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a>; I was never with him a fortnight, till my journey to Lisbon; by letter I had always
               been unreserved towards him, but there <span style="text-decoration: line-through">is</span> were a thousand causes to prevent the confidence of unembarrassed conversation. all
               this I hope is over, I have followed your advice in my letter as closely as was possible,
               &amp; said every thing for the past as well as for the present. I can write to him with
               pleasure now that I have a subsistence, &amp; am embarked in a profession which promises

                  </div> is a worthless wicked man &amp; behaves very unkindly &amp; insolently to Tom because he thinks
                  him friendless. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> has that proud spirit which every man who knows his own conduct to be irreproachable
                  ought to have. I respect him as much as I love him — he received ten pounds prize
                  money only a few weeks ago, &amp; sent half of it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">his mother</a>. how little my friend are acts of private virtue known or rewarded in this world!
                  the Jews ought to have been a very good people because their rewards were temporal.
                  I feel very angry at reflecting that such a life as my brothers should be at the mercy
                  of a sea captain. it is not many months since he was sent to board a <span style="text-decoration: line-through">prize</span> vessel in such weather that the boat must inevitably have sunk in attempting to reach
                  her — &amp; yet he could not refuse or remonstrance, &amp; would have perished if a Lieutenant
                  with him had not ordered them to give over the attempt. this is called discipline.
                  there was no man on board his vessel would have risqued his life in the leaky prize
                  for the prize money <span style="text-decoration: line-through">they</span> &lt;he&gt; might share. if <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> had brought her into port his share would not have exceeded five guineas, but the
                  Captains would have been considerable, &amp; his loss nothing if those he sent on board
                  had been drowned. I have made application to have my brother removed to another ship.
                  tis a horrible life. I had rather associate with the Botany Bay colonists than with
                  the crew of a man of war. Some of the Swedenbourgians <span style="text-decoration: line-through">have</span> believe that every man will meet the kind of heaven he imagined in the next world,
                  &amp; that the enjoyment of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">this</span> &lt;it&gt; will be <span style="text-decoration: line-through">their</span> &lt;his&gt; hell till <span style="text-decoration: line-through">they are</span> &lt;he is&gt; fully sensible of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">their</span> &lt;his&gt; error &amp; has<span style="text-decoration: line-through">e</span> learnt to form the wish of wisdom. I wonder what strange place they allot for sailours!
                  they have every thing good to learn, &amp; what is the more difficult task, a great deal
                  to forget. the ancients had a comfortable fiction in their waters of Lethe
