               <p><span class="date">Monday morning</span> — A female scout at Christ Church, only fifteen, has lately delivered herself &amp; strangled
                  the child. what adds to the horror of the circumstance is that her own mother is the
                  only witness. the girl they say is remarkably handsome. I heard this story related
                  at dinner yesterday, &amp; you cannot imagine the effect it had upon me. the situation
                  of the father immediately occurred; for surely one whom the fear of shame carried
                  to such dreadful lengths could not easily have been seduced. nothing is more astonishing
                  to me than that a virtue so rigidly demanded from woman should be so despised among
                  men. Gillies

               of interruption from college. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> I purpose studying physic. innumerable &amp; insuperable objections appeard to divinity
               — surely the profession I have chosen affords at least as many opportunities of benefitting
               mankind. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</a> says no &amp; spoke of the efficacy of prayer. suppose you &amp; I <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LightfootNicholas">Lightfoot</a> resided in the same village as priest &amp; apothecary. a labouring man with a wife &amp;
               family is dangerously ill. who renders him the most essential service — you in talking
               of heaven &amp; closing his eyes in peace, or I in restoring him to the world &amp; giving
               him time to prepare for death?</p>
            <p class="indent1">in this country a liberal education precludes the man of no fortune from independance
               in the humbler lines of life — he may either turn man butcher, or embrace one of three
               professions in all of which there is too much quackery — Law is of all others the
               most unpleasant — the lawyer lives by the vices &amp; follies of his neighbours, blows
               up the coals of discord, &amp; when the fuel is spent is paid for quenching it. a honest
               well-minded attorney might be of service to mankind, but he must be independent of
               his profession in order to be honest &amp; well-minded, &amp; must consider it his duty rather
               to reconcile enemies than to provoke friends. but before Law can become justice —
               a mighty change must be effected in order to simplify it — the voluminous lumber of
               tautology must either be burnt or shut up in some sepulchre, a monument of human folly,
               &amp; the few eternal &amp; immutable laws of justice, with the few that originate from society
               be collected in one volume that every individual may carry the law of his life in
               his pocket, &amp; judge for himself.</p>
            <p class="indent1">in all this <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> I see nothing very visionary, or indeed anyway impossible. the absurd custom of paying
               attorneys in proportion to the number of words &amp; lines, has introduced that tautology
               &amp; barbarism so disgustingly perplexing — Law as it is disgraces justice — as it should
               be &amp; as it may be it becomes simple &amp; useful.</p>
            <p class="indent1">it were easy to point out innumerable objections to divinity, — but there is one sufficiently
               obstinate at the threshold. the oaths of this you will form a proper estimate, &amp; tell
               me whether or no with my principles it were just to enter into orders — to undertake
               teaching morality &amp; virtue &amp; begin my pastoral charge by perjury.</p>

               <p>in fact there was no alternative when these ideas had weight. the army I never thought
                  of. to physic I see no objection. the study itself enlarges the mind &amp; the practice
                  affords more opportunities of serving society than any other profession. very soon
                  shall I commence my anatomical &amp; chemical studies. when well grounded in these, I
                  hope to study under Cruikshanks

               &amp; that I must conform more to its manners. but these imaginary inconveniences are
               amply balanced by the various agreable circumstances.</p>
            <p class="indent1">this resolution has relieved me from a weight that hung heavy upon my mind &amp; embittered
               many hours. I am inclined to think morality &amp; active virtue will do — nor were it
               difficult to prove this — but the human mind is as yet incapable of the pure speculations
               of philosophical justice.</p>
