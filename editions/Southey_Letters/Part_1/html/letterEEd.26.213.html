                  a business at which every body is astonished, for how such a body of such people could
                  so have concerted &amp; carried into execution a well organized mutiny is incomprehensible.
                  where its effects will end too — is difficult to guess; for as all authority depends
                  upon the opinion the governed entertain of the power of the governors, when they discover
                  that the power is in their own hands, the very foundation of <span style="text-decoration: line-through">gov xx</span> subordination, &amp; consequently of authority must be shaken.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">As I have no business in London (except indeed to dine at Grays Inn once at the latter
               end of June) till November, we intend spending the summer &amp; autumn somewhere by the
               sea. where is not yet determined, but most probably somewhere in Hampshire &amp; this
               you will learn from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a>. we go about the middle of May — &amp; it will shorten your journey to see us. London
               is a place for which I entertain a most hearty hatred, &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> likes it as little as myself — &amp; as for the sea — I like it very much when on shore.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I had a letter from Lisbon yesterday. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncles</a> family has been very unfortunate. his poor old woman is dead, &amp; so is his dog Linda.
                  his mare who was lame he had given away to be turned into the woods — she has not
                  been seen lately — &amp; he thinks the wolves have eat her. twas an account that made
                  me melancholy — I had been long enough an inhabitant of his house to become attached
                  to every thing connected with it — &amp; poor old Ursula

                  again without some feelings of regret. my letter was from my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</a>, now an inmate of my Uncles. I have learnt from other quarters that my Uncle is made
                  Chaplain to our troops there.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">My acquaintance here are more than are convenient — &amp; I meet with invitations unpleasant
               to refuse &amp; still more unpleasant to accept. this is another motive to me to wish
               for a country residence as long as possible. I find the distances in this foul city
               very inconvenient — tis a mornings work to call upon a distant friend — &amp; I return
               from it thoroughly fatigued. We are going to dine on Wednesday next with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WollstonecraftMary">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, of all the literary characters the one I most admire. my curiosity is fully satisfied,
               &amp; the greater part of these people after that wish is satisfied leave no other remaining.
               this is not the case with her — she is a first rate woman — sensible of her own worth,
               but altogether without arrogance or affectation.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have two reasons for preferring a residence near the sea. I love to pickle myself
                  in that grand brine tub — &amp; I wish to catch its morning evening &amp; mid day appearances
                  for poetry, with the effect of every change of weather. fancy will do much — but the
                  Poet ought to be an accurate observer of nature — &amp; I [MS torn] shall watch the clouds
                  &amp; the rising &amp; setting sun &amp; [MS torn] the sea birds with no inattentive eye. I have
                  remedied one of my deficiencies too since a boy — &amp; learnt to swim enough to like
                  the exercise. this I began at Oxford &amp; practised a good deal in the summer of 1795
                  at Baptist Mills.

                  </div> — a glorious spot. I have no idea of sublimity exceeding it. I would wish my destiny
                  fixed to settle ultimately in England. a fickle climate — &amp; a system of increasing
