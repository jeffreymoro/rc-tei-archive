                  the ground on which I build my principles. if virtue be sought for in the present
                  system of things it must be for its own sake &amp; its reward as being most pure is likewise

                  the philosophers but more I believe to the conscious dignity of independance. where
                  abilities command more respect than wealth or titles — &amp; virtue is more honourd than
                  a long pedigree, it is morally impossible that the mercenary motives should prevail.
