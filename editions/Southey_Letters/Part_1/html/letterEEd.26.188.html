               when a young man, he wrote eclogues, and a comedy, in praise of the Grand Inquisitor;
               and a pastoral, in honour of the duke of Alva. From these symptoms, one who knew the
               human heart might have prophesied, that the young poet never would attain to excellence.
               The Dutch idea of bartering his verses could not have entered the mind of the enthusiast:
               the young enthusiast carefully conceals his feelings from observation, and he who

               usually been employed on the weak and the wicked, on those whom we despise and detest;
               but, among the villains whose deeds pollute the page of history, the duke of Alva
               ranks in the first class. This man united in himself the bigotry of the priest, the
               duplicity of the politician, and the brutality of the soldier; and to this man did
               Lope de Vega write a pastoral! Arcadia and the duke of Alva! Madness never produced

                  it a witty and ingenious composition; it displays, however, little ingenuity, and
                  less wit. The poet tells the Flea where he goes, and what he feeds upon, and calls
                  him a greater Turk than Amurath, because he spares nobody.

               honours as of days. If not the best of poets, he was the most fortunate; the wealth
               he acquired rendered him happy in life, and the use he made of it cheered him in death.
               He died honoured by the great, celebrated by the learned, and regretted by the poor.
               His reputation still flourishes in his own country; and though the impartial judgment
               of foreigners cannot rank his productions above mediocrity, let it be remembered,
               that he never was excelled in industry as an author, or in liberality as a man.</p>
