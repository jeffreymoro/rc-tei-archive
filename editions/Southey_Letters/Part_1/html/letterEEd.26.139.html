            <p class="indent1">Bedford — the week is over. I am at Bath — &amp; have left for six long months — <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">my wife</a>. —</p>
            <p class="indent1">On Saturday morning the ceremony was performed with the utmost privacy — the day was
               very melancholy. my <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> returned home at night, &amp; I slept as usual at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottles</a>. the next &lt;day&gt; we parted.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Why am I going abroad — I ask myself the same question — &amp; can to return no answer
                  — but that it is to please <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a>. when I have found out the reason myself, you shall know. why did I marry — do you
                  ask? it is <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> a satisfaction to myself — if the tongue of malice should whisper that I have forsaken
                  her (&amp; calumny has been busy with me) there is now an answer that will make it dumb.
                  &amp; what is more of consequence — if I should not return alive — she has a claim upon
                  the protection of those I am now satisfying — for the “bitter little that would then
                  be left of life.”

            <p class="indent1">mutually did we press each others hand &amp; parted in silence. the moment I had left
               her I burst into tears. she still keeps her own name — for it may not be convenient
               for us to live together immediately upon my return.</p>
            <p class="indent1">God bless you. tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> this — &amp; remember me to him — we go hence on Thursday. — &amp; I hope that in spite of
