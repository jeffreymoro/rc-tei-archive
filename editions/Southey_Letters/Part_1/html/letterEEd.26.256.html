               in 1807. In the sixth chapter of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547–1616), <em>Don Quixote</em> (1605–1615), the curate declares: ‘let this Palm of England be cared for and preserved,
               as a thing singular in its kind, and let a casket be made for it, like that which
               Alexander found among the spoils of Darius, and destined to keep in it the work of
