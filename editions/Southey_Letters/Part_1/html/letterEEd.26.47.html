                  parts of my life which I would desire to relive it should be my Worcestershire journey
                  — to one who goes for fashion or to a fète or to a hunting box it may appear ridiculous
                  but to him whose philosophy proceeds from nature &amp; the heart the case is different.
                  I was absent but three weeks — yet three ages in this sink of science could not erase
                  the ideas resulting from it (nor were that possible) supply the vacancy. Evesham Abbey
                  was the only spot memorable from accidental occurrences which I visited — a clear
                  brook an extensive prospect a woody glen or a rising spring were more frequently the
                  objects of my pilgrimage &amp; where I let my Fancy stray more at will. I meant to have
                  concluded this letter in a spot the most romantic I ever recollect to have seen —
                  that intention was never executed &amp; memory must supply the picture. a spring <span style="text-decoration: line-through">rushing</span> dropping over a rock which it had made amid the wood — thro a narrow opening in the
                  wood a cascade caused by the dissolving snow — a brook between so clear so broken

                  much has been said of the depravity of mankind by authors &amp; in the moment of discontent
                  I have accorded to their sentiments — but those who live in that hot bed of iniquity
                  London, or that nursery of debauchery an English University are not qualified to judge
                  — if observation may be depended upon there are men buried in retirement neither unworthy
