                  that within a fortnight after the dreadful death of his mother, the head of his office
                  at the India house almost turned him out of the room because he had not shaved! assuredly
                  I fear that if Society had not very bad materials to work upon, it could not produce
                  the beings it does. but physical evil is in great part produced by moral evil, the
                  germ of existence is cankered oftentimes, &amp; the sins of the father are indeed visited
                  upon the children. that all moral evil may be removed may, I think, be deduced from
                  all we know of the nature of the human mind, &amp; of the attributes of the Creator. Atheism
                  were piety to the belief that God can have made one being necessarily &amp; irremediably
                  bad. but surely Society is so constituted as to encourage every evil propensity. the
                  straight path of rectitude is rugged &amp; difficult &amp; every possible allurement used
                  to draw us from the painful way. it is most like a whitened sepulchre. Go to the haunts
                  of amusement; to the evening fire side of affluence what so gay so happy as civilized
                  society? <span style="text-decoration: line-through">return</span> &lt;go&gt; to the streets of London what so wretched! the Crisis is approaching, &amp; tho I

                  I love his poetry because it is wholly written from the heart. in a world such as

                  of a wise man to check &amp; regulate them, to become despotic over his own mind. I am
                  fond of great part of the Stoical system, &amp; there are few characters that I contemplate
                  with more reverence than the slave Epictetus.
