            <p class="indent1">I should be sorry my dear Lightfoot were all intercourse between you &amp; I to cease.
               during two years of my existence, &amp; those not the most unimportant, I cannot look
               back upon myself without remembring you. my intercourse with most men has been embittered
               by their follies or their faults, from you I recollect only acts of kindliness, during
               the whole of our intimacy. one &amp; he the best of us, is in a better world, methinks
               the common friendship of poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</a> is a tie which should not be broken. I have a silver pencil from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Sewardfamily">his brother</a> for you, which he desired me to keep till an opportunity of sending it offered. were
               I within fifty miles of you I would bring it myself.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am here for a short &lt;time&gt; only with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a>. my place of abode is London, but as I live in lodgings there I can give you no direction.
               I have been a member of Greys Inn for twelve-months, shall go to a Special Pleaders
               Office after Christmas, &amp; probably enter into that line<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> of business for myself the following year. — add to this that I &amp; Edith are as well
               &amp; as happy as you could wish us, (save only that I have no children) &amp; you know all
               that concerns me. I have no wants for the present, no fears for the future. had a
               country life fallen to my lot I should have liked it better, but of the circumstances
               that make up comfort place is the least important — &amp; I shall always be able to escape
               to green fields during the long vacation.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will be pleased to hear that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George Burnett</a> is comfortably settled as minister to an Unitarian congregation at Yarmouth in Norfolk.
               he was to have passed some weeks with us in Hampshire (where we spent the summer in
               an out-of-the-way village near the sea) but the congregation invited him there, so
               that it is now fourteen months since we have seen each other. I hear from him frequently.
               every body loves him. he is the same as you knew him, but you will allow one who is
               an Unitarian himself, to say that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BurnettGeorge">George</a> has theological learning enough to puzzle the whole bench of bishops.</p>
