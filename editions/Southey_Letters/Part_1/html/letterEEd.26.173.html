                  so dirtily distinguished. At that period laced cloaths were worn, and he was fond
                  of appearing in a showy suit. It is strange that men of genius should so frequently
                  wish to render themselves singular by their appearance, either by becoming slovens,
                  or, like Chatterton and Gray,
