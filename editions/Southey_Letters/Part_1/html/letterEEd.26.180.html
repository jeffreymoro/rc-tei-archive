               <p>Boscan himself tells us, in his dedication to the duchess de Soma, that it was by
                  the advice of Andres Nabagero, the Venetian ambassador, that he introduced Italian
                  metres and Italian taste into the Castilian poetry. “We were conversing together at
                  Grenada (says he) upon literary subjects, and particularly upon the difference of
                  languages, when he observed to me, that in the Castilian tongue we had never attempted
                  sonnets, and other kinds of composition used by the best authors of Italy; and he
                  not only said this to me, but urged me to set the example. A few days afterwards,
                  I departed for my home, and musing upon many things during the long and solitary journey,
                  frequently thought upon what Nabagero had advised: and thus I began to attempt this
                  kind of verse. At first I found some difficulty, because it is very complex (<span class="ital">muy artificioso</span>) and has many peculiarities different from our own: afterwards, from the partiality
                  we naturally feel towards our own productions, I thought that I had succeeded well,
                  and gradually grew warm and eager in the pursuit. This, however, would not have been
                  sufficient to stimulate me to proceed, had not Garcilaso encouraged me, whose judgment,
                  not only in my opinion, but in that of the whole world, is esteemed as a certain rule.”

                  a pipe, is quite as unnatural as one of the cannibal giants of romance, and infinitely
                  less agreeable as a companion by the fire-side. The Spanish Parnassus is very much
                  infested by these gentry, and they are equally troublesome on the Portuguese side

            <p class="indent1">“Nature has hidden in rough shells, at the bottom of the sea, those pearls to which
               man has affixed such value; she has hidden that gold with which our souls are fettered,
               in the bowels of the earth, amid barbarous nations, and in distant countries: she
               has guarded the sea with rocks, and sown it with dangers, to place boundaries to our
               desires, and lengthen the period of our lives: but Evil, to deprive us of our tranquillity,
               laid open these secrets, and hid from us the true knowledge where real tranquillity
               is to be found. Then did this malignant spirit disfigure the shepherds with coarse
               vile garments, and represent their life of contentment as a life of mean and despicable
               labour; and by these magical delusions were we taught to despise the only treasure
               which the earth affords to render the mind happy: but when this fascination is removed,
               and we see things clearly, how much more beautiful appear the various colours with
               which the fields are apparelled, and the trees, and the sun, and the horizon beautiful
               when he sets, than all the deceitful trappings of Vanity! How much more delightful
               to our ears is the song of innocent birds, than the sound of flattering tongues, that
               endeavour to entrap our reason! Is not the rock that hangs over the stream, in whose
               caverns the birds dwell, and under whose shade the fishes sport, more to be admired
               than the sumptuous and superb edifice, that cannot so well resist the force of the
               tempest, or the secret sap of time? Where can life pass more delightfully or more
               tranquilly than among the flocks and herds? How much more secure is the enjoyment
               of these than the hopes of the court, and the deceits of the city! And if we have
               so often sighed for that happy age of gold, it is for this advantage, exceeding all
               others, that men lived then like shepherds, and followed their flocks, and cultivated
               the earth: and this truth is clearly proved; for the first man whom God created held
               this office, and the title which God gave him, was that of lord of the animal world;
               and Abel, the first martyr, in whom the church began, and the other children of Adam,
               tended their flocks: so likewise did Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob with his beloved
               Rachel, and Esau; Joseph and his brethren were shepherds, as they confessed to Pharaoh.
               Moses and Zipporah, Saul and David, kings of Israel, and Mesa, king of Moab, had executed
               this honourable office; and king Cyrus had exercised it among the ancient Persians.
               Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, with Faustulus, who educated them, kept sheep;
               and among those valiant Romans, the fame of whose exploits has echoed over the world,
               we read of many whose names discover their origin, such as the Vituli, the Vitellii,
               the Porcii, the Capri, the Tauri and the Bubulci. Many persons have risen to the highest
               dignities, from the pastoral state: Giges, king of Lydia; Sophy, king of the Turks;
               Primislaus, king of Bohemia; Tamerlane, emperor of the Scythians; Justin, emperor
               of the Romans; Viriatus, captain of the Portuguese; and Sixtus the first, the Roman
               pontiff: and, in truth, what is the life of a shepherd, but the similitude of empire?
               but a system of government, with moderation and mildness? For what can be more similar
               to the government of a kingdom than the management of a flock? To defend them from
               wild beasts, to secure them from robbers, to guide them to good pastures, cool shades,
               and clear waters; to threaten them with his voice, to chastise with the crook those
               who stray; to amuse them with the pipe and with the song, to cure them with herbs
               when they are sick; to be clothed with their wool, to feed upon their milk, and thus
               to pass peaceably through life? Among the vain deities whom the blinded Gentiles worshipped,
               Apollo, Mercury, Daphne, and Pan, and Proteus, and Paris, and Polyphemus, were shepherds;
               and the true God whom we serve, is frequently styled a shepherd, in the holy Scriptures;
               so ancient and so honourable is the pastoral life, which the avarice of men has now
               made despicable!</p>
            <p class="indent1">“Much knowledge is certainly necessary for a shepherd; an acquaintance with the nature
               of soils and pastures, the virtues of herbs, the changes of weather, the movements
               of the heavenly bodies, the effects of the sun, and the qualities of animals; and
               this life, though the most quiet, produces in its employments all things necessary
               for our subsistence: wool, milk, skins, the flesh of animals, herbs, grain, fruit.
               What life, then, can be more delightful than the pastoral life? or what prejudice
               can be greater than that which denies this truth?</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>“What style can be more conformable to reason, or less vitiated, than the simple style
                  of the shepherd? and therefore is it that the ancient writers have delivered their
                  precepts in the pastoral language, as being most pure and natural. Under this allegory,
                  Solomon veiled the mysteries of our faith, in his Songs to his beloved; instructing
                  us, by his lofty theme, and by a strain of poetry as sublime in itself, as it is humble
                  in its similitude; which example alone would be sufficient, with the men of this age,
                  to dignify pastoral productions. In this style the Greeks and Romans, and the Italians,
                  the Spaniards, and our Portuguese, have written works, many in number, and rare in
                  quality; marvellous works, to enumerate which would be another new undertaking! Therefore,
                  curious reader, I present to you the manners and language of shepherds, as the true

                  Albanio now talks in his sleep and Salicio interrupts and wakes him. He now requests
                  him to relate his history, and Albanio tells a very long story of his being the intimate
                  friend of a young female relation, with whom he used to hunt; how he one day told
                  his love; she left him, and he is dying with despair. After they are gone out, Camille
