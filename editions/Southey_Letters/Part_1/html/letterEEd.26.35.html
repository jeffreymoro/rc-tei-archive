            <p class="indent2">I hoped to have seen you before this day. that hope like most of mine is disappointed.
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a> is now in heaven. on Monday week I attended him to the grave. who knows but my next
               visit thither may be final — I ought to have written to you before but the subject
               was painful &amp; you will excuse me. he had been long declining. evident however as this
               was I still deceived myself. when I passed thro Bath to Oxford I staid at my fathers
               &amp; saw him in his bed — he prest my hand with affection &amp; for the only time in his
               life blest me. why it was I know not but it struck me that I never should see him
               more. I never did. in a better world I shall.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Of this no more — the subject is painful to me &amp; cannot be agreable to you. to his
               loss I am resigned. I am even thankful for it when I consider how grievous a burden
               is a heart opprest by injustice &amp; misfortune. our meeting you see is thus deferrd
               &amp; the melancholy silence of sorrow wears away with me that season appropriated to
               festivity. I have however resources in my own reflexions &amp; solitude I have never found
               irksome — one book succeeds another — I take the pen for relaxation &amp; at least possess
               negative happiness.</p>

                  </div> of all this more by Tuesday. my letter shall reach you then. are you in any of these
                  tremendous associations? our church wardens have devised a curious test all loyal
                  subjects are desird to sign their names to an address. such is their artifice that
                  to my knowledge they made a child of ten years old write his name. thus they mean
                  to know those who believe not in the divine right &amp;c. never shall the name of your
                  friend be prostituted so basely.&gt;
