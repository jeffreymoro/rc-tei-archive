            <p class="indent1">My dear friend I sincerely thank you for your letter. its contents are strange &amp; I
               am inclined to think when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a> blamed me for not doing my utmost to relieve my family he must have alluded to my
               repeated refusal of entering into orders; a step which undoubtedly &lt;would&gt; have almost
               instantly relieved them &amp; which occasioned me great anguish &amp; many conflicts of mind.
               To this I have been urged by him &amp; by <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a>, but you know what my religious opinions are, &amp; I need not ask you whether I did
               rightly &amp; honestly in refusing.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Till Xmas last I supported myself wholly by the profits of my writings. when I left
               Lisbon I had thirty pounds from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a>, of which a large part was expended in paying my passage &amp; the journey home. When
               my determination was made not to enter into the church I instantly quitted the University,
               that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a> might no longer be inconvenienced by me. I applied for a clerks place in a public
               office &amp; my republican principles occasioned my ill success. at this time my acquaintance
               with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> commenced; I had all the enthusiasm which a young man of strong feeling &amp; an acute
               sense of right &amp; wrong can possess, &amp; resolved to go to America &amp; attempt to establish
               a better system. we hoped to raise a sum sufficient amongst us, &amp; I had then expectations
               that the reversion of a family estate might be sold, which has since proved worth
               nothing. wild as the plan was it wanted not plausibility &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> would have gone with us had it taken place. at the end of 1794 I found myself disappointed
               in this; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> with whom I had previously lived had turned me out of her doors; &amp; I would not be
               burthensome to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> tho my quitting her was against her wishes. I went to Bristol to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> &amp; supported myself &amp; almost him I may say, for what my labours earned were as four
               to one. I gave lectures, I wrote indefatigably. nor is there one single action of
               this whole period that I would wish undone.</p>
            <p class="indent1">One <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">friend</a> I had, only one, willing &amp; able to serve me; but he had not the power till he was
               of age. in the summer of 1795 <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a>, as you know, came to England, he urged me very strongly to take orders. my heart
               was heavily afflicted: my literary resources were exhausted, &amp; it was yet a year &amp;
               half before my friend could assist me, &amp; you will believe &lt;me&gt; when I say that my
               spirit could but ill brook dependance. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I</span> Add to this that my opinion of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">S T Coleridge</a> was not what it had been, for by long living with him I knew much of his character
               now. I gave him <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncles</a> letter when it arrived &amp; told him I knew not what I ought to do. I wrote to my friend
               — he strongly advised me against the church &amp; recommended the Law when he could enable
               me to pursue it. after some days I followed this advice; our <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxxx xx xxxx</span> finances no longer suffered us to remain at Bristol as we had done, we removed as
               we had before agreed, I to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</a>, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">&amp; bef</span> our arrears were paid with twenty guineas which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> advanced as the copy right price of the poems which were published not till after
               my return from Lisbon. during all this <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge</a> was to all appearance as he had ever been towards me — but I discovered that he had
               been employing every possible calumny against me &amp; representin me as a villain.</p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mothers</a> was now my home, but I was more frequently with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a>, &amp; with a mind agitated by so many feelings did I compose the greater part of Joan
               of Arc. when this was nearly compleated <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a> asked me to go abroad with him. I consented, &amp; married the morning of my departure.
               this too requires some explanation. I had never avowed a<span style="text-decoration: line-through">n</span> long formed attachment till the prospect of settling in America made me believe it
               justifiable. I placed <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> during my absence with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Cottlefamily">Cottles sister</a>, who keep a school, as one of their family, &amp; it was not proper that she should be
               supported by me except as my wife. the remainder of what Joan of Arc was to produce
               would defray this expence. on my return I &lt;had&gt; resolved still to leave her there,
               &amp; live seperately till the Xmas of 1796 when I had no evil to endure — but dependance.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I returned however with the remainder of the thirty pounds — about 18 I believe. I
                  had likewise the matter for my Letters, which were only published from necessity. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</a> supplied me in advance with such small sums as I wanted from time to time, which the
                  sale of the first edition of that book would repay, &amp; my own reserved copies of Joan
                  of Arc produced me <span style="text-decoration: line-through">with thes</span> enough with these assistances. By Xmas I had published my poems &amp; letters.

               a cottage, &amp; lived there with my wife &amp; mother, without one wish unsatisfied. as it
               was, it was my duty to labour till I could do this indepently by the Law. we had clothes
               to purchase — some little to discharge — &amp; a journey to London. with these draw-backs
               you will easily conceive that at [MS torn] the end of the first half year nothing

                  therefore to know the state of my finances. this surprized me because I had told him
                  what I expected. on the receipt of this letter I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> &amp; told her to expect this ten pounds, which I fortunately wanted not, for this purpose
                  I wrote to Burn for it by means of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</a>, explaining to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</a> why I accepted it that he might not think I was wantonly draining <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbert">my Uncle</a>. this I shall explain in my letter to Lisbon which fortunately is not yet written.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Thus you may see that the only means I have <span style="text-decoration: line-through">omitted</span> ever possessed of assisting <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> was by entering the Church. God knows I would exchanged every intellectual gift which
               he has blest me with for implicit faith to have been able to do this. I have urged
               her to come &amp; live with me; she has a large lodging house which does not pay its own
               rent, &amp; my wish is that she would let the remainder of her lease upon a reduced rent,
               <span style="text-decoration: line-through">that what</span> &amp; sink a certain little to prevent greater loss. I can then support her.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I care not for the opinion of the world, but would willingly be thought justly of
               by a few individuals. I labour at a study which I very much dislike, to render myself
               independant — &amp; I work for the booksellers whenever I can get employment that I may
               have to spare for others. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">I now do all I can</span> I sent ten pounds when last in London to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Frickerfamily">Ediths mother</a> whose wants were more pressing than those of my own. I now do all I can, perhaps
               I may one day be enabled to do all I wish. however there is One who will accept the
               will for the deed.</p>
