Republished, Joseph Cottle, <em>Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey</em> (London, 1847), pp. 191–93 [in part].<br>Dating note: The dating of this letter is based on Joseph Cottle’s, however it is
               possible that it was begun at a slightly earlier time and continued on Tuesday 15

            <p class="indent1">Indeed my dear friend, it is strange that you are reading a letter from me at this
               time, and not an account of our Shipwreck. We left Falmouth on Tuesday mid-day; the
               wind was fair till the next night, so fair that we were within twelve hours’ sail
               of Corunna; it then turned round, blew a tempest, and continued so till the middle
               of Saturday. Our dead lights were up fifty hours, and I was in momentary expectation
               of death. You know what a situation this is. I forgot my sickness, and though I thought
               much of the next world, thought more of those at Bristol, who would daily expect letters;
               daily be disappointed, and at last learn from the newspapers, that the Lauzarotte
               had never been heard of.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Of all things it is most difficult to understand the optimism of this difference of
                  language; the very beasts of the country do not understand English. Say ‘poor fellow’
                  to a dog, and he will probably bite you; the cat will come if you call her ‘Meeth-tha,’
                  but ‘puss’ is an outlandish phrase she has not been accustomed to; last night I went
                  to supper to the fleas, and an excellent supper they made; and the cats serenaded
                  me with their execrable Spanish: to lie all night in <span class="ital">Bowling-Green Lane,</span>

                  not venture to shave on board, and have had no razor on shore till this evening. Custom-house
                  officers are more troublesome here than in England, I have however got every thing
                  at last; you may form some idea of the weather we endured; thirty fowls over our head
                  were drowned; the ducks got loose, and ran with a party of half naked Dutchmen into
                  our cabin; ’twas a precious place, eight men lying on a shelf much like a coffin.
