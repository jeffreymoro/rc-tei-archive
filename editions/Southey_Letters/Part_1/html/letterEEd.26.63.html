               my strange brain — that the one confuses the other &amp; I wander from all. your letter
               arrived to day &amp; relieved me from a great weight — the apprehension that my baggage
               was lost — tho I jested upon the subject made me very uneasy — when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> seemd anxious I laughd but my laugh (as it often is) was artificial — the rogue who

                  of the Inquisition as an argument against Xtianity. for your feelings I make every
