               <p>I write to you upon the subject of the vignettes again, because it has been recommended
                  from many quarters, &amp; by those who know how books sell. they tell me that ornaments
                  of this kind accelerate the sale of a book; &amp; as far as my own observations go — I
                  may say my own <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxxxxx x xxxxx</span> feelings — they agree with the remark. I have been calculating what the surplus would
                  be to expend in prints, if the book were sold at six shillings — &amp; I find the 500
                  nine pences amount to £18–17–0. now two vignettes &amp; the Gaspar Poussin

                  within the sum allotted. the point is — will it accelerate the sale? — think you upon
                  this — &amp; let me speedily know the result of your thoughts — that — if they incline
                  toward tickling the public eye — I may see something about it personally. we leave
                  town in a fortnight. but I have now access to &lt;the&gt; artists thro Opie.

               <p>Opie is indeed a very extraordinary man. I have now twice seen him. without any thing
                  of politeness, his manners are pleasing, tho their freedom is out of the common; &amp;
                  his conversation, tho in a half-uttered half-Cornish half-croak, is interesting. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">perhaps</span> there &lt;is a&gt; strange contrast between his genius, which is not confined to painting,
                  &amp; the vulgarity of his appearance — <span style="text-decoration: line-through">perhaps</span> of his manners &amp; language sometimes. you will however easily conceive that a man who
                  can paint like Opie must display the same taste on other subjects. he is very fond
                  of Spenser — no author furnishes so many pictures he says — You may have seen his
                  Britomart delivering Amoret. he has begun a picture from Spenser which he <span style="text-decoration: line-through">says</span> himself thinks his best design — but it has remaind untouchd for three years. the
                  outline is wonderfully fine. it is the delivery of Serena from the Salvages by Calepine.
                  you will find the story in the sixth book of the Faery Queen somewhere about the 7<sup>th</sup> or 8<sup>th</sup> Canto.
