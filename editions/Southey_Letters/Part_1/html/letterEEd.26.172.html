            <p class="indent1">The philosophy of Helvetius has become very fashionable in England. I, however, believe,
               that all arguments deduced from experience and analogy, are directly in opposition
               to it. Two individuals — say the advocates of this system, would be precisely similar,
               if they received precisely the same education; that is, if they should be precisely
               in the same situations, and the same circumstances; now this can never take place.
               Thus, they assert what they themselves acknowledge never can be proved.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Materialists and Immaterialists are agreed, that the brain is the organ of thought;
               we have no business now with the enquiry what it is that thinks — a point which never
               can be proved, and of which the proof, if possible, would be useless. The brain, however,
               is the organ of thought, as the eye is the organ of vision; the point, then on which
               this system rests, is, that the organization of the brain is in all men equally perfect,
               excepting in absolute idiots and madmen. But is there no gradation from the man of
               strong and sound intellect, down to the idiot? Has your correspondent never known
               persons, who, though not in a state of absolute idiotism, are yet little removed from
               it? Who shall draw the line where these <span class="ital">removes</span> end? As there are gradations below the standard of common sense, may we not reasonably
               infer that there are gradations ascending above it?</p>
            <p class="indent1">The opponents of Helvetius believe in innate aptitudes — not innate ideas. In the
               same manner as the organ of sight is formed with different degrees of strength in
               different persons, they assert a difference of perfection in the organ of thought.
               I have known a child catch a tune before he could articulate a sentence, though his
               brother never discovered the least inclination for music. Now the <span class="ital">education</span> of their <span class="ital">ears</span>, had been precisely the same; for their mother had sung the same songs to both in
               their infancy.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The instance of the Jesuits, which Helvetius adduces, may be applied against his system:
               it is a well known fact, that their preceptors watched with the utmost attention the
               disposition of their pupils. One of them was believed incapable of attaining any kind
               of knowledge, till his tutor tried him in geometry, and he became a celebrated mathematician.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Is the brain always <span class="ital">exactly</span> of the same size and shape? Are the ventricles always exactly of the same size? Is
               the medullary substance always <span class="ital">exactly</span> of the same consistence — so that the vibrations may always be propagated with equal
               swiftness? These questions must all be decided in the affirmative, before it can be
               proved that all men are equally possessed of intellectual powers.</p>
