            <p class="indent1">When do I come to London? a plain question. I cannot tell — is as plain an answer.
               my books wil be out before Xmas. &amp; I shall then have no further business in Bristol.
               yet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> this is not saying when I shall leave it — the best answer is — as soon as I can
               — &amp; the sooner the better. I want to be there. I want to feel myself settled — &amp; God
               knows when that will be. for the settlement of a lodging is but a comfortless one.
               to compleat comfort a house to oneself is necessary for I do not like living in the
               same den with the beast.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>however I expect to be as comfortable as it is possible to be in that cursed city
                  — “that huge &amp; hateful sepulchre of Men”

                  </div> — I detest cities — &amp; had rather live in the fens of Lincolnshire or on Salisbury
                  plain than in the best situation London could furnish. the neighbourhood of you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> can alone render it tolerable. by the Lord <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> I fear the air will wither me up like one of the miserable myrtles at a &lt;town&gt; parlour
                  window the noise the smoke the filth the Beast — oh for the house in the woods &amp; the
                  great dog!</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I already feel intimate with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CarlisleAnthony">Carlisle</a>. but I am a very snail in company <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> &amp; pop into my shell whenever I am approachd or roll myself up like a hedge hog in
               my rough outside.</p>
            <p class="indent1">it is strange but I never approached London without feeling my heart sink within me.
               an unconquerable heaviness oppresses me in its atmosphere — &amp; all its associated ideas
               — are painful. with a little house in the country &amp; a bare independance how much more
               useful should I be — &amp; how much more happy! it is not talking nonsense when I say
               that the London air is as bad for the mind as for the body. for the mind is a cameleon
               that receives its colours from surrounding <span style="text-decoration: line-through">xxx</span> objects. in the country every thing is good. every thing in Nature is beautiful —
               the benevolence of Deity is every where presented to the eye, &amp; the heart participates
               in the tranquillity of the scene. in the town my soul is continually &lt;disgusted&gt; by
               the vices &amp; follies &amp; consequent miseries of mankind.</p>
            <p class="indent1">my future studies too — now I never read a book without learning something — &amp; never
               write a line of poetry without cultivating some feeling of benevolence &amp; honesty.
               but the law — a damned jargon — a quibbling collection of voluminous nonsense — but
               this I must wade thro — aye &amp; I will wade thro — &amp; when I shall have got enough to
               live in the country you &amp; I will make my first Xmas fire of all my law books. oh <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> what a blessed bonfire! the Devil uses the Statutes at large for fuel when he gives
               an Attorney his house-warming.</p>
