               is of all others the most qualified for rendering us hapy but these collegiate scholars
               have no idea of rendering study agreable — the old monastic leaven still infects the
               whole substance — but reform is a dangerous word. did you never hear of bodies discovered
               in the ancient tumuli fresh &amp; perfect in appearance which mouldered with a touch?
               the allusion is just to our universities &amp; schools. had I been properly educated for

               did not certainly create any agreable ideas but still there was nothing to disgust.
               afterwards he led me down stairs &amp; showed me who dreamt of nothing like it half a
               woman. in the course of my life I never saw any object so horrible anatomy I once
               intended to study but if it can only be learnt by overcoming every feeling &amp; every
