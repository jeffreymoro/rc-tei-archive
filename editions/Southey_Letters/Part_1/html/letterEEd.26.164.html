               <p>THAT the literature of Spain and Portugal is not attended to at present, when the

                  that the same neglect should have prevailed in those earlier periods, when translations
                  were so common, so useful, and so honourable. The best Italian poets were naturalized
                  in England, during the reigns of Elizabeth and James;

                  to the English readers: the few specimens that he has printed, are untranslated, and
                  selected chiefly to show their different metres. His work has been the companion of
                  my Spanish studies: I have derived pleasure and instruction from it, and have only
                  to regret, that by not extending his work, he has left a less able pen to attempt
