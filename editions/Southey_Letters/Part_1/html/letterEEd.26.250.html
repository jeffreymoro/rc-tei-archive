            <p class="indent2">After a journey of almost four hundred miles &amp; very great mental anxiety I am once
               more at rest, with the reward of believing that I have contributed to the happiness
               of two persons. I can not say that friendship put my exertions in requisition, for
               my acquaintance with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd</a> (whom I accompanied) was slight. one day you shall hear the particulars in conversation
               — suffice it now to say that he came to me greatly agitated, &amp; uncertain how to act,
               that the happiness of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#PembertonSophia">a very excellent young woman</a> depended upon his conduct, that matters are well arranged — &amp; that he has returned
               with me to be my guest till in three months I transfer him to her who will then have
               the best claim.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>We reached this place last night. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> will be here on Saturday night. I could much wish you to visit us while she is here.
                  you would see a woman whose health Affliction has broken, but whose unalterable sweetness
                  of temper nothing has been able to injure. you would see <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother</a> likewise, who has left his ship. an excellent young man. we met unexpectedly at Bristol
                  on my return. when he had procured his discharge the Lieutenants called him into their
                  room, &amp; offered him collectively &amp; individually certificates that his conduct had
                  been uniformly strictly proper &amp; that the Captain

                  vessel? he has served four years &amp; a half — &amp; is I believe an excellent sailour. one
                  who knows his duty &amp; performs it is a valuable acquisition to any ship.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You shall know <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LambCharles">Lambs</a> history when we meet. I shall relate it to you with the hope of perhaps benefiting
               a man, who amid sufferings more intense than usually afflict mankind, has attained
               a degree of saintly resignation almost more than human. I myself have little knowledge
               of him; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Lloyd</a> sought him out &amp; has won his intimacy. he has certainly performed to the utmost every
               duty of every relation.</p>

               <p>We are situate about ¼ of a mile short of the 8 mile stone from Ringwood. the inn
                  at Christ Church is nearly two miles distant. it is a decent one, &amp; as I have in some
                  part explained how the room destined for your reception became pre-occupied, it were
                  needless to apologize. I shall &lt;have&gt; much pleasure in introducing you to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharles">Charles Lloyd</a>. men who mean well, &amp; wish to act well ought to know each other, &amp; as you say, if
                  there be but a few Sodom may yet be saved.

                  </div> Of collective efforts, &amp; the elicited wisdom of conversation — I think as little as
                  of the rest of the city-philosophers jargon. but good men encourage each other in

               little for one who has neither the feelings nor habits of honest independance, &amp; who
               always indulges himself careless of consequences. some Linendraper is now going to
               live with him &amp; study one hour a day. ridiculous as this is, it is the most feasible
               plan he has yet adopted. the man cannot be very hungry after learning who limits himself
               to one hour a day, &amp; if instead of a tutor &amp; guide he can be satisfied with th[MS
               torn] most entertaining of — I may say — buffoons — they will do well together. it
               is not possible to think too highly[MS torn] <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridges</a> abilities, or too despicably of him in every other character.</p>
