            <p class="indent2">I like the plan you propose, &amp; see no objection to it at present. but you know how
               feasable those things appear which we wish. one circumstance only may happen to prevent
               it — I have some hopes that my mother will come &amp; live with me. this I very earnestly
               wish &amp; shall use every means to induce her, but it does not appear so probable as
               I could desire. this I shall know in a short time — &amp; if then you have not changed
               your intentions — you know how gladly I should domesticate under the same roof with
               you. in that case I should certainly prefer keeping a servant for various oeconomical
               reasons.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I think you would derive more good from Epictetus

                  </div> than from studying yourself. there is a very proud independance in the Stoic philosophy
                  which has always much pleased me; you would find certain sentences in the Enchiridion
                  which would occur to the mind when such maxims were wanted &amp; operate as motives. besides
                  when you are examining yourself you ought to have a certain standard by which to measure
                  yourself: &amp; however far an old Stoic may be from perfection, he is almost a God when
                  compared to the present race who libel that nature which appeared with such exceeding
                  lustre in Athens in Lacedæmon &amp; in Rome. I could send you to a better system than
                  that of the bondsman Epictetus, where you would find a better model on which to form
                  your conduct. but the mind should have arrived at a certain stage to profit properly
                  by that book, which few have attained. it should be cool &amp; confirmed.</p>

               <p>As for the Law I am less surprized at your laying it down than at your taking it up.
                  with your prospect of independance I think your leisure could scarcely be worse employed
                  than in learning that which you would only wish to remember in your profession. for
