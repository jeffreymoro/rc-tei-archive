            <p class="indent1">Your silence my dear <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> rather alarmed than surprized me, I concluded you were unhappy &amp; that rather than
               communicate any disagreable intelligence you were silent. daily expectation prevented
               me from writing. it is not an hour since I received yours. but the weight of solitary
               reflection must be thrown off. learn the whole history of my situation &amp; when you
               &lt;know&gt; what Philosophy has done for me — try my friend the same remedy.</p>
            <p class="indent1">you know <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a> was a tradesman. in those circumstances which enabled him for twenty years to live
               happily &amp; support a family in that honourable mediocrity most to be envied. three
               years back he became the dupe of artifice &amp; was ruined. he struggled in vain with
               misfortunes. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyJohn">an unfeeling brother</a> refused assistance — &amp; he was arrested not for his own debts but for a bill endorsed
               for a deceitful friend. I saw <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">him</a> Horace in prison. I saw him releasd just in time to reach home — meet fresh misfortunes
               &amp; die of a broken heart. mine <span style="text-decoration: line-through">hav</span> must either have broken or grown callous. for what I am reservd I know not. few calamities
               can now afflict me for to these most dreadful ones my own imprudence has added others.
               I contracted a debt for books when a false kindness conceald the misfortunes of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</a>. home you may easily imagine could be no longer agreable. I had always lived with
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a>. she is the best of women. but unmerited injuries — &amp; generosity (even prodigal)
               ill requited have soured her temper. the lodging house which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> supports herself by at Bath, is still more unpleasant I am compelld to associate
               with fools &amp; to know they think it condescension.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>When <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Seward</a> invited me to Sapey I gladly went. his character commanded esteem. I saw Augusta Roberts

                  </div> — six days I lived in the same house — scarcely ever from her sight. the snow confined
                  us. I was lost. when I wishd her farewell my heart was full &amp; she was not unmoved.
                  I brooded over an attachment which appeard innocent — I indulged dreams of future
                  fortune. communications with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Sewardfamily">M<sup>rs</sup> Seward</a>, rendered it easy to keep up my memory but I was dissatisfied. I wrote to Augusta.
                  the lines were inclosed for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SewardEdmund">Edmund Sewards</a> perusal. he wrote immediately in the utmost agitation &amp; acquainted me with his brother<span style="text-decoration: line-through">s</span> <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Sewardfamily">Johns</a> attachment to Augusta. he describd his own situation &amp; with a generosity seldom equalld
                  in Romance waited my reply declaring he would not interest himself for his brother.
                  what remaind for me? at the expence of my happiness I preservd that of two persons
                  more deserving. I directed him to burn my letter. desird him to forget it &amp; promised
                  what never can be performd to forget Augusta.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">this last happened whilst I was at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a>. compare your situation with mine <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a>.</p>
            <p class="indent1">there was a period when I had almost abandond hope &amp; resolvd to seek happiness in
               another world. at another time I have thought of selling myself to murder in the East
               Indies &amp; relieve my family from a burden. but they look to me for future support.
               the church is allotted for my pursuit &amp; when I reflect how unfit I am for the office
               — this appears the heaviest of my misfortunes. unfortunately my dear friend I am not
               stupid enough to be orthodox. doubts will intrude. I cannot stifle them I cannot find
               conviction &amp; an oath &lt;is&gt; required at ordination — add to this that in my ideas the
               very existence of a priest is wrong. to obtain future support — to return the benefits
               I have received, I must become contemptible infamous &amp; perjured.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>on this most gloomy prospect one only ray of light appears. at the deaths of <span class="ref">my fathers elder brother</span> &amp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through">that</span> of Lord Somerville

                  </div> a very large estate reverts to me. but even of this I can obtain no more information.
                  enquiry is vain. I would sell the reversion did I know particulars — but the whole
                  is enveloped in mystery. a man appearingly from the country when first my father became
                  bankrupt called &amp; offerd to buy it. the offer was made with insolence &amp; my fathers
                  feelings overcame his judgement. ‘tho I have ruined myself I never will ruin my children’
                  said he, &amp; turnd the man out of doors without enquiring who employed him.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>my eccentricities can no longer surprize. at the age of nineteen I have known more
                  calamity than many who deserve it more, meet with in long lives. the only society
                  that could please me here is that of some young women sisters

                  </div> — with whom I was partly educated &amp; whose histories are as melancholy as my own. the
                  ill grounded fears of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TylerElizabeth">my Aunt</a> forbid it. I see them seldom. but they know my motives &amp; pity me. other society I
                  have none. this city is peopled with rich fools — I might mingle with them but I cannot
                  bow &amp; smile where I despise folly &amp; execrate vice. thus am I compelld to seek internal
                  resources. I have read libraries &amp; written volumes, &amp; still find I have libraries
                  to read &amp; volumes to write. it is not for fame — it is for a temporary refuge I seek.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I have written without reserve. never before did I totally unbosom myself. judge if

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>let me turn to you. never were two young men more calculated for happiness or farther
                  from it. your situation is however preferable to mine — will you be surpassed in resolution?
                  call up the latent energy of mind. seek refuge in study — &amp; remember no crime can
                  equal despair. whilst life can be of service to one existing being it is criminal
                  to quit it. what but this witholds me either from seeking happiness in France in America
                  or in the grave? but my family look forwards to my assistance — my brothers

                  I attempt to blind his reason but it is too strong for delusion. he now affects a

            <p class="indent1">yet <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHoraceWalpole">Horace</a> I live. I make pursuits — draw out the most extensive plans &amp; pursue them with resolution.
               my heart partakes of my friends happiness &amp; has a pang in store for his affliction.
               I rise &lt;in&gt; the morning without expecting pleasure &amp; lie down without wishing dissolution.
               my mind is fortified by philosophy. the conflict was severe but passion yielded. &amp;
               at this period the least part of my misery or of my happiness is selfish. I feel more
               for my friends. below the malice of Fortune I feel myself above her influence. she
               now can have but few afflictions in store. her quiver must be almost exhausted. &amp;
               whatever she can inflict I can sustain.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I could draw the comparison between our situations &amp; point out how preferable is yours.
               consider them yourself. you have the affection of a deserving object. nothing but
               her becoming worthless can deprive you of it. I forbear to enlarge but you think me
               wrong. suffer me to say thus much — she must be unworthy of you if any earthly power
               can make her false. force can always be opposed. &amp; remember in the most hazardous
               attempt you are sure of one associate.</p>
