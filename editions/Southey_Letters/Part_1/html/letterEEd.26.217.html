               edition of Southey’s <em>Poems</em> (1797), Morgan Library, MA 414.]<br>Previously published: Kenneth Curry (ed.), <em>New Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 2 vols (London and New York, 1965), I, pp. 127–129 [where it is misdated [4 May
               1797]].<br>Dating note: The dating of this letter is from internal evidence. It was written on
               Thursday, 18 May, before Southey left for Ringwood, Hampshire, on Wednesday 24 May
               1797.</p>

                  All the prefaces like that to Rudiger. &amp; no ornaments at the end of each poem. I have
                  put my new arrangement by the Contents. let the Contents be printed exactly in the
                  same manner that they are now. “Lyric Poems” &amp; “Musings” must each have a black letter
                  title page. I do not think the first Birth day Ode deserves to be reprinted. if however
                  you wish it, it may be inserted the first of the Lyric poems; entitled “To a Friend
                  on his birthday, &amp; the motto, now assigned to the other, affixed to that.
