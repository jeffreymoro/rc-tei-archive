                           was a mythical king of Messenia. See Pausanius (AD C2), Descriptions of Greece, 4.
                           9.1–10 and 4. 13.4. Southey has expanded on his source, providing names for Aristodemus’s

            <p>The Messenians during their struggle with Lacedæmon applied to the Delphian oracle.
               The Pythoness declared that a virgin of the blood of Apytus must be sacrificed to
               the infernal deities. lots were cast &amp; the daughter of Lyciscus was the destind victim.
               Lyciscus however bribed a priest to declare the child suppositious &amp; taking advantage
               of the confusion deserted with her to Sparta. upon this Aristodemus “a man in whom
               superstition or ambition or perhaps both together had stifled paternal tenderness,
               voluntarily offered his own daughter for the victim. the virgin was betrothed to a
               young Messenian of highest rank &amp; estimation. he insisted that the daughter of Aristodemus
               now belonged to him, &amp; when this plea was overuled, declared that she could no longer
               answer the demand of the oracle, for she was pregnant by him. Aristodemus was enraged
               to madness — to confute this falshood he immediately slew his daughter &amp; caused the
               body to be dissected. his ambition was gratified by the crown. but after the interval
               of some years his despair &amp; remorse made him kill himself upon his daughters tomb.</p>

                  much surprized at the question as I was when first it met me. tis not a point of trivial
                  importance — for it involves in its consequences the most important benefits to society.
                  the case is this. does Man act from free will — or is he is uniformly necessitated
                  to act as he really acts. after much consideration much prejudice &amp; much argument
                  I am convinced that he is uniformly necessitated to act; &amp; that no man in any period
                  of his life could act differently from what he did.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>all actions must be voluntary or involuntary — &amp; we know that there are both kinds.
                  choice cannot be attributed to an involuntary action &amp; the very idea of a voluntary
                  action is that of an action which you perform because you have motives for doing it.
                  you act in obedience to motive — you are necessitated so to do — &amp; it little matters
                  to say that you chuse the motive from Free Will — as there must have been motive for
                  the choice &amp; if you add link to link ad infinitum still you &lt;must&gt; make motive the
                  beginning of the chain. — ponder this well. tis an abstruse subject. but of the utmost
                  importance. upon this rests the propriety or impropriety of revenge &amp; punishment.

                  not look upon the instrument of a bad deed with anger or abhorrence. he will pity
                  him. anger &amp; revenge must cease. &amp; punishment is only a legal modification of revenge.
                  the difference between virtue &amp; vice exists in the physical nature of things — &amp; from
                  that physical constitution — the one will always be an object of desire &amp; the other
                  of disgust. the more you consider this the stronger these arguments will appear.</p>
