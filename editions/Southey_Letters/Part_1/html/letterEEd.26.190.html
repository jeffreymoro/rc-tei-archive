               <p>I was at Bristol when your letter arrived — the inclosed was immediately written,
                  I have spoken of Robert Haynes

                  </div> as your character of him taught me he deserved to be spoken of — he will need no other
                  introduction. if my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</a> revisits Lisbon &amp; I shall by this post assure him there is no danger in so doing —
                  you may send any thing by him to introduce him to Haynes — who may then supply my
                  place to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ThomasWilliamBowyer">Thomas</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">you mistook me about Madoc. I had neither the intention or wish of immediate publication.
               twas a forlorn hope for the future. I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</a> about five days ago — &amp; told him the only remora that would detain me here after
               Christmas. I am as little content with the world as you are, but I do not like <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allens</a> gunpowder plot. the world must be mended by the total reorganization of society.
               &amp; as a Christian I believe this must take place. if I did not — I should join the
               Atheism of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#AllenRobert">Allen</a> — without embracing his plans for the improvement of a rascally public. you call
               yourself an aristocrat — &amp; before God I know no man whose opinions &amp; feelings are
               more anti-aristocratical!</p>
            <p class="indent1">I shall probably visit London a week before <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> — to look about me &amp; fix. will you house me for that time? your plan makes some alteration
               in mine — I meant to live about Newington to be in the road between <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Brixton">Brixton</a> &amp; the Exchequer — now the nearer we are to Lincolns Inn the better — &amp; the nearer
               to each other.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But why so anxious <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor</a> as to injure your health? a little stoicism amalgamates well with human affections
               &amp; virtues &amp; methinks you are too anxious: you have already enough for all wants —
               &amp; all necessary comforts — &amp; your heart is now your own. a single man needs only good
               raiment &amp; shelter. if his affections be not engaged &amp; these fail to make him happy
               — nothing can. that man should ever want these!</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Do you expect to find me altered much? I feel myself the same now as when I first
                  began to feel: &amp; can trace the developement of my character thro every stage. it is
                  tranquilized — not changed. remember you the first of March 1792?
