               taking some shame to myself that I should have cause to remember it on this occasion,
               I thank you for the manner in which you have done me the honour of mentioning my name
               in your epitaph upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke
                  White</ref>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Smyth’s epitaph to
                  Henry Kirke White was inscribed on a memorial, funded by an American admirer of
                  the poet’s, the physician and botanist Francis Boott (1792–1863), in All Saints’
                  Church, Cambridge. It was reproduced in editions of Southey’s <title>Remains of
                     Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham</title> from 1822.</note> This is the first
               time that my praise has been written in marble:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The epitaph praised ‘generous SOUTHEY’, who ‘Told the tale and
                  show’d what WHITE had been’ (lines 9–10).</note> &amp; tho I am as indifferent as
               a man would wish to be in these times to common applause &amp; to common censure, I
               am well aware that laudari a laudato viro<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘To be praised by a man of praise’.</note> must always be a subject of just
               satisfaction. – We were not deceived in the opinion which we formed of this
               extraordinary youth. You had the gratification of knowing him, &amp; of showing him
               personal kindness. I could only pay a tribute of respect to his remains; but of all
               the actions of my life it is that for which I have been the most abundantly requited. </p><p rend="indent1"> You would have had another youth, of not inferior promise, some three
               years ago, if he had not been cut off even more prematurely than poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">White</ref>, – that <ref type="m" target="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert Knowles</ref>, whose lines written in
               Richmond Church Yard you have no doubt seen.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Knowles’s ‘Lines written in the Churchyard of Richmond, Yorkshire’ (sent to
                  Southey in 1816 under its original title ‘The Three Tabernacles’) appeared in the
                     <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 7 (June 1817), 420–421, and was much
                  reprinted, including in Southey’s article ‘Cemeteries and Catacombs of Paris’,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (April 1819), 359–398 (396–398).</note>
               When the first plan for placing him at Cambridge failed thro the inability of some of
               his friends to allow him the little which they had promised, he introduced himself to
               me by letter, &amp; sent me that poem, with another of considerable length &amp;
               great power of execution, tho by no means fit for publication from its ill conceived
               &amp; incongruous plan.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">For Southey’s
                  response, see his letter to Herbert Knowles, 27 October 1816, <title>The Collected

                  the second poem sent to Southey was; it might have been the untitled poem
                  beginning ‘My Friend! not now thy name – yet sacred still,’, published in
