                  on sinecures. In a speech in the House of Commons on 22 March 1821 he moved the
                  abolition of the offices of Receivers-General and Distributors of Stamps,
                  maintaining that the posts were sinecures, as evidenced by the appointment of ‘an
                  idle poet (Mr Wordsworth)’ as Distributor of Stamps in Westmorland in 1813. The
                  Commons set up a Select Committee to investigate the issue and this sent
                  Wordsworth into a panic. He posted a carefully worded letter to his patron, the
                  Earl of Lonsdale, outlining his duties as Distributor; see <title>The Letters of
