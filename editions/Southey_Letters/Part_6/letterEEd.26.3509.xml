					Sir</salute></opener><p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the draft. I am now preparing for you with all proper dispatch both the Peninsular
					War &amp; the Book of the Church; &amp; you will have the commencement of the first very shortly, &amp; that of the
					second soon after it,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
						(1823–1832) and <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> for I am now as seriously at work, as the
					summer interruptions of this place will admit.</p><p rend="indent1"> An hour or two before I left London, I found a card from Sir George Dallas<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The political writer George Dallas, 1st Baronet (1758–1833; <title>DNB</title>), who
						had been a protégé of Warren Hastings (1732–1818; <title>DNB</title>) during the latter’s time as Governor-General
						of Bengal 1774–1785.</note> expressing a wish on the part of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hastings<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Anna Maria Apollonia [Marian] (1747–1837; <title>DNB</title>), née Chapuset, second
						wife and widow of Warren Hastings. Southey was considering writing a life of Hastings, but did not do so.</note>
					to see me the next day at twelve. Had my departure regarded myself alone, I would without hesitation have delayed
					it; – but a friend had taken his place with mine for that evening to accompany me home, – &amp; I had also an
					engagement to meet <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">an old Lady</ref> (a near relation from a distant
					part of the country) at Birmingham the next day, by the mail. So that it was impossible. – From our conversation
					with Sir George Dallas it appears to me that the proper plan will be to publish a selection from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hastings papers &amp; correspondence, accompanying it with his life. That life <del>would</del> requires a
					compendious view of our Indian history down to the <del>pres</del> time of his administration, &amp; in its
					progress it embraces the preservation of our Indian Empire, &amp; the establishment of the <del>presen</del>
					existing system. Something must be interwoven concerning the history of the native powers, Moor <del>&amp;</del>,
					Mahratta, &amp;c &amp; their institutions, I see how all this is to be introduced, &amp; see also that no subject
					can afford materials more important or more various. And what a pleasure it will be to record the triumph of such a
					man as Hastings over the tremendous combination of his persecutors at home! – I had a noble catastrophe in writing
					the life of Nelson,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813); the
						‘noble catastrophe’ was Horatio Nelson’s (1758–1805; <title>DNB</title>) death at Trafalgar and perhaps also his
						relationship with Emma Hamilton (c. 1765–1815; <title>DNB</title>). </note> – but the latter days of Hastings
					afford a scene more touching &amp; perhaps more sublime, because it is more uncommon.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Hastings had returned to Britain in 1785. Between 1787–1795 he was impeached, tried and acquitted
						of misgovernment in British India. He was left with massive debts and a compromised reputation, and spent his
						final two decades out of public life. </note> – Let me have the works of Orme &amp; Bruce &amp; Mill,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Orme (1728–1801; <title>DNB</title>), <title>History of the Military
							Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan from 1745</title> (1803), and <title>Historical Fragments of the
							Mogul Empire, of the Morattoes, and of the English Concerns in Indostan from the Year 1759</title> (1805); John
						Bruce (1744–1826; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Annals of the Honorable East-India Company, from their Establishment
							by the Charter of Queen Elizabeth, 1600, to the Union of the London and English East-India Companies,
							1707–8</title> (1810); and James Mill (1773–1836; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The History of British
							India</title> (1817). They were nos 2123, 426 and 1875, respectively, in the sale catalogue of Southey’s
						library.</note> &amp; I will set apart a portion of every day to this course of reading &amp; begin my notes
					accordingly.</p><p rend="indent1"> Procure for me the “Memoires pour servir a l histoire d’Espagne, par Nellerto;”<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Juan Antonio Llorente [pseud. Nellerto] (1756–1823), <title>Mémoires pour servir à
							l’Histoire de la Révolution d’Espagne</title> (1814); no. 2027 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</note>
					&amp;, if you can, some historical works by Francisco de Olivarez which I have seen noticed in a Magazine, – they
					are an account of the war in Catalonia, in 4 vol. published at Seville 1815. Anecdotes of Chiefs in the Catalan
					War, &amp; Memoirs of the Spanish Monarchy to the abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the usurpation of Joseph.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had read John Mitford’s ‘On Spanish Literature, with some Account of
						Francisco de Olivarez’, <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 10 (October 1818), 221–223. The books Southey
						requested are Olivarez’s <title>Account of the War in Catalonia</title>, in four volumes, published at Seville
						1815; <title>Anecdotes of Chiefs Employed in the Catalan War</title> (1816); and <title>Memoirs of the Spanish
							Monarchy to the Abdication of Charles 4 &amp; the Usurpation of Joseph Bonaparte</title> (1816). Mitford’s essay was incorrect, and none of these works seem to have existed. </note> My poor correspondent <ref type="m" target="people.html#AbellaManuel">Abella</ref> who used to supply me with Spanish Documents is dead, to my great loss, &amp; I have now no means of
