                     of the Abipones, an Equestrian People of Paraguay</title> (1822). It was a
                  translation of Martin Dobrizhoffer (1717–1791), <title>Historia de Abiponibus
                     Equestri, Bellicosaque Paraquariae Natione</title> (1784), no. 843 in the sale
                  catalogue of Southey’s library. The translation did eventually run to three
                  volumes.</note> which vexes me greatly. You have plainly taken the copy in your
               hands for <hi rend="ital">half</hi> the work, instead of a <hi rend="ital">third</hi>, the original consisting of <hi rend="ital">three</hi> volumes. There is
               but one remedy, – which is to cut the translation down by omitting all that can best
               be omitted. Send the MS. back to me, &amp; I will see to this. The book will no
               longer have the same value as the original, but it will be lightened, &amp; thereby
               better suited to the great majority of readers. The pruning knife must be used
               without mercy, so as to cut out, if possible a full third.</p><p rend="indent1"> I did not know that <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Frere</ref>

                  1808–1809. In 1816 he married Elizabeth Jemima, Dowager Countess of Erroll
                  (1771–1831), and in 1820 retired to Malta in an attempt to recover her
                  health.</note> There is no person from whom those proofs<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Proofs of the first volume of Southey’s <title>History of the

               derive any of that advantage expected from him. Particular parts, which I will point
               out when we come to them, may be sent to particular persons who were either present
               at the actions described, or possess official knowledge of the transactions.
               Something no doubt will be gained by this on the score of accuracy; but what I wanted
               from <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> no other person
               can supply, – his individual knowledge of the leading men in Spain &amp; of the views

               has been forwarded to him, I shall probably have a reply to it in time to be useful.
               He had promised for the last three or four years to send me papers, – this was put
               off from day to day, as a business that might be deferred, – writing a letter of
               recollections is a different thing, &amp; more likely to be done.</p><p rend="indent1"><hi rend="ital">True</hi> liberality, such as that in the reviewal of

               to be evidenced upon all subjects by the Q. R. for three or four numbers, as
               undeniably as in this instance, I verily believe that the influence of that Journal
               would be doubled. An opinion prevails, which I have taken some pains to combat, that

               because it is not true. But certainly there are some works which have been treated
               with a severity altogether unjustifiable, &amp; exceedingly injurious to the
