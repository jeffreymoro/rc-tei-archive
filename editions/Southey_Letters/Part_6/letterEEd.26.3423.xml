						Sir</salute></opener><p rend="indent1"> You propose a question to me which I can no more answer with any grounds for an opinion, than if
					you were to ask me whether a lottery ticket should be drawn blank or prize, – or if a ship should make a prosperous
					voyage to the East Indies. If I recollect rightly poor Scott of Amwell<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John
						Scott of Amwell (1731–1782; <title>DNB</title>), Quaker, poet and expert on turnpike trusts and the Poor Law.
						Southey had drawn attention to the account of the scenes at Scott’s deathbed in Alexander Chalmers (1759–1834;
							<title>DNB</title>), <title>The Works of the English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper</title>, 21 vols (London,
						1810), XVII, pp. 445–452, in his article for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 11 (July 1814), 480–504
						(500–501); but Chalmers’s account, which Southey followed, emphasised that Scott had been troubled by fears of his
						own unworthiness, rather than being harassed by ‘sour-blooded bigots’. However, Southey’s rather different
						description of events concerning Scott in this letter was repeated, with some similarity of phrasing, in the
						review of Barton’s <title>Poems</title> (1820) in <title>London Literary Gazette and Journal of Belles Lettres,
							Arts, Sciences, &amp;c.</title>, 170 (22 April 1820), 260–263, so Barton may have passed Southey’s comments on to
						the reviewer to use in promoting his book.</note> was disturbed in his last illness, by some hard hearted &amp;
					sour-blooded bigots who wanted him to repent of his poetry as of a sin. The Quakers are much altered since that
					time. I know one, a man deservedly respected by all who know him, (<ref type="m" target="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">Charles Lloyd the elder of Birmingham</ref>) who has amused his old age by
					translating Horace &amp; Homer;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Lloyd published privately <title>A
							Translation of the Twenty-Fourth Book of the Iliad of Homer</title> (1807), a translation of Books 1–7 of the
							<title>Odyssey</title> (1810) and <title>The Epistles of Horace translated into English Verse</title>
						(1812).</note> he is looked up to in the Society, &amp; would not have printed these translations if he had
					thought it likely to give offence.</p><p rend="indent1"> Judging however from the spirit of the age as affecting your Society, like every thing else, I
					should think they would be gratified by the appearance of a Poet among them, who confines himself within the limits
					of their general principles. They have been reproached with being the most illiterate sect that has ever arisen in
					the Christian world; &amp; they ought to be thankful to any of their members who should assist in vindicating them
					from that opprobrium. There is nothing in their principles which should prevent them from giving you their
					sanction: &amp; I will even hope that there are not many persons who will impute it to you as a sin, if you should
						<del>xxx</del> call some of the months by their Heathen names. I know of no other offence that you are in danger
					of committing. They will not like virtuous feelings &amp; religious principles the worse, for being conveyed in
					good verse. If poetry in itself were unlawful, the Bible must be a prohibited book.</p><p rend="indent1"> I shall be glad to receive your volume,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton’s
							<title>Poems </title>(1820).</note> – &amp; you have my best good wishes for its success. The means of promoting
					it are not within my power. For tho I bear a part in the Quarterly Review (&amp; endure a large portion of the
					grossest abuse &amp; calumny for opinions which I do not hold, &amp; articles which I have not written) I have long
					since found it necessary, for reasons which you may easily apprehend, to form a resolution of reviewing no poems
					whatever. My principles of criticism indeed are altogether opposite to those of the age. I would treat every thing
					with indulgence, except what was mischievous. And most heartily do I disapprove of the prevailing fashion of
					criticism, the direct tendency of which is to call bad passions into full play.</p><p rend="indent1"> Heartily hoping that you may succeed to your utmost wishes in this meritorious undertaking</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> I remain dear Sir</salute><salute rend="indent2"> Yrs faithfully</salute><signed rend="indent3"> Robert Southey.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
