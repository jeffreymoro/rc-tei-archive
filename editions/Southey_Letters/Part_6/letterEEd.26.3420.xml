                  community run by Robert Owen (1771–1858; <title>DNB</title>), on 26 November 1819
                  destroyed No. 3 Mill, devoted to mule spinning.</note> &amp; not pleased at the
               ground which was taken for scouting the poor Projector in Parliament.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Owen had been campaigning since 1817 for a scheme
                  whereby paupers would be settled in communities on land acquired by the state or
                  local parishes. These ideas were debated in the House of Commons on 16 December
                  1819, after Owen’s friend, Sir William de Crespigny, 2nd Baronet (1765–1829), MP
                  for Southampton 1818–1826, moved to refer the matter to a Select Committee.
                  Brougham spoke in favour of the motion, but Nicholas Vansittart (1766–1851;
                     <title>DNB</title>), Chancellor of the Exchequer 1812–1823, condemned it on the
                  grounds of Owen’s rejection of orthodox Christianity. After this opposition from
                  the Cabinet, the motion was lost 141–16.</note> It looked too much like seeking
               for an excuse to get rid of the motion instead of rejecting it upon broader grounds;
               – for if the want of religion were all, that might surely be supplied <del>when</del>
               by the parties who direct the experiment to be made. Not that the question is fit for
               Parliament. But I should like well to see a wealthy parish form such an establishment
               for its paupers</p><p rend="indent1"> It is a good thing to see that the necessity for colonization seems
               now to be admitted as undeniable.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">There
                  were no fewer than six different state-aided emigration schemes in 1815–1826 to
                  Canada and the Cape of Good Hope, including a grant of £50,000 in July 1819 to
                  send 4,000 settlers to South Africa. However, the government was reluctant to
                  commit large funds at a time of pressure on the budget.</note> I remember when
               <ref type="m" target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord Liverpool</ref> protested against any such policy,
               &amp; held up America as a warning.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">It is
                  not clear which speech of Lord Liverpool’s Southey is referring to here; Southey
                  may be alluding to the Passenger Act (1803) and its subsequent amendments, which
                  raised the price of transatlantic fares by increasing the regulations on passenger
                  ships.</note> This too is a step gained. – I shall take the first opportunity of
