						exceptionally heavy and are possibly in another hand. The words deleted here are possibly ‘Bampton Lectures’,
						indicating that Miller had sent a copy of the printed text of a series of eight sermons on <title>The Divine
							Authority of Holy Scripture, Asserted, From its Adaptation to the Real State of Human Nature</title> he had
						delivered in 1817 under the auspices of the Bampton Lectures on Christian theology, which have been delivered
						annually at Oxford University since 1780. They had been published in 1817, with a second edition appearing in
						1819. </note> &amp; the letter which accompanied them. They were put into my hands at the Inn door, while I was
					waiting for the Stage Coach. My time in London was so compleatly filled up with hurrying &amp; wearying engagements
					of various kinds, that reading was impossible. I am now once more at home &amp; in quiet; &amp; having received the
					packages of books which followed me, the first which I read has been your volume. Till I had perused it I would not
					thank you for it, – for a letter of thanks in such cases, written before the book is read, may often be rightly
					understood as implying in the writer <del>a wish not to express any opinion to xxxx</del> a disinclination to read
						<del>the work</del> &lt;it&gt;, or an apprehension that, having read it, the opinion which he should form would
					not be one that he could communicate to the author.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have read your <del>Xxxxxxxx</del> with more than common pleasure; – with the double
					gratification of feeling myself every where in sympathy with the writer, &amp; of finding a calm, settled &amp;
					secure conviction of the great truths of Christianity supported by an original train of argument, which the more it
					is considered the stronger it must appear. I have read it too with advantage as well as delight – &amp; if I

					faces, especially when they come many together; &amp; I have the more inconvenient defect of not having that

					It is well that his papers were not consigned to any person who held opinions similar to his own; (<ref type="m" target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Godwin</ref>, for instance, who I hear has been very inquisitive concerning
					them) – for, in spite of the dreadful insanity of which they contain the most decided proofs, a publication might
