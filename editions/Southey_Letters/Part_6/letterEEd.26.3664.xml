					Soc. For the good reason that I intend to dine in Cumberland on that day; – &amp; a request to write verses for the
					said dinner, for the equally good reason that I am too busy, &amp; have no talent for occasional poetry.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royal Literary Fund, established in 1790 to aid British writers in financial
						difficulties. It received a Royal Charter in 1818. Much of the charity’s money came from its annual fundraising
						dinner, which was held on 10 May 1821. The ‘conviviality of the Meeting was sustained with unabated spirit till
						near midnight’, <title>Morning Post</title>, 11 May 1821. Southey neither attended the dinner nor wrote any verses
						for the occasion.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Another reason not less decisive might have been added, if I had not borne in mind that the least
					which is said is the soonest mended, – a maxim which I impress upon my children when they hurt themselves in
					infancy, as a charm to stop them crying. That reason is that <del>I</del> if I write Satire, there are few subjects
					on which I would lay &lt;on&gt; the Lash with so much severity as this worshipful Society which while it lauds
					itself as a Joint Stock Company of Patronage, does in fact nothing more than relieve literary pauperism by
					donations of five &amp; of ten pounds, – which just serves to purchase a reprieve from the spunging house, or the
						parish,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A sponging house was a place where debtors were temporarily
						confined to try and arrange a settlement with their creditors; if they failed to do so they were usually taken to
						court and then debtors’ prison. ‘The parish’ was poor relief, available from parish ratepayers. Southey’s view of the Royal Literary Fund was not a recent one. He had previously attacked its ‘despicable ostentation of patronage’ in his review of Isaac D’Israeli, <title>Calamities of Authors; Including some Inquiries Respecting their Moral and Literary Characters</title> (1812), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (September 1812), 93–114 (109).</note> – &amp; to
					prolong the process of starving.</p><p rend="indent1"> I could say much more upon this subject, &amp; upon the sort of Society which would really be
					beneficial to Literature &amp; to the community. Whatever D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Johnson may have said, the
					Booksellers are <hi rend="ital">not</hi> the best patrons of literature.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A

Southey had proposed that the government establish an academy to provide employment for literary men and benefit individual and national interests in his review of Isaac D’Israeli, <title>Calamities of Authors; Including some Inquiries Respecting their Moral and Literary Characters</title> (1812), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 8 (September 1812), 113–114.</note> which has been published is
					ridiculous; but Academies are not in themselves bad things. In other countries they have done a great deal; &amp;
					there is a great deal to be done in this, which will never be done without one –</p><p rend="indent1"> How much depends upon Austria<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Austria had sent an army to
						crush the liberal revolution in Naples in March 1821.</note> at this moment! A liberal policy might do wonders
					now, – but the race of statesmen is extinct. With evil on all sides, one has nothing to hope for – except
					tranquillity, – &amp; that sort of melioration arising from the spirit of the age, which was going on every till
					the French Revolution brought on an age of blood.</p><closer><salute rend="indent2">God bless you</salute><signed rend="indent3"> RS</signed></closer><postscript><p rend="indent0"><date when="1821-04-06">6 April. 1821.</date></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
