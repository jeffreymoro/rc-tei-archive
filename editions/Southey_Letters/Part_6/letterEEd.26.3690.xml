               reply <del>as soon as</del> immediately, but having expressed &lt;a hope&gt; that business might probably soon lead me into the West Country,
               &amp; intimated a little too confidently the likelihood of my succeeding to some good family estates there in consequence of Lord
               Somervilles death, – the letter was laid aside, till I could be more certain.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey
                  Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765–1819; <title>DNB</title>), agricultural reformer and third cousin of Southey, had died on 5
                  October 1819. Somerville’s mother was Elizabeth Cannon Lethbridge (d. 1765), the daughter of Mary Southey (1704–1789) and niece of
                  John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). The latter had inherited the Fitzhead estate in Somerset from his mother, Mary Cannon (1678–1738). On
                  his death, John Cannon Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville his primary heir, and Southey’s father
                  and two uncles the residuary legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three Southey brothers only
                  Southey’s father married, leading the poet to believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that he and his brothers
                  were now the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate.</note> Shortly afterwards I went to London<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey visited London in May–June 1820.</note> &amp; the result of my legal enquiries there was, that owing to the
               clumsy manner in which a will was drawn up, estates to the value of a thousand a year in Somersetshire which according to the clear
               instruction of the testator ought now to have devolved upon me, <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;had been&gt; adjudged<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">There were a number of legal disputes over the Fitzhead estate; Southey is here probably referring to the case

                  (1789–1857). They had no blood ties to the Southeys.</note> – so that the whole is gone to a different family. You know me well
               enough to believe that this never deprived me of an hours sleep nor a moments peace of mind. The only ill effect was that I fancied
               your letter had been answered, &amp; wondered I did not hear from you again, – which wonder, nothing but never-ending business has

                  had become increasingly reclusive. As an obituary explained, ‘he for many years secluded himself from general society, and appeared
                  wholly indifferent to the habits of Academical life’, <title>Gentleman’s Magazine</title>, 147 (March 1830), 279. </note> The
