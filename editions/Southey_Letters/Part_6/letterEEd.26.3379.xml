					in structure that with which the second volume of my Minor Poems concludes.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s duty as Poet Laureate was to produce a New Year’s Ode for 1820; his ode was later published as ‘The
						Warning Voice. Ode I’ in <title>The Englishman’s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and
							National Information</title> (London, 1824), pp. 381–383. Here Southey compares this poem with his ‘Ode, Written
						in December, 1814’, published in <title>Minor Poems</title>, 2 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 227–238. This poem had
						proved too controversial to serve as the New Year’s Ode for which it was intended.</note> This is a subject upon
					which I feel that I could write well in prose, – but <hi rend="ital">cui bono</hi>? – <hi rend="ital">Cui
						malo</hi><note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘To whose benefit?’ and ‘To whose harm?’</note> is very obvious,
					for it would be to the consumption of time which ought to be more profitably employed. And yet my fingers itch to
					begin a series of letters under some <hi rend="ital">nom de guerre</hi> in the Courier.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write these pseudonymous letters. </note></p><p rend="indent1"> The ‘rejected address’ was printed in the London papers as read by <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> at the Kendal meeting, &amp; commented upon by him.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A County Meeting for Westmorland was held at Kendal on 21 October 1819 to
						protest against the authorities’ actions at the ‘Peterloo’ meeting in Manchester on 16 August 1819, which led to
						eleven deaths. Brougham was present, and read out and denounced the rival pro-government Loyal Address which
						Southey had written (though Brougham was unaware of its author). He remarked that the Address ‘is very long
						indeed, and extremely dull’, and described its authors as ‘fawning sycophants’ who had produced a ‘slavish’
						document, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 26 October 1819. The entire address had been leaked to, and printed
						by, the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 23 October 1819.</note> If a letter of mine upon those comments should
					be inserted in one of the Kendal papers I will send it for your perusal.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey responded to Brougham’s speech with his, [Robert Southey] to Henry Brougham, [before 6 November 1819],
						Letter 3381, published in the <title>Westmorland Gazette</title>, 13 November 1819, signed ‘VINDEX’.</note> – The
					danger is from the imbecillity of the Administration. Lord Sidmouth<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry
						Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth (1757–1844; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1801–1804, Home Secretary
						1812–1822. Southey had met him on 26 April 1817 at the house of Robert Harry Inglis.</note> I know saw the danger
					clearly in 1817, &amp; was disposed to act resolutely, but <ref type="m" target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord
						Liverpool</ref>, tho I verily believe him in ordinary times to be the best statesman we have, is of all men the
					most unfit for a time of danger, for he is timid irresolute &amp; cold as an icicle. Things therefore must be worse

					circumstanced as to be able to transplant <hi rend="ital">omnia mea mecum</hi>,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">‘All things with me’.</note> I should think seriously of moving into Switzerland, <del>xx</del>
					&lt;that being&gt; the country which let what will happen to the rest of Europe, is likely to be disturbed the least:
					&amp; the distance so easy that it would be always in our power to return.</p><p rend="indent1"> Meantime I do as the people did before the flood when the Ark was on the stocks,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Genesis</title> 6–8 in which the patriarch, Noah, was instructed by God to
						build an Ark to preserve life on earth from a devastating flood.</note> eat, drink, <del>x</del> go on with my
					usual employments, &amp; sleep – as if things were to last my time. If the Radicals bring the matter to blows soon,
					they will be put down, &amp; we shall be left no worse than we were, with a great advantage for Government if it
					knew how to profit thereby. But the longer revolutionary principles are allowed to be disseminated, the greater
					will be the danger, – for in the end they will make it a struggle between youth &amp; age, &amp; then the weakest
					must go to the wall. Upon this subject I think I could write in a way which would raise <ref type="m" target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord Liverpools</ref> pulse, &amp; make <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Prince</ref> rub his eyes.</p><p rend="indent1"> Let <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Osiris</ref> <hi rend="ital">order</hi> <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> not to go to the Office.
