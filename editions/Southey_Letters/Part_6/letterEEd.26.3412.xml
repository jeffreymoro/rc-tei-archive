Mine has had but an inauspicious beginning. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> was seized with a bilious attack on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> &amp; it is but just now that we can pronounce him, I hope, to be recovering. The recovery however will
					be sadly impeded by an endemic catarrh &amp; cough, with which <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">the
						mother</ref> &amp; all the children are at this time affected, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> to boot. As yet I have escaped, but I have
					suffered much from anxiety, &amp; was laid up the whole of yesterday by a sick headache. It gave me however the
					first opportunity of trying an experiment which I give myself credit for devising, – that of taking milk &amp;
					water, instead of warm water only, when vomiting is to be excited. I thought this would take off the edge of the
					acidity, &amp; preserve the throat from that excoriating sensation <del>t</del> which this operation had always
					before produced. It succeeded perfectly. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> who likes a
					physical fact will be pleased with this; &amp; reasoning from this, I think a draught of milk might very probably
					remove the heart-burn.</p><p rend="indent1"> I told you that I had returned to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> draught for my last paper.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of Thomas Fosbrooke (1770–1842; <title>DNB</title>),

					has not yet thought proper to take the least notice of this, – so I suppose he is chewing the cud in anger, – tho
					angry he had no occasion to be, as I took the matter <hi rend="ital">bonâ fide</hi> to be a mistake on his part.
					This is now plainly not the case. I should like you to ask <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> whether he received my letter with the draft, that I may be quite sure it reached him. – I repent
