                  Sir John Nicholl (1759–1838), MP for Penryn 1802–1806, MP for Hastings 1806–1807, MP for Great Bedwyn 1807–1821, 1822–1832,
                  ecclesiastical lawyer and Dean of the Court of Arches 1809–1834. Heber was, in particular, accused of favouring Catholic
                  Emancipation. Peachy was entitled to vote in this contest as he possessed both Bachelor of Civil Law (1790) and Doctor of Civil Law
                  (1813) degrees from Oxford. </note> should be a hard one, I hope you may be induced to go. As there is no political difference

               neither fit to live nor to die. In the affair of the funeral the Radicals have outdone their usual out doings. Surely that business was
               sadly mismanagement, – the body should have been shipt off in the state barge from the garden of Brandenburgh House to Woolwich.<note n="30" place="foot" resp="editors">The government feared Queen Caroline’s funeral procession on 14 August would provoke disorder and
                  radical demonstrations and ordered the cortege to avoid the City of London on its route to Harwich, where the Queen’s body was to
                  embark for Germany and burial in Brunswick Cathedral. However, crowds in London forced the procession to alter its route and go
                  through the City. Soldiers forming the Queen’s honour guard opened fire on the crowd and two people were killed.</note> – The
