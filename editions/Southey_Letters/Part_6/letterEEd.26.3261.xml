					he saw in a plain trustworthy manner, chose to embody his knowledge in the shape of a novel. Felix Alvares is the
					name of the book &amp; it is worth looking at, for the manners are faithful, &amp; a great many anecdotes of the

						Philip III (1578–1621; King of Spain and Portugal 1598–1621). This manuscript had been brought to Southey’s
