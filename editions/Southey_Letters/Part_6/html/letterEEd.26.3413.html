               On his death, John Cannon Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named
               Somerville his primary heir and, should he die without heirs, Southey’s father and
               two uncles as the residuary legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children.
               Of the three Southey brothers only Southey’s father married, leading the poet (encouraged
               by his Aunt Mary) to believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that
               he and his brothers were now the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate. Southey was
               the heir at law of John Cannon Southey, i.e. he was entitled to inherit his real property
               if he was intestate. However, this did not help Southey’s claim on the Fitzhead property.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               The family of the Earls of Coventry held the Lordship of the local manor under a similar
               system, i.e. for the term of a number of named lives, one of which at this time was
               George III (1738–1820; King of Great Britain 1760–1820; <em>DNB</em>). As Lords of the Manor they held certain rights over property in Fitzhead.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               estate. The Beadons went on to consolidate their holdings in the area, when in 1824
               Richard Beadon (the Bishop’s son) bought the Somerville (formerly Cannon Southey)
               lands in Milverton and Wivelscombe, including Preston farm. These were the fourth
