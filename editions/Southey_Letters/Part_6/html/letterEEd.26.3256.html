                  </div> my dear Sir, affects me greatly. It <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> represents a state of mind into which I also should have fallen had it not been for
                  that support, which you are not disposed to think necessary for the soul of man. I
                  too identified my own hopes with hopes for mankind, &amp; at the price of any self-sacrifice
                  would have promoted the good of my fellow creatures. I too have been disappointed,
                  – in being undeceived; but having learnt to temper hope with patience, &amp; when I lift
                  up my spirit to its Creator &amp; Redeemer – to say, not with the lips alone but with
                  the heart, thy will be done,

            <p class="indent1">O Sir! religion is the one thing needful, – without it no one can be truly happy &lt;(do
               you not <span class="ital">feel</span> this?)&gt; with it no one can be entirely miserable. Without it, this <span class="strikethrough">whole frame of things</span> &lt;world&gt; would be a mystery too dreadful to be borne. <span class="strikethrough">Xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx</span> our best affections &amp; our noblest desires a mere juggle &amp; a curse, – &amp; it were better
               indeed to be nothing than the things we are. I am no bigot, – I believe that men will
               be judged by their actions &amp; intentions, not their creeds. I am a Christian, &amp; so
               will Turk, Jew &amp; Gentile be in Heaven, if they have lived well according to the light
               which was vouchsafed them. I do not fear that there will be a great gulph between
               you &amp; me in the world which we must both enter, but if I could persuade you to look
               on towards that world with the eyes of faith, a change would be operated in all your
               views &amp; feelings, &amp; hope &amp; joy &amp; love would be with you to your last breath, – <span class="strikethrough">x</span> universal love, – love for mankind, &amp; for the Universal Father into whose hands you
               are about to render up your spirit.</p>
            <p class="indent1">That the natural world by its perfect order displays evident marks of design, I think
               you would readily admit; – for it is so palpable that it can only be disputed from
               perverseness or affectation. Is it not reasonable to <span class="strikethrough">bel</span> suppose that the moral order of things should in like manner be coherent &amp; harmonious?
               – It is so if there be a state of retribution after death. If that be granted every
               thing becomes intelligible, just, beautiful &amp; good. <span class="strikethrough">Xxx xxxx happxxxxx xxxxx</span> Would you not from the sense of fitness &amp; of justice wish that it should be so? And
               is there not enough of Wisdom &amp; of Power apparent in the creation to authorize us
               in inferring, that whatever upon the grand scale would be best, therefore must be?
               Pursue this feeling, – &amp; it will lead you to the Cross of Christ.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I never <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> fear to avow my belief that warnings from the other world are sometimes communicated
                  to us in this, &amp; that absurd as the stories of apparitions generally are, they are
                  not always false, – but that the spirits of the dead have sometimes been permitted
                  &lt;to&gt; appear. I believe this because I cannot refuse my assent to the evidence which
                  exists of such things, &amp; to the universal consent of all men, who have not <span class="ital">learnt</span> to think otherwise. Perhaps you will not despise this <span class="strikethrough">opinion</span> as a mere superstition when I say that Kant, the profoundest thinker of modern ages,
                  came by the severest reasoning to the same conclusion.
