                  A great many of the persons who usually write to me on such occasions are just now
                  waiting to see which way the wind of public opinion will set in. But among the poets
                  I may call for a division &amp; count a majority.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am very much amused at your account of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> &amp; the literatuli, &amp; at their concern for my devoted head. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</a> had deserved more than this at my hands;

                           published by Murray. The coruscating and hilarious ‘Dedication’, which attacked Southey
                           and others, had been suppressed (and was not published until 1833), but Southey undoubtedly
                           knew of its existence. His response was A Vision of Judgement (London, 1821), ‘Preface’,
                           pp. xvii–xxii, where he denounced ‘the Satanic school’ of poetry without naming any
                           one poet.</span></div>
                  </div> but what I have written proceeded from a sense of duty, not from any personal resentment,
                  – if any personal feeling existed, it was a latent apprehension that some undeserved
                  censure might attach to me for the scandalous silence of the QR. concerning Don Juan.
                  As for <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</a> anticipated contest I have no itch for controversy &amp; will never be drawn into one.

                           Southey responded with his letter to the Editor of the Courier (5 January 1822). The
                           letter appeared in the Courier on 11 January 1822. Byron’s parody, The Vision of Judgment
                           (1822), however, provided him with a crushing victory.</span></div>

                  newspapers, from the language held in Parliament, &amp; from the foreign journals printed
                  in England, – to these latter the movements in Portugal &amp; Brazil may directly be ascribed.
