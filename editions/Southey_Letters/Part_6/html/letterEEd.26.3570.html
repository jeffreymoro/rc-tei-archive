                  the H Commons where it would certainly have been thrown out on the first reading.
                  For reckoning upon a like proportion of Whigs &amp; Cowards in both houses, you would
                  have the Radical Members to aid them, &amp; the <span class="strikethrough">x</span> greater number of Members for large towns, who as they must either <span class="strikethrough">have</span> vote<span class="strikethrough">d</span> with the Mob, or lose their seats at the next election, would have found some specious
                  excuse for obeying the will of the rabble. – Ministers therefore no doubt would gladly
                  let the matter rest, but this will not be in their power. The Queen is in the hands
                  of a gang (rather than a party) who will go any lengths to bring about a revolution,
                  &amp; she is ready enough to go all lengths with them. So much the better if this accelerates
                  the crisis, for the longer that crisis is delayed the more perilous it will be.</p>
