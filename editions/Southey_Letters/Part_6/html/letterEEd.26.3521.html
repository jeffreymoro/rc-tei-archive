                           1819. Somerville had inherited the Fitzhead estate in Somerset from his great-uncle
                           John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). On his death, John Cannon Southey had left a complex,
                           ill-advised will which named Somerville his primary heir and, should Somerville die
                           without heirs, Robert Southey’s father and two uncles as the residuary legatees, their

                  it a great advantage, for if my mind does not flow freely on one subject, or I do
                  not perceive how to arrange either the argument, or the narrative, – instead of persisting
                  doggedly against the grain, I lay the paper by, &amp; turn to something else that the

         <div class="note" id="Note1"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">The first part of the letter deals with Southey’s continuing attempts to discover
               if he, and his brothers, might benefit from the estate of their third cousin John
               Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765–1819; <em>DNB</em>), who had died on 5 October 1819. Somerville had inherited the Fitzhead estate in
               Somerset from his great-uncle John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). On his death, John Cannon
               Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville his primary heir
               and, should Somerville die without heirs, Robert Southey’s father and two uncles as
               the residuary legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three
               Southey brothers only the Poet Laureate’s father married, leading the Poet Laureate
               to believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that he and his brothers
               were now the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               family, whose head was James, 13th Lord Somerville (1698–1765) and from whom these
               estates had descended to his grandson, John Southey Somerville.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
