                           as ‘Innovations’ in the form of worship in the Church of England, including ‘all corporal

                           or towards the Communion-table’. The House of Lords refused to agree to this Declaration,
                           but the Commons ordered its publication anyway.</span></div>

                           Dering on Matters of Religion (1642) was ordered by parliament to be burnt, and he
                           was briefly imprisoned on 4 February 1642. Southey quoted at length from Dering’s
                           speech against the banning of bowing at the name of Jesus in The Book of the Church,
                           2 vols (London, 1824), II, pp. 372–374.</span></div>
                  </div> This decree was subsequent to the Irish Massacre. The fact which the Jesuit might
                  have dwelt upon with advantage is, that the intolerance of the Parliament, seeking
                  to enforce the penalty of death against recusant Priests, when Charles, like his father,
                  was inclined to toleration, gave a pretext for the rebellion, &amp; furnished those who
                  instigated it with means for alarming &amp; enraging the populace.

                           However, only seven Catholic priests were executed in the reign of James I (1566–1625;
                           King of Great Britain 1603–1625; DNB). Only two were executed in the reign of his
