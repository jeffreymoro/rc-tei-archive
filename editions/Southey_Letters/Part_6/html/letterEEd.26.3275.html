                  </div> It is curious as showing the strange method of keeping an issue open in Portugal at
                  that time, – or rather of promoting a discharge. The time must have been in the first
                  part of the 16<sup>th</sup> century – for the fact was sworn to, among other miracles when, between the years
                  1550 &amp; 1555 depositions were taken preparatory to the canonization of S Gonsalo De

                  suckle these captives, when they are so young as to require the breast. – The chapter

                  ibidem coagulato, ut medicis omnia exquisita sanitatis remedia tentantibus, omnino

                  medicis et chirurgis fuerat excogitata, longitudinis digitalis, quâ in putridæ carnis
                  hiatum immissâ, interius sanguinis putor foras ut efflueret conabantur. Post aliquot

                  medici varia remedia adhibentes non solum non extrahere, sed nec etiam ut appareret

                  fasciis et linamentis medicinalibus sponte suâ adhærentem invenerunt. Denique ne dubium

               labour had been completely fruitless. A period of one whole year had now gone by while
               that sore was being treated. And, in order to restore her health, a lead pipe had
               been devised by the doctors and surgeons, of a finger’s length; after inserting this
               into an opening in the putrid flesh, they were trying to make the putridity of the
               blood inside flow out. However, after a few days, since the sore was creeping further
               inside, the pipe buried itself so far in that the doctors, employing various remedies,
               were unable not only to extract it, but even, as it seemed, to achieve anything by
               any means. So that lead instrument lay hidden within her breast for a period of five
               months. At length, the surgeons, who now desired only to relieve the mortal danger,
               by common agreement decreed that an incision must be made in the woman’s breast. After
               that final judgement had already been passed by them, the illustrious man Joannes
               de Souza, her father-in-law, arrived in order to visit the sick woman, and on learning
               of the doctors’ deliberation, suffering along with his sick daughter-in-law, he began
               to advise her, with words full of faith, that she should voluntarily entrust herself
               to Blessed Gondisalvus Amaranthus, as though to a celestial and most esteemed doctor,
               to be looked after. At once the afflicted matron obeyed the words of her father-in-law,
               and acquiescing with his advice, made a vow to D. Gondesalvus, accompanied by her
               whole family. And then, when tears had sprung up, she began to pour out humble prayers
               that she might escape the danger of death and recover her former health. Why say more?
               On that selfsame day, when the doctors and surgeons had come at Vespers time and taken
               off the plaster that had been placed on the woman’s breast to cleanse the humour,
               they found that the pipe, which had been concealed for such a long time, was clinging
               of its own accord to the bandages and medical linens. Finally, lest there should arise
               any doubt that D Gondisalvus did this by his merits, within the space of just eight
               days she saw herself most completely healed.’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
