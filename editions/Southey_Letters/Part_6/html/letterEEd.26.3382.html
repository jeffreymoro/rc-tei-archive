               of his remainder. My father was too angry at the proposal to enquire who sent him.
               He always believed that his children had their chance in the lottery of life, &amp; I
               believe common opinion in Somersetshire has always magnified that chance much beyond
               its real value; if it be now of any value.</p>

               <p>To myself it is of very little consequence. My habits of labour are so fixed, that
                  whether I wrote for a subsistence or not I should be just as deeply engaged in the
                  press, &amp; the only difference would be that I should give up reviewing, – &amp; become
                  perfectly indifferent to the sale of my books as a matter of profit. – I am older
                  in constitution that in years, – &amp; older in heart than in constitution. And I believe
                  that if it were not for my children I should not bestow even the thought that a mere
                  enquiry occasions concerning any worldly inheritance. Six feet by three in the N.W
