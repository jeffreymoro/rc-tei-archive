                           1819. His obituary in the Gentleman’s Magazine, 89 (October 1819), 374, noted he had
                           left a wife, Anne Page, née Davis (1780–1820), and nine children, ‘very slenderly
                           provided for’. This was despite Davis holding a number of clerical appointments, including
                           Vicar of Willen, Buckinghamshire 1806–1819, Vicar of Steventon, Berkshire, and Rector

            <p class="indent1">I thank you for your solicitude concerning my readiness to give. But you do not know
               when I turn a deaf ear. The case of poor Pages family is the only one in which I had
               not a cogent motive, – then perhaps there was no better one than a regard to appearance,
               – a tax &lt;to&gt; which I have paid less in the course of my life than any other person.

               he may not want for necessaries while in health, nor for comforts (as far as they
               can be procured) when health fails him. I think it very likely that he may be consumptive:
