               <p>Here I am 250 miles from home, &amp; in no very comfortable state. One of the tumours
                  on my head which I offered to the knife in London but was advised to let alone has
                  suppurated. This process did not begin till we had left Edinburgh. When I reached

                           to be sure of Miss Pigott’s identity, but she might have been Emma Pigott (dates unknown),
                           younger daughter and co-heiress of James Pigott (d. 1822) of Fitz-Hall, Iping, Sussex.
                           Fitz-Hall was only five miles from Susannah Rickman’s home at Harting. Emma Pigott
                           married, in 1824, Edward Brice Bunny (d. 1867) of Speen Hill, Berkshire.</span></div>
                  </div> while they went to inspect some works to the Westward, &amp; I went to the nearest Apothecarys
                  to have the tumour dressed. A decent man with an honest face

                  </div> officiated, but withal told me then in the morning his brother, who was of the medical
                  profession, would be there. And the said brother this morning wanted to enlarge the
                  orifice &amp; tells me that it may probably inflame &lt;talked of communicating with the
                  dura mater &amp; so forth&gt;. I proposed to set off homeward, – but he said this was not
                  necessary, – &amp; on the whole I concluded that he wanted to keep me under his hands,
                  &amp; finding that if I was to be laid up my resolution was that it should be in my own
                  house, – he changed his note, &amp; said I might as well proceed. I do not like the man
                  because he manifestly endeavoured to deceive me, saying that the contents of the tumour
                  could not suppurate, because they were without vitality – when they are suppurating.
                  So too he says there can be no healing till a wound is made by art, &amp; tho I suspect
                  it is doing injustice to Nature who has made one for herself, &amp; if I reason justly
                  would be likely when the obnoxious matter was got rid off to set about healing <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> it without the assistance of an Aberdeen Laboratory-keeper, – <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> (you must know that Apothecary in Scotland signifies an Oil &amp; Colour Man.)

                  </div> – On the whole therefore I am inclined to pursue my journey, thinking that easy stages
                  (we travel with the same horses &amp; therefore cannot exceed 35 miles <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> a day) are less likely to produce harm than two days &amp; nights of mail coaching.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">But it is not easy to make up my mind, &amp; come to any decision under these circumstances.
               You know how little I am in the habit of complaining. I said nothing of this matter
               to any person of the party, till we reached Taymouth, &amp; then perceiving that it had
               broke, I desired <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TelfordThomas">Telford</a> who slept in the room with me by accident that night, to look at it. No one else
               has heard of it yet – merely because we thought it best not to give them any uncomfortable
               feelings about me, – my hair is long enough to cover the lint, so that it has not
               been observed. But I begin to think that they ought to be told &amp; consulted, – &amp; that
               it is not fair to proceed with them, with such a chance of being laid up on the way.
               – In short I am perplexed &amp; uneasy, &amp; heartily wish I were either at home, or in London.
               At present I have no pain, &amp; endure no other inconvenience than that I cannot lie
               on my right side nor clean my hair properly as I use to do. It will be a week before
               we reach Inverness, – there I can either obtain advice if needful, or get into the
               stage for Edinburgh, – but after all the proper course will be to enquire who is the
               best surgeon here, &amp; consult him at once, &amp; act upon his opinion, – that is as to
               advancing or returning, – for as for <span class="strikethrough">lay</span> lying by at an Inn, that I will never do <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx xxx</span> &lt;unless&gt; it becomes inevitable.</p>

               I had not heard of his fathers death. I saw his good little wife &amp; D<sup>r</sup> &amp; M<sup>rs</sup> Wood, – they were very <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> kind to me – &amp; I was sorry that I had only an hour to pass with them.</p>

               is of a kind, frank, chearful, generous nature, – &amp; seems to take as much interest
               in looking <span class="strikethrough">the</span> after the vile <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> sore upon my pericranium, as in inspecting any of his own stupendous works.</p>
            <p class="indent1">If there be any money forthcoming for me at the Exchequer, you may send it to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a>. I cannot tell you where to direct to me, we have such a zig-zag course before us,
