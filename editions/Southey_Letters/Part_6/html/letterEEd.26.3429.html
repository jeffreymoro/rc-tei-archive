                  I can advance more than I should chuse to make myself responsible for, without occasion.
                  I shall bring together <span class="strikethrough">a great</span> some curious historical matter, &amp; relieve the subject by interspersing a few pieces
                  of poetry, (as Boethius has done, from whom indeed the conception of the book was
                  taken)

                  it may be worth while to give the volume an attractive appearance by a few views,

                  </div> I have very little doubt that it will excite considerable attention, &amp; lead many persons
                  into a wholesome train of thought. The first dialogue in which the Ghost introduces
