                  You have now to expect pleasures &amp; anxieties altogether different from any that you
                  have ever felt before. So different indeed is the parental affection from every other,
                  that it seems to show more aptly than any other illustration, how possible it is that
                  man may contain within him <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> instincts &amp; senses which are not evolved in this state of being, but will be developed
