                  the war with conscientious virulence, &amp; think it their duty to exterminate each other.
                  I do not think there will be any such struggle in Portugal: – but there may probably
                  be a separation from Brazil, which will leave the country helpless.

                           demands for the monarchy to return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807–1808. This
                           process led to the separation of Portugal and Brazil in 1822, though Brazil did not
                           become a republic, or split into separate states.</span></div>
                  </div> And if the revolution extends to Brazil, as may reasonably be apprehended, that country
                  will be split into as many republics as there may be successful adventurers to place
                  themselves at the head of a sufficient number of bandits to call themselves an army.
                  – Look where we will, I see nothing but evil aspects. Yet I am less alarmed at the
                  home prospect than those persons with whom I converse or correspond. I think that
                  the length <span class="strikethrough">of the</span> to which the business must be protracted, will tire that beast the people; – that
                  the men of property who <span class="strikethrough">do</span> are not actually aiming at a revolution, will be afraid of one &amp; bestir themselves
                  in time; – that many persons who were at first deluded have been convinced that the
                  Queen is guilty, as much by her conduct during the inquiry as by the evidence, &amp; perhaps
                  more so; – &amp; if these considerations do not suffice to dispel any gloomy apprehensions
                  – I fly to the good old saying God’s above, &amp; rest <span class="strikethrough">upon them</span> there as in a strong hold. This I think certain that the license of the press will
                  not continue much longer. For Government must restrain it; or be destroyed; &amp; in case <span class="strikethrough">of its destr</span> the Press should triumph &amp; effect its object, we know that the first act of a Revolutionary
                  Government will be to bind it in fetters of iron. I believe there will not be a free
