                  it is drawn are not accessible, for the greater part. There existed no history of
                  that great region before I undertook the subject; &amp; <span class="strikethrough">now there is no part of the world of which so</span> &amp; I have embodied in it more facts relating to the aboriginal inhabitants, more details

                  interest it will promise to the great mass of the public. And I expect from it neither
                  popularity nor profit in my own time. But it must make its way slowly &amp; surely, &amp;
                  become a standard book (setting all other merits aside, whatever they may be) for
