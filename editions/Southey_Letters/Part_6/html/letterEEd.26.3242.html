            </div>
            <p class="indent1">…. notwithstanding the marvellous mildness of the season. Marvellous it may well be
               called. The summits of the mountains were free of snow till the last week in January;
               what had fallen before that time had never remained twelve hours. The valley has only
               been whitened once, and then only inch-deep, and for half a day, and the ground has
               never been hard frozen. We had a greater variety of flowers at Christmas than April
               in all likelihood will supply. </p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You are going to Switzerland, I hear, and though we shall miss you in the autumn,
                  I am glad that you have determined upon an excursion which will give you so much pleasure,
                  and concerning which I shall have so much pleasure in talking with you. Whatever route
                  you may take, I hope you will not omit the ride from Meiringhen to Sarnen, the lake
                  and valley of Lungern being (Interlaken <span class="ital">perhaps</span> alone excepted) the loveliest scene which I remember in the country. And the little
                  valleys which you cross in passing the Brunig are the very perfection of pastoral
                  scenery. But I am particularly desirous that you should see the Flying Tree,—the most
                  astonishing thing that I have ever seen, or ever expect to see.

                           July 1817. There he saw the eight-miles-long ‘Slide of Alpnach’, erected to convey
                           logged spruce trees from the mountainside to the lake below. The trough, a feat of
                           engineering supported on a timber frame over several ravines, was so angled as to
                           transport the tree trunks from forest to shore in no more than six minutes.</span></div>
                  </div> I have very much repented that we did not remain a day for the purpose of seeing the
                  scaffolding both in the mountain where it begins, and at the river where it terminates.
                  It is about two miles from Sarnen, on the way to Alpnach. Let me also recommend to
                  you our Unterseen guide, Hans Roth,

                  </div> for whose good-nature and good qualities <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a> will vouch, and whose honest countenance will recommend itself. He was ten days in
                  our company, and we were so attached to him that we were quite sorry when the time
                  of parting came.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I fear you will see our country with altered eyes when you return to it, though I
               can perfectly understand why it is in some respects more suited to a painter’s purposes.
               But Switzerland excels as much in beauty as in grandeur. I do not envy the magnitude
               of its mountains, for which far too great a price is paid, in the perpetual insecurity
               which they occasion (to say nothing of the foul waters which they produce), but there
               is a beauty in the softer scenery which may well be envied, and in the Alpine valleys
               a charm altogether peculiar. I am now remembering more particularly those which lie
               between Martigny and Chamouny. </p>

                  twice in the Magazines with much worse fortune: once they made me like a Calvinist
