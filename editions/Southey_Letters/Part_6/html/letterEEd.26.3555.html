                           to the refusal by a bank in London to pay a bill of exchange presented on Southey’s
                           behalf because an incorrect (and higher) sum had been entered on the bill. It therefore
                           looked as if Southey had deliberately, and fraudulently, overcharged for his services.
                           The money Southey was owed was payment for writing an ‘account’ of David Pike Watts
                           (1754–1816), a fabulously rich wine merchant and philanthropist, who had been an important

                  entitled to such a sum.

                  to accept the Bill <span class="ital">which I presented to them</span> &amp;c. The inference seems to be that they accepted it at first conditionally, – as it
                  was drawn (“as you have been or <span class="ital">may be</span> advised) – that they wrote concerning it to Ilam, &amp; received the advice which led
                  to its rejection. This seems to be the natural inference, &amp; yet I can hardly think
                  it possible. For if I had drawn beyond the intended amount M<sup>rs</sup> WR would surely have concluded there was a mistake somewhere, not that I could have
                  committed <span class="strikethrough">an action</span> a fraudulent &amp; scandalous action. But however that may be, my character is brought

               <p>For the first time in my life I am utterly at a loss how to act. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> is at this time too closely engaged at the Exchequer, &amp; also too much an invalid to
                  go to the Bankers, – &amp; indeed to enter into explanation with them, &amp; ask their permission
                  to draw for the smaller sum, would be <span class="strikethrough">to xxxx</span> &lt;like&gt; putting myself on my defence, &amp; expressing a doubt whether that permission
                  might be granted. With the business of protesting it I had, as you know, nothing to
                  do, – except to feel the whole impropriety &amp; the whole inconvenience. The bill is
                  in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedfords</a> hands, I can desire him to burn it &amp; to pay the costs incurred, &amp; I am inclined to
                  think that the best – &amp; only course I can pursue is to do this, &amp; let the matter rest,
                  till you have an opportunity of explaining it. The money would have come seasonably,
                  – but come when it may now, it will be dearly earned, this vexation being taken into
                  the account.
