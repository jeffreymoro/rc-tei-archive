                           send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew up a conservative response – an
                           Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the
                           press; see Southey to Humphrey Senhouse, [15 October 1819], Letter 3366. The tone
                           and content of the Address were objected to by moderate supporters of the government

                  therefore worth while to enter into an explanation of what was laid aside: – in all
                  such cases to need explanation is fault enough. The fault at Manchester, according
                  to what I have heard, was in employing the yeomanry instead of the regular troops.

                           at St Peter’s Field on 16 August 1819, the task was delegated to the Manchester and
                           Salford Yeomanry, a body of upper-class local volunteers; they began to attack the
                           crowd indiscriminately, and the crowd responded by throwing brickbats at the Yeomanry.
                           Finally, the meeting was dispersed by regular troops, primarily the 15th Hussars.</span></div>
                  </div> This was obviously done as appearing <span class="strikethrough">the</span> least obnoxious But after bearing a great deal of outrage &amp; injury, they lost their
                  temper, which disciplined soldiers would not have done, &amp; did more mischief than was
                  necessary in dispersing the rascally rabble. This account is probable, &amp; came to me
                  upon good authority. I do not believe that the Magistrates committed any other error.
                  The illegality of the meeting, if any meeting can be illegal, is plain; &amp; the civil
                  power was not sufficient to execute the warrant. But enough of this. Whether the crisis
                  of this distemper is at hand we shall soon see. The sooner it comes the better, for
                  I have not that confidence either in the foresight, or in the resolution of the Ministers
                  to believe that that they will take such measures as might avert it. My advice would
                  be not to suspend the Habeas Corpus,

               a County Meeting on 13 October 1819 to protest at the local authorities’ actions and
               send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew up a conservative response – an
               Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the
               press; see Southey to Humphrey Senhouse, [15 October 1819], Letter 3366. The tone
               and content of the Address were objected to by moderate supporters of the government
               in the Lake District, led by Thomas Wallace (1768–1844; <em>DNB</em>), MP for various seats 1790–1828, including Cockermouth 1813–1818, member of the
               Board of Control 1807–1816, Vice-President of the Board of Trade 1818–1823, and later
               1st Baron Wallace. Southey’s Address was suppressed and Wallace drew up a replacement,
               which was published in the <em>Morning Chronicle</em> on 29 October 1819; it was notably circumspect in its reference to events at ‘Peterloo’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville as his primary
