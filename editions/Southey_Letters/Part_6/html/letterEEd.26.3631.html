               <p>It gave me very great pleasure to receive a letter from you, – to hear than you are

                           Hill had been born in 1809, which meant he would usually have been placed in the third
                           form.</span></div>
                  </div> (which, judging from your age, is higher than I had expected) – that you are in the
                  room with the head of the house, (which is a great advantage in point of comfort,)
                  &amp; that you have so kind a friend in my good friend M<sup>r</sup> Knox,

                  passed since I was in that form where you are now, &amp; I perceive by your letter that
                  the school (like every thing else) has undergone some changes during that time. Three
                  &amp; thirty years hence, Edward, when thro the mercy of God I shall be in a better world,
                  you I hope may look back upon Westminster with as much satisfaction as I do now, for
