                           (1774–1827; DNB), Scottish publisher, bookseller and stationer, for ‘a collection
                           of original dispatches from the home Government to D. Luiz de Sousa, during his administration
                           of Brazil’. Luis de Sousa, Conde do Prado (c. 1580–1643) was Governor-General of Brazil
                           1617–1621 in the reign of Philip III (1578–1621; King of Spain and Portugal 1598–1621).

                  you see to what a bulk it has grown under my hands.

                  of the United States, – &amp; that the Brazilians have accomplished more in proportion

                  a return to its true principles, &amp; the enforcement of good laws, – equally to the
