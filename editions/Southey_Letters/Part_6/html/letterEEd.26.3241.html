               discovered in Denmark, seized with a disorder of mind that is extremely dangerous
               to society. This is an imagination, that, by committing premeditated murder, and being
               afterwards condemned to die for it, they are better able, by public marks of repentance
               and conversion, as they go to the scaffold, to prepare themselves for death, and work
               out their own salvation. A little while ago, one of these wretches murdered a child
               out of the same principle. In order, however, to take from these wretches all hope
               of obtaining their end, and to extirpate the evil, the king has issued an ordinance,
               by which his majesty forbids the punishing them with death; and enacts, that they
               shall be branded in the forehead with an hot iron, and whipped: that they shall afterwards
               be confined, for the rest of their days, in an house of correction, in order to be
