                  </div> One means of keeping the Press within tolerable bounds has frequently occurred to
                  me; it is that printers &amp; booksellers should be licensed, &amp; lose their license upon
                  conviction for libel. They are the only body of tradesmen who have a class of avowed
                  rascals belonging to them, fellows that live by such arts of piracy as the law cannot
                  reach, publishing catchpenny works under false names (Robert Sout<span class="ital">hy</span> to wit)

                  to bring home to him the fact of the publication. Now surely when a man thus publicly
                  avows his act &amp; deed, it would be very reasonable that he should brought to trial
                  for it, &amp; convicted, unless he could prove upon trial either that he was not the author,
