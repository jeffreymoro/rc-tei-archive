                  copy which has been sent to me is a fragment, beginning with an imperfect sentence,
                  thus, “believe him insincere – &amp; ending also imperfectly, thus, – “&amp; be still kindly
                  affected to her &amp;c.” – It appears from M<sup>r</sup> Wesley’s published correspondence that he had a correspondent of that name, at the
                  time when he separated from his wife. – May I request, if you possess the letter &amp;
                  it be perfect, that you will favour me with the beginning &amp; the end of it, – so as
                  to supply what is wanting in this copy.
