               <p>The house was in Walcot parish, in what five &amp; forty years ago was the skirts of the

                  was thought a bad one, because of the approach, &amp; because the nearest houses were
                  of a mean description: in other respects it was a very desirable residence. The house
                  had been quite in the country when it was built; one of its fronts looked into the
                  garden, the other <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> into a lower garden, &amp; over other garden grounds, to the river, Bath wick fields –

                  The dead wall of a dwelling house which formed one side of the garden-enclosure was

               travel writer Philip Thicknesse (1719–1792; <em>DNB</em>). Schomberg left Bath under a cloud, eventually settling in Reading, where he died
