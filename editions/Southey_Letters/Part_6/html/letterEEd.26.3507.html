            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>There is no better proof that two fellow-travellers are upon a proper understanding
                  with each other, than when they travel together for a good length of time in silence,
                  each thinking his own thoughts, and neither of them feeling it necessary to open his
                  lips for the sake of politeness. So it is with real friends: I have not written to
                  congratulate you on your change of state
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Neville White had married Charlotte Sewell (1799–1873), daughter of Joseph Sewell
                           (1772–1844), a wealthy Norwich solicitor, on 12 January 1820.</span></div>
                  </div> till now, because I could not do it at leisure, I would not do it hastily, and <span class="ital">I knew</span> that <span class="ital">you knew</span> how completely every day, hour, and minute of my time must be occupied in London.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> Never, indeed, was I involved in a more incessant succession of wearying and worrying
                  engagements from morning till night, day after day, without intermission; here, there,
                  and everywhere, with perpetual changes of every kind, except the change of tranquillity
                  and rest. During an absence of nearly eleven weeks, I seldom slept more than three
                  nights successively in the same bed. At length, God be thanked, I am once more seated
                  by my own fireside – perhaps it is the only fire in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> at this time; but like a cat and a cricket, my habits or my nature have taught me
                  to love a warm hearth: so I sit with the windows open, and enjoy at the same time
                  the breath of the mountains and the heat of a sea-coal fire.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>And now, my dear Neville, I heartily wish you all that serious, sacred, and enduring
                  happiness in marriage which you have proposed to yourself, and which, as far as depends
                  upon yourself, you have every human probability of finding, and I make no doubt as
                  far as depends upon your consort also. Such drawbacks as are inseparable from our
                  present imperfect state, and such griefs as this poor flesh is heir to, you must sometimes
                  expect, and will know how to bear. But the highest temporal blessings as certainly
                  attend upon a well-regulated and virtuous course of conduct now, as they did during
                  the Mosaic dispensation;

                           but was still required to obey God’s laws, even without the hope of reward in a future
                           life.</span></div>
                  </div> for what other blessings are comparable to tranquillity of mind, resignation under
                  the afflictive dispensations of Providence, faith, hope, and that peace which passeth
                  all understanding?

                  </div> However bitter upon the palate the good man’s cup may be, this is the savour which
                  it leaves: whatever his future may be, his happiness depends upon himself, and must
                  be his own work. In this sense, I am sure you will be a happy man; may you be a fortunate
                  one also.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I had the comfort of finding all my family well, the children thoroughly recovered
               from the measles, though some of them somewhat thinner, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">the mother</a> a good deal so, from the anxiety and the fatigue which she had undergone during their
               illness. You hardly yet know how great a blessing it is for a family to have got through
               that disease; one of the passes perilous upon the pilgrimage of life. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</a> had not forgotten me; five minutes seemed to bring me to his recollection; he is
               just beginning to walk alone, – a fine, stout, good-humoured creature, with curling
               hair, and eyes full of intelligence. How difficult it is not to build one’s hopes
               upon a child like this.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am returned to a world of business; enough to intimidate any one of less habitual
                  industry, less resolution, or less hopefulness of spirit. My time will be sadly interrupted
                  by visitors who, with more or less claims, find their way to me during the season
                  from all parts. However, little by little, I shall get on with many things; of which
                  the first in point of time will be the long-intended Book of the Church.

                  </div> Had that book been written by a clergyman, it would have made his fortune beyond all
                  doubt. But it will do its work better as having come from one who could have had no
                  view to preferment, nor any undue bias upon his mind. If I live, I shall yet do good
                  service both to the Church and State.</p>

                           by the University’s Vice-Chancellor Frodsham Hodson (1770–1822; DNB), Principal of

                  the Vice-Chancellor, I went alone into Christ Church walks, where I had not been for
                  six-and-twenty years. Of the friends with whom I used to walk there, many (and among
                  them some of the dearest) were in their graves. I was then inexperienced, headstrong,
                  and as full of errors as of youth and hope and ardour. Through the mercy of God, I
                  have retained the whole better part of my nature, and as for the lapse of years, that
                  can never be a mournful consideration to one who hopes to be ready for a better world,
                  whenever his hour may come. God bless you!</p>
