                           1797) of Whitley House, Northumberland. Although Southey found her harmless, even
                           comical, Tom and his wife disliked her intensely, causing a great deal of tension
                           in their household; see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 15 October 1821, Letter

                  do as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</a> would have wished me to do, had she been living. – It may put me occasionally to some
                  inconvenience &amp; may deprive me of some luxuries which would otherwise be within my

                  which it has pleased God to favour me if I dealt &lt;otherwise&gt; towards him <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxxxxx</span> &amp; withheld assistance which it might be in my power to bestow? He however will be
                  guilty of the most unpardonable imprudence if he goes on relying upon what he can
                  draw from me, from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry</a> &amp; from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</a> (to whom I find he is in the habit of applying.) All these resources must be casual.
                  We have none of us too much for ourselves &amp; with our lives all our assistance must
                  fail. My family will be provided for in the event of my death, but I can make no provision

                  others. It is odd that I have not received the watch for her.

                  the eruption which frequently attends teething. Tell him that I am going tomorrow
                  to buy pretty things. In a very few hours he will learn to remember me, I warrant,
                  especially when I speak the rhinoceros-language. – The weather is excessively hot.
                  – Perhaps I may find time this morning to write a letter to the children, which I
                  would have done oftener if I could.
