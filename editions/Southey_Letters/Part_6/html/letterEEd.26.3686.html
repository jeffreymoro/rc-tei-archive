                  curiously balanced, than in any other case, – except perhaps that of the two Alexander

                           of Great Britain from the Revolution in 1688 to the Accession of George I (1787) was
                           an important source for its time. The book’s editor, William Thomson (1746–1817; DNB),
                           argued that its author was actually Alexander Cunningham (c. 1655–1730; DNB), Professor
                           of Civil Law at the University of Edinburgh 1698–1710 and classical scholar.</span></div>
                  </div> but the internal evidence is strongly in its favour, &amp; I very much doubt whether any
                  man could have written it <span class="strikethrough">as a</span> in a fictitious character, the character is so perfectly observed. If it be genuine,
                  – (which I believe it to be as much as one can believe the authenticity of any thing

                  </div> It is worth reading, but has less of his characteristic strength &amp; felicity of thought

                           put Brazil firmly under Portuguese control and this led directly to the separation

                  </div> will be to separate the two countries, &amp; then, I fear, to break up Brazil into as
