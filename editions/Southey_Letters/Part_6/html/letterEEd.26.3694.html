               <p>The public news from Brazil has made me look daily with much anxiety for tidings concerning
                  you, – in what manner these revolutionary movements may have affected your interests.
                  As they have neither been hasty, nor unforeseen, I should hope there had been time
                  to extricate your property from the precarious hands in which it was placed, – but
                  then I call to mind how much easier it is to run into danger than to withdraw from
                  it, &amp; that tottering Governments <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxxxx</span> are too much alarmed &amp; perplexed to pay much regard to their engagements. On the other
                  hand it occurs to me that the Government would endeavour to fulfil its engagements
                  to British subjects, in preference to any others, because the Kings intention of returning
                  to Portugal must have for one chief motive, the desire of feeling himself within reach
                  of British protection.

                           it declared its intention of organising elections to a Cortes, which were held in
                           December 1820, and demanded John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826) return
                           from Brazil, where the court had fled in 1807–1808. The king reached Portugal on 3
                           July 1821. It was feared in Brazil that his return would signal an attempt to put
                           Brazil firmly under Portuguese control and this led directly to the separation of
                           the two countries in 1822.</span></div>

                  </div> The separation of the two countries can hardly be prevented now, indeed the wisest
                  conduct could only have delayed it, &amp; brought it about quietly &amp; amicably, by a division
                  of the kingdoms, fixing one son at Lisbon, &amp; the other branch at the Rio.

                           a monarchy under John VI’s eldest son, Pedro I (1798–1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831).
                           The ‘other branch’ is probably a reference to Pedro’s younger brother, Miguel I (1802–1866;
                           King of Portugal 1828–1834), who did indeed gain the throne of Portugal, but only
                           by briefly usurping it from Pedro’s daughter, Mary II (1819–1853; Queen of Portugal
                           1826–1828, 1834–1853).</span></div>

                  upon which monarchy rests are <span class="strikethrough">not to</span> wanting. It is to be expected that the Brazilians will form a Constitution in imitation
                  of the American States, – without any regard to the difference of their habits, character,
                  &amp; former institutions. Disputes &amp; divisions between the great Captaincies will be
                  the next step, &amp; while the great <span class="strikethrough">cxx</span> cities undergo as many revolutions as Buenos Ayres,

               it declared its intention of organising elections to a Cortes, which were held in
               December 1820, and demanded John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826) return
               from Brazil, where the court had fled in 1807–1808. The king reached Portugal on 3
               July 1821. It was feared in Brazil that his return would signal an attempt to put
               Brazil firmly under Portuguese control and this led directly to the separation of
               the two countries in 1822.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               a monarchy under John VI’s eldest son, Pedro I (1798–1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831).
               The ‘other branch’ is probably a reference to Pedro’s younger brother, Miguel I (1802–1866;
               King of Portugal 1828–1834), who did indeed gain the throne of Portugal, but only
               by briefly usurping it from Pedro’s daughter, Mary II (1819–1853; Queen of Portugal
               1826–1828, 1834–1853).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
