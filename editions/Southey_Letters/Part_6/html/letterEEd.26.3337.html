                  used by any person but myself when kissing one of my own children in infancy, and
                  talking nonsense to it, which, whatever you may think of it at present as an exercise
                  for the intellect, I hope you will one day have occasion to practise, and you will
                  then find out its many and various excellencies.

                  and I should deal insincerely with you if I did not add, that ages hence it will be
                  found among those works which are not destined to perish; and secure for me a remembrance
