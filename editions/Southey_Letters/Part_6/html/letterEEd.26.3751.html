               <p>... ... What you relate of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</a> is quite characteristic of the manner in which he abuses his own powers, playing the
                  mere sophist, and disregarding the opinions and feelings of others; careless how he
                  offends and hurts them, though as incapable as man can be of giving intentional pain,
                  or doing intentional wrong. He was not serious, for he knows very well that to call
                  for proof of a negative is an absurdity, and that reason <span class="ital">and discourse of reason</span> are very different things. If he misleads some, his example operates as a warning
                  upon others. They see how he has squandered his abilities, and that the hereditary
                  blindness

               way) should ensnare him in a spider’s web of sophistry, more skilfully constructed
               than his own, and of a stronger thread. The pleasure of defending transubstantiation

                  country is a reproach to human nature, and our Government has much to answer for.
                  They must know that such a people ought to be kept under military law till they are
