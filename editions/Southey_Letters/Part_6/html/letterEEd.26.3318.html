               <p>When you hear that my journey to the south must be postponed till the fall of the
                  leaf, I fear you will think me infirm of purpose, &amp; as little to be depended on as
                  the wind &amp; weather in this our mutable climate. The cause however lies rather in a
                  good obstinate principle of perseverance, than in any fickleness of temper. This history,

                  the summer (beyond all previous or possible calculation) that if I went into the South
                  as soon as it is compleated, I should be under the necessity of shortening my stay
                  there, &amp; leaving part of my business undone, in order to return in time for a long-standing
                  engagement, which in the autumn will take me into the Highlands.

                           estates around Derwentwater that were owned by the Greenwich Hospital. The Hospital
                           was under increasing pressure to maximise its income from its estate and some tree-felling
                           was planned. However, Castlehead wood was saved from this process. The Hospital’s
                           administrators had also ordered the draining of some of their land next to Derwentwater,
                           by lowering the level of the lake.</span></div>
                  </div> But this neighbourhood has suffered much from the axe since you were here. The woods
                  about <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lodore">Lowdore</a> are gone, so are those under Castle-crag, so is the little knot of fir trees on the
                  way to Church, which were so placed as to make one of the features of the vale, &amp;
                  worst of all, so is that beautiful birch grove on the side of the lake between Barrow
                  &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Lodore">Lowdore</a>. Not a single sucker is springing up in its place, – &amp; indeed it would require a
                  full century before another grove could be reared which would equal it in beauty.
                  It is lucky that they cannot level the mountains, nor drain the lake, – but they are
                  doing what they can to lower it, &amp; have succeeded so far as to render all the old
                  landing-places useless. If the effect of this should be to drain the marshy land at
                  the head &amp; foot of the lake, without <span class="strikethrough">laying as xx</span> leaving as much more swamp uncovered, it will do rather good than harm. The Island
