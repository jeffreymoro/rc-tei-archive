                  they were in the last generation, we do not hear from them such sound reasoning, such

                  </div> of the unimpassioned character of our &lt;printed&gt; sermons is certainly true, – the cause
                  of it is to be found in the general character of the congregations for which they
                  were composed, – always regular church-going people, – persons of wealth &amp; rank, –
                  the really good part of the community, &amp; the formalists &amp; Pharisees; none of whom
                  would like to be addressed by their Parish Priest as miserable sinners standing in
                  need of repentance. Sermons of country growth seldom find their way to the press;
                  in towns the ruder classes seldom attend the church service, – in large towns because
                  there is no room for them: &amp; indeed <span class="strikethrough">both</span> in country as well as town, the subjects who are in the worst state of mind &amp; morals

                  wanting. Your Buckminster was taking the right course. The early death of such a man

                  of an English Reviewer passes on your side of the Atlantic for more than it is worth;
                  with us the review of the last month or the last quarter, is as little thought of

                  is which they are referred to in the Vocabulary led me to this, &amp; this leads me to
