            <p>MS: British Library, Add MS 47553. TR; 3p.<br> Previously published: Edward Dowden (ed.), <em>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</em> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 363–366.<br> Note on MS: The letter is a reply to that sent by Shelley, 17 August 1820. Southey’s
               letter survives in an undated transcript by Edith May Southey (though the date written
               at the top of the transcript is in Southey’s hand). Our copy text is from this transcript.
               It was sent by Southey to John Taylor Coleridge on 19 January 1821. The text contains
               some verbal differences from the version published in Dowden, which was based on a
               transcript made by Caroline Bowles that seems not to have survived; see Edward Dowden
               (ed.), <em>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</em> (Dublin and London, 1881), p. 363 n. The text in Dowden contains some variants, notably
               the addition of two sentences to the paragraph on Shelley’s marriage (see note 14
               below).</p>

               drowned in the Serpentine, that she was living apart from her husband, who was abroad,
