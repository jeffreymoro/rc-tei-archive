                           was controversial, not only praising Britain’s victory in the war against France,
                           but stating: ‘The same perfect integrity has been manifested in the whole administration
                           of public affairs’ (vi); not a view the Whig opposition endorsed. However, the earlier
                           draft of the ‘Dedication’, in Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733, shows Southey
                           had intended to go much further and urge that ‘adequate remedy should be applied to
                           that intolerable licentiousness of the press … either by the vigorous application

                  </div> You will not regard the trouble of the discussion, neither do I regret the time employed
                  in composing it; the spirit moved me, – &amp; I satisfied myself by writing according
                  to my feelings. There ended all my interest in the affair, for I have lived long enough
                  to know how little such things are thought of by any but the writers themselves –
                  &amp; to apply that knowledge to things of more pith &amp; moment than a dedication. How differently
                  did I feel on that Saturday when the first number of the Flagellant was published!
