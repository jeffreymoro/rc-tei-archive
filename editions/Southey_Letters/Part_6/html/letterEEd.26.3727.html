                  Vienna on the first of next month. And I invite you, Grosvenor, to purchase a ticket
                  also, &amp; let us go shares in the adventure; – &amp; if we get the prize, we will make a
                  merry &amp; memorable journey to Prague, &amp; you shall take your choice of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> seven titles for your Baronship, to wit Ziekem, Wolschow, Koyschitz, Shunkaú, Libietitz,

                  valued judicially at 896,755 florins of Vienna. I suppose the inhabitants are included.
                  – The notion I think will amuse you as much as it does us. So buy the tickets Grosvenor.
