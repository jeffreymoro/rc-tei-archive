                           printers and publishers, Louis Elzevir (1604–1670) and Daniel Elzevir (1626–1680).

                  </div> The original edition is a black letter book printed at Alcala. Men investigating the
                  history of the disease were more likely to have recourse to histories &amp; memoirs of
                  the wars in Italy, than to a work which relates to the affairs in Spain. But tho it
                  may thus be explained why medical authors should not have looked for it where it was
                  to be found, it is certainly most remarkable that historians, whose business it was
                  to have read these Epistles (important as they are in the history of that most important
                  age) should not have noticed a passage so decisive upon a very curious &amp; disputed
                  question. Yet I think they must have overlooked it, – for certainly <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> it puts an end to all doubt. – The truth is that most historians have contented themselves
                  with <span class="ital">referring</span> to many of their authorities, instead of <span class="ital">reading </span>them.</p>
