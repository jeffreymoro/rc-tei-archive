            <p>MS: Bristol Reference Library, SR4 pb Southey MSS, B20863. AL; 3p.<br> Previously published: Charles Cuthbert Southey (ed.), <em>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey</em>, 6 vols (London, 1849–1850), IV, pp. 344–346 [in part; dated ‘Keswick, 1819’].<br> Dating note: Dated from content and from dating in <em>Life and Correspondence</em>; the letter was written after the publication of <em>Don Juan</em> on 15 July 1819, and after Edith Southey’s ‘three months illness’ following the birth
               of Charles Cuthbert Southey on 24 February 1819. It is possibly either unsent or a
               draft of a lost letter that was sent; the MS is unfolded and there is no surviving
               address leaf or concluding salutation and signature.</p>

                           Progress of Methodism (1820); see The Works of the Rev. John Wesley, 3rd edn, 14 vols

                  </div> Journals, for the year 1781. He says “Jan<sup>y</sup> 23 I went to Dorking, &amp; buried the remains of M<sup>rs</sup> Attersal, a lovely woman, snatched away in the bloom of youth: I trust it will be
                  a blessing to many, &amp; to her husband in particular.” The latter part of the sentence
                  might be taken in a very different meaning from what the writer intended. The name
                  is so peculiar a one that I suppose it to be the same as yours, &amp; that Wesley has
                  mis-spelt it; – – but this brings me no nearer you than to induce a guess that Surry
                  may be your country. You tell me that the whole of your happiness is dependent upon
                  literary pursuits &amp; recreations. It is well that you have these resources, – but were
                  we near each other, &amp; were I to like you half as well upon a nearer acquaintance,
                  as it appears to me at this distance that I should do, – I think that when I had won
                  your confidence I should venture to tell you that something better than literature
                  is necessary for happiness.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">To confess the truth, one of the causes which have prevented me from writing to you
               earlier has been the wish &amp; half-intention of touching upon this theme, – checked
               by that <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxxxxxxx thought</span> sort of hesitation which sometimes (&amp; that too often) prevents us from doing what
               we ought, for fear of singularity. That you are a woman of talents I know, – &amp; I think
               you would not have given me the preference over more fashionable poets, if there had
               not been something in the general character of my writings which accorded with your
               feelings, &amp; which you did not find <span class="strikethrough">elsewhere</span> in theirs. But you have lived in <span class="strikethrough">the</span> high life, – you move in circles of gaiety &amp; fashion, – &amp; tho you sympathize with
               me when I express myself in verse, it is more than probable that the direct mention
               of religion may startle you, as something unwarranted as well as unexpected.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I am no Methodist, no Sectarian, no Bigot, no Formalist. My natural spirits are buoyant
               beyond those of any person man, woman or child, whom I ever saw or heard of. They
               have had enough to try them &amp; to sink them &amp; it is by religion alone that I shall
               be enabled to pass the remainder of my days in chearfulness &amp; in hope. Without hope
               there can be no happiness, &amp; without religion no hope but such as deceives us. Your
               heart seems to want an object, – &amp; this would satisfy it: – <span class="strikethrough">it</span> if it has been wounded, – this &amp; this only is the cure.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Are you displeased with this freedom? – Or do you receive it as a proof that <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> I am disposed to become something more than a mere literary acquaintance, – &amp; that
               you have made me feel an interest concerning you which an ordinary person could not
