                           take up the post in Pernambuco. The bankruptcy of the merchant Samuel Palmer (1762–1851),
                           of Bourton-on-the-Water, in 1816 had led to actions by Palmer’s creditors to recover
                           the debts that Sandby owed to Palmer. As Sandby had already spent time in prison for
