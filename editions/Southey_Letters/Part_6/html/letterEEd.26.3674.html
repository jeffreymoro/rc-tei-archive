               John Cam Hobhouse (1786–1869; <em>DNB</em>) was a Whig MP with much radical support. He was MP for Westminster 1820–1833, MP
               for Nottingham 1834–1847 and MP for Harwich 1848–1851. Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet
               (1768–1843; <em>DNB</em>) was MP for the City of London 1817–1843 and Lord Mayor of London 1815–1817. He was
               a well-known Whig and supporter of George IV’s estranged wife, Queen Caroline (1768–1821;
               <em>DNB</em>). Samuel Phillips Eady (dates unknown) was much ridiculed in 1821 for a pamphlet
               he had written, claiming to offer a cure for syphilis. Hobhouse’s name had been removed
               from the final sentence of Southey’s article, <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 24 (January 1821), 510, which in the censored published version read thus: ‘And,
               perhaps, some of our readers may think that in the days of Alderman Wood, Jeremy Bentham,
               and Dr. Eady, whose fame is written in chalk upon all the walls, we have bestowed
               too much attention upon an inferior quack [Huntington].’</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               one who had ‘deserted’ his ‘principles’ and ‘lost’ his ‘reputation’ (p. xxxiv) and
               singled out his violent rhetoric: ‘What seems to me chiefly admirable in his panegyric,
               is the temperate air with which the peaceful possessor of the butt and bays presents
               the axe of vengeance to the dynasty restored in France, and exhorts the reluctant
               Louis to the levelling of that upas, under the branches of which, when miscalled the
               tree of liberty, the youthful poet tuned his long forgotten lays’ (p. xxxv). Southey
               had visited France in May 1817 during his continental tour of that year.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               by the radical bookseller and printer James Ridgway (1745–1838). Canning’s response
               was to write, via Ridgway, on 10 April 1818, effectively challenging the anonymous
               author to a duel. This letter became public on 12 April. Many thought the pamphlet
               to have been the work of Hobhouse, but no reply was received and a duel was avoided.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note14_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
