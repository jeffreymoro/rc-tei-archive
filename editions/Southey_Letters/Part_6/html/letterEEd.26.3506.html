               <p>I take the first opportunity after my return home to thank you for the very interesting
                  &amp; valuable papers with which you have entrusted me;

                  </div> &amp; to assure you that I will <span class="strikethrough">take</span> use them with that discretion which it is equally my duty &amp; my desire to observe.
                  Indeed you will readily perceive that in using private materials it would be at once
                  useless &amp; improper to refer to them as my authorities, – useless because the reader
                  who should be desirous of comparing my statement with those authorities can have no
                  opportunity of doing it; – improper because it might seem like a wish of transferring
                  to others that responsibility which ought to rest wholly upon myself. I shall therefore
                  acknowledge in the preface whatever favours of this kind I have received, but in no
                  instance specify in the body of the work, the specific documents from which it has
                  been drawn, except where those documents are before the public.
