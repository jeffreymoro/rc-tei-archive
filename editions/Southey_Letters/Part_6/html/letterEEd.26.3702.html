            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I had not leisure to reply to your former letter when it arrived; – a full reply to
                  it, indeed, would require <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> a dissertation rather than a letter. The Influence of the Holy Spirit is believed
                  by all Christians, except the Ultra-Socinians, – the more pious Socinians would admit
                  it, tho under a different name.

                           this time another term for the Unitarian strand in Christianity. Unitarians did not
                           accept the existence of the Trinity. Some were only willing to use the term ‘Holy
                           Spirit’ to describe an aspect of God’s power, especially when directly inspiring or
                           relating to human beings; while others regarded the ‘Holy Spirit’ as a subordinate
                           divine being created by God. </span></div>
                  </div> But the question what is, &amp; what is not, the effect of that Influence, is precisely
                  asking where, in religious cases, reason ends, &amp; insanity begins. In all communities
                  of Christians there have been, &amp; are persons, who mistake their own imaginations for
                  inspiration; &amp; that this was done in some cases by the early Quakers, the present
                  members of that Society would not deny.</p>

               <p>It is always my custom to have a work long in my thoughts before it is taken actually
                  in hand: &amp; to collect materials &amp; let the plan digest while my main occupation is
                  upon some other subject – which has undergone the same slow but necessary process.
                  At present I am printing the History of the Peninsular War,

                  </div> One great advantage arising from this practise is, that much in the meantime is collected
                  in the course of other pursuits which would not have been found by a direct search:
                  – facts &amp; observations of great importance frequently occurring where the most diligent
                  investigator would never think of looking for them. The habit of noting &amp; arranging
                  such memoranda <span class="strikethrough">I did not acquire till</span> is acquired gradually; &amp; can hardly be learnt otherwise than by experience.</p>

                           reach Europe, and he did not receive an obituary in The Times until 5 July 1821. The
                           comparison here is with the ancient conquerors, Alexander the Great (356–323 BC; King
