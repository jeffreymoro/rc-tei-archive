            <p>Address: To/ Miss Barker<br> MS: MS untraced; text is taken from Robert Galloway Kirkpatrick, ‘The Letters of
               Robert Southey to Mary Barker From 1800 to 1826’ (unpublished PhD, Harvard, 1967),
               pp. 454–455.<br> Unpublished.<br> Dating note: Dating from content, which places this in early March 1819. 6 March
               fell on a Saturday in that year, and the letter was probably written then.</p>
