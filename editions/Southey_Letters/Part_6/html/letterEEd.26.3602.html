               <p>The death of poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a> has given me, &amp; indeed my whole household a severe shock, for he had been with us
                  so much that he seemed almost like one of the family. It is little more than five
                  years since I became acquainted with him, &amp; we had spent more than twelve months of
                  that time together, at home &amp; abroad. And the more we knew of him the better we loved
                  him, – he was so sensible of any kindness, so thoroughly amiable, &amp; bore his cross
                  so meekly.

               ‘legislatorial attorney and representative’ for the town, and in April 1820 he was
               sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for sedition and conspiracy for a speech
               he had given at Stockport on 28 June 1819. He had written from prison to the government,
               offering to go to Italy and collect information concerning Queen Caroline (1768–1821;
               <em>DNB</em>), who was facing a Bill of Pains and Penalties that would have dissolved her marriage
               to George IV on the grounds of her adultery. Not receiving a reply, Wolseley had published
               the letter in <em>The Times</em>, 11 October 1820, noting his acquaintance with Caroline when she lived at Como in
               1817 and stating he could obtain information ‘that no Englishman but myself and a
               Mr. Walter Landon, who is now in Italy, can have the opportunity of knowing’. Southey
               saw the letter and transcribed it for Landor; see Southey to Landor, 29 October 1820,
               Letter 3547. Landor responded by sending a letter to <em>The Times</em>. He also asked Southey to get the same letter into the <em>Courier</em>; John Forster, <em>Walter Savage Landor. A Biography</em>, 2 vols (London, 1869), I, pp. 466–467. <em>The Times</em> published Landor’s letter on 4 December 1820; in it he insisted, ‘whatever I may
               have heard relating to the Queen, I know nothing positive, and never made a single
               inquiry that either could inculpate or acquit her in the cause now pending’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
