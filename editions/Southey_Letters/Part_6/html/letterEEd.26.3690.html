               Somerville’s mother was Elizabeth Cannon Lethbridge (d. 1765), the daughter of Mary
               Southey (1704–1789) and niece of John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). The latter had inherited
               the Fitzhead estate in Somerset from his mother, Mary Cannon (1678–1738). On his death,
               John Cannon Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville his
               primary heir, and Southey’s father and two uncles the residuary legatees, their rights
               passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three Southey brothers only Southey’s
               father married, leading the poet to believe (after the death of his father and paternal
               uncles) that he and his brothers were now the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               because the latter had become increasingly reclusive. As an obituary explained, ‘he
               for many years secluded himself from general society, and appeared wholly indifferent
