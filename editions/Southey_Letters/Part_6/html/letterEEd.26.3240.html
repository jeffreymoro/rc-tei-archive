                  be to their injury. It appears therefore to me that they would only require selection

                  who have time to spare &amp; would be happy in obtaining such an employment. There may
                  possibly also be another reason why another person may better be applied to on this
                  occasion. The difference between your opinions &amp; mine might be so great, that I could
                  &lt;not&gt; with satisfaction or propriety, become the means of introducing yours to the

                  a great gulph between us, you would hardly have thought of making me your editor.
                  Indeed if there had not been something in your letter which seems to make it probable
                  that I should feel a lively interest in the transcript of your thoughts &amp; feelings,
                  – my answer would have been brief &amp; incisive. <span class="strikethrough">Dxxxxxxxx I cannot xxxxxx it</span>, –</p>
