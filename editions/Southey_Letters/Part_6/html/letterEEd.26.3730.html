               (Letter 3729). There is a fair copy of the letter to ‘Stumparumper’, also in Southey’s

               as copy text because the deletions indicate that it is clearly the first version of
               this letter.</p>

                  called us &lt;persecutorums, &amp;&gt; great improprietors for performing this meritorious <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> &lt;task&gt;; &amp; has often told me not to be such a stuposity; threatening us sometimes that

                  play the very dunder; &amp; sometimes bidding us get away with our toadywidferings. And
                  she asks me how I can be such a Tom-noddycum &lt;(tho my name as she knows is Robert)&gt;
                  &amp; calls me detesty, a mafrum, a goffrum, a chatterpye, a sillycum, &amp; a great mawkinfort.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">But when she speaks of you it is with a kinder meaning. You are not a vulgarum, nor
               a great ovverum govverum; the appellations which she has in store for you are either
               words of direct endearment, or of that <span class="strikethrough">kind</span> &lt;sort&gt; of objurgation which is the playfullest mood of kindness. Thus you are a Stumparumper,
               because you are a shortycum; &lt;&amp; you are&gt; a wattlykin, a tendrum, – a detestabumpus,
               &amp; a figurumpus. These are the words which come from her chapset when she speaks of
               you; &amp; you need not be told what they signifump.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I dare say you have set up a whickerandus at this, &amp; I hope you will not be dollatory
               in expressing the satisfaction which you derive from knowing that you are thus decidedly
               in her good graces. Perhaps you may attempt an answer in the same strain, &amp; show yourself
               none of the little blunderums who deserve to be bangated, but an apt pupolion which
               if you do you will deserve to be called as clever as De-Ciiggle.</p>

                  </div> philosophy might analyze &amp; discover the principles of its construction. I tho an <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxly</span> a diligent &amp; faithful observer, &lt;must confess that I&gt; have but little insight into
                  it. I can indeed partly guess why <span class="strikethrough">asses</span> donkeys in this language are called jacks, &amp; why peck is a nose; why some part of
                  an Elephants trunk is a griper, but not why it is a snipe; why nog is a lump, bungay
                  a bundle, &amp; why trottlykins should stand for childrens feet; – but not why my feet
                  &amp; yours should be opprobriously termed hocksen &amp; hormangorgs. So too when I hear needles
                  called nowgurs, – ladies, laduls, whispering, twistering, – vinegar, wiganar, &amp; a
                  mist fogogrum, or fogrogrum, I have some glimpse, tho but a glimpse, of the principle
                  upon which these neologisms are introduced. I can perceive also the analogies by which
                  the new vocabulary is to be extended; for example, pie being called pie-īe-īe; it
                  follows that pudding should be pudding-ūdding-ūdding. And a pew being called pewdiddledoo,
                  to be consistent, we should speak of the Churchdiddledurch, the Clerkdiddlederk, &amp;
                  the Parsondiddledarson, – only that this might appear disrespectful to the Vicar.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>But I should in vain seek to discover the <span class="ital">rationale</span> of other parts of this speech, though I were to study the subject till I were as tired
                  as a dogs detested hinder. And tho I get at the meaning by asking an explanation,
                  still no clue to the <span class="strikethrough">x xxx</span> derivation is afforded. Thus for instance when it was said don’t roakin there &amp; I
                  desired to know what was intended by this <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> prohibition, the answer was ‘every body says roakin’, &amp; when I prest for farther explanation,
                  I was informed that roaking was digging &amp; grumping in a work-box. So too on the way
                  from M<sup>rs</sup> Calverts

                  </div> one evening, I was desired to stop till she had gathered up her doddens; &amp; that word
                  was interpreted to mean a plaid, a pair of pattens &amp; an umbrella. If my foot happens
                  to touch her chair, I am told that anything whidfetting the chair makes her miseraboble.
                  If the children – the childerōpusses I should say, are bangrampating about the house,
                  they are said to be rudderish &amp; roughcumtatherick. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthberts</a> mouth is called sometimes a jabberumpeter, sometimes a towsalowset. When the word
                  comfortabuttle is used, I suppose it may be designed to mean that there is comfort
                  in a bottle. But by what imaginable process of language and association Snoutarumpeter
                  can be, as she declares it to be, a short way of calling Mother I am altogether unable
                  to comprehend.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">On one occasion however I was fortunate enough to see this extraordinary language,
               if I may so express myself, in the mint, &amp; in the very act of its coinage. Speaking
               of a labourer, she said – the Thumper, the What-dye-callder, – the Undoer – I cant
               hit upon it! – the cutter-up. – these were the very words received &amp; noted as they
               came fresh from the die; – &amp; they meant a man who was chopping wood.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I must now bring this letter to a conclusion. The account indeed is very incompleat,
               but you may rely upon its fidelity. And tho of necessity I have spelt the words according
               to their pronunciation, I hope that this has not occasioned any disvuegurment, &amp; that
               none of them in reading will stick in your thrapple. The subject cannot be so important
               to you, as it is to me, who live in a house where this language is spoken &amp; therefore
               have been obliged to <span class="strikethrough">acquire some knowledge</span> pay attention to it. Yet it will not <span class="strikethrough">be</span> &lt;appear&gt; altogether <span class="strikethrough">uninteresting to you</span> &lt;incurious&gt;, connected as it is with <span class="strikethrough">the philosophy of language</span> &lt;the science of philology&gt;; &amp; perhaps your regard for the inventor may give it a
               more than ordinary interest in your eyes.</p>
