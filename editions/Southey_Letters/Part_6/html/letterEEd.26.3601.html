               <em>DNB</em>) was described as Handel’s ‘munificent pupil and patron’. However, Handel had died
               before George III became King, and Handel had never taught the young monarch or received
               any payments from him. Southey here suggests that the lines are intended to mean that
               George III was a patron and student of Handel’s music, which was undoubtedly true.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
