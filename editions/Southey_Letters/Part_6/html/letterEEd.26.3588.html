               <p>Thank you for your letter &amp; for the squibs. M<sup>r</sup> Hughes has plenty of gunpowder, &amp; makes good use of it.

                           Hughes (1790–1857; DNB), had been publishing; for example, The Radical Harmonist (1820),
                           Solomon Logwood (1820) and The Asses Skin Memorandum Book, Lost in St Paul’s (1820).</span></div>

                  may do good service in these times: – otherwise there are pleasanter paths in literature,
                  which for his own sake I should wish him to pursue. Indignation will make good poetry,
                  but it leaves the mind in a heated &amp; uncomfortable state; &amp; poetry is of most advantage
                  both to the writer &amp; reader, (&amp; especially to the former) when it elevates us above
                  the every-day concerns &amp; unworthy humours of the world. I shall be very glad to see
                  the production of a different class which you promise me. Meantime, as you have left

            <p class="indent1">I cannot tell you how much I was pleased with the good, honest, warm, Welsh loyalty
               of your letter. Our Protestant Missionaries have proved, in opposition to their Romish
               predecessors, that the best helpmates they can take with them are their wives; – &amp;
               you have persuaded me in like manner that a woman may be of as much use in putting
               down evil opinions &amp; diffusing good ones, as a Justice of the Peace. It is for want
               of zeal that we perish.</p>

                  </div> I perceive some objections to it, of which the weightiest is its tendency to relieve
