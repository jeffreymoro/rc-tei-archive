                  was very civil, but written as if he were hurt at knowing that I had been hurt by
                  his unwarrantable liberty. He said what might be very true, that he could not always
                  print what I could write, (which would &lt;hold&gt; good in about one case of 100) &amp; that

                  I have not answered his note; but it is more than likely than one article more will
