               This produced a further round of legal tangles over the Fitzhead estate in Somerset
               that Somerville had inherited.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
         <div class="note" id="Note10"><span class="noteLabel">9.. </span><span class="noteBody">Somerville’s mother was Elizabeth Cannon Lethbridge (d. 1765), the daughter of Mary
               Southey (1704–1789) and niece of John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). The latter had inherited
               the Fitzhead estate from his mother Mary Cannon (1678–1738). On his death, John Cannon
               Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville as his primary
               heir, and, should he die childless, Southey’s father and two uncles as the residuary
               legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three Southey brothers
               only Southey’s father married, leading the poet to believe (after the death of his
               father and paternal uncles) that he and his brothers were now the rightful heirs to
               the Fitzhead estate. </span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
