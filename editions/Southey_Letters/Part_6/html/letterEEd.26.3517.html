TR; 3p.<br> Previously published: Edward Dowden (ed.), <em>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</em> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 359–360 [undated].<br> Note on MS: The letter is a reply to that sent by Shelley, 26 June 1820. Southey’s
               letter survives in an undated transcript by Edith May Southey, which was sent by Southey
               to John Taylor Coleridge on 19 January 1821. Our copy text is taken from this. The
               text contains very minor verbal differences from the version published in Dowden.
               These differences do not affect the sense. <br> Dating note: Dating from content and from information in other surviving correspondence;

                           It concluded with an ad hominem attack that suggested the reviewer knew a great deal

                  </div> The specimens which I happen to have seen in reviews &amp; newspapers have confirmed my
                  opinion that your powers for poetry are of a high order – but the manner in which
                  those powers have been employed is such as to prevent me from feeling any desire to
                  see more of productions so monstrous in their kind &amp; so pernicious in their tendency.
                  You perceive Sir that I speak as I think, and therefore you will not ascribe my ready
                  and direct denial of the criticism to the sort of menace which your note conveys –
                  nor understand it as acknowledging in any man a right to call upon me for such a denial
                  upon no better grounds than a mere suspicion which he or his friends may chuse to
                  entertain. Those friends of yours who have persisted in affirming that I am the author
                  can have had no other grounds; they have committed the gross impropriety of affirming
                  positively what they could not possibly know to be true, &amp; what happens to be absolutely
                  false.</p>

               <p>I reply to you Sir because I cannot think of you without the deepest compassion. Eight
                  years ago you were somewhat displeased when I declined disputing with you upon points
                  which are beyond the reach of the human intellect telling you that the great difference
                  between us was, that you were then nineteen &amp; I was eight &amp; thirty. Would that the
                  difference were no greater now! You wrote to me when you sent me your Alastor that
                  as you tolerated my opinions, you supposed I should tolerate yours.

               the reviewer knew a great deal about Shelley’s personal affairs: ‘if we might withdraw

               it would be an unanswerable comment on our text; it is not easy for those who <span class="ital">read only</span>, to conceive how much low pride, how much cold selfishness, how much unmanly cruelty
               are consistent with the laws of this “universal” and “lawless love.” But we must only
               use our knowledge to check the groundless hopes which we were once prone to entertain
               of him’ (471). The article had, moreover, described Shelley as ‘an unsparing imitator’
               and <em>The Revolt</em>’s language and versification as a ‘copy’ of Southey’s, though ‘altogether more luxuriant
               and ornate than the original’ (461). Shelley was mistaken in attributing the review
               to Southey, who had a policy of not reviewing contemporary poetry. Its author was
