                  </div> – you may perhaps have supposed that I had either forgotten or neglected an important
                  means of obtaining information, &amp; a very friendly invitation. I am now however, for
                  the first time since the offer was made, in the metropolis, &amp; am length able to avail
                  myself of it. Will it suit you to receive me on Tuesday the 30<sup>th</sup>? Or in any part of the fortnight following? With my knowledge of the subject, previous
                  collections, &amp; habits of dispatch, two days I should think would suffice for perusing
                  the papers, &amp; making such notes as would be necessary. As soon as I return home, which
                  will be in the last week of June, my history of the war will be put to the press</p>
