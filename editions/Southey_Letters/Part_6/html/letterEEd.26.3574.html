                  consequence except to the poor people concerned in it, &amp; as they got off with the
                  gallies, it is probable they met with nothing more than their deserts; – offences

                           a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King’s wife,
                           Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821; DNB), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her
                           marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government
                           majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House
                           of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore had announced the Bill would
                           be withdrawn.</span></div>
                  </div> my feeling towards the one is that which one has for an honest and upright General
                  or Admiral who commits a fatal error in judgement, – towards the other I will not
                  trust myself to say what it is, farther than that I have never read of any faction
                  in any age or country, acting <span class="strikethrough">in</span> more basely &amp; wickedly than the present race of Whigs. Verily they will have their

                  then they will escape with no other punishment than that of lasting infamy, which
                  they seem incapable of feeling. I hardly thought it possible to think worse of them
                  than I did twelve months ago. A worse symptom is the cowardice that has shown itself
                  among better men. It is in vain to disguise from ourselves the real situation of the
                  country. A revolution is effected. We are under the tyranny of the Press &amp; the Mob.
                  The popular opinion is thoroughly corrupted from Thursoe to Penzance, – &amp; the fidelity
                  of the troops is more than doubtful.

                  we may have no greater loss to regret. If the Press triumphs we know there is an end
