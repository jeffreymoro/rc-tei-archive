                  </div> In Portugal this is clear that any Revolution which totally separates it from Brazil
                  must be an evil, because in the growing importance of that country, it would have
                  a protection, which it cannot expect from any other quarter, especially if its politics
                  takes (as seems likely) an Anti-Anglican character, – always the mark of <span class="ital">liberal</span> opinion in Portugal. Our Government ought to be told that this revolution has been
                  brought about thro the English Press – a curse to other countries as well as its own
                  – four Portugueze Journals were printed here at one time, of which two were Jacobinical
                  in the extreme, &amp; a third Revolutionary: and all, even the fourth (which was set up
                  as a counter-poise by Funchal the Ambassador) laboured to exasperate the Portugueze
                  against the English.
