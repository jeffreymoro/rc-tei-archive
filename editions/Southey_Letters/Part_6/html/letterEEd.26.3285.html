            <p class="indent1">Your grand weather-glass arrived yesterday, – &amp; great was my dismay upon opening it,
               at finding that one of the tubes was broken. By good fortune it is only the smaller
               one in which the weight plays, &amp; no inconvenience will result from it, a small piece
               of the main tube also was knocked off upon the journey, but in such a part &amp; so small
               as not to be material. But more care ought certainly to have been taken in securing
               the inside, – a little cotton, or tow would have prevented these mishaps. It is fixed
               on the first landing place, opposite the Spanish map of S America, &amp; indicates I hope
               a change of weather, of which we shall be very glad, – for a bitter East wind is now
               prevailing.</p>
