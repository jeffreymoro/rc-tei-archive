                           here. The first version of the poem had contained a rousing finale that called on
                           the people of France to rise up and assassinate Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821; Emperor
                           of the French 1804–1814, 1815). This was clearly a potential embarrassment to the
                           government, and in late 1813 these parts of the poem were removed on the advice of
                           Croker and Rickman. A heavily revised version of the poem was published by Longman
                           as Carmen Triumphale on 1 January 1814.</span></div>

                           This was not issued in Southey’s official capacity as Poet Laureate, and was therefore
                           free (in principle at least) from the restrictions that post imposed on him. It had
                           been retitled ‘Ode, Written During the Negociations with Buonaparte, In January 1814’

               here. The first version of the poem had contained a rousing finale that called on
               the people of France to rise up and assassinate Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821; Emperor
               of the French 1804–1814, 1815). This was clearly a potential embarrassment to the
               government, and in late 1813 these parts of the poem were removed on the advice of
               Croker and Rickman. A heavily revised version of the poem was published by Longman
               as <em>Carmen Triumphale</em> on 1 January 1814.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               and was therefore free (in principle at least) from the restrictions that post imposed
               on him. It had been retitled ‘Ode, Written During the Negociations with Buonaparte,
               In January 1814’ and included in <em>Minor Poems</em>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. [215]–224.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
