                           known as ‘The Challenge’. Successful Scholars have the right to special privileges;

                  </div> next year, – because it will require <span class="ital">cramming</span>, (an operation which whether it be always beneficial, he doubts; – I, for my part,
                  not doubting that it is always injurious –) – &amp; because of his youth &amp; gentleness
                  of disposition. His utmost efforts next year could not be expected to bring him in
                  except among the four last, &amp; then – to use Knoxs words “a gentle delicate boy would
                  be subjected to the severest part of a severe discipline.” The year after he would
                  probably come in very high. – Knox must be the best judge of all this. – With regard
                  to the discipline of which he speaks, it is one of those evils which cry aloud for
                  extirpation, – &amp; against which I should have cried aloud ere this, if it were not
                  for the temper of the times, when so many persons would join in the cry for the purpose
                  of mischief. But the oeconomy of our public schools stands grievously in need of reform. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoodenoughEdmund">Goodenough</a> had an opportunity last year of breaking the tyranny which is exercised in College,
                  when a flagrant instance came before him in the case of James Moore’s son.

               with me they were as much sport as study. – So easily are these things acquired by
