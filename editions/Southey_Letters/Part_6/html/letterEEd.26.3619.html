                           Historia de Abiponibus Equestri, Bellicosaque Paraquariae Natione (1784), no. 843
                           in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. The translation did eventually run to
                           three volumes.</span></div>
                  </div> which vexes me greatly. You have plainly taken the copy in your hands for <span class="ital">half</span> the work, instead of a <span class="ital">third</span>, the original consisting of <span class="ital">three</span> volumes. There is but one remedy, – which is to cut the translation down by omitting
                  all that can best be omitted. Send the MS. back to me, &amp; I will see to this. The book
                  will no longer have the same value as the original, but it will be lightened, &amp; thereby
                  better suited to the great majority of readers. The pruning knife must be used without
                  mercy, so as to cut out, if possible a full third.</p>
