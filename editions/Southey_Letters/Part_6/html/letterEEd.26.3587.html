               <p>Now concerning the Vision. You may growl as much as you like. But before you begin
                  to put on your critical cap, observe with respect to the metre, that I write upon
                  the postulate of using in the four first feet of the verse, any foot of two or three
                  syllables: the English hexameter in this respect bearing the same loose resemblance
                  to the Latin, that the English heroic verse of ten syllables does to the ancient Iambic
                  verse, after which it is sometimes called. This of course is to be explained in the
                  preface.
