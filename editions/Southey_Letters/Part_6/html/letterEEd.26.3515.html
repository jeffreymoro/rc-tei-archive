               <p>My reading has never been directed to metaphysical subjects, concerning such subjects

                  one cannot help learning from common books &amp; common conversation. With regard to moralists
                  the best beyond all doubt will be found among those divines, speaking of whom the
                  late King said ‘there were Giants upon the earth in those days.”
