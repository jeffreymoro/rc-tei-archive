                  </div> some months ago, I was sorry that it contained nothing which informed me to whom I
                  might address my thanks, &amp; express the pleasure which I derived from its perusal.
                  It is a great satisfaction that I am now enabled so to do. The poems evidently proceed
                  from a cultivated, amiable &amp; well-directed mind; every reader must peruse them with
                  respect as well as gratification, &amp; in the authors own immediate circle they must
                  have that interest which we attach to the faithful portrait of a friend.</p>

               <p>It is seldom that I think of myself as a poet. “My way of life has fallen into the

                  </div> – &amp; the inclination for writing poetry has past away. But to be assured that I have
                  not failed in my hope of conveying worthy &amp; ennobling feelings to congenial minds
                  would be sufficient recompense for having lived laborious days, even if the labour
                  had not been of a kind which brings with it its own reward.</p>
