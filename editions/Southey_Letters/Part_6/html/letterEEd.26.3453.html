                  for the last ten days. The whole of the copy is in his hand, except a few notes, which
                  are merely kept back till the text is printed, that I may know how to arrange them.
                  There are, as nearly as I can calculate twelve or thirteen sheets yet to print. If
                  he compleats these in the course of four weeks, by that time, I shall have rid my

                  </div> – for the subject it is which makes it hang upon hand, I have written 200 lines, <span class="strikethrough">wh</span> but this hardly expresses the quantum unless you call to mind that such lines must
                  be estimated by measure as well as by tale. Some three or fourscore <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> more may bring it to an end; – &amp; then perhaps so long a time may have elapsed that
                  it may be thought better to withhold it altogether, rather than come so long after
                  the occasion. This would be no loss, as if it be printed I shall only have my labour
                  for my pains. But if it lies by me, it may acquire value by keeping. I shall finish
                  it as soon as I can, &amp; take council concerning the publication, with perfect indifference

               had been of her own blood. Of her little money she has left them five pounds each,
