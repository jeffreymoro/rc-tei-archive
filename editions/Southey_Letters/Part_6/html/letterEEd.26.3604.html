               <p>I inclose a letter for Elmsley.

                  </div> I have some objections, which appear to me of considerable weight, against this Constitutional
                  Association.

                  </div> In the first place it is reversing the order of things. Government is endangered by
                  a devilish Press, &amp; instead of fairly attacking an evil which it must controul, or
                  be destroyed by it, it wishes to keep aloof, &amp; leave individuals to associate for
                  its defence. That is, we are to protect Gov. instead of being protected by it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Secondly – political associations in turbulent times are very dangerous things. Clubs
               may be met by clubs, Anti–Jacobine by Jacobine, – till we come to Club law.</p>

                  But I do not like this mode of acting, because Government can &amp; ought to do all that
