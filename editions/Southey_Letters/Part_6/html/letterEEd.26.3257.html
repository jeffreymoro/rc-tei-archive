            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am indeed gratified by your offer of becoming one of the sponsors to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">this infant</a>, and truly proud should I have been to have received so kind a mark of friendship,
                  if it could have been so. But <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Grosvenor Bedford</a> requested some months ago that if the child should prove a boy, he might hold the
                  same relation to it which he had done to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">his dear brother</a>, and that same feeling induced me, as soon as he was born, to desire that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Charles W. Wynn</a> would do the same. I mean to call him Cuthbert; you who know <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</a> poems so well will understand why.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Wordsworth’s ‘Inscription: For the Spot where the Hermitage Stood on St. Herbert’s
                           Island, Derwent-Water’ (1800). The poem recounts how St Herbert (d. 687; DNB) lived
                           in seclusion, but prayed that he and his friend, St Cuthbert (c. 634–687; DNB), should
                           die at the same time – a prayer that was granted. The name ‘Cuthbert’ indissolubly
                           linked the new child to his dead older brother, Herbert, as did his other name, ‘Charles’,
                           the name of both his godparents, Bedford and Wynn, who had also been Herbert’s godparents.</span></div>
                  </div> From most people I keep such feelings out of sight, as if I were ashamed of them,
                  and for them it is reason enough that it is a good Saxon name, still in use in Northumberland
                  and Durham, and neither so general as to be common, nor so strange as to have any
                  appearance of affectation.</p>

               <p>He was born in the study, and when he opened his eyes, I would say, if wishes could
                  influence the course of his life, what he was born to was before him. You will wonder
                  how this should have happened. The high winds about Christmas gave an ugly shake to
                  a high chimney which, if it were to receive such another <span class="ital">airquake</span>, might probably make its way through the roof into our bedroom. The masons cannot
                  pull it down and rebuild it while there is any chance of frost; they patched it as
                  well as they could, but lest we should both be killed, or one of us frightened to
                  death, it was necessary that we should shift our quarters, and as no other apartment
                  in the house would afford the needful accommodation, my study was converted into <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">my lady’s</a> chamber, and I have taken up my abode in what was formerly <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">Coleridge’s</a>, but now goes by the name of All Saints’ Room, in honour of my delectable folios.

               <p>The places which I am very desirous you should see in Switzerland are luckily of the
                  easiest access, partly by water, partly by the carriages of the country. Protestant
                  Switzerland has probably suffered less in the general dislocation of principles and
                  morals than any other part of Europe; still, it has suffered much. This I learnt from
                  some ministers in the Pays de Vaud.

                           the sixteenth century. Southey visited the area on 1–3 June 1817 and met a Minister
                           of the local Protestant Church, whose name he thought was Conobé, on 1–2 June; this

                           (1747–1822; DNB). His The Peasant of Auburn; or, The Emigrant: A Poem (1783) was an

                           a cautionary tale about the perils of leaving an English village for a new life in
