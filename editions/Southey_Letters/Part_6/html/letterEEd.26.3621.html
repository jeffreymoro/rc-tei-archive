               <p>My dear Sir, – Many causes have prevented me from acknowledging the receipt of your
                  letter so soon as I wished and intended to have done. One of them has been the intention
                  of telling you that you would receive a poem of mine which is at this time in the
                  press,

                  </div> but has been delayed there somewhat longer than I expected, owing in some degree to
                  my distance from London, which occasions great loss of time when anything is to travel
                  backwards and forwards. In less than a fortnight I trust it will be sent to you. It
                  is an experiment in metre,

                  </div> What you have to learn is arrangement and compression, or, rather, selection. And
                  when you read, living poets especially, but indeed any poets, seek rather to discover
                  what there is in their style and manner that you should avoid, rather than what you
                  should imitate. The more easily the manner of any poet may be imitated, the more reason
                  is there to suspect that it is faulty – mannerism itself being a fault. It is a chaste
                  and severe style which you should study – not an exuberant one – the perfection of
                  such style is to be seen in Dante,

               yet your compositions are too wild and luxuriant, but you might try some kind of romantic
               drama upon a small scale, a thing of three acts – we have seen fairy tales in pantomime
               – but something of that line with the charm of poetry has not yet been tried.</p>
