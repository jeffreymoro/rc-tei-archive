                  </div> In the course of a fortnight you will receive the book. The hexameters have nothing
                  uncouth in their appearance, the type being adapted to their <span class="ital">longitude</span> rather than to the size of the page; – &amp; for their effect upon the ear, it must be
                  a stubborn prejudice that maintains its ground against them. But a good pelting shower
                  of abuse I shall have, sans doubt: – having with some ingenuity contrived to give
                  matter, or pretext, of offence to all parties, like a very Ishmaelite.

                  </div> For I have neither placed Pitt nor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Fox</a> among the Worthies of the late reign, &amp; you may easily guess how that sin of omission

                           ‘the Satanic school’ of poetry without naming any one poet. This was, as far as Byron
                           was concerned, Southey’s response to the suppressed ‘Dedication’ to the first two
                           cantos of Don Juan (1819), which had lampooned Southey mercilessly.</span></div>

                  it touches upon the state of the Press; &amp; if this should be thought to look as if
                  I were appointing myself one of the Kings Counsellors, – I have given a discretionary
                  power of throwing it behind the fire.

                           HM 2733, shows Southey had intended to be more controversial and urge that ‘adequate

                           by the vigorous application of existing laws or by the enactment of such new ones
                           as the suspension of the abuse may render necessary’. Southey had submitted the ‘Dedication’
                           to Grosvenor Bedford and asked him to consult Herries on its propriety, Southey to
