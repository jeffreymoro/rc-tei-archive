            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I thank you for your pamphlett, for the manner wherein you have been pleased to mention
                  me in it, &amp; for your obliging letter.

                           The Parish Controversy, published in Leeds by W. Gawtress and Co. in 1819.</span></div>

            <p class="indent1">– A cordial Hand-shake you shall have, whenever you may find your way to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, &amp; should any circumstances lead me to Leeds, I will not fail to enquire for you.</p>
            <p class="indent1">It is demonstrable in the present state of things that the poor who want employ, cannot
               be employed advantageously in any other way than in raising food &lt;or in public works&gt;.
               The manufacturing &lt;system&gt; will have its ebbs &amp; its flows, &amp; possibly may have a higher
               tide than has ever been known before, – but then it will be followed again by low
               water. Other nations will manufacture for themselves, &amp; the more prosperous they are
               the sooner they will begin to do so, tho the first effect of their prosperity will
               be an increasing demand for British goods. If Government would bring the waste lands
               into cultivation, gradually, as national domains, in the course of a few generations
               the rents <span class="strikethrough">would xxxxxxx</span> &lt;would&gt; form a material item in the yearly income. Your poor at Leeds are probably
               not very well adapted for agricultural labour, – but a little practise will enable
               man to handle a spade, – &amp; if you had land for the experiment (your county is full
               of waste land!) surely it would be possible to convince the necessitous that is as
               easy to cultivate a common in England, as a <span class="ital">prairie</span> in America.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Wishing you success in your meritorious endeavours</p>
