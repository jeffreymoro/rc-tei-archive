                  myself that I should have cause to remember it on this occasion, I thank you for the
                  manner in which you have done me the honour of mentioning my name in your epitaph

                  </div> &amp; tho I am as indifferent as a man would wish to be in these times to common applause

                  which we formed of this extraordinary youth. You had the gratification of knowing
                  him, &amp; of showing him personal kindness. I could only pay a tribute of respect to
                  his remains; but of all the actions of my life it is that for which I have been the
                  most abundantly requited.</p>
