                           of the Peninsular War (1823–1832). The book in question was Douglas’s Observations
                           on the Motives, Errors and Tendency of M. Carnot’s System of Defence (1819), which
                           offered a detailed critique of Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot’s (1753–1823) classic
                           work on fortifications, Traite de la Défense des Places Fortes (1810), on issues such

                           Southey. At this time Pasley was Director of the School of Military Fieldworks at
                           Chatham and had given Southey a practical demonstration of some techniques of besieging
                           and defending fortifications on 9 May 1817. Pasley did not review Douglas’s book for
                           the Quarterly Review.</span></div>
                  </div> to review that book. It would hardly require more than half a dozen pages; &amp; I believe
                  the book deserves to be brought forward, as being of great practical importance. If
                  as I apprehend, it shows that we are as much superior to the French in the most important
                  branch of war in theory, as we have proved ourselves to be in the field, the work
                  which demonstrates this ought to be brought prominently into notice, – more especially
                  as the notoriety which the Q.R. may give to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#DouglasHoward">Sir Howards</a> refutation of Carnots theories, may tend to prevent our allies, from committing errors
                  the consequence of which must be severely felt, whenever France is able to resume
