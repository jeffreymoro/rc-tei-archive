            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letters have troubled me; – &amp; I should have replied to the first of them without
               delay, if I had not expected to receive the half notes – which I now acknowledge &amp;
               thank you for.</p>

               <p>If it were at a better season of the year, I should press you to make for yourself
                  as long a vacation as you could, &amp; set off forthwith for <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, where I would answer for putting you in good condition. But in the month of November,
                  when the paths are strewn with the fallen leaves, the roads ancle-deep in mire, &amp;
                  the glass oscilating between Rain &amp; Much Rain, &amp; only getting up to Change, for the
                  sake of verifying its accuracy by falling back again, – this prescription is not applicable.
                  Make up your mind however, &amp; your arrangements, – to come with the Cuckoo,

               <p>My dear Grosvenor I am noways inclined to condemn you, as you seem to imagine, – nor
                  like the shoemaker whom we went to see in Richters picture, to persuade you that the
                  shoe fits, when you feel that it pinches.

                  </div> – Only let me say, that I should be as glad as you could be to find myself in possession
                  of a good independent fortune: – &amp; that we poor Lacklands &amp; Lackstocks who have to
                  earn our livelihood, must endeavour to make the best of it. You are better off at
                  this time than the King or his Prime Minister. – If I were in town I would give you
                  as much of my time as you would accept, – that is, I would take my sneezes at the
                  Exchequer at noon, &amp; dine with you &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordHenry">the Master of the Rolls</a>, as often as you would let me make <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;a&gt; fourth in your party. But as this cannot be, let me, I entreat you, converse as
                  well as we can, at a distance, &amp; do not imagine yourself unfit for correspondence,
                  or suffer yourself to acquire a distaste for it. I have often, since my return from
                  London, been vexed, as well as disappointed, at not hearing from you as usual. Your
                  letters made up no small part of my enjoyments. You are my only <span class="ital">frequent</span> &amp; <span class="ital">constant</span> correspondent. – The only person with whom correspondence has become a <span class="ital">habit</span>, – with whom I can be grave or nonsensical, to whom I can say <span class="ital">quidlibet de quolibet</span>,
