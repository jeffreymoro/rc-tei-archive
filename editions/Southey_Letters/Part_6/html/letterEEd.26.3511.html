                  while I was waiting for the Stage Coach. My time in London was so compleatly filled
                  up with hurrying &amp; wearying engagements of various kinds, that reading was impossible.
                  I am now once more at home &amp; in quiet; &amp; having received the packages of books which
                  followed me, the first which I read has been your volume. Till I had perused it I
                  would not thank you for it, – for a letter of thanks in such cases, written before
                  the book is read, may often be rightly understood as implying in the writer <span class="strikethrough">a wish not to express any opinion to xxxx</span> a disinclination to read <span class="strikethrough">the work</span> &lt;it&gt;, or an apprehension that, having read it, the opinion which he should form would

                  of the great truths of Christianity supported by an original train of argument, which
                  the more it is considered the stronger it must appear. I have read it too with advantage
