                           the Plan of Pacification (1795), which confirmed that the Methodist Conference could

               Wesley’s death was when the New Connexion left in 1797 over issues of church government.
               But this was after the final split between the Anglican Church and Methodism over
               the Plan of Pacification (1795), which confirmed that the Methodist Conference could
               appoint Ministers who would be able to administer the sacraments.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note16_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               made in 1818 to authorise Ministers to administer the sacraments. This produced a
               split between ‘Primitives’, who wished to remain within the Church of England, and
               ‘Wesleyans’, who did not, which was not healed until 1878.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note17_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
