               return from Brazil, where the court had fled in 1807–1808. These events led to the
               separation of Brazil and Portugal in 1822.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               the ‘redder’ one is probably the pencil and watercolour sketch now in the collections
               of the Wordsworth Trust, Grasmere; and the ‘uncoloured’ one is in Keswick Museum and
