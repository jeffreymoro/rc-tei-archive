                  destroyed, &amp; the whole face seamed with scars. While she was very young she had a

                  500£, – I should think not more. Shop signs were general in those days, but the custom
                  of swinging them <span class="strikethrough">from high posts</span> over the street (as is still done at Inns in the country) was falling into disuse. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">My father</a> true to his boyish feelings &amp; his passion for field sports even in the uncongenial
                  way of life in which his lot had fallen, took a hare for his device. It <span class="strikethrough">occupied</span> &lt;was painted on&gt; a pane in the window on each side of the door, &amp; was engraved in

                  in the porters hand in London. &amp; I often think of having one cut upon a seal in remembrance
                  of Him &amp; of the old shop. Bryan the Prophet told me in the days of Brothers that I
                  was of the tribe of Judah,—a sort of nobility which those Prophets had the privilege
                  of discovering without any assistance from the Heralds office.
