               of Queen Charlotte’. Neither had been published by this time; the former eventually
               appeared in <em>Friendship’s Offering: A Literary Album and Christmas and New Year’s Present, for
                  1828</em> (London, 1828), pp. 1–6, and the latter in <em>Friendship’s Offering and Winter’s Wreath: a Literary Album, and Christmas and New

               been made to sign over his powers to his brother, Pedro II (1648–1706; King of Portugal
               1683–1706), who became Regent. Southey thought that something similar might take place
               in Spain, and that the king, Ferdinand VII, whom he detested, would be declared unfit
               to rule and replaced by a regency led by one of his younger brothers, Charles, Count
               of Molina (1788–1855) or Francisco, Duke of Cadiz (1794–1865). This did not happen.
