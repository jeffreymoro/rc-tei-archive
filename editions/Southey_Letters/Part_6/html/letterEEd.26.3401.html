                  are past when the speeches of Opposition might be read with pleasure &amp; advantage by
                  those who differed from the speakers in opinion &amp; disapproved their conduct. Nothing
                  is now left but the gall &amp; bitterness of faction: instead of logic &amp; eloquence you
                  have personalities &amp; calumny, &amp; the place of argument is supplied by the hardihood
                  which advances again &amp; again the same shameless misrepresentations. We shall not appear
                  a very wise people in the eyes of posterity. For what absurdity can be greater than

               before us, to the extent &amp; magnitude of which I cannot shut my eyes. A strong government,
               a wise administration &amp; a flourishing trade might enable us to overcome them, to attain
               a state of prosperity, &amp; place things in such a train as might promise to render that
               prosperity durable. But we have neither of these, nor any hope, nor any chance <span class="strikethrough">at present</span> of obtaining them. These are uncomfortable thoughts. – Enough of them therefore for
