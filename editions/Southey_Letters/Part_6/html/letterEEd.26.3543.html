                  that the consideration of whom I may please or displease would never make me turn
                  aside from what I believed to be the right line. I shall write fairly &amp; freely, in
                  the spirit of Christian charity. My personal feelings are those of respect toward
                  the Society (such as it has been since its first effervescence was spent) &amp; of good
                  will because of many of its members whom I have known &amp; esteemed. Its history I shall
                  relate with scrupulous fidelity, &amp; discuss its tenets with no unfavourable or unfriendly
                  bias, neither dissembling my own opinion when it accords, nor when it differs with
                  them. And perhaps I may expose myself to more censure from others on account of the
                  agreement, than from them because of the difference. But <span class="strikethrough">the one</span> neither the one result nor the other will in the slightest degree influence me: my
                  object being to compose with all diligence &amp; all possible impartiality an important
