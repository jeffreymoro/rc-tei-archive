                           “Necessity of Parliamentary Enquiry” (1820). This was a reply to the review in Edinburgh
                           Review, 44 (October 1819), 441–453, of Phillpotts’s pamphlet, A Letter to the Freeholders
                           of the County of Durham on the Proceedings of the County Meeting holden on Thursday,
                           21st October 1819 – and Particularly on the Speech of J. G. Lambton, Esq., M. P. (1819).</span></div>
                  </div> – if every person who has been misrepresented &amp; calumniated in that dishonest journal
                  had vindicated himself as temperately &amp; as ably as you have done, its credit would
                  have gone down in the world much sooner than it did. Your pamphletts cannot fail of
                  producing some good. Persons of the opposite party who are not so far gone in faction
                  as to be irrecoverable, will like the manner &amp; the temper so well that they will attend
                  the more willingly to the reasoning which is so candidly but cogently set forth, &amp;
                  the dignified severity with which you conclude will be felt where it ought to be. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</a>, I well know, winces like a galled jade

                  </div> &amp; the manifestation of feeling which they have called forth from the sound part of
                  the community, have produced a sudden calm over the country. The disease is not cured,
                  but time is gained for administering alteratives. The three things needful are – to
                  check the seditious press (which I fear is not sufficiently done) – to provide wholesome
                  instruction for the rising generation, &amp; to have a constant outlet open for restless
                  spirits &amp; superfluous hands. The attention of Government is directed to all these
                  objects, &amp; there exists a very general desire (quickened no doubt by a sense of danger)
                  to alleviate misery &amp; prevent crimes. If in the course of the next generation we are
                  not made the most miserable of all nations by a radical Revolution, there is I think
                  a fair prospect of our attaining to a greater degree of national happiness than has
                  ever been enjoyed by any people in any age of the world. <span class="ital">Utrum horum</span>?
