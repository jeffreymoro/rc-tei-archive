                  insolence &amp; atrocious calumnies with which he has been assailed. There is only one
                  sentence which I could wish you to reconsider; – instead of saying “not impertinently”,
                  it would be better in my judgement to say “with due (or with <span class="ital">dutiful</span>) respect, – &amp; I would leave out what is said of servility, because the days of servile
                  dedications are gone by, &amp; it is better not to seem thus to reflect upon a vicious
                  fashion which has become obsolete.
