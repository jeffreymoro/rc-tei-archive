               <p>I do not think the progress of Revolution in Brazil will be so rapid as to destroy
                  the credit of Government, or materially to affect its finances for some time. Even
                  from Para the surplus of the Treasury will be remitted to the Rio, till the people
                  of the former place chuse to make themselves the capital of a separate republic.

                           following the French invasion. Events in Portugal produced a number of sympathetic
                           military revolts in Brazil; one in the Province of Para was reported in The Times,
                           13 March 1821. These developments eventually led to the separation of Portugal and
                           Brazil in September 1822; but Brazil did not become a Republic until 1889, nor did

                  imprudent as to incur any farther risque of the same kind. Meantime I look with much
                  anxiety to the news from that country, far less for the kind of interest which I naturally
                  now take in its fortunes, than in your account: tho, as I said before, there will
                  be time for your brother to save what he has embarked, before the total wreck.</p>

Make your choice
                  of these. Of the two which he took away in nearly a finished state, I know not which
                  was to be preferred, – that in the lilac dress had most of the features, that in the
                  redder one more of the character; – he expected to make the third of which the dress
                  was not coloured when he went away, better than either.
