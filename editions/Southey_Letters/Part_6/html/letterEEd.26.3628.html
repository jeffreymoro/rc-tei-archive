                  I cannot but hesitate in fixing upon such a man as Wesley a spot that must blacken

                           see Southey to [Glocester Wilson], 29 December 1820. However, the letter Wilson possessed
                           was only a copy. He had received this from his mother and she had, in turn, been given
                           it some years before by Wesley’s estranged wife, Mary (1709/10–1781). </span></div>
                  </div> what M<sup>rs</sup> Wesley gave his mother was a copy only: had it been the original it might have been
                  possible to identify the handwriting. As it is, I am inclined to suspect that it was
                  a scheme of M<sup>rs</sup> Wesleys to blast her husbands character, for she told M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson that she considered her life to be in her danger from him, &amp; a woman who could
                  say that would not scruple at producing a supposititious letter.
