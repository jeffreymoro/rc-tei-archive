            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It appears to me that whatever time you bestow upon the classics is little better
                  than time lost.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Neville White had enrolled at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1819 as a part-time Bachelor
                           of Divinity student. The course lasted ten years and required minimal residence in
                           Cambridge. The assessment was also light. He did not need to acquire this degree in
                           order to become a clergyman – he had passed his examination for the priesthood in
                           October 1820.</span></div>
                  </div> Classical attainments are not necessary for you, and even if you were ten years younger
                  than you are, they would not be within your reach. This you yourself feel; you had
                  better therefore make up your mind to be contented without them, and desist from a
                  study which is quite impossible for you to pursue with any advantage to yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My dear Neville, it is a common infirmity with us to over-value what we do not happen
                  to possess. In your education you have learnt much which is not acquired in schools
                  and colleges, but which is of great practical utility, – more probably than you would
                  now find it if you had taken a wrangler’s degree, or ranked as a medallist.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>i.e. if White had achieved academic success at Cambridge by being a wrangler (obtaining
                           first class honours in the third year of a degree), or by winning or being ranked
                           in a university competition (for example, the Chancellor’s Gold Medal). </span></div>
                  </div> You have mingled among men of business. You know their good and their evil, the characters
                  which are formed by trade, and the temptations which are incident to it. You have
                  acquired a knowledge of the existing constitution of society, and situated as you
                  will be, in or near a great city, and in a trading country, this will be of much more
                  use to you professionally, than any university accomplishments. Knowing the probable
                  failings of your flock, you will know what warnings will be most applicable, and what
                  exhortations will be most likely to do them good.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The time which classical studies would take may be much more profitably employed upon
               history and books of travels. The better you are read in both, the more you will prize
               the peculiar blessings which this country enjoys in its constitution of Church and
               State, and more especially in the former branch. I could write largely upon this theme.
               The greater part of the evil in the world, – that is, all the evil in it which is
               remediable (and which I take to be at least nine-tenths of the whole) – arises either
               from the want of institutions, as among savages; from imperfect ones, as among barbarians;
               or from bad ones, as in point of government among the oriental nations; and in point
               of religion among them also, and in the intolerant Catholic countries. In your own
               language you will find all you need, – scriptural illustrations, and stores of knowledge
               of every kind.</p>
            <p class="indent1">What you say concerning my correspondence, and the latitude which you allow me is
               both kind and considerate, as is always to be expected from Neville White. I do not,
               however, so easily forgive myself when a long interval of silence has been suffered
               to elapse. A letter is like a fresh billet of wood upon the fire, which, if it be
               not needed for immediate warmth, is always agreeable for its exhilarating effects.
               I who spend so many hours alone love to pass a portion of them in conversing thus
               with those whom I love.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will be grieved to hear that I have lost my poor friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a>, whom you saw with us in the autumn. He left us at the beginning of November, and
               is now in his grave! This has been a severe shock to me. I had a most sincere regard
               for him, and very many pleasant recollections are now so changed by his death, that
               they will never recur without pain. He was so thoroughly amiable, so sensible of any
               little kindness that was shown him, so kind in all his thoughts, words, and deeds;
               and withal bore his cross so patiently and meekly, that every body who knew him respected
               him and loved him. Very few circumstances could have affected me more deeply than
               his loss.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Remember me most kindly to your excellent mother, and to your sisters.
