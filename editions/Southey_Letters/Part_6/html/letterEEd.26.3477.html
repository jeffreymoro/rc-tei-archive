            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Since I have been in London I have very often wished that you, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</a> were with me for a little while, to see what a number of strange things there are
               to be seen in this great overgrown town. London is so large a place that if the whole
               lake of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, and the whole vale from the end of the Lake to Bassenthwaite, and from <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Skiddaw">Skiddaw</a> and Latrigg on one side to the foot of the mountains on the other were covered with
               houses, altogether would not make so great a city as London by one half. Think then
               what a huge place it must be; and all full of streets, with no gardens or fields;
               nothing to be seen but buildings on every side, and stone pavements under your feet,
               and such a smoky air overhead that you can hardly see what a blue sky is. And then
               such a number of carts and carriages, going all day long through the streets, and
               almost all night too; and such thousands and ten thousands of people; from morning
               till night the great streets are as full as <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> is upon fair-day.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I arrived in London on May Day, which is a holiday for the chimney sweepers. All the
                  chimney sweepers, little and great, on that day are dressed as fine as they can make
                  themselves, with ribbons of all colours, and a great deal of gilding about them, and
                  feathers in their caps; and they go about the streets with a wooden thing in one hand
                  (such as the churchwardens carry about in church to collect money for a brief), and
                  their brush in the other; and with these they make a clatter, and beg money from those
                  who stop to look at them. They have generally a green man in company who is also called
                  “Jack in the Bush,” because he is in the middle of a green bush, which covers him
                  all over, head and all, so that you can see nothing but his feet, and he goes dancing
                  with the rest. This bush is ornamented with ribbons, and I have seen them in former
                  times half covered with bright pewter pots and dishes, which it must have been a great
                  fatigue to carry about and dance under their weight, especially in a hot day, and
                  being so shut up from the air. This Jack in the Bush is a comical sight, but I am
                  sorry to say that it does harm by frightening horses: a poor curate in the adjoining
                  parish of Tooting, the other day was thrown in consequence under the wheels of a stage
                  coach, and it is not yet known whether he will recover from the dreadful hurts which
                  he received.

            <p class="indent1">But how would you like to see these chimney sweepers that are so very fine! I have
               seen you and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bell</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</a> look somewhat like them when you had dressed yourselves up; but you were never half
               so fine, because you had no gilt finery about your clothes. Moreover the sweeps beautify
               their faces in a remarkable manner. I will tell you how to do it if you wish to be
               as fine as they are. You know their faces are very smutty: they let the smut stay
               that they may be known for chimney sweepers: therefore to be like them you must first
               rub some soot upon your faces. Next, you must rub some whiting upon your cheeks and
               forehead, that there may be great white patches in the middle of the smut; and then
               upon the white you must rub a little rose pink, and upon that again here and there
               you must stick some beaten gold, so that the face may be black and white, and purple,
               and gilt: if you do this, you will then be as fine as so many chimney sweepers on
               the first of May. I must not forget to observe that the chimney sweepers make a feast
               with the money which is given them; and they are so fond of their holiday that they
               make the first of May last the whole of the week; so you may tell <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith</a> that her birthday is not yet over in London.</p>

               <p>If I were to describe the extraordinary things which I have seen in the shops only
                  while walking along the streets, a whole letter would not afford sufficient room.
                  I will only tell you, that in one window I saw a great many shaddocks,
