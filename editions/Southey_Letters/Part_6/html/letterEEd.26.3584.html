               <p>My dear Sir, – You will think that I am damping your hopes, because I tell you that
                  they must be tamed and broken-in to the uses of the world.

                  </div> to which you would devote yourself, is in reality very unlike what it appears to a
                  youthful imagination. Their yoke is not easy, neither is their burthen light. Believe
                  me, when I tell you that of all modes of life, that of the man who trusts to his literary
                  exertions alone for support is the most miserable. And the very end at which he aims
                  in his outset – that of improving and exalting his intellectual faculties – is most
                  effectually defeated by the means which he pursues. They are worn and jaded by the
                  daily labour to which they must be subjected; and they are inevitably degraded and
                  polluted by the necessity of writing for immediate effect and sale, and consequently
                  of following the humour of the times. Poetry will be the delight of your life if you
                  cultivate it for its own sake – your bane if you trust to it for subsistence. In the
                  latter case, it would not be expressing myself too strongly, were I to say that there
                  is danger of destruction both to body and mind – in the former you will find hope,
                  strength, consolation; and, if patience be not wanting, ultimately the honour and
                  remembrance to which you aspire.</p>

                  </div> Not one volume of poems out of twenty that are published pays the expense of publication.
                  Works of this nature which would have obtained general admiration forty and even thirty
                  years ago, are now still-born from the Press: the public appetite being palled, not
                  only by the number of dishes which are set before it, but also by the high spicing
                  with which too many of them are seasoned. And in the poems of a very young writer,
                  the faults lie upon the surface, and are perceived by those (the great majority) who
                  are quite incapable of perceiving the genius which is blended with them, and the seeds
                  of excellence among the rubbish. Be not discouraged at this; but do not think of publishing
                  more at present. At your age the growth of your mind, when under proper culture, will
                  be so rapid, that before a poem had been published six months, you would wish to alter
                  one half of it and perhaps to strike out the other.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The first and most important advice which I would impress upon you is to attend to
                  the business of life. In what business are you engaged? And what prospect or hope
                  have you of bettering your condition in it? Let me know your domestic history. I would
                  serve you, if I could, more substantially than by advice alone, but advice is good
                  for something. You have found time to compose a very great number of verses; you will
                  therefore be able to find time for disciplining and storing your mind and laying in
                  knowledge. The great use of youthful composition is to acquire command of language
                  and of versification. Having so far accomplished this, the next task is to learn how
                  to employ that power – what faults to avoid, and at what excellences to aim. It would
                  be useless to send me your ‘Astrea’

                  </div> – no bookseller would undertake the risk of publishing so long a poem. In long works
                  the design is of as much importance as the execution; but the art of planning a long
                  work is almost the last which is acquired. In small pieces there is not that difficulty;
                  and the power of a youthful mind may as well be shown by a short poem as by a long
                  one, by twenty or fifty lines as well as ten thousand. Take, for example, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">H. K. White</a> and ‘The Rosemary,’ and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#KnowlesHerbert">Herbert Knowles’s</a> poem written in Richmond churchyard.
