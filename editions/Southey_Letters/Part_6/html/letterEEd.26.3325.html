                           Its main opponent was John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon (1751–1838; DNB), Lord Chancellor
                           1801–1806, 1807–1827. His determined opposition to legislation in this field meant
                           that no further regulation of asylums was passed until 1828. In his speech against
                           the Bill, Eldon complimented Wynn by stating: ‘This bill came from the other house
                           of parliament, and so much did he respect the individual with whom it originated,
                           that nothing would induce him to oppose it, if he did not feel himself bound to do

                  </div> – Another session &amp; you will carry your object. It is a melancholy reflection that
                  we have so little of that charity in Protestant Countries which the Roman Catholics
                  can draw upon to any amount. It exists as strongly in individuals, – but there is
                  no regular channel in which it can act. And yet how greatly is it wanted in prisons,
                  &amp; hospitals, &amp; mad houses! And if it were possible to give some of our enthusiasts
                  that direction, many of them would do much good who would otherwise be doing no little
                  evil. You will see that I scatter some good seeds upon this subject in the Life of
                  Wesley,
