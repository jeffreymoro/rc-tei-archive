                           a County Meeting at Wigton on 13 October 1819, addressed by Brougham, to protest at
                           the local authorities’ actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew
                           up a conservative response – an Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals
                           and calling for curbs on the press. This Address was circulated by Lord Lonsdale,
                           the Lord Lieutenant for Cumberland, and a copy was leaked to the Morning Chronicle,
                           23 October 1819. However, the Chronicle correctly reported that ‘several of the most

                  would not be easy for an opponent to gain a hearing; and certainly no person who regards
                  his own character as a gentleman would expose himself to a personal altercation with
                  one who cares so little in all his public conduct for the urbanities of life. There
                  is one requisite of a demagogue, Mr. Brougham, which you possess in perfection: when
                  you address the rabble you address yourself admirably to their humour, and cast aside
                  every thing in feeling or manner by which they could possibly distinguish you from
                  one of themselves. The press, however, is open to your antagonists, and in bringing
                  you by this means before the tribunal of sober minds, they run no risqué of being
                  silenced by the clamour of your friends, or the brickbats of your partizans.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You have insisted that the Loyal Address of the County of Cumberland was privately
               prepared, and clandestinely circulated. Privately prepared any paper must be which
               is not got up at a public meeting; but how that which was circulated by the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lieutenant</a>, and lay publicly for signatures can be said to have been <span class="ital">clandestinely</span> brought forward, it would be difficult to understand if we did not know that political
               orators sometimes indulge in bolder licences of speech than have ever been claimed
               by the poets.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The Address you are pleased to say is <span class="ital">very long indeed and extremely dull</span>. In a matter of taste, who shall presume to dispute the sentence of a Scotch Reviewer?

                  inch rule, and your own speech, which is precisely upon the same subject appears even
                  in its abbreviated report to be more than thrice as lengthy. Let that pass. Whether
                  the Address be long or short, ill-written or well, is of no moment: you are welcome
                  to display your own skill in the niceties of composition by animadverting upon its
                  style, – but you shall not misrepresent its meaning as you have done, without being

                           Whig landowners, including William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam (1748–1833; DNB),
                           Lord-Lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire, and Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of

                  </div> you have thought proper to say, that these personages are described in the Address

                  of the Address is not a fool that he should throw out such senseless aspersions; nor
                  could you, Sir, be so stupid as thus grossly to mistake the meaning of a plain and
                  obvious allusion to the mob-heroes of the day. If it had been possible for a man of
                  the bluntest understanding to make the mistake, the very next sentence in the paper
                  would have shown him his blunder, where the Whigs who have attended the public meetings
                  in question are distinctly alluded to as persons of rank and respectability. You did
                  not misunderstand the passage, and I accuse you, Sir, of having deliberately and wilfully
                  misrepresented it.</p>

               <p>But this, Sir, is not the only misrepresentation of which you were guilty, in your

                  lives were lost at Manchester – yet <span class="ital">greater and far more extensive evils must arise, if the people are allowed to assemble</span>; – the paragraph proceeds to say, <span class="ital">under such circumstances, in contempt of the constituted authorities</span>, – but you cut off the last member of the sentence, make your full stop where it
                  suits your purpose, and then proceed to argue and inveigh against the mutilated passage,
                  as if you had given its whole meaning. You call it slavish, and base, and pitiful,
                  and low, and cowardly, and then you ask if they are Englishmen who have said this?
                  Truer Englishmen than yourself, Mr. Brougham, in birth, in breeding, in all their

                           drilling at White Moss, near Middleton, and had been attacked and beaten. Secondly,
                           Joseph Harrison (1779–1848), one of the organisers of a radical meeting in Stockport
                           on 28 June 1819, was arrested in London and when he was being escorted back for trial
                           in Cheshire, the constable, William Birch (b. 1792), accompanying him was shot and
                           wounded on 23 July 1819.</span></div>
                  </div> There was nothing equivocal in the object of the meeting. The Radicals avowed their
                  object, – it was <span class="ital">Liberty</span>, according to their acceptation of the word, <span class="ital">or Death</span>. It is notorious that pikes had been manufactured for their use, and that they had

         <div class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">1.. </span><span class="noteBody">Following the ‘Peterloo’ Massacre of 16 August 1819, Whigs in Cumberland organised
               a County Meeting at Wigton on 13 October 1819, addressed by Brougham, to protest at
               the local authorities’ actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew
               up a conservative response – an Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals
               and calling for curbs on the press. This Address was circulated by Lord Lonsdale,
               the Lord Lieutenant for Cumberland, and a copy was leaked to the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 23 October 1819. However, the <em>Chronicle</em> correctly reported that ‘several of the most respectable of the LOWTHER party have
               refused to sign the Loyal Address, and cry out against it as <span class="ital">ultra</span>’. The Address was not proceeded with, and government supporters in Cumberland produced
               a more moderate document. A further County Meeting for Westmorland was held at Kendal
               on 21 October 1819 to protest against the authorities’ actions at the ‘Peterloo’ meeting.
               Brougham was present, and read out and denounced the rival pro-government Loyal Address
               which Southey had written (though Brougham was unaware of its author). He remarked
               that the Address ‘is very long indeed, and extremely dull’, and described its authors
               as ‘fawning sycophants’ who had produced a ‘slavish’ document, <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 26 October 1819.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               constables, James Murray and William Shawcross (dates unknown), had observed radicals
               drilling at White Moss, near Middleton, and had been attacked and beaten. Secondly,
               Joseph Harrison (1779–1848), one of the organisers of a radical meeting in Stockport
               on 28 June 1819, was arrested in London and when he was being escorted back for trial
               in Cheshire, the constable, William Birch (b. 1792), accompanying him was shot and
               wounded on 23 July 1819.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note7_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in ‘Mr Brougham. – Education Committee’, <em>Quarterly Review</em>, 19 (July 1818), 492–569, published 2 February 1819. Southey was particularly sensitive
               to the charges that Brougham made against people in public life, as it had been reported
               that Brougham had attacked Southey from the hustings during the Westmorland election,
               on 30 June 1818. Southey had drawn up a list of similar criticisms that Brougham had
               made, and which he intended to use in his planned (but uncompleted) published response
               to Brougham; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 1 August 1818, <em>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</em>, Letter 3175.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note11_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
