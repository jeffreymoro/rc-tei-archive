                  of what an hexameter is, to enable him to give it its proper accentuation; but leaving
                  that to follow (as in any other kind of verse) from the natural &amp; proper pronunciation
                  of the words. I find it a full &amp; sonorous measure, capable of great strength, great
                  sweetness &amp; great variety of movement. This you may rely upon, that if the thoughts
                  will support the measure, – the measure will support the thoughts. – I hope it will
