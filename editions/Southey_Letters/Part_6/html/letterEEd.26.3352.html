                  so much was never done by any Government for the improvement of a country in the same

                  a few hundred pounds, to such enormous ones as require an expence of 70 or 80,000.

               built between 1814–1816, to carry the road over Loch Fleet. It comprised an earthwork,
               and a bridge with self-regulating sluice gates that allowed the waters from the river
               to flow out, but prevented seawater from coming in.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               1836–1881, in 1836); and their companion, Emma Pigott. It is difficult to be sure
               of Miss Pigott’s identity, but she might have been Emma Pigott (dates unknown), younger
               daughter and co-heiress of James Pigott (d. 1822) of Fitz-Hall, Iping, Sussex. Fitz-Hall
               was only five miles from Susannah Rickman’s home at Harting. Emma Pigott married,

               in the 21st Light Dragoons and the brother of Charles Collins, Southey’s old schoolfriend.
               Southey missed seeing him, as Collins had travelled south to deal with matters arising
               from the death of his father, William Collins (c. 1751–1819), naval engineer and inventor,
               on 23 April 1819 at his home in Maize Hill, Greenwich. Southey did see Collins’s wife,
               Margaret (d. 1852), and her uncle, James Wood (d. 1825), of Keithick, Perthshire.
               Dr Wood was ‘a delightful old man’ who ‘set me at ease concerning one of the tumours
