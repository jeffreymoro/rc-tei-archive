                  for an opportunity of conveyance. It was not till this morning that I received it
                  in a parcel, dated on the sixth of this month. The waggon travels slowly, &amp; more time
                  is lost in carriers warehouses, where a parcel has to change conveyances twice or
                  thrice on the road, than is required for the journey. – I now thank you again for
                  the dedication &amp; the poem. It is a very pleasing production, in a fine strain of genuine
                  feeling.</p>

                  a good deal in collecting materials &amp; digesting the order of their arrangement. The

                  of the subject, I shall take care to <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> show to some members of the society before it is printed. The general spirit &amp; tendency
                  of the book will, I doubt not, be thought favourable <span class="ital">by</span> the Quakers <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> as well as <span class="ital">to</span> them, &amp; the more so by the judicious, because communication comes with <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> ten fold weight from one who does not dissemble his own differences of opinion upon <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> certain main points. – Perhaps in the course of the work I may avail myself of your
