                  to you in the object at which you are aiming; &amp; if great powers, great activity of
                  mind, great industry, and great readiness, are considered, as they ought to be, the
                  requisites for Professorship, I know not to whom the Magistrates &amp; Town Council could
                  award it with more propriety than to you.
