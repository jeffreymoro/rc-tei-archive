               and the series of events that followed, as attempts were made to deprive her of the
               title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King, made her a figurehead for
               radicals, and also triggered public protests in her support. Southey, who was ferociously
               opposed to Caroline, here compares her to Messalina (c. AD 17/20–48), the infamously
               dissolute wife of Claudius (10 BC–AD 54; Emperor of Rome AD 41–54).</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
