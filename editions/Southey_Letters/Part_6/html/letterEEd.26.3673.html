               <p>To my great surprize I have lately met with proof positive that Siphilis was known
                  by its French name as the prevailing pest of the age, before the discovery of America,
                  &amp; that it had taken the Greek Professor at Salamanca by the nose, four years before
                  Columbus sailed on his first voyage.

                           was commissioned by the Spanish crown to sail west across the Atlantic in 1492; he
                           discovered America rather than Asia. Southey had been collecting information that
                           seemed to disprove the view that syphilis had an American origin; see Robert Southey
                           to Herbert Hill, 8 April 1821, Letter 3666.</span></div>
