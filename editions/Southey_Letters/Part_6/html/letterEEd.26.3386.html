            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I would do what you desire if it were possible. But when I wrote to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gifford</a> immediately on my return <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx</span> from Scotland, I then declined writing upon this subject,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> because it <span class="strikethrough">then</span> appeared to me too late to undertake it for the next number, writing as I do, slowly,
                  in every thing but narration. You talk of a week; – it would be the principal business
                  of a month, work as diligently as I could.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

                  &amp; if preventive means had been used when first I pointed out the coming danger in
                  the Q.R. much of the existing evil might have been easily averted.

                  </div> All that you say of the advantages afforded by publishing in such a journal as yours
                  is true, &amp; you may remember that I yielded to those same arguments three years ago,
                  &amp; cast into the shape which you advised what would otherwise have been brought forward
                  in a more regular &amp; extended form.

                  </div> The immediate object was obtained, – but I believe it was at the expence of a greater
                  good. A review is laid upon the shelf sooner than a substantive volume, &amp; is not so
                  likely to be taken from it. And I am inclined to think that if I had brought forward
                  my views of the state of society &amp; its impending dangers in a connected shape, – &amp;
                  with that perfect freedom which I should have felt when publishing in my own name,
                  – there would have been a regular set of opinions before the public, to which the
                  well disposed might have been contented to appeal as their articles of political belief.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The advantages of writing anonymously are imaginary <span class="strikethrough">in my case</span> as far as I am concerned. <span class="strikethrough">A</span> I <span class="strikethrough">enjoy</span> &lt;have&gt; already as large a portion of critical &amp; Jacobinical abuse as can possibly
               be bestowed upon me. Whoever hates the government &amp; the religion of his country, whoever
               has renounced his Saviour &amp; would dethrone his King, regards me <span class="strikethrough">as his</span> with a deadly hatred. If I <span class="strikethrough">regarded</span> &lt;cared for&gt; this <span class="strikethrough">with</span> (which I do not) I am not in the slightest degree protected from it by writing in
               the Review; <span class="strikethrough">but on the contrary</span> I am just as much exposed – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">am less able to d</span> which is a real evil, I am exposed to disadvantage which I should not be, if standing
               alone. For in the first place, I cannot speak out, as I would do, tho by so doing
               I should serve the Government with far greater effect. This passage must be softened,
               &amp; that must be expunged, – till sometimes a paragraph appears so mutilated in argument
               &amp; so emasculated in style, that I scarcely recognize my own writing &amp; should be unable
               to defend it. <span class="strikethrough">And perhaps in the next number there appears an article there expressly written for
                  the purpose of contradicting what I had advanced</span> – I am in the situation of a man brought into the lists <span class="strikethrough">to</span> as a Champion, if those persons for whom he fights were <span class="strikethrough">to every now &amp; then</span> to insist upon his laying aside his own weapons which he has been accustomed to wield
               &amp; on which he can depend; &amp; were moreover every now &amp; then to catch him by the arm
               when he is about to strike, for the purpose of giving the blow a different direction,
               or adding <span class="strikethrough">force</span> &lt;strength&gt; to it, whereas the effect of such interference is effectually to frustrate
               <span class="strikethrough">the</span> &lt;his&gt; aim &amp; <span class="strikethrough">destroy xx its force</span> take away this force.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You are not aware how much my articles have suffered by this sort of mutilation, –
               to say nothing of what they lose by being written under a sense of restraint.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>On the whole then I am not displeased that there should be so unanswerable a reason
                  as the shortness of time, for not writing a political <span class="strikethrough">arti</span> paper just now. Sometime or other I shall find an opportunity of treating upon the
                  Prospects of Society when I can do it in my own way, &amp; to my own satisfaction.
