                  have some ground. For tho <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my Fathers</a> name is only mentioned in the device of the Fitzhead lease, <span class="strikethrough">there</span> &amp; it is by no means unlikely that the other property entailed upon Lord S. &amp; his issue,
                  may revert to the heirs of the testator, upon the death of Lord S. without issue.

               &amp; it will not be difficult to find the other trials (for there were several) in the
               Report Books. Lord S. sold the whole property, – which he was not entitled to do till
               he had a son of age to consent to it. The first business is to discover whether I
