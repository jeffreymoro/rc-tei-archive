               <p>I thank you for the volume, and for the honourable manner in which you have mentioned

                           of Henry Kirke White and concluded with a ‘Sonnet to Robert Southey, Esq. Poet Laureate’
                           (p. 223). The latter lauded Southey as a ‘Prolific Mind – spontaneous Muse – bright
                           Star,/ In the pure Heaven of Verse benign and clear!/ Friend of the Dead! who pierced
                           each scattered scroll,/ Preserving to all time the Poet’s name,/ Of that young, resolute,
                           weak, yet ardent soul,/ Which burnt out its own fire, and went in flame/ To be renewed
                           above the dulcet pole –/ Friend of the Dead! – and this shall be thy fame.’</span></div>
                  </div> On such occasions as this it is a painful task to reply to an author, if a mere acknowledgement
                  of thanks, couched in the language of common courtesy, is all that I can offer, consistently
                  with truth. But it becomes a very gratifying one, when I can with perfect sincerity
                  give commendation and encouragement. Your legend,

                  </div> though crude in the plan and faulty in composition, as so juvenile a production needs
                  must be, contains the strongest and most unequivocal proofs, not of poetical feeling
                  alone (which may exist without genius), but of genius also. The interest which this
                  alone would have excited concerning you, is much increased by what I gather of your
                  history from some of the smaller poems, and by the tone of moral principle which everywhere
                  prevails. And when I came to your assertion that no duty has ever been neglected by
                  you for the pursuit of poetry,
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> the main apprehension which I should otherwise have felt for your success in life
                  was removed. Time enough may be found for business and for literature – even by those
                  whose employments are most laborious. I could give you examples of this, but happily
                  you stand in no need of admonition on this score.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Respecting your progress in poetry, and the course of reading by which your mind is
               to be enriched and strengthened, it is probably in my power to offer you some useful
               advice, and perhaps to direct you into a shorter and safer path than you would find
               for yourself. But I must know more of your circumstances, and schemes, and hopes.
               Write to me, therefore, as fully as you may feel inclined. Though with more employments
               than you or any person would suppose, I will yet find time to advise you faithfully
               and frankly. – Meantime, believe me to be truly your well-wisher,</p>
