            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>It is very gratifying to know that you are satisfied with my good endeavours, – &amp;
                  the more gratifying inasmuch as <span class="strikethrough">xxxx xxx</span> the paper having been delayed nearly two years in the Editors hands, has suffered
                  considerably by mutilation on its way thro the press.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Southey’s review of Benjamin Haydon, New Churches, Considered with Respect to the
                           Opportunities they Offer for the Encouragement of Painting (1818) appeared in Quarterly
                           Review, 23 (July 1820), 549–591, published on 5 October 1820. When Southey first submitted
                           it, Gifford asked Southey to rewrite it to make it longer and he then made considerable
                           alterations to the second draft before it was published; see Southey to John Murray,
                           19 October 1819, Letter 3368, and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 8 October
                           [1820], Letter 3535.</span></div>
                  </div> I had quoted much more largely from your pamphlett, – &amp; in what follows the extract
                  not only sentences, but whole paragraphs have been cut out. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GiffordWilliam">M<sup>r</sup> Gifford</a> has more than once promised me that he would not take these unwarrantable liberties
                  with my papers, – but I believe he might as well promise to abstain from food, as
                  from the exercise of his editorial authority.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">The subject if treated by itself would only have filled three or four pages. – I thought
               it better therefore to <span class="strikethrough">xxxxx</span> introduce it at the end of a paper considerable in length &amp; treating of other important
               things; – sure of gaining thereby this advantage at least, that those persons who
               should be impressed by the facts stated, or the arguments adduced in the earlier part
               of the essay, would be disposed to agree with the writer throughout, &amp; thus follow
               him with willing minds to the end.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The press has great power for producing immediate evil, – much less for bringing about
               any immediate good. But tho truth &amp; good principles make their way slowly, they are
               sure to make it at last. And I have no doubt that whenever the Government finds itself
               at ease concerning the revenue the Arts will feel the benefit. The disposition is
               not wanting.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You have great subjects in hand, – &amp; if any man can be equal to them – you are.
