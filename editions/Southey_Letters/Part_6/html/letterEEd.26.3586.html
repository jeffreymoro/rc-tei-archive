                           and John Stoddart (1773–1856; DNB), who was an acquaintance of Coleridge in Malta

                           from that post in 1816, he edited a new pro-ministry paper, theNew Times 1817–1826.
                           The ‘Association’ was the Constitutional Association (1821–1822), which issued pro-government
                           propaganda and endeavoured to secure the conviction of radical journalists for libel.

                  </div> – We live in odd times. The use of Government is to protect individuals, &amp; a strange
                  revolution must have taken place before it becomes necessary for individuals to combine
                  for the purpose of protecting government. The ultimate policy of such Associations
                  I very much doubt, &amp; am not much inclined to think favourably of their immediate utility,
                  as tending to encourage weak ministers in their disposition to shift responsibility
                  &amp; trouble upon any body rather than rouse themselves to a sense of danger &amp; of duty.
                  – I understand that I am to be applied to on this occasion, but I am by no means determined
                  what <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> answer to return. Not from any humour of caution, – a man whose name would stand in
                  the first column of a proscription <span class="strikethrough">can lose</span> &lt;risques&gt; nothing by setting it forward in any cartel of defiance that his party may
                  set forth; – but from the doubts which I have here expressed.</p>

               <p>What a frightful thing is this change in the nature of small pox; that every week
                  brings to ones knowledge some fresh instance of its occurring for the second time,
                  inoculation seeming now to afford as little security as vaccination!

                           an older method of treatment that was riskier to undergo, as it involved immunizing

                  </div> – Is this a change in the type of the disease (for diseases have their revolutions)
                  – a change in the human body? or were such cases as frequent formerly, only that they
                  past unobserved? – Reasoning upon probabilities, one might have supposed that any
                  disease might be taken a second time, after a certain lapse of years; – every particle
                  of the body being renewed in that time. Facts however are decidedly against this,
                  as in measles still, – as in small pox, till very lately, – for this question must
                  have been largely discussed &amp; carefully examined during the first years of inoculation.</p>
