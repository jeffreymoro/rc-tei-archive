               <p>I am out of order at one end, – luckily it is not at the top. God keep me sound there,
                  &amp; any other affliction will be comparatively light. What I used to take for hæmorrhoids
                  I have reason to believe is prolapsus, the state of the part varies greatly at different
                  times. A fortnight ago I walked up Saddleback without the slightest inconvenience,
                  &amp; now it comes down not only with the shortest walk, but as I sit at my desk I rise
                  free from the complaint. It comes on about half an hour after stool, – the <span class="strikethrough">gut</span> &lt;ring&gt; descending after it has been properly replaced. The cause I believe to be this.
                  – Rectum is <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxxxxx</span> wrong with me; – &amp; <span class="strikethrough">xxxx wrong xxx xxx</span> how I cannot tell, but wrong it &lt;certainly&gt; is. In my ordinary course of life I am
                  obliged to remain a long while upon the seat, before a motion is produced, – not by
                  straining, – the tripes know what they have to do, only they are a long while about
                  it; – &amp; very <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> rarely discharge as much of their contents <span class="strikethrough">then</span> at first as they ought to do. I suspect that the fæces which are brought lower down
                  at that time, &amp; still retained, occasion the protrusion, – because if in the course
                  of the morning I can <span class="strikethrough">produ</span> effect a farther discharge, the annoyance ceases. – After a walk I return with a considerable
                  protrusion, – in an inflamed state, the reaction would not be worth a thought, &amp; hardly
                  occasion one, if I did not know what was the cause of it. I replace the &lt;part&gt; immediately
                  when I come into the house, go to dinner, &amp; as if the excitement of food acted as
                  a general tonic, feel no more of it for the day, unless I go again to stool, – or
                  walk. – When I have &lt;been&gt; <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx</span> taking continual exercise, eating of course with increased appetite (probably twice
                  the quantity of food that I do at home) &amp; drinking liberally of good wine (Angels
