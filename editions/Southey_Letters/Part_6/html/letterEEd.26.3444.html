                  the fishermen, &amp; the fish-potters being <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> unanimously of opinion that this is not the season. The proper months are October

                           1820, leading to the succession of his eldest son, George IV, who was desperate to
                           divorce his estranged wife, Queen Caroline (1768–1821; DNB). The death of a monarch
                           automatically triggered a general election, which occurred between 6 March and 14
                           April 1820. The previous general election in 1818 had produced a bitter contest in
                           Westmorland, where Henry Brougham had attempted to break the Lowther family’s hold
                           on both seats. Finally, Charles Ferdinand d’Artoise, Duc de Berri (1778–1820), a nephew

               <p>You will be compelled, sooner or later, to agree with me concerning the Press, &amp; you
                  cannot be more unwilling to come to that opinion than I have been. There will be no
                  security for government or society, till the constituted authorities all over Europe
                  have the controul of the Press. The question is whether this shall be conceded to
                  an equitable Government, which consults the public good, &amp; regards public opinion,
                  – as the means of preventing revolution, – or whether it will be taken by the military

                  this miserable country must inevitably undergo, unless the Press be curbed. We have
                  no statesman courageous enough to venture upon the remedy, tho I cannot believe any
                  of our statesmen can be so blind as not to understand the danger. What then is to <span class="strikethrough">preserve</span> &lt;save&gt; us? Perhaps a premature rebellion, before the army is corrupted: this is not
                  so likely as it was three months ago, when a day for the attempt was fixed, &amp; when
                  any government but ours would have caught the ring leaders in a trap.
