                           notoriety for publishing private letters by Alexander Pope (1688–1744; DNB), though
                           it is now acknowledged that he was tricked by the latter into so doing. John Nichols
                           was an inveterate collector, editor and publisher of literary manuscripts. They, along
                           with Richard Phillips, are, for Southey and Elmsley, examples of members of the literary
                           trade who catered to the public appetite for knowledge of authors and in so doing
                           profited from the writings of others.</span></div>

                  designed to give. It is well that I had never reckoned upon such chances. My castles
                  in the air have been of a different kind. – I have rubbed on up the hill, &amp; made my
                  way in spite of many impediments &amp; encumbrances. My means have kept pace with a growing
                  expenditure. It is true that this depends upon the continuance of health &amp; faculties,
                  &amp; that the stroke which disables me will also cut off my &lt;main&gt; resources. But I live
                  in hope. What with my books, copyrights &amp; papers, &amp; a life insurance for 4000£ (which
                  is now worth 5) if I died tomorrow, there would be ten thousand pounds for my family.
                  And if it please God that I live ten years &amp; continue to do well, I have plans &amp; engagements
                  which will enable me to lay by not less than 5000£.</p>

               private letters by Alexander Pope (1688–1744; <em>DNB</em>), though it is now acknowledged that he was tricked by the latter into so doing.
               John Nichols was an inveterate collector, editor and publisher of literary manuscripts.
               They, along with Richard Phillips, are, for Southey and Elmsley, examples of members
               of the literary trade who catered to the public appetite for knowledge of authors
               and in so doing profited from the writings of others.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note1_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               This produced a further round of legal tangles over the Fitzhead estate in Somerset
               that Somerville had inherited from his great uncle John Cannon Southey (d. 1768).
               On his death, John Cannon Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named
               Somerville his primary heir, and should he die without heirs, Southey’s father and
               two uncles as the residuary legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children.
               Of the three Southey brothers only Southey’s father married, leading the poet (encouraged
               by his Aunt Mary) to believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that
               he and his brothers were the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate. After taking legal
               advice, though, Southey decided not to pursue the matter.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               in Greek mythology. The spring Hippocrene was created from his hoof-print, and all

         <div class="note" id="Note15"><span class="noteLabel">15.. </span><span class="noteBody">Southey felt that Jeffrey’s negative reviews of his poems, beginning with that of
               <em>Thalaba the Destroyer</em> (1801) in <em>Edinburgh Review</em>, 1 (October 1802), 63–83, had seriously harmed their sales for the next ten years,
               i.e. <em>Thalaba </em>(1801), <em>Madoc</em> (1805) and <em>The Curse of Kehama</em> (1810). It was not until <em>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</em> (1814) that Southey produced a poem from which he made considerable profits. However,
               the success of the <em>Edinburgh Review</em> had led to the foundation of its conservative rival, the <em>Quarterly Review</em>, in 1809 and thus allowed Southey a regular income from writing for it and a platform
               from which to criticise Whigs like Jeffrey.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note15_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
