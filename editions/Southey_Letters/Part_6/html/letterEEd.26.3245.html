                           to eleven public and university libraries. But (at 211–213) Southey ended with a plea
                           for perpetual copyright in order to benefit the families of authors after their death.
                           The ‘Statute of Anne’ or Copyright Act (1709) had first created the idea of a limited
                           period of copyright protection for published works, but this was not finally confirmed
