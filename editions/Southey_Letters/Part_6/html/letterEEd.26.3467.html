                  </div> I shall write to them from London, and propose to be with him in the last week of
                  May, or the first of June, which will allow me either to come from his house to Cambridge
                  at your time, or to visit Cambridge first, and then proceed to him.

                           a Bachelor of Divinity degree as a ‘ten-year man’, i.e. a part-time, mature student
                           (he graduated in 1829). </span></div>
                  </div> At all events, I will be with you at Norwich, though it can only be for a couple of
                  days; and it is my full intention, if possible, to see you at Cambridge also. I leave
                  home on Monday, and shall be ten days on the road to town. You shall hear from thence
                  as soon as my movements can be fixed.</p>
            </div>

               to see him in the last week of May, and that if he is in London before that time,
               he will find me in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Q. Ann Street</a>.</p>

               <p>One word of advice before I conclude. I was always apprehensive that you would injure
                  your health by too much and too anxious an attention to your studies. Take heed, or
                  rather take warning, for the future. The immediate object is effected. You have obtained
                  your ordination;
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
                           (3)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>White had been concerned about his ordination examination, which required knowledge
                           of Greek, Latin, works of divinity and the Bible. He duly passed and was ordained
                           as a Deacon on 12 December 1819, becoming a Curate at St Edmund the King, Norwich.</span></div>
                  </div> and now remember, that to become a critical scholar requires the labour of half a
                  life. Do not aim, therefore, at what is impossible. Your object is to be a useful
                  clergyman, not a learned one; to undertake the cure of souls, not to engage in polemical
                  service, or nice disquisitions in philology. There is a body of Divinity in our own
                  language, such as I verily believe is not to be paralleled in any other. Study there
                  and drink of the Scriptures, and be content with as small a quantity of Greek and
                  Latin as will suffice to carry you through the academical forms. Your first duty is
                  to take care of your health, and you need not be told that anxiety is a slow, sure
                  poison.</p>
