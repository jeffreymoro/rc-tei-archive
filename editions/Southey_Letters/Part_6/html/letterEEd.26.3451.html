               <p>We have lost poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">Wilsey</a>, – &amp; I have this day seen her laid in the grave. She had for some time been sinking
                  gradually under the weight of seventy seven years. Her memory with regard to recent
                  occurrences was quite gone, tho, as usual in such cases, it retained clearly all its
                  early impressions. On Monday the 28<sup>th</sup> last she walked as far as the Church with the children, &amp; went down with them into
                  the vault of the Stephenson family, which the representative of that family chuses
                  to have opened whenever he comes to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, for the purpose I suppose of airing his ancestors.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The Stephensons were a long-established and prominent Keswick family and included
                           John Stephenson (1691–1768), MP for Sudbury 1734–1741, who made a fortune in India.
                           John Stephenson had no children, and by this time his relatives were based in London,
                           mainly engaged in banking (though the Stephensons still owned Scalesby Castle).</span></div>
                  </div> So long a walk she had not taken for many many weeks; but she came back in her usual
                  good spirits, &amp; declared that she was not tired. The next day she was as well as she
                  had been during the winter. On the Wednesday morning she fell in getting out of bed,
                  &amp; grazed her forehead. She was found when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> C.</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> went down to her, much shaken, &amp; in a tremulous state. However she made a good breakfast,
                  &amp; walked about. But there was a manifest change in her countenance, which one of the
                  maids had perceived before she fell out of bed &amp; I have no doubt that the fall <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> was occasioned by a slight stroke in the head. The head was inclined all that day
                  a little on one side, &amp; she was what they call in this country <span class="ital">maffled</span>, – that is, confused in her intellect. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> saw her, &amp; said that she had been younger or stronger he would have bled her, – but
                  in her case bleeding might have produced death. She kept up during the day, &amp; was
                  left when we went to bed sleeping apparently well, &amp; breathing naturally. One of the
                  maids however slept in the room with her, as indeed she had always slept within call
                  in case of necessity during the winter. At one o clock she awoke, insisted that it
                  was time to get up, &amp; could not be persuaded to the contrary, – drest herself, &amp; made
                  a good breakfast. Between six &amp; seven we were <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxx with a</span> called, – she was very ill, &amp; had had <span class="strikethrough">a</span> one or two fits, – &amp; was then violently convulsed. When the convulsion left her, her
                  sight, hearing &amp; speech were gone. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> did not suppose she would have lasted six hours. But she lived till the eighth day,
                  the convulsions returned more than once, &amp; while they lasted she moaned like one in
                  pain. But on the whole there was little apparent suffering, &amp; I believe no return
                  of intellect, certainly not of any of the senses which she has lost. The extraordinary
                  thing is that so feeble &amp; exhausted a body should have continued to struggle with
                  death so long, with no other sustenance than <span class="strikethrough">x</span> now &amp; then a tea spoonful of tea or coffee, – indeed little more than merely wetting
                  the lips.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">For some time she has been among our cares rather than our comforts – but her death
               makes a blank, <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &amp; both young &amp; old will feel her loss. For there never lived a better creature. I
               never knew any one with a more generous spirit, or a more affectionate heart.</p>
