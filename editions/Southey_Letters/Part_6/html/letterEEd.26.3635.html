                  so carefully inculcate upon my children in infancy when they happen to hurt themselves
                  that ‘the least which is said, is the soonest mended. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">The King</a> may perhaps look at the poem, because it is likely to be talked of, but it is not
                  very likely that he will ever waste a thought upon the Dedication. Whether he does <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> or not, I never will again.</p>

                  I do not feel that there is any abruptness in the original beginning. If you do not
                  like munificent in the first paragraph you may say liberal.

                  the second paragraph is best as it originally stood. The sentence in the third about
