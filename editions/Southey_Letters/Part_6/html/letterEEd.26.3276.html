            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I had long entertained the hope of one day seeing you in that situation which was
                  so worthily filled in old times by Sir Richard Whittington, of delightful memory,
                  and of going by your special invitation to the Lord Mayor’s dinner, there to be dieted
                  upon turtle and venison, with all the exquisite &amp;c.’s of the city.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>White had abandoned his career as a London-based merchant in the hosiery trade and
                           decided to become a clergyman. Southey here creates a good-natured fantasy around
                           the idea that White might have become Lord Mayor of London, a post famously occupied
                           by the merchant Sir Richard (‘Dick’) Whittington (c. 1350–1423; DNB), whose life was
                           the subject of many ballads, chapbooks, puppet plays and even an opera. No doubt the
                           prominent role of Whittington’s cat in these legends appealed to the cat-loving Southey.</span></div>
                  </div> And now I must be content with turkey and tithe-pig in the county of Norfolk!
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A tithe-pig was traditionally held back as a payment for tithe, or church-rate. Norfolk,
                           the county to which White was moving, was associated with the rearing of turkeys.
                           By 1720 it was estimated that c. 250,000 turkeys per annum were walked from the county
                           to markets in London, their feet dipped in tar or shod in leather boots to protect
                           them. Turkeys are still reared there today, though transport links between the county
                           and the capital have improved a little. </span></div>
                  </div> See from what a height of expectation your letter has thrown me down. Seriously, my
                  dear Neville, it seems to me like a dream, – and that, perhaps, because when the conduct
                  of the lady’s father is looked at in the true point of view, there is more good feeling
                  in it, and good sense also, than are usually met with in real life.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>White married Charlotte Sewell (1799–1873) on 12 January 1820. She was the daughter
                           of Joseph Sewell (1772–1844), a wealthy Norwich solicitor. The marriage occasioned
                           White’s move to Norfolk and his new father-in-law was supportive of White’s decision
                           to change careers and become a clergyman, despite the loss of income this would involve.</span></div>
                  </div> It evinces a proper disregard of money, and a right judgment of your principles and
                  disposition. On your part I can easily understand the repugnance you would feel at
                  giving up the fair establishment which you had formed for yourself, and in which you
                  had the reasonable prospect of acquiring an honourable fortune. The sacrifice of pride
                  (I use the word in a good sense) which you have thus made is, I doubt not, properly
                  appreciated. Upon any other point you should have a cheap dispensation for your samples,
                  if I were a Pope, and put such things to sale.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The change in the pursuits and habits of your life will be very great, but you are
                  not too old for it.

                           Divinity degree as a ‘ten-year man’, i.e. a part-time, mature student (he graduated
                           in 1829). He was ordained as a Deacon on 12 December 1819 and became a Curate at St

                  </div> But when you enter upon your new studies, take heed that you do not pursue them too
                  closely, nor with too much anxiety. You may, without much difficulty, acquire as much
                  as is <span class="ital">necessary</span> for your purpose. Do not be anxious for going beyond this, lest you should injure
                  your health. You may push your studies afterwards quietly, and at leisure; but be
                  contented at first with acquiring merely what is needful.</p>

            <p class="indent1">I send you half a letter rather than not write by return of post. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">The child</a> is going on well, – <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">the mother</a> not altogether as I could wish; but a little time, we trust, will set everything
               to rights. I am closely employed, and yet shall not be able to reach London before
               the beginning of May. When do you leave it? and in what part of the land of turkeys
               are you to be fixed? and at what college do you propose to enter?</p>
