                           the Speech of J. G. Lambton, Esq., M. P. (1819). This pamphlet criticised the County

                  </div> – it is very able, very animated, &amp; thoroughly judicious. I wish such arguments were
                  more frequently urged &amp; more generally circulated, but as you have truly observed,
                  the greater activity is as usual with the worse cause.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am silent myself during these distempered times, partly because I do not like to
                  be distracted from calmer &amp; more congenial pursuits; still more because it does not
                  appear to me that I could do any good by advising measures of a more decisive character
                  than ministers are likely to adopt. In all likelihood they will do enough to avert
                  the immediate danger, supported as they will be by the Grenvilles,

                  that were ever employed the English press is at this time the worst; &amp; unless some
                  effectual means are taken for curbing it, I believe that a bloodier Revolution than
                  has ever yet polluted the earth must inevitably ensue.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You need not be told Sir that there is a want of vigour in the existing Administration,
               &amp; that there is no hope of seeing that <span class="strikethrough">want</span> defect supplied from any quarter, or by any change. If they would but be persuaded
               that it is not more difficult to carry whole measures than half-ones, all might yet
               be well. My hope is that the <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> magnitude of the evil will compel them to look the danger in the face &amp; meet it manfully.
               And notwithstanding all ominous appearances I comfort myself with a persuasion that
               Providence will not suffer a country such as this to be destroyed. Were it not for
               this ground of hope, I own I should despair. But these feelings will not prevent me
               from exerting myself to the utmost whenever it appears to me that it can be done with
               any prospect of utility.</p>
