                           Southey. Part Five, Letter 3149. Murray had expressed a cautious interest, and Bowles
                           had then sent her manuscript to him; see Southey to John Murray, 6 February 1819,

                  </div> – &amp; this day I have received an apology for not answering my letter &lt;till now&gt; stating
                  (which no doubt is the truth) that not having answered it by return of post it went
                  out of his head.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I feared what his reply would be, – &amp; from this long silence you will have expected
               it. These are his words – “The MSS poem is such as to do its author very great credit.
               But the fact is that no poetry except your own &amp; that of some four or five others,
               has the least chance of sale at present, &amp; I am obliged to refrain.” – There is but
               too much truth in this. Poets who would &lt;have&gt; obtained universal applause thirty
               years ago, cannot now obtain a hearing, – however <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> great the promise which their works may contain, – &amp; the vilest trash will be received
               from one who, by fair means or by foul, has obtained a reputation. As for the incivility
               of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</a> long delay, you must remember that a great bookseller is a much greater man than
               the Prime Minister.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am sorry for this, &amp; perhaps more disappointed than you will be. A local poem, –
                  such as I suggested in my last letter, – would have a better chance than one of any
                  other kind, – because it carries with it a local interest. The New Forest

                           been born and brought up. Bowles replied on 12 May 1819, rejecting the idea of a poem
                           on the New Forest, but promising to send the manuscript of a blank verse poem, a draft

                  </div> is both in its history &amp; scenery a rich subject – &amp; with the help of prints a <span class="strikethrough">poem</span> book might be made which would be bought by idlers at Lymington Southampton &amp;c; –
                  booksellers must look to the <span class="ital">sale</span> of what they publish, &amp; this is a kind of sale on which they can in some degree calculate.
                  – The Isle of Wight is not so extensive a subject but it would have the same advantage.
                  The Forest however affords more scope, &amp; would supply matter for a very interesting
                  poem, especially to one who has so many feelings connected with it as you needs must
                  have. – Have you ever accustomed yourself to write blank verse? – for that would be
                  the most suitable metre. Think of this, – of the Convents &amp; Castles within its <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> &lt;ancient&gt; precincts, – of Winchester, – of William the Conqueror &amp; William Rufus,
