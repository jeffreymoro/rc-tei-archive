                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Under extreme pressure from George IV, the Cabinet had reluctantly agreed to introduce
                           a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King’s wife,
                           Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821; DNB), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her
                           marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government
                           majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House
                           of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore announced the Bill would
                           be withdrawn.</span></div>
                  </div> – Come here early in May, &amp; I will put you in good condition, body &amp; mind. We will
                  go over the whole of the Land of Lakes, making a compleat tour of them, – &amp; I will
                  have a pair of riding breeches made for the nonce, to go on horseback with you. We
                  will have mountain parties, – &amp; such tarn scenes as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</a> will show you in his drawing, – make your arrangements accordingly, &amp; for me, I will
                  live upon the exercise in anticipation, till you make your appearance.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It is well that one has something to exhilarate one in private life, – for otherwise
               there is very little either at home or abroad, which can be regarded with hope, or
               with complacency. I am heartily ashamed of the English people, who have retained nothing
               of the old English character, except physical courage, &amp; extreme credulity. – <span class="ital">Physical</span> courage I say, because there is very little of the moral virtue left. We are at this
               time under the tyranny of the Press, – &amp; the men who have the direction of <span class="strikethrough">the</span> public opinion, &amp; thereby of public affairs, are precisely the greatest rascals in
               the country, the most profligate &amp; worst-principled adventurers of the age. Things
               cannot continue thus. &amp; whatever course they may take, if you &amp; I should reach the
               age of threescore years &amp; ten, we shall in all human probability have outlived the
               English constitution &amp; the liberties of England. The question is not whether we shall
               escape from despotism, but whether the process by which it is to be brought on will
               be longer or shorter, – more or less calamitous &amp; frightful. In the present <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> condition of the world I am perfectly certain that no government can withstand the
               influence of a free press; – the freedom of the press is incompatible with public
               security, – &amp; yet we know that the inevitable tendency of despotism is to degrade
               mankind, &amp; that without the wholesome influence of the press governments tend to despotism.
               – But of what use is it to anticipate evils, against which no exertions can avail,
               till we have a resolute government.</p>

               <p>Sad changes have taken place among our Cats since you were here. I believe you remember
                  Lord Nelson. He became so wretched that it was an act of mercy to put him in the river,
                  – &amp; that service was rendered him by poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson</a>. Bona Fidelia reached a good old age, &amp; was found dead in the wood-house. There then
                  remained Madame Bianchi, who was Bona’s daughter, &amp; Pulcheria who was Madames daughter.
                  These poor creatures who lived with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson</a>, &amp; had possession of the chairs &amp; the fireside in her kitchen forsook the house the
                  day that she had her mortal seizure. They became almost wild, – at length however
                  we got them to come into the house for food, &amp; I had persuaded them to come to my
                  call before I left home in the spring. When I returned Madame had disappeared (&amp; has
                  never been seen since) – &amp; Pulcheria was in a miserable state, – dying of some disease
                  which was then prevalent among the cats &amp; very fatal to them. It was pitiable to see
                  her, &amp; yet in the hope of her recovery, I could not order an end to be put to her
                  lingering. But I was glad when she was found dead. – A visitor from the town, by name
                  Virgil, who haunted these premises, being probably driven from his own, died here
                  also. And thus the old generation to which Bona Marietta, Sir Thomas Dido, &amp; Madame
                  Catalani had belonged, was extinct. We have now only a young Othello, from Newlands;
                  he has the defect of being of a miserably small breed, otherwise a worthy &amp; promising
                  cat who has never looked into a boot; &amp; is safe from all such operators as the Editor
