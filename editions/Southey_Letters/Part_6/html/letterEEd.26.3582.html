            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I shall have a poem to send you in the course of a few weeks, planned upon occasion
                  of the King’s death (which you may think no very promising subject), laid aside eight
                  months ago, when half written, as not suited for publication while the event was recent,
                  and now taken up again, and almost brought to a conclusion. The title is, ‘A Vision
                  of Judgment.’

                  </div> It is likely to attract some notice, because I have made – and, in my own opinion,
                  with success – the bold experiment of constructing a metre upon the principle of the
                  ancient hexameter. It will provoke some abuse for what is said of the factious spirit
                  by which the country has been disturbed during the last fifty years; and it will have
                  some interest for you, not merely because it comes from me, but because you will find <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry’s</a> name not improperly introduced in it.

                           to write a Birthday Ode for the monarch until the accession of George IV in 1820,
