            <p class="indent1">We are going on very badly, one complaint is no sooner removed than something worse
               appears in its place. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> has an abscess forming in the softest part of the thigh, close to the anus. I dread
               the probability of a fistula in consequence, tho <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> assures me there is no danger. But I know that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> tho an excellent practitioner in diseases which occur every day, is not, &amp; cannot
               be a good surgeon. The tumour is scarcely painful, but it increases a dreadful plague
               of hæmorrhoids, which there is &lt;no&gt; means of subduing, or even of relieving, – five
               leeches were applied this morning, &amp; these cursed tubes fill again almost as fast
               as they are emptied: &amp; this allows her no ease in any position.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Of course I am not now writing to ask advice which can be of no use at such a distance,
                  – &amp; in a case which belongs <span class="strikethrough">mor</span> to surgery. But <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> her inveterate costiveness must have had some share in producing the one malady &amp;
                  perhaps both, – &amp; in order to relieve this in future by the surest &amp; easiest way,
                  I wish you would send me down one of those machines whereby she may <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> operate upon herself, &amp; thus never be deterred from obtaining a remedy in time.

            </div>
            <p class="indent1">God knows how long this illness may continue, or how it may end. The only real evil
               of living in the country is the impossibility of getting the best aid in such cases.
               – The swelling is now as large as a hens egg, &amp; has no appearance of ripening for
               puncture. It came on rapidly, beginning on Saturday morning, – but now appears to
               undergo no change. I suppose the leeches, which have been applied to the hæmorrhoids
               may have retarded it. </p>
            <p class="indent1"><a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">The child</a> is doing well. But unwilling as <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</a> is to hear of weaning it, I am sure she must not continue in her <span class="strikethrough">debitxxx</span> debilitated state to suckle it.</p>
