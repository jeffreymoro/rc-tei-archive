               <p>My dear Sir, — I have just received your parcel of books, with your letter of the
                  20th. I received also G. Whitehead’s Journal and the epistles of the Yearly Meeting.

                           Methodism (1820). The concern proved to be unfounded, because the biography was abandoned.</span></div>

               <p>I am not so ignorant of mankind, or so inexperienced in the world as to suppose it
                  possible that such a work can be written without offending some of the Society to
                  whom it relates, unless it were composed with the direct object of pleasing them.
                  But I am sure that no just and even-minded member of the Society ought to be offended
                  with what I shall write, no person who will allow to me the same freedom of opinion
                  (always exercised within the limits of charity) which he claims for himself. The errors
                  of the early Quakers were those of their age, their virtues were their own. I will
                  do the amplest justice to their virtues, but I shall neither conceal their faults
                  nor those of their opponents and persecutors. If I did, the lesson of charity, which
                  the book is designed to enforce, would be weakened and incompleat. These things are
                  matter of history. The life of George Fox must be written as that of Luther, of Calvin,
                  and of our own Cranmer,

                           Martin Luther (1483–1546); John Calvin (1509–1564); and Thomas Cranmer (1489–1556;

                  all subtractions that may be made, he, like them, will remain a good, an eminent,
                  an influential man — a great and chosen agent in the moral and religious world. The
                  members of the Church Establishment will not be offended when I shall speak of the
                  severity which was exercised against the Quakers in the strongest terms of condemnation.
                  The members of your Society will have as little reason to be offended, because I do
                  not dissemble the provocation which their predecessors gave. Perhaps no person understands
                  the temper of those times better than myself, because no person has studied their
                  history more.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">With regard to facts then, my intention is and must be to compose a full and faithful
               history, and that history could not be faithful unless it were full. With regard to
               the manner of relating them, I can only say that there will be no intention to offend,
               and that I verily believe no person will be offended whom I could possibly be desirous
               of pleasing.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Touching the tenets and discipline of the Society, tho’ I am under no apprehension
               of committing any material error (seeing how ample the materials are from which the
               account must be derived) I repeat that it will give me great pleasure to submit the
               chapters which relate to them to your perusal before they are printed.</p>
