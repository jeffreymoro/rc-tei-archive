                  it is in a strain of the warmest affection, &amp; the most unbounded reverence; &amp; yet
                  at the same time shows that she was a virtuous woman, &amp; was alarmed at his conduct.
                  He must then have been about sixty five years of age. The internal evidence of the
                  letter is in favour of its authenticity. If authentic, it would prove that Wesley
                  had fallen into a temptation incident to the sort of Confessor-like situation in which
                  he had placed himself, – &amp; trusting probably to his age, had indulged it as far as
                  he wished. The fact, if fact it be, would not affect the opinion which should be formed
                  concerning all the former part of his life, nor concerning the general tenour of his
                  conduct. But it would show, like many cases in Catholick history, how easily spiritual
                  &amp; carnal affections may be blended, – which needs no additional proof. On the whole
                  I shall be sorry to find it genuine, because the publication of such a fact will certainly
                  do more harm than good, – &amp; yet having written the life of Wesley, I do not see how
