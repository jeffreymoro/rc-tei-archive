            <p class="indent1">This has been a trying week to me. Both <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Mother</a> &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Child</a> were in considerable peril, – &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> absolutely despaired of saving the child, – but the <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">Mother</a> heard him say so, &amp; that occasioned an extraordinary effort on her part, which was
               the human means of saving one life, &amp; perhaps both. –</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I intend to call him <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</a>. If any one asks why, it is reason enough that I like genuine English names, &amp; such
                  as are peculiar without being fantastic. – But you may, for your own satisfaction,
                  find the secret feeling that leads me to chuse it, in a legend which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> has versified, – as an inscription for S<sup>t</sup> Herberts Island.

                           Island, Derwent-Water’ (1800). The poem recounts how St Herbert (d. 687; DNB) lived
                           in seclusion, but prayed that he and his friend, St Cuthbert (c. 634–687; DNB), should
                           die at the same time – a prayer that was granted. The name ‘Cuthbert’ indissolubly
                           linked the new child to his dead older brother, Herbert, as did his other name, ‘Charles’,
                           the name of both his godparents, Bedford and Wynn, who had also been Herbert’s godparents.</span></div>

                  accept the advances which he made towards an intimacy. But he must heard enough of
                  me from those who know <span class="strikethrough">my</span> me &amp; my habits well. And yet in all that he says about my allotment of time there
                  is no other foundation of truth than that when I could not afford to write poetry
                  at any other time, I wrote it before breakfast, and counted it as so much gained from

                  absurd terms of my library: which is only extraordinarily good in relation to the

               &amp; my intention is to assist the vomiting by draughts of warm milk &amp; water, instead
               of warm water only, – merely to sheath the acid on its passage. But I hope the necessity
               will not recur soon. I shall be drawn out of doors when <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</a> makes his removal in March, – &amp; my journey to London towards the end of April will
