                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>James Henderson (c. 1783–1848), History of Brazil (1821). He had sailed to South America
                           in 1819 and was Consul-General in Columbia 1823–1836.</span></div>
                  </div> is the book which I mentioned to you when I was last in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#PaternosterRow">Paternoster Row</a>. The author says, in his proposals, that “little authentic intelligence (concerning
                  Brazil) has hitherto been published, and the accounts we have of its discovery, colonization,
                  divisions, government, productions, are vague, and frequently contradictory.” He therefore
                  promises to give “a genuine and well-authenticated history from original documents.”
                  Now, if when he wrote these proposals he knew nothing of my work, it is plain that
                  he must have known little of what has been written concerning Brazil, and lived little
                  with persons who take any interest concerning its history. If he did know of my history,
                  or if, knowing it as he now does, he continues to circulate the same proposals, the
                  language which it contains is exactly that which a plagiarist would use who meant
                  to make up his own book by pillaging mine. These remarks only affect the respectability
                  of the author; but as for his works interfering with mine, it can do so no more than
                  an abridgment would do, which any man has a right to make (as the law stands), and
                  which I have no doubt this will prove to be in the whole historical part. In fact,
                  there is no other connected history of Brazil than mine, either printed or in manuscript,
                  and without the assistance which he can derive from mine, and mine only, he might
                  as well pretend to write a history of the moon.
