                  admired by the reading part of my family. But you know what becomes of good intentions
                  – the Devil is said to pave his dominions with them, &amp; if it be so I have furnished
                  him with as many materials as most men. My excuse must be not so much the number of
                  my own employments, as the numerous interruptions to which I am liable, during part
                  of the year, from unexpected visitors, &amp; all the year long from persons at a distance
                  who, with or without a reason, write<span class="strikethrough">s</span> to me upon all imaginable &amp; unimaginable subjects. – One man for instance requests
                  an acrostic for his mistress, &amp; another consults me upon a scheme for paying off the

                  or in the kinder mood which those of a better kind excite, things which I ought &amp;
                  designed to do are left undone, time passes on; &amp; the arrears become like a prodigals
