            <p>Endorsements: Fr RS./ July 1820; July 1820<br> MS: Huntington Library, RS 398. ALS; 3p.<br> Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), III, pp. 200–201 [in part].<br> Dating note: Dating from content; reports of the revolution in Naples did not appear
               in British newspapers until 21 July 1820. Southey would not have seen these until
               22 July 1820, and this letter was written shortly afterwards. As it does not refer
               to Rickman’s communication of 21 July 1820 (received by Southey c. 24 July), this
               letter probably belongs to c. 22–23 July.</p>

                  ever been written upon Welsh affairs.
