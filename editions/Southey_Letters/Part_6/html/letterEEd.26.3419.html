                  last, &amp; that pursuant to the intention which he then expressed, he has placed his
                  papers at my disposal. As yet I have receivd no communication from his family upon
                  this melancholy subject.

                  &amp; it may more conveniently be done where I can have an opportunity of consulting with <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Robinson</a>. It is a dismal case: – &amp; judging from the two extraordinary letters in my possession,
                  &amp; from what <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Robinson</a> informs me of, I have little doubt but that it may be rendered a very instructive

                  acted &amp; reasoned upon it insanely. I had no suspicion who my correspondent was, nor
                  of his purpose. That he was serious in what he said, I was fully persuaded, &amp; therein
                  I was right; but had my nature been a little more suspicious, perhaps I should not
                  so entirely have believed that when he spoke of dying within the month, he meant to
                  imply that he was in the last stage of some incurable disease. My answers were written
                  under that impression. Had I known who &amp; what he was, I would have urged him to come
                  down here, – not with the expectation of reasoning him out of any opinions, or into
                  any, but for the chance of so influencing his feelings as to dispose <span class="strikethrough">them</span> him for such a change.</p>
