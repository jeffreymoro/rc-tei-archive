               in Cumberland organised a County Meeting on 13 October 1819 to protest at the local
               authorities’ actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew up a conservative
               response – an Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for
               curbs on the press. It was not proceeded with, and the government’s supporters in
               Cumberland produced a more moderate document. Southey’s Address, though not his identity
               as its author, had been printed in the <em>Morning Chronicle</em>, 23 October 1819.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note10_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               against the authorities’ actions at the ‘Peterloo’ meeting. Brougham was present,

               which Southey had written (though Brougham was unaware of its author). He remarked
               that the Address ‘is very long indeed, and extremely dull’, and described its authors
