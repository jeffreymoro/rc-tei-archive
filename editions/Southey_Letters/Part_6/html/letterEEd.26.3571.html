                  metres in the different modern languages, as well as in our own. This with a few specimens

                  were well &amp; as they should be, remind me very much of the year 1800, when there seemed
                  every probability that the yellow fever would make its appearance at Lisbon. Anxious
                  as all persons who suffered themselves to think upon the subject were, &amp; as I myself
                  was, tho at a time of life when such anxieties are more easily put aside than in maturer
                  years, I have often thought how little that frightful apprehension appeared to affect
                  those among whom I lived, – their business &amp; their amusements went on as usual; &amp;
                  the Government itself did not appear more indifferent to the imminent danger, than
                  even the reflecting part of the people. That poor country was spared from the visitation
                  of pestilence; to undergo others not less terrible in their action &amp; perhaps more
                  lasting.

                           marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government
                           majority had been only nine votes and it had seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass
                           the House of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore had announced
                           the Bill would be withdrawn. As was customary when a national victory was celebrated,

               of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government majority had been only nine votes
               and it had seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House of Commons. Lord Liverpool,
               the Prime Minister, therefore had announced the Bill would be withdrawn. As was customary
               when a national victory was celebrated, many householders put lighted candles in their
               windows. This occurred at different dates in towns across the country, mostly between
               11 November and 16 November 1820; the celebrations in Keswick were on 15 November
               1820.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               the ‘redder’ one is probably the pencil and watercolour sketch now in the collections
               of the Wordsworth Trust, Grasmere; and the ‘uncoloured’ one is in Keswick Museum and
