                  </div> to me, at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">D<sup>r</sup> Southeys (my brother)</a> – <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#QueenAnneSt">19 Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square</a>, I shall find it there, sooner than it would find its way to <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> thro the booksellers hands. I dare say you write blank verse, – your ear will lead
                  you to the measure but if you should have written under any erroneous notion of its
                  structure, it will be very easy to show you where you are wrong, &amp; what you have to

                  down upon the river &amp; the opposite woods. Immediately under that horse block is a

                  now, – but when I was between fifteen &amp; eighteen many &amp; many are the verses which
                  I wrote in that cave.
