                  but I know not how I could have written it in less compass, the quantity of matter
                  being so great in <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#CoxeWilliam">Coxes</a> volumes. I have avoided throughout all technical details, all general history, &amp; kept
                  as close as possible to Marlborough. Yet it is longer by a full third that you would
                  have wished to have, or I to make it. The length however may show that I never spare
                  time or labour.</p>
