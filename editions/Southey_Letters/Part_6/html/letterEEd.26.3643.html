                  </div> which I trust you will find on your arrival in Grosvenor Square. It is chiefly as
                  a metrical experiment that I offer it to your notice. You are accustomed to the blank
                  verse of Shakespeare and Milton
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  heroic measure of the ancients retains something of its dignity and power in our language,
                  though the English is certainly less fit for it than either the Greek, the Latin,
                  or the German. Taking it upon the principle of adaptation which I have followed, it
                  appears to me a fine measure, inferior, indeed, to our blank verse (as every other
                  measure is), but possessing in the union of variety and regularity, an advantage peculiar
                  to itself.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The subject is not one which I should have chosen under other circumstances; but when
                  I accepted the Laureateship, it was with a hope of being exempted from the ordinary
                  worthless taskwork which degrades the office,

                           Birthday Odes and New Year’s Odes that were set to music and performed at court. However,
                           despite the fact that these performances had been suspended since 1810, he had still
                           been compelled to write a New Year’s Ode each year since his appointment in 1813 and
                           Birthday Odes in 1820 and 1821.</span></div>
                  </div> and a determination of exerting myself upon other occasions in a manner which, if
                  that hope were gratified, would prove that I had no desire to shrink from labour,
                  or, if it were not, might redeem the office from contempt. Time enough has now elapsed
                  since the death of the King,

                  an imaginative manner, which could not have been done without some shock to the feelings,
                  while that event was recent, and had all the awfulness of immediate reality.</p>

                           DNB), Prime Minister 1809–1812, related some of the events of the Regency period of
                           1811–1820 to the ghost of George III. During the Regency, George III was incapacitated
                           by madness and thus unaware of crucial events such as the final victory over France
                           in 1815.</span></div>
                  </div> This fault was unavoidable. I could not offer a tribute of respect to the late King
                  without a just compliment of this kind to the present,

                  from fancy to fact, it has been done, where alone it was practicable, when the poem
                  passes from fact to fancy, and enters again upon the imaginary world.

                  </div> The measure, and the subject, and what I have said, and what I have left unsaid, will
                  bring upon me a hailstone chorus of abuse. It will affect me much less than this abominable
                  east wind, which is now making its way through walls, windows, and curtains to my
                  discomfort, and making itself felt in spite of a leathern waistcoat. But against literary

                  </div> The translator has not Frenchified it by any additions, but it is curious to see how
                  skilfully he has contrived to skip every image and every expression which had any
                  peculiar force or propriety. In this respect the version reminds me of what happens
                  among peacocks where a white bird has crossed the breed—the degeneracy shows itself
                  in the eye of the feather, even when all other parts of the plumage remain untainted.
                  It would surprise me greatly if, after all that has been done to trim it to the French
                  taste, anything so completely anti-Gallican in style, feeling, and composition, should
