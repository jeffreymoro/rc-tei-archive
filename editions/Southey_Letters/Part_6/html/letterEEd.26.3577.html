            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am heartily glad to see you writing once more in a healthful tone. Your letter on
               this account has done me as much good as a bottle of honest Rhenish, or better Moselle
               would have done, – &amp; you know how well those wines agree with me, &amp; I with them.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>My vision grows, grows, grows, &amp; will get beyond 600 lines, which in this lengthy
                  measure contain as much matter as 1000 in blank verse.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A Vision of Judgement (1821), written in hexameters and divided into twelve sections;
                           it was published in quarto format.</span></div>
                  </div> It cuts into a dozen sections, – breathing places being very agreable for short-winded
                  persons, in long-winded poems. Every day for the last week I have expected to finish
                  it. Today I took a holiday, partly because a parcel arrived, &amp; I had letters to write,
                  &amp; partly because I had applied it too closely, as I found in my sleep.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You may have it in ordinary quarto if you like the size better. The foolscap seems
               to me, tho an unusual form in this country, a good one, &amp; especially for long-lined
               verse. Profit or loss is out of the question. It will pay its expences &amp; not much
               more. But it will be talked of, &amp; abused &amp; ridiculed, which is all well, – &amp; it will
               do me credit both now &amp; hereafter, – which is better. – You shall have the first portion
               of it in a few days</p>
