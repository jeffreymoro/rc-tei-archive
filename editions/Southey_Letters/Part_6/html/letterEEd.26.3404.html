                           of inheriting property at Fitzhead after the death of his third cousin, and John Cannon
                           Southey’s heir, John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765–1819; DNB). An
                           heir at law was entitled to receive the real property of someone who died intestate.
                           Southey did stand in this relation to John Cannon Southey, but it did not help his
                           claim on the Fitzhead property.</span></div>

                  doubt about it. Your pedigree is right, as far as it goes, but it remains to be seen
                  whether the common ancestor to whom we <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> go back, had not other children besides the father of Cannon S. &amp; our G. Grandfather,
                  &amp; whether there may not be descendants of an elder branch than the said G.G.

                  I expect to hear of one in an Old Bailey list, – or at a Radical Meeting – the name

                  the Cannon, – some of these sons of guns may have a prior claim to mine. After all
                  the claim may be worth nothing. For that Lord Somerville did all he could to cut off
                  the right of the heir at law, is quite certain: &amp; the only chance I have is that he
                  may have been mistaken, &amp; done what he was not legally enabled to do, – that is, –
                  whether I am not entitled to a suit in Chancery, as a cheap &amp; agreable amusement for
