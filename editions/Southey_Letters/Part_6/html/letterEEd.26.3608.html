               <p>I am sorry you have thought <span class="strikethrough">it</span> proper to conceal your name <span class="strikethrough">from me</span>, because it would have been a pleasure to me to know to whom I am indebted to for

                  </div> &amp; the Rise &amp; Progress of Quakerism has gone forth, I have received many letters from
                  members of the Society, the general tendency <span class="strikethrough">of which</span> has been to express an apprehension that I should <span class="strikethrough">judge</span> &lt;speak&gt; harshly &lt;or unfavourably&gt; of their founders, – <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> a wish that I should judge of these

                  writings, – &amp; some thing like a fear lest certain parts of their history should be
                  brought into the light. But upon the only points where they have reason to fear the
                  light none of these letters have touched, – that is, upon the question of the doctrines
                  which the<span class="strikethrough">y</span> &lt;primitive Quakers&gt; <span class="strikethrough">originally</span> advanced, &amp; upon the suppression of certain passages in some of their <span class="strikethrough">printed</span> works, which materially affected the pretensions of the writer.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">With regard to the first of these <span class="strikethrough">questions</span> &lt;points&gt; I believe that George Fox very often did not know what he meant, &amp; that,
               as is often the case with mystic &amp; enthusiastic writers, so with him &amp; many of his
               early disciples their expressions are not to be taken in the sense which <span class="strikethrough">their</span> &lt;the&gt; literal interpretation warrants, but in the no-sense from which they proceeded.
               They were blasphemers by chance-medley, &amp; not by design. – This is my present impression.
               Of course it is impossible to <span class="strikethrough">say</span> &lt;tell&gt; how far farther investigation may lead me to alter or modify it, for as yet,
               tho well acquainted with the history of the Society, I am only on the threshold of
               my work.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>The second <span class="strikethrough">question</span> &lt;point&gt; involves a charge against which I can see no such reasonable defence. What
                  the suppressions are which have been made in <span class="strikethrough">the re-impressions of</span> G Fox’s writings, I have not yet had the means of ascertaining. A very important one
                  in those of Edward Burroughs has been pointed out by their old enemy Francis Bugg.

                           (1640–1727; DNB) was a Quaker from Mildenhall, Suffolk, who left the Society and became
                           an anti-Quaker polemicist. Bugg’s Pilgrim’s Progress from Quakerism to Christianity
                           (London, 1700), pp. 74–77, no. 393 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library, pointed
                           out that Burrough’s A Trumpet of the Lord Sounded out of Sion (1656) had been substantially
                           altered in its second edition of 1672, particularly by omitting Burrough’s ‘Prophecy
                           to the Cavaliers’.</span></div>

            <p class="indent1">The truth seems to be that the Quakers are as much hampered by the infallibility of
               their <span class="strikethrough">Church</span> &lt;Teachers&gt;, as the Romanists; &amp; that &lt;like&gt; some of the Monastic Orders they would
               be very glad if the history of their Founder could be buried in oblivion. If the secrets
               of the heart were known perhaps <span class="strikethrough">any</span> many of them would be found to respect him less than I do.</p>

               you are pleased to express. For tho I have long learnt to regard common praise as
               well as common censure with more indifference than the state of the weather, every
