               <p>It has been almost an even chance that this letter should have borne a black seal,

               <p>Your letter came in time. I followed the statement of these rascally biographers,
                  – &amp; shall now venture to call it in question. Perhaps the truth is that a pension
                  was allowed them after the dispute with the Pope was accommodated, &amp; not till then.

                           but qualified his opinion in a note. The latter also recorded the complaint of Sebastião
