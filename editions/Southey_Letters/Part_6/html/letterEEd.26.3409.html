                  noble &amp; <span class="ital">elect</span> Lady Huntingdon – was sister to the Earl of Ferrers who was hanged. She was daughter
                  of Washington Earl of Ferrers &amp; born in 1707.

                           Connexion’. She was the daughter of Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl Ferrers (1677–1729).
                           Laurence Ferrers, 4th Earl Ferrers (1720–1760; DNB) was hanged for murdering his steward;
                           he was the first cousin, rather than the brother, of Selina Hastings.</span></div>

               <p>I am as yet no nearer the mark concerning my chance of a Chancery suit. But this seems
                  clear, that if I am heir at law, my claim will be to the whole property, – if it was
                  not in Lord Somervilles power to cut off that claim. It appears by the will that he
                  was christened John Southey, which latter name he always thought proper to drop, tho
                  he derived from it his best expectations at the time of his birth.

                           (1765–1819; DNB). Southey was able to establish that he was John Cannon Southey’s
                           heir at law, i.e. he was entitled to receive his real property if he was intestate.
