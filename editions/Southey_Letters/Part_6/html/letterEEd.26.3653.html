            <p class="indent0">My dear Sir, – There is no doubt of your powers; there can be no doubt of your success
               to the height of your ambition when your judgement is sufficiently matured to choose
               your subjects well, and to feel that the arrangement is not of less consequence than
               the execution. And this tact you will not be long in acquiring.</p>

                           see Southey to Heraud, 13 March 1821, Letter 3650. In the event, his response to Southey’s
                           critique, especially the unpleasant subject matter, was to decide against publication.</span></div>

                  (you know not how much I am occupied with works of great labour, more, I verily believe,
                  both in number and magnitude, than any other man ever ventured to contemplate, much
                  less to engage in at one time) – nevertheless I would have read the whole of the manuscripts
                  could it have been of the slightest service to you. But there was no necessity for
                  this. More power cannot be shown than the one displays, and power is all that can
                  be looked for in the productions of one so young.</p>

               <p>In the subject which you have now chosen, I am glad to hear that you mean to follow
                  the historical events. You will thus avoid the main difficulties of constructing a
                  drama. The historical drama is a distinct species, and one in which great things may
                  be done. You ask me whether Nero’s poem is extant – the whole story of his setting
                  fire to Rome has every appearance of mere vulgar calumny, and no such poem ever existed.
                  I believe they were not his own verses which he is said to have repeated.

                           62: 16–18. Heraud was planning a tragedy on Nero, which he sent to Southey in manuscript
                           in 1822; see Southey to John Abraham Heraud, 9 April 1822.</span></div>

               <p>In ‘The Baron of K.’ the story is too shocking – beware of anything monstrous in your
                  fictions. That incredulity and consequent dislike against which Horace warns the poet,
                  is provoked as much by the monstrous in morals, as in the creatures of fancy.

                  </div> If the catastrophe of your story (whether narrative or dramatic) is to be mournful,
                  let it at least be just, or of that kind in which the reader will acquiesce with satisfaction,
                  as being the best termination under the circumstances of the tale. To instance in
                  one of my own works, ‘Roderick’ is a tragic poem, but the reader can have no wish
                  for a different catastrophe.
