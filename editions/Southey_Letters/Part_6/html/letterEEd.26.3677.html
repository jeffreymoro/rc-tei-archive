               I transcribe the lines here because you will feel their truth at this time. Parental
               love, however, is of slower growth in a father’s than in a mother’s heart: the child,
               at its birth, continues, as it were, to be a part of its mother’s life; but, upon
               the father’s heart it is a <span class="ital">graft</span>, and some little time elapses before he feels that it has united and is become inseparable.
               God bless the babe and its parents, and spare it and them, each for the other’s sake,
               amen!</p>
