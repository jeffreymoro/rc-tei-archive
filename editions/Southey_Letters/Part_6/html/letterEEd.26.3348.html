               <p>This day, Tuesday the 7<sup>th</sup> of Sept. 1819, I am at Dingwall, the capital of the county of Ross, having returned
                  here from Fleet Mound. Fleet Mound is an embankment across an inlet of the sea, 990
                  yards in length (something more than half a mile) over which the road passes, – the
                  road &amp; the parapet walls filling the whole breadth of the mound, which is 20 feet
                  at the top 140 at the base, &amp; 16 from the bottom.
