               <p>We are just in the same state, except that the evil of the haemorrhoids is abated,
                  or for a time removed. It is now three weeks since the tumour began to appear, &amp; for
                  full half that time it has been to all appearance stationary, without the slightest
                  change. I have only discovered that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</a> knows nothing about it, for having positively pronounced it an abscess, which must
                  ripen &amp; be pierced, the last time I saw him, he talked of it being coagulated blood,
                  – the consequence of the labour, – which ignorant as I was I knew to be nonsense.
