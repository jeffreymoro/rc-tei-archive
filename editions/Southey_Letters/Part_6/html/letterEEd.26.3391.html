                  </div> which had so long been lying in <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Queen Anne Street</a>. I read it this morning, &amp; will rather dispatch a hasty letter than let a post elapse
                  without telling you of its arrival, &amp; exhorting you, by all means to proceed with
                  the poem. It is in a very sweet strain, go on with it, &amp; you will produce something
                  which may hold a permanent place in English literature. – As you go on you will feel
                  what passages are feeble, &amp; require to be shortened or expunged, – there is very little
                  that stands in need of this. The flow of the verse is natural &amp; the language unconstrained
                  – both as they should be. Everybody will recognize the truth of the feeling which
                  pervades it, – &amp; there is a charm in the pictures, – the imagery &amp; the expression
                  which cannot fail to be felt.</p>
