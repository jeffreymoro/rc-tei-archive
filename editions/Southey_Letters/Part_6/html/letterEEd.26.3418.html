               <div class="indent0">My dear Kenyon</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Supposing that you will by this time be in London, I was intending to write &amp; thank
               you for your company, &amp; your laver, when the loitering intention was quickened into
               effect by some intelligence which this days post has brought.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You will not have forgotten the two remarkable letters from the anonymous writer who
               wished to entrust his papers to my care after his death. I now learn that the unhappy
               writer put an end to his life on New Years day; &amp; that on the day preceding he deposited
               the papers at a house in town to await my directions. He proves to have been <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HamondElton">M<sup>r</sup> Elton Hamond</a>, a person well known to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brother</a>, &amp; whom I once met at dinner some years ago, at <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GoochDrRobert">D<sup>r</sup> Gooch’s</a>, &amp; well remember as a mild, melancholy, <span class="ital">introspective</span> man. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Henry Robinson</a> (a friend of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth’s</a> &amp; of mine) informs me of this, &amp; gives me a very singular &amp; interesting account of
               the deceased, with whom he had long been intimate. He describes him as thoroughly
               virtuous, good &amp; gentle hearted, but intense feeling, intense vanity, self-centering
               thoughts, miserable metaphysics &amp; a morbid temperament combined to produce &lt;in him&gt;
               that sort of insanity, which is incurable by any human means. – I anticipate a melancholy
               task with his papers, but it may possibly be an useful one.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Cases of this kind are seldom laid before the world either faithfully or charitably.
               The same elements which made <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HamondElton">Elton Hamond</a> an utter unbeliever in every thing which it is desirable to believe, &amp; a suicide
               at last, would have made him a Saint in the middle ages of monachism, – or a martyr
               in the age of the Reformation. – And what should I have been in those days? – A pilgrim
               to Jerusalem, – a chronicler (if I had learnt to write) &amp; a maker of verses.</p>

                  nothing inflammatory, nothing hostile to the existing institutions be suffered to
                  appear. And the alternative is, whether you will submit to this to prevent revolution,
                  or come to it thro revolution &amp; the military government in which revolution inevitably
