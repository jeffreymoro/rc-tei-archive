            <p class="indent1">Of all frail things the life of an infant is the frailest, – &amp; it seems to be ascertained
               by observation that the more intellectualized the race in the human species, (as the
               more acutely sensitive among brutes) the less chance has the individual for being
               reared. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">This godson of yours</a> makes me more continually anxious than I ought to be, – for that anxiety can do him
               no good, &amp; certainly does me none. He is now just eleven months old, &amp; being as you
               may suppose a sort of pet &amp; play thing for every body, has been brought more forward
               than I could have wished, or would have permitted if I could have prevented it; –
               better would it have been to have left him to his mere animal functions as far as
               possible. The consequence is that he is far more forward in intellect than any of
               my other children have been at the same age: &amp; this is by no means desirable. He is
               very subject to bilious affections – nothing worse as yet, – but these come frequently,
               &amp; when they begin there is no knowing how they may end. But enough of this.</p>
