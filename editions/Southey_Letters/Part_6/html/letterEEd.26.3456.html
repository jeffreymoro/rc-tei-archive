               <p>… There are at this day half a million of persons in the world (adult persons) calling
                  themselves Methodists, and following the institutions of John Wesley;

                  of America; and they go on increasing year after year. They have also their missionaries
                  in all parts of the world. The rise and progress of such a community is, therefore,
                  neither an incurious nor an unimportant part of the history of the last century. I
                  have brought it no farther than the death of the founder.
