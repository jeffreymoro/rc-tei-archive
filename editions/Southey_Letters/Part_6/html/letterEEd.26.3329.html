            <p class="indent1">It is no easy task, Mr. Cunningham, to answer a letter like yours. I am unwilling
               to excite hopes which are but too likely to end in severe disappointment; and equally
               unwilling to say anything which might depress a noble spirit. The frankest course
               is the best. Patience and prudence are among the characteristic virtues of your countrymen:
               the progress which you have made proves that you possess the first in no common degree;
               and if you possess a good share of the latter also, what I have to say will neither
               be discouraging nor useless. </p>

                  </div> contains incurable defects, but not such as proceed from any want of power. You have
                  aimed at too much, and failed in the structure of the story, the incidents of which
                  are impossible for the time and place in which they are laid. This is of little consequence
                  if you are of the right mould. Your language has an original stamp, and could you
                  succeed in the choice of subjects, – I dare not say that you would obtain the applause
                  of which you are ambitious, – but I believe you would deserve it.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Let me make myself clearly understood. In poetry, as in painting, and music, and architecture,
               it is far more difficult to design than to execute. A long tale should be everywhere
               consistent, and everywhere perspicuous. The incidents should depend upon each other,
               and the event appear like the necessary result, so that no sense of improbability
               in any part of the narration should force itself upon the hearer. I advise you to
               exercise yourself in shorter tales, – and these have the advantage of being more to
               the taste of the age.</p>
            <p class="indent1">But whatever you do, be prepared for disappointment. Crowded as this age is with candidates
               for public favour, you will find it infinitely difficult to obtain a hearing. The
               booksellers look blank upon poetry, for they know that not one volume of poems out
               of a hundred pays its expenses; and they know also how much more the immediate success
               of a book depends upon accidental circumstances than upon its intrinsic merit. They
               of course must look to the chance of profit as the main object. If this first difficulty
               be overcome, the public read only what it is the fashion to read; and for one competent
               critic – one equitable one – there are twenty coxcombs who would blast the fortunes
               of an author for the sake of raising a laugh at his expense.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Do not, therefore, rely upon your poetical powers as a means of bettering your worldly
               condition. This is the first and most momentous advice which I would impress upon
               you. If you can be contented to pursue poetry for its own reward, for the delight
               which you find in the pursuit, go on and prosper. But never let it tempt you to neglect
               the daily duties of life, never trust to it for profit, as you value your independence
               and your peace. To trust to it for support is misery and ruin. On the other hand,
               if you have that consciousness of strength that you can be satisfied with the expectation
               of fame, though you should never live to enjoy it, I know not how you can be more
               happily employed than in exercising the powers with which you are gifted. And if you
               like my advice well enough to wish for it on any future occasion, write to me freely;
               I would gladly be of use to you if I could.</p>
