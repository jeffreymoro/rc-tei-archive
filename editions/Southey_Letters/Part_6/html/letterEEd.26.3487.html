               <div class="indent0">My dear Kate,</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Your letter followed me to Cambridge, where I received it this morning at breakfast,
               and a great comfort it was. For although all the intelligence which came from home
               had been good, still I looked uneasily for what the next post might bring. Had it
               not been for this sort of anxiety, which you know nothing at all about, I dare say
               I should have written some queer letters to you and your sisters. But I am not so
               comical a papa anywhere else as at home.</p>
            <p class="indent1">You, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bell</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</a> are all very good girls, and have written me very nice letters, which had pleased
               me very much. One or two of my friends who know you all three, have seen your letters,
               and said what good girls you were, and how nicely you wrote. Nevertheless it will
               still be proper for me not to forget that receipt which we used to talk about for
               the pickle. You and <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</a>, I dare say, remember it. Very soon I shall begin buying the other things which I
               am to bring home, such as the books, and the prayer books, and the pretty things for
               <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</a>. You may depend upon my returning the last week in June, if it please God that I
               continue well.</p>

               <p>Among the comical things which I had to tell you all, was how I went to St. Paul’s
                  Church, when a sermon was preached for the benefit of the Children of the Clergy,
                  on which occasion there is the grandest church music ever performed in these kingdoms:

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The annual Festival of the Sons of the Clergy, held in May at St Paul’s Cathedral,
                           London, and famed for the quality of its music. It raised money for impoverished clergy
                           and the widows and orphans of clergymen. In 1820 the Festival was on 18 May, Morning
                           Chronicle, 19 May 1820. There was a huge attendance by dignitaries of the City of
                           London, judges and senior clergy. The sermon was by James Stevens (1777–1870), Lecturer
                           at St Margaret’s, Westminster 1808–1820, Rector of St James Garlickhythe 1814–1820,
                           Dean of Rochester 1820–1870.</span></div>
                  </div> and there was a fat lady before me very finely dressed in a velvet pelisse; but she
                  sat so that I could see her stumpy grey bristles under a brown wig, and could not
                  help seeing a dirty under petticoat through her pocket-hole. Remember therefore when
                  you are an old maid, or an old wife, that you have your wig made long enough to cover
                  your poll, and that you never wear dirty petticoats, either upper or under.</p>
