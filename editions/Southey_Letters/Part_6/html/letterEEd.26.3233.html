            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Writing to you I find when I am in want of anything, is like putting on Fortunatus’s
                  wishing-cap.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

                           Europe. He had a cap that could grant the wearer whatever he wished.</span></div>
                  </div> I cannot tell you how much I was surprised and gratified yesterday by the contents
                  of your parcel. The book arrived in the best time possible, to assist me with materials
                  in that part precisely where they are most scanty and I was most deficient, and completely
                  to confirm the view which I had taken of the conduct of the Jesuits in the most important
                  part of the volume, and indeed of the work.

                           of Southey’s library. Southey required it for the third and final volume of his History
                           of Brazil (1810–1819).</span></div>
                  </div> Dean Funes has a strong Spanish antipathy for the Portuguese: except where this feeling
                  predominates, I find his opinions, both of men and measures, to coincide with my own
                  in every important point, and this coincidence is so remarkable as to be not a little
                  gratifying to me.</p>

                           (he graduated in 1829). White was ordained as a Deacon on 12 December 1819 and became

                  </div> I am ashamed of not having yet read it, and written to him. I have gone some way through
                  the first volume. The book does him very great credit, though I believe him to be

                  </div> as the woman said, he may defy criticism. You have exactly hit the blot. Here lies
                  the truth: what is vital and spiritual in religion, is compatible with various forms,
                  with many imperfections and errors of belief, and with much alloy of superstition;
                  and as it is independent of all rational distinctions, it acts when those distinctions
                  are forgotten. The question is in what manner can Governments best provide for the
                  religious instruction of the people, and how can they best maintain those outward
                  and visible forms, without which (supposing them to be totally abandoned) the inward
                  and spiritual grace could no more exist, than our life could exist on earth without
                  the body in which it resides. Now I affirm that it is just as much the duty of a Government
                  to establish a National Church, endow it largely, and support it liberally, as it
                  is for the father of a family to train up his children in the way he would have them
                  go.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">

                  that such a book was in existence, had it not been for the Yankee Report,

                  not easily obtainable, and especially when they are unexpected.</p>
