               <p>We the undersigned Nobility, Magistrates, Gentry, Clergy &amp; Freeholders of the County
                  of Cumberland; feel it our duty at this time to approach the Throne with a declaration
                  of our loyal attachment to the established Institutions of these Kingdoms, in opposition
                  to the principles &amp; practises by which their security is endangered &amp; the peace of

                           the dispersal of a public meeting in Manchester, resulting in at least eleven deaths,
                           Whigs in Cumberland started to organise a County Meeting, held on 13 October 1819,

            <p class="indent1">It is the direct &amp; undisguised object of those demagogues, by whom the multitude are
               misled, to bring about a revolution by force. For this purpose men are openly trained
               to arms, &amp; assembled in bodies which bid defiance to the civil power: assassination
               has been recommended, &amp; in more than one instance attempted; &amp; lists are avowedly
               kept in which the loyal members of the community are marked for proscription. The
               rights of property are threatened; &amp; the deluded populace are taught to believe that
               the administration of public affairs ought to be taken from persons who are qualified
               by their education &amp; station in life, &amp; whose stake in the country is a pledge for
               their good intentions, &amp; transferred to the ignorant &amp; needy, who are necessarily
               incompetent, &amp; who have nothing to lose. The liberty of the press is daringly abused
               to the most flagitious purposes; it is employed with unremitting activity to efface
               from the minds of the people all respect for the laws, all sentiments of loyalty &amp;
               religion, &amp; all the old honourable feelings by which Englishmen heretofore have been
               distinguished. And unhappily this has been so far successful, that men are now no
               longer disqualified for popular favour by notorious infamy: it matters not how profligate
               they may be in the relations of private life, how base in their dealings, how bankrupt
               in character &amp; in fortune, nor how openly they may live in habitual violation of the
               laws both of God &amp; man.</p>
            <p class="indent1">Regarding these things with just apprehension we must express our sorrow that any
               persons of rank &amp; respectability should be induced to take measures which obviously
               tend to encourage wicked &amp; desperate men in their rebellious purposes. For however
               much we regret the lives which were lost at Manchester, we cannot but see that greater
               &amp; far more extensive evil must arise, if multitudes are allowed to assemble under
               such circumstances, in contempt of the constituted authorities. And we perceive in
               the attempts which are made to misrepresent the transactions of that day, a manifest
               design of diverting public indignation from the real authors of the mischief, the
               effect of which would be so to pervert the laws as to make them protect those whom
               they ought to punish, &amp; intimidate those whom they ought to protect.</p>
            <p class="indent1">As Englishman therefore who rightly appreciate the blessings which we enjoy, &amp; desire
               that the free &amp; happy constitution which we have inherited from our fathers may be
               transmitted to our children, we feel it our duty thus to address <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">your Royal Highness</a>. And should your Royal Highness be advised to recommend to Parliament the adoption
               of restrictive measures to check the diffusion of licentious principles, &amp; curb the
               audacious spirit of blasphemy &amp; treason, we beg leave to assure <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">your Royal Highness</a> that much as we deplore the necessity for such measures, we will chearfully submit
               to them, with a full sense of that necessity, as the natural consequence of excesses
               which have at all times produced similar results, &amp; as the indispensable &amp; only means
               of saving the country from the worst of all evils.</p>
