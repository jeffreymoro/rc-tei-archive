               <p>So long a time had elapsed without my hearing from you or by any accident of you,
                  that I began to fear what might have been the cause of this long silence, &amp; was really
                  afraid to enquire. I am very sorry that M<sup>r</sup> Bush

                           College, Oxford; in 1819 he was Curate at Stockleigh Pomeroy, Devon, and thus a near
                           neighbour of Lightfoot. </span></div>
                  </div> did not make use of your name when he was at <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a> last summer: – he could have brought with him no better introduction, &amp; I have always
                  time to perform offices of attention &amp; hospitality to those who are entitled to them.
                  He left a good impression here, as an excellent preacher; – indeed I have seldom <span class="strikethrough">he</span> or never heard a more judicious one. The account which he gave you of my way of life
                  is not altogether correct. – I have no allotted quantum of exercise, – but, as at
                  Oxford, sometimes go a long while without any, &amp; sometimes take walks which would
                  try the mettle of a younger man. And a great deal more of my time is employed in reading
                  than in writing; – if it were not, what I write would be of very little value. But
                  that I am a close student is very true, &amp; such I shall continue to be as long as my
                  eyes &amp; other faculties last.</p>

               <p>You must apply in time if you design to place <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LightfootJohnP">your son</a> at Oriel, – it is now no easy matter to obtain admission there, nor indeed at any

                           Leigh (d. 1785), Master of Balliol 1726–1785, and the College was almost bankrupt
                           by 1780. Its revival was due to the discovery of coal under some of its estates in
                           Northumberland, and the leadership of John Parsons (1761–1819; DNB), Master of Balliol
                           1798–1819, who reformed both the College tutorship system and the University’s examinations.

                  my skill in throwing stones for the pleasure of hearing them knock against your door.
                  Seriously however, altered as the College is, there would be an advantage in sending
                  your son there, where you have left a good name &amp; a good example. Poor <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HoweThomas">Thomas Howe</a> I believe led but a melancholy life after he left College, without neighbours, without
                  a family, without a pursuit, he must have felt dismally the want of his old routine,
                  &amp; sorely have missed his pupils, the Chapel Bell, &amp; the Common Room. A Monk is much
                  happier than an old fellow of a College who retires to reside upon a <span class="strikethrough">x</span> country living. And how much happier are you at this day, with all the tedium which
                  your daily occupation must bring with it, than if you had obtained a fellowship, &amp;
                  then waited twenty years for preferment.</p>
