                  yet to what a series of anxieties &amp; losses have you been exposed, without any fault,
                  – or even any thing which can justly be called incaution on your part! These are indeed
                  severe trials, &amp; the more so, considering by whom this recent evil has been brought
                  on. My fear now is lest your brothers

                           1820 and demands that the monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807–1808,
                           following the French invasion. John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826) arrived
                           back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and eventually agreed to a new liberal Constitution.
                           John VI appointed his son, Pedro (1798–1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831), as Regent

                  it is likely to consider as first necessary. Nor in the present state of those poor

                  more than nominal) between Portugal &amp; Brazil may continue, nor what course affairs
                  may take in either. This however is both consolatory &amp; certain, that no good man is

               1820 and demands that the monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807–1808,
               following the French invasion. John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826) arrived
               back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and eventually agreed to a new liberal Constitution.
               John VI appointed his son, Pedro (1798–1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831), as Regent
               in Brazil and Pedro summoned an elected advisory council to represent the different
               Brazilian provinces. These events eventually led to the separation of Portugal and
               Brazil in September 1822; but Brazil did not become a Republic or disintegrate. Nor
               did Brazil or Portugal renege on existing financial commitments.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note2_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
