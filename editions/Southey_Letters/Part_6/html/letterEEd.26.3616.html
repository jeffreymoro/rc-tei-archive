                  But the fact is this. The printer &amp; publisher M<sup>r</sup> Le Bel

                  importance here than they are in England) insisted upon having the life. He said the
                  French know nothing of M. Southey &amp; in order to make the work sell it must be managed
                  to interest them for the Author. To get rid of his importunities we said we were not
                  acquainted with the life of M<sup>r</sup> Southey. Would you believe it? this was verbatim his answer. “N’importe! Ecrivez toujours,
                  broder! broder un peu, que ce soit vrai ou non ce n’y fait <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> rien: qui prendra la peine de s’en informer?”

                           it?’</span></div>
                  </div> Terrified lest this ridiculous man should succeed in his point, I at last yielded:
                  &amp; sent to London to procure <span class="ital">all the Lives</span>, &amp; from them, &amp; what I had heard from my dear departed friend Richard Brinsley Sheridan,

            <p class="indent1">The Notice sur M. Southey which has <span class="strikethrough">thx</span> been thus compounded has <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> &lt;scarcely&gt; one single point accurately stated, – as you may suppose, &amp; not a few

               at the whole transaction, &amp; bear the translation with a magnanimity which would excite
               the astonishment &amp; envy of <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</a> if he were here to witness it. I have even gone beyond the Quaker principle of bearing
               injuries meekly. I have written to thank the inflictor. Happily it is in prose &amp; the
               Chevalier has intended to be faithful, &amp; has I believe actually abstained from any
               interpolations. But, – did you ever hear me mention a fact worthy of notice which
               I observed myself, – that wherever a breed of peacocks is spoiled by mixture with
               a white one, birds that escape the degeneracy in every other part of their plumage
               show it in the <span class="ital">eye</span> of the feather, – the fact is very curious, where the perfection of natures work
               is required, there it fails. <span class="strikethrough">Xxxx</span> This affords an excellent illustration for the version now before me, – every where
               the eye of the feather is defective. It would be impossible more fully to exemplify
               how compleatly a man may understand the general meaning of a passage, &amp; totally miss
               its peculiar force &amp; character.</p>
