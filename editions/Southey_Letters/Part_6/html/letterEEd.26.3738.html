                  </div> I did not know to whom I was writing. A note which <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">M<sup>r</sup> Henry Robinson</a> left for me during my absence, made me first apprehend that you are the M<sup>r</sup> Laing with whom I had half an hours pleasant &lt;conversation&gt; in 1819, when I laid my
                  hand on two books relating to Brazil, after having for many years sought them in vain.
