                           The first was Quarterly Review, 15 (July 1816), where Southey reviewed a series of
                           volumes by travellers in England under the title ‘Works on England’ (537–574), and
                           his review of ‘Ali Bey’, Domingo Badia y Leblich (1766–1818), Travels of Ali Bey in

               <p>There may however be some advantage ultimately in the frequent disappointments to
                  which I have been subjected. They very much weaken the single motive which induces
                  me ever to write under an editor who takes such unwarrantable liberties with my papers.
                  If I cannot obtain the supplies which I want by this means <span class="ital">when</span> I want them, I must seek for them thro some other channel. Say nothing about this.
                  I shall withdraw quietly, &amp; derive larger sums from <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> – in a manner much more worthy of myself, &amp; without having my works corrected like
