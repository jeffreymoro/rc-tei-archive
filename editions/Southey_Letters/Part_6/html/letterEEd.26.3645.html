               and performed at court. This custom had been suspended since 1810 due to the illness
               of George III (1738–1820; King of Great Britain 1760–1820; <em>DNB</em>), but Southey had been informed that it had been reinstated by his successor in 1820.
               It had been decided that George IV would celebrate his official birthday on St George’s
               Day, 23 April, apart from years when that fell on a Sunday, when the celebrations
               would be deferred until Monday 24 April. Southey had therefore written a Birthday
               Ode for 1820 (the unpublished ‘Ten fateful years have passed away’) and was about
               to embark upon a second one (‘Ode for St George’s Day’, unpublished until <em>Poetical Works</em>, 10 vols (London, 1837–1838), III, pp. 258–262). Neither ode was performed at court
