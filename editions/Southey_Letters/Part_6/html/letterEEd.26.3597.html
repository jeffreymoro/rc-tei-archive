            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I am now in the press with the history of the Peninsular War. The first chapter is
                  merely introductory, concerning the state of the three countries which were directly
                  involved in the contest.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> With this therefore I had no occasion to trouble you, but upon coming to matters of
                  fact I have desired <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> to send you the proof sheets.

                  </div> I should have preferred sending you the manuscript, – but you will read it with much
                  greater facility in the printed copy. My hand writing has become a very difficult
                  one, unless I make a transcript for the press, which in the present case is not necessary.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Now with regard to the communication of your corrections. My way with proof sheets
                  (which make some of the happiness of my life) is to read them aloud on the evening
                  when they arrive, keep them one post, read them aloud a second time the next day,
                  &amp; despatch them on the second night. In case of smaller corrections, such as are at
                  once to be received thankfully, &amp; without doubt, there is no need to communicate them,
                  – return the proof at such times to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a>, &amp; your corrections may go at once to the Printer.

                  opinion, to see things in a different point of view, &amp; to modify, or totally to alter
                  the tenour of the narrative <span class="strikethrough">of</span> in that part, – then if you send me your remarks on the day after the proof has been
                  sent to you, – they will reach me (who am always at home) on my second evening, &amp;
                  in good time.</p>

               <p>The sooner you can let me have such papers in your possession as may be useful, the
                  better. And there are some points upon which <span class="strikethrough">hearing your xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span> by letter would be more serviceable than any other documents, as giving me what in
                  no other way could be obtained. These, with your permission I will propose to you
                  as they occur in my progress. At present what would be most serviceable to me would
                  be that sort of information which you could communicate in a leisure hour concerning
                  the leading members of the Central Junta,

                  I have had of conversing with you upon Spanish affairs, a single expression of yours

                  which I believe was soon followed by his death. The time spent upon that obscure labour
                  I do not regret, (tho it would have sufficed for compleating my history of Portugal

                  else have attained, but also because it compelled me to look into my own opinions,
                  &amp; see upon what foundation they rested. Some portions of that narrative I shall incorporate.</p>

               <p>During the contest my anticipations for Spain were always hopeful. I wish they were

                  </div> But at present my best hope is that other countries, &amp; especially Portugal, may be
