                  lines to the Courier, by considering that before my remarks could arrive in town,
                  the subject which gave occasion to them would have lost its freshness, &amp; be grown

               <p>It is an ill symptom to see how the importance of the Reporters is acknowledged in
                  Parliament. Of the two tyrannies that of the pen appears to me more hateful than that
                  of the sword, as a plague of wild beasts is less dreadful than a plague of insects
                  &amp; reptiles, &amp; one would rather fall under a lions paw than be <span class="strikethrough">ea</span> devoured alive by vermin. We were approaching rapidly to that state, &amp; it remains
                  to be seen whether the present measures, which are very good as far as they go, will
                  save us from it. They will, if the press be vigilantly watched. Just now it seems
                  likely that juries would act as they ought to do, – for juries upon political questions
                  must always be expected to act according to the prevailing feeling in their rank of
                  life; &amp; at this time a favourable change appears to have taken place. But whatever
                  the popular temper may be, the Law Officers ought never to relax in their duty. Another

                           the ‘state of the manufacturing districts’, but was opposed by the government and
                           his motion was lost. Here Southey sets out some of the arguments against such a committee
                           that John Rickman had elaborated in his letter to Southey of 11 December 1819.</span></div>
                  </div> proposed would have done more mischief than any other imaginable measure, for it would
                  have been the means of making Parliament itself circulate every kind of inflammatory
                  opinion, &amp; all the ex-parte evidence in favour of the Radicals that could have been
                  raked together. But I should have been glad to see such evidence concerning the causes
                  of the existing commercial embarrasments as might be obtained by a Committee under
                  proper guidance. I believe it would be found that our machinery has tempted the manufacturers
                  to overstock all their markets, &amp; I fear also that that system of knavery which prevails
                  in every branch of trade wherever it can be exercised, has led them to export such
                  flimsy goods, that other countries are superseding us with their honester wares. If
                  this latter opinion were verified, it is possible that some means of remedy might
                  be applied. Another cause undoubtedly is that commercial embarrasments spread from
                  one country to another, &amp; the distress which is felt in America acts upon England.
