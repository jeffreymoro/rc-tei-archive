               <p>You will wonder at seeing my letter dated from home, at a time when I hoped to have
                  been thinking of leaving London on the way to Ludlow. My movements however are only
                  delayed, &amp; the main cause of delay is, I trust, removed. – I have had a long train
                  of anxieties since <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BrowneMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Brownes</a> kind letter arrived. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerEdith">M<sup>rs</sup> S.</a> at the time when she should in the ordinary course of things have been recovering,

                  distressing &amp; alarming kind, – by which she was confined more than four weeks to her
                  bed, &amp; nearly ten weeks to her room. Nor was it till the day before yesterday that
                  she &amp; <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">the child</a> (who has had a serious illness also) were well enough to be taken to church.

                  </div> It will be yet some time before she recovers her strength, but the season is favourable,
                  &amp; I hope &amp; believe there is nothing now to apprehend.</p>

               <p>During this long interval I have frequently been under too much anxiety to sit calmly
                  at my desk, &amp; thus have lost time when I could ill afford to lose it. The consequence
                  is that I shall be going for London just when instinct would induce every man, woman,
                  &amp; child to get out of it, if they had it in their power. My history of Brazil has
                  grown tremendously under my hands. After having done so much, the desire of leaving
                  nothing undone induced me to wind up the work with a view of the state of the country,
                  as compleat as I could make it, at the time when the history concludes, which is with
                  the removal of the Court thither in 1808.

                           ‘June 23rd, 1819’ (p. 879). The book did not proceed chronologically beyond the flight
                           of the Portuguese court to Brazil in 1807–1808.</span></div>
                  </div> Perhaps if I had properly estimated the extent of this concluding Chapter I should
                  have been tempted to make some excuse to myself for omitting it, in full assurance
                  that no one would have had reason to complain of the book as being imperfect without
                  it. It will however add as much to its value as to its bulk. But it will take me a
                  month longer before I am fairly thro the press with it, – &amp; this I fear will make
                  it August before I can reach Ludlow, on my homeward journey.</p>
