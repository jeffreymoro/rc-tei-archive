                           a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King’s wife,
                           Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821; DNB), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her
                           marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government
                           majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House
                           of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore had announced the Bill would
                           be withdrawn.</span></div>
                  </div> I should like to offer him a mark of respect, – so experimental a production as this
                  is not what one would chuse for the occasion. Tell me, if you think there would be
                  an impropriety in addressing it to the Czar.

                  modern tongues the book will gain a substantive bulk, – perhaps as thick as the Carmen
                  Nuptiale, – but the size must be foolscap quarto.
