            <p>MS: Bodleian Library, Oxford, Dep. Hughenden, 243/2. TR; 1p.<br> Unpublished.<br> Note on MS: The text survives only as a transcript in William Lisle Bowles’s hand
               that was included in a letter written by him on 22 October 1820. The subject matter
               suggests that Southey’s original possibly formed part of the letter he had sent to
               Bowles on 16 October 1820; see Letter 3540.</p>
