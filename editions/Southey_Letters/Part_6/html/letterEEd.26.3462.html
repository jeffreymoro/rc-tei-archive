               <div class="indent0">My dear Sir</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">After many delays, arising from various causes, I am at length able to fix the precise
               time of my departure for the South. On Monday the 17<sup>th</sup> of this month it is my intention to leave home, &amp; make the best of my way to Llangedwin,
               near Oswestry, where I shall stay with my friend <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">C Williams Wynn</a>, till the Saturday. On that day I shall leave him, &amp; endeavour to reach Ludlow, if
               it be convenient for you to receive me at that time. But if this should <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> happen to interefere with any of your engagements, it will make no difference to
               me: in that case I will proceed straight from Llangedwin to London, &amp; take Ludlow
               in my way back at the end of June.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The influenza which has prevailed so generally throughout the kingdom, has been very
               prevalent here. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EdmondsonDr">M<sup>r</sup> Edmondson</a> never remembers one either so general, or so severe in the course of <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> seven &amp; thirty years practise. I am the only person in this house who has escaped.
               It is still hanging upon <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<sup>rs</sup> Coleridge</a>. But as we have had an honest, old fashioned, hard winter, such as winters used to
               be, so it seems as if we were about to have an old fashioned spring, – for of late
               years spring has been more like a prolongation of winter, than the genial season which
               poets have celebrated, &amp; which I seem to remember in my boyhood. The fields are growing
               green, flowers are opening, buds swelling, birds singing, &amp; the glass is at 63. So
               I am going to London just at the season when instinct would impel one to hasten out
               of it.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>About a month ago we lost our excellent old inmate, <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<sup>rs</sup> Wilson</a>, in her seventy eighth year. She lingered eight days after a paralytic stroke had
                  deprived her of all her senses, &amp; as we hope of all sense of suffering. It was very
                  gratifying to observe how much interest her illness excited among the old inhabitants
                  of <a class="link_ref" href="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</a>, &amp; how general a testimony was borne to her worth. There are indeed but few who could
                  remember when she was, as they say, “more thought of” than any other young woman in
                  the place, both for her beauty &amp; her conduct; but <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> a later generation had learnt to respect her character, &amp; to know her good qualities,
                  &amp; she went to her grave with the deserved reputation of having never said an unkind
                  word, nor done an unkind action. She disposed of her little property in small legacies,
                  in a very affecting manner. Among other she has left five pounds to each of my girls,
