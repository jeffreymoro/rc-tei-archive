                  much bitterness of spirit, much credulity, and I have no doubt, some calumny, but
                  yet no specimens of pure railing, that is railing per se, unaccompanied with any kind
                  of reasoning. Do not however suppose that effervescences of this kind proceeding in
                  such times from a thoroughly honest heart would weigh with me more than a feather
                  in the scale in the general estimate of an eminent character.</p>

                  </div> I suspect therefore that it is written in a fierce puritanical spirit (for the author
                  was a puritan) but not without some ability. I have one of Bugg’s works and only one
                  – his Pilgrims Progress, by which it appears that hard words were liberally used on
                  both sides.

            <p class="indent1">To conclude then, my intention in writing the Life of your Founder and the Rise and
               Progress of your Society, is to do it diligently, faithfully and charitably, in a
               Christian Spirit not dissembling my own opinions, but rendering ample justice to the
               opinion of others. If I commit any unintentional errors, let them be pointed out and
               I will correct them thankfully. If I reason falsely let me be confuted – if I wilfully
