               dispose of their land allowed an action to be brought against them by the person to
               whom they wished to transfer the estate – an action in whose success they colluded,
               using long-established legal procedures. The person conveying the land was then said
               to have ‘suffered a recovery’. Presumably, Lord Somerville had not engaged in this
               process to pass on his estates to his heirs, primarily his half-brother, Mark Somerville,
               16th Lord Somerville (1784–1842), who was unconnected to the Southeys. Despite its
               bizarre rituals, ‘common recovery’ served an important purpose in allowing the holders
               of entailed estates to dispose of land they were not legally allowed to sell.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note12_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
