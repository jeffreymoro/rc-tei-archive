                  the Treatise is very satisfactory, &amp; with good reason: for it admits that he is right
                  in his principles, &amp; consequently that Carnot is wrong. It is a subject of very considerable
                  importance, – this I know enough of it to understand. Half a dozen pages in the Review
                  would be sufficient for it. And if Col: Pasley cannot be got to undertake it (who
                  is plainly the fittest person)
