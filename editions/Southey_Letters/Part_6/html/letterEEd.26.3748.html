                           1820 and demands that the monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807–1808,
                           following the French invasion. John VI (1767–1826; King of Portugal 1816–1826) arrived
                           back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and eventually agreed to a new liberal Constitution.
                           John VI appointed his son, Pedro (1798–1834; Emperor of Brazil 1822–1831), as Regent
                           in Brazil, and Pedro summoned an elected advisory council to represent the different
                           Brazilian provinces. These events eventually led to the separation of Portugal and

                  to split do not commence hostilities against each other, the deserts which separate
                  them will be the only cause; &amp; intestine commotions will <span class="strikethrough">be</span> give each enough to do at home, – especially when we recollect the fearful proportion
                  of the <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> black population! The separation of the two countries being now, I think, inevitable
                  (it is the natural &amp; direct consequence of the Revolution at home) the best thing
                  which can be wished for Brazil, is the speedy formation of a federal government, &amp;
                  a Congress. But if this was so difficult in English-America that it could hardly have
                  been effected by any other man than Washington,
