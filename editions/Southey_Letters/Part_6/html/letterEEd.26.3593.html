                  </div> is more likely to explain than any other person: – how is the common fact to be accounted
                  for, that a peach-stone is frequently found broken to pieces in the fruit, the fruit
                  itself having received no injury? S<sup>t</sup> Pierre asks if it is caused by “electricity, vegetable or animal,” – with reference

         <div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6.. </span><span class="noteBody">Under extreme pressure from George IV, the Cabinet had reluctantly agreed to introduce
               a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King’s wife,
               Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821; <em>DNB</em>), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King. On the Third Reading
               of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government majority was only nine votes and it
               seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the
               Prime Minister, therefore had announced the Bill would be withdrawn. As was customary
               when a national victory was celebrated, many householders put lighted candles in their
               windows. This occurred at different dates in different towns, mostly between 11 November
               and 16 November 1820; in Keswick the celebrations occurred on 15 November 1820.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
