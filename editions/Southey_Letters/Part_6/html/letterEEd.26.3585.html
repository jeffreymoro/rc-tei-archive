                           was appointed Regius Professor of Divinity in 1822 and Bishop of Oxford in 1827. A
                           zealous and influential tutor and lecturer, he was credited with reviving theological
                           studies at the University. A high churchman, Lloyd was initially opposed to civil
                           liberties for Catholics, but in 1829 joined Robert Peel, his former student, in supporting
                           Catholic relief. His move infuriated conservatives in church and state, and he was
                           publicly snubbed by George IV. Lloyd might have wished to research monastic history

               and lecturer, he was credited with reviving theological studies at the University.
               A high churchman, Lloyd was initially opposed to civil liberties for Catholics, but
               in 1829 joined <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#Peel">Robert Peel</a>, his former student, in supporting Catholic relief. His move infuriated conservatives
