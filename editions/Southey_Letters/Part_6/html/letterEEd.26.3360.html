                  structure, &amp; of its situation. The next day we returned to the coast at Forres. From

                           to be sure of Miss Pigott’s identity, but she might have been Emma Pigott (dates unknown),

                  the new ferry boat upon which we had depended was not launched, <span class="strikethrough">so we</span> &amp; as there was no means of getting the carriage across we retraced our steps. We remained
                  three days at Inverness, – one morning was given to the Vitrified Fort, &amp; another
                  was past in going up the Caledonian Canal to Loch Ness. Then we proceeded to Fort
                  Augustus, &amp; remained two days there, inspecting the works of the canal which are in
                  progress between that place &amp; the head of Loch Lochy. We were three days at Fort William,
                  – one day was employed in inspecting the canal from its western end to the end of
                  Loch Lochy, – another in visiting the Parallel Roads in Glen roy, – &lt;one of&gt; the greatest
                  curiosities in Scotland, – or perhaps in any other country. Balachulish ferry was

                           and designed these works.</span></div>
                  </div> The latter work I had the satisfaction of seeing in all stages of its progress, –
                  for it is compleated at the two ends, &amp; in the intermediate portion the excavations
                  &amp; other operations are going on. It is truly a stupendous undertaking, &amp; perhaps its
                  magnitude can be fully felt by those only who like myself have seen the extent of
                  masonry which will be concealed under water, when the whole is finished. The locks
                  are made large enough for a 32 gun frigate, &amp; at the western end there are eight of
                  these in immediate succession. The whole length is 500 yards, the whole ascent 64
                  feet. When we saw it the water was falling from one lock to another, in so many smooth
                  cascades, shining &amp; sparkling like polished steel, – more resembling a scene in a
                  pantomime than any thing real. The workmen have given this place the name of Neptunes
                  stair case.

                           lock (the longest in the United Kingdom) on the Caledonian Canal, comprising eight
                           locks, which raise (or lower) boats 64 feet in a distance of 180 feet. Southey visited
                           on 19 September 1819, Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819, ed. Charles Harold Herford

                  </div> There is a certain character of sublimity about it, which is felt the more because
                  you have at the same time the greatest natural object in Great Britain in sight –
                  Ben Nevis. But the most astonishing sight is the off-let for lowering the canal, if
                  the waters should at any time flow into it faster than they carried off by the ordinary
                  outlet. Three sluices each 4 feet by 3 open into a strong arch about 25 feet high,
                  which is built upon a rock, – &amp; needs indeed such a foundation. For when these sluices
                  are opened the incumbent weight forces out the water with such scarcely conceivable
                  velocity that the whole part of the canal between the stair-case &amp; the regulating
                  lock, six miles in length may be lowered one foot in <span class="strikethrough">an</span> one hour. They were opened for us, &amp; I never saw any thing comparable to the prodigious
                  force with which the water filled the whole arch, &amp; formed in a few minutes a torrent
                  which would have swept away the strongest swimmer into the river Lochy.</p>

               built between 1814–1816, to carry the road over Loch Fleet. It comprised an earthwork,
               and a bridge with self-regulating sluice gates that allowed the waters from the river
               to flow out, but prevented seawater from coming in.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               but Southey is probably referring to the Marquess himself, George Granville Leveson-Gower
               (1758–1833; <em>DNB</em>), 2nd Marquess of Stafford and (from 1833) 1st Duke of Sutherland. The latter’s marriage
               to Elizabeth Sutherland (1765–1839; <em>DNB</em>), Countess of Sutherland in her own right, gave Stafford control of enormous Scottish
               landholdings.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note4_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               1836–1881, in 1836); and their companion, Emma Pigott. It is difficult to be sure
               of Miss Pigott’s identity, but she might have been Emma Pigott (dates unknown), younger
               daughter and co-heiress of James Pigott (d. 1822) of Fitz-Hall, Iping, Sussex. Fitz-Hall
               was only five miles from Susannah Rickman’s home at Harting. Emma Pigott married,
               in 1824, Edward Brice Bunny (d. 1867) of Speen Hill, Berkshire.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
