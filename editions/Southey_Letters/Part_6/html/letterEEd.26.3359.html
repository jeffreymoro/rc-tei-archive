                           (‘On the Present Greatness of Britain’) championed native common sense and argued
                           that: ‘What now remains to keep our Britain blest/ But steady fortitude and social

                  we lose those liberties which are at this time so grossly &amp; perilously abused. God

               built between 1814–1816, to carry the road over Loch Fleet. It comprised an earthwork,
               and a bridge with self-regulating sluice gates that allowed the waters from the river
               to flow out, but prevented seawater from coming in.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               than Southey’s. Although it acknowledged a period of potential crisis, his first prolusion
               (‘On the Present Greatness of Britain’) championed native common sense and argued
               that: ‘What now remains to keep our Britain blest/ But steady fortitude and social
               rest;/ The growing worth of every active mind,/ With justice, moral faith and hope
               combin’d;/ The blending of the free and loyal heart,/ Gracing the patriot with the
               subjects part:/ Obedient to the laws; respecting power;/ Conscious of rights; contented
               with the hour:/ Pursuing firmly all that’s great and fair,/ And happiest in the good
               which others share!/ Be this thy spirit Britain! and the earth/ Will hail thy empire
               as its noblest birth./ Mankind will gaze to emulate thy fame;/ But to attain it, must
               thy virtues claim’, <em>Prolusions On the Present Greatness of Britain; On Modern Poetry; and On the Present
                  Aspect of the World</em> (London, 1819), pp. 82–83.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note6_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
