            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I wish for your sake that the next few months were over – that you had passed your
                  examination, and were quietly engaged in the regular course of parochial duty.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

                           clerical career. He enrolled at Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 26 June 1819 to study for
                           a Bachelor of Divinity degree as a ‘ten-year man’, i.e. a part-time, mature student
                           (he graduated in 1829). However, White was more immediately concerned with his approaching
                           ordination examination, which required knowledge of Greek, Latin, works of divinity
                           and the Bible; he duly passed and was ordained as a Deacon on 12 December 1819, becoming
                           a Curate at St Edmund the King, Norwich.</span></div>
                  </div><span class="ital">In labore quies</span> you know is the motto which I borrowed from my old predecessor Garibay.

                           (2)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>‘In labour is rest’, the motto on Southey’s seal. He had borrowed it from the prolific

                  </div> It is only in the discharge of duty that that deep and entire contentment which alone
                  deserves to be called happiness is to be found, and you will go the way to find it.
                  Were I a bishop, it would give me great satisfaction to lay hands upon a man like
                  you, fitted as you are for the service of the altar by principle and disposition,
                  almost beyond any man whom I have ever known. I have long regarded it as a great misfortune
                  to the Church of England that men so seldom enter it at a mature age, when their characters
                  are settled, when the glare of youth and hope has passed away; the things of the world
                  are seen in their true colours, and a calm and sober piety has taken possession of
                  the heart. The Romanists have a great advantage over us in this.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>You asked me some time ago what I thought about the Manchester business.

                  </div> I look upon it as an unfortunate business, because it has enabled factious and foolish
                  men to raise an outcry, and divert public attention from the great course of events
                  to a mere accidental occurrence. That the meeting was unlawful, and in <span class="ital">terrorem populi</span><div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

                  </div> is to me perfectly clear. The magistrates committed an error in employing the yeomanry
                  instead of the regulars to support the civil power; for the yeomanry, after bearing
                  a great deal, lost their temper, which disciplined troops would not have done.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
                           (5)
                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>When the Manchester magistrates ordered the arrest of the main speakers at the meeting
                           at St Peter’s Field on 16 August 1819, the task was delegated to the Manchester and
                           Salford Yeomanry, a body of upper-class local volunteers; they began to attack the
                           crowd indiscriminately, and the crowd responded by throwing brickbats at the Yeomanry.
                           Finally, the meeting was dispersed by regular troops, primarily the 15th Hussars.</span></div>
                  </div> The cause of this error is obviously that the magistrates thought it less obnoxious
                  to employ that species of force than the troops, – a natural and pardonable mistake.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It is no longer a question between Ins and Outs, nor between Whigs and Tories. It
               is between those who have something to lose, and those who have everything to gain
               by a dissolution of society. There may be bloodshed, and I am inclined to think there
               will before the Radicals are suppressed, but suppressed they will be for the time.
               What may be in store for us afterwards, who can tell? According to all human appearances,
               I should expect the worst, were it not for an abiding trust in Providence, by whose
               wise will even our follies are overruled.</p>
