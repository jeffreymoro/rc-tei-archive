               a pitch plaister has been put on. More relief may be expected from change of weather
               than from medicine. At present a severe East wind prevails.</p>

                  made unexceptionable, – &amp; seem placed as if to invite mockery. And in one part I think
                  the Poet is hardly serious enough for his subject, – where he is asking <span class="ital">what</span> Peter saw in the water.
