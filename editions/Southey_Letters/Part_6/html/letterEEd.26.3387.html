            <p class="indent1">I trust you will not consider me as acting improperly in addressing myself to you
               upon a subject on which an official application to the Admiralty has been made twice

                           of the administrative offices that local ratepayers were liable to hold. In this case
                           the office was Collector of the Taxes, which probably mainly involved dealing with
                           the parish’s Land Tax assessment.</span></div>
                  </div> He applies to know whether he is not privileged by his commission from serving in
                  any such office; – the first reply which he receives is that their Lordships do not
                  think it necessary to interfere; – the second, that they do not think it their province
                  to advise him upon a point of law.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">Now, my dear Sir, this point of law concerns the service. A naval officer may be summoned
               <span class="strikethrough">at</span> upon his duty at any time, – how then can <span class="strikethrough">he</span> an office be thrust upon him which requires residence while it lasts, &amp; renders him
               responsible to the Exchequer if it be not performed? – Is not this a question which
               implicates the privileges of the navy? &amp; where should those privileges be understood
               if not at the Admiralty? The common sense of the case is plain. If the point of law
               be doubtful, how easy is it for the Admiralty to obtain an opinion! And is it not
               fitting that a point <span class="strikethrough">which</span> should be settled, which so long as it remains undetermined exposes their officers
               to vexation, &amp; places them in a situation wherein they know not how to act, – having
               on the one hand to compromise the privileges of the service, – or on the other to
               incur the expences of a law suit?</p>

                           the government proposed to suppress radical agitation. These included a new Seditious
                           Meetings Prevention Bill and a Criminal Libel Bill.</span></div>
                  </div> The Opposition will endeavour to make up in violence, what they will lose in numbers.
                  But Government has great advantages at this moment. I should think it prudent not
                  to press the suspension of the H. Corpus,

                  by this forbearance would be worth something. The main objects are to prevent seditious
                  meetings, &amp; to curb a licentious press: &amp; the evils of both are so generally acknowledged,
                  that there never was a better &lt;time&gt; for <span class="strikethrough">xxxx</span> proposing some effectual remedy. I have reason to believe that one of the most effectual
                  would be supported by some persons not in the habit of acting with Government, – that
                  of making banishment for life the punishment for sedition &amp; blasphemy.

                           version of the Bill had made transportation for seven years the punishment for a second

                  one Sessions to another, for these offences, (which allows them to go on during the
                  interim in the same course,) is so palpable, &amp; so absurd, that an act for remedying

                  </div> Still more would result from repeated prosecutions of the seditious papers. Long impunity
                  has made them incautious. In the month of August I saw a Scotch newspaper containing

                           Ferdinand VII (1784–1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813–1833) of poisoning one of his two
                           former wives: either Princess Maria Antonia of Naples (1784–1806); or Princess Maria
                           Isabel of Portugal (1797–1818). At this time the Review was ‘a violent anti-ministerial

                  in that quarter (Montrose.) The M Chronicle of Sept. 21. says speaking of the approbation
                  signified to the Magistrates at Manchester, “The Kings Government has by this approbation
                  declared that it will, whenever it pleases so to do, plunge those arms entrusted to
