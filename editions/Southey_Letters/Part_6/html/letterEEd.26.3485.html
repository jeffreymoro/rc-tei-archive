                  companion of my walks. When absent from home I was never so chearfully employed as
                  in writing to him, never so happily as when devising means for his present gratification
                  or future advantage. My hopes were centered in him. I saw in him all that was good
                  in myself. I thought it would be possible to prove in his person what might be done
                  with the most promising nature <span class="strikethrough">by</span> &lt;under&gt; the most favourable circumstances by the most diligent cultivation. The proudest
                  &amp; dearest thought of my heart was that I should have a son to succeed me, who would
                  take up the pursuits which I should leave unfinished, &amp; start from the point at which
                  my career had ended: —a son who loved me with his whole heart &amp; soul &amp; strength, –
                  as I loved him, <span class="strikethrough">&amp;</span> &lt;for I&gt; almost lived in his existence. If any grief could have killed me it would
                  have been this deprivation: &amp; had it not been for the sake of those whose well being
                  depends upon my life, I should at that time earnestly have desired &amp; prayed for death.</p>

            <p class="indent1">Among the many evils which are done by canting &amp; trading professors of religion, it
               is not the least that they make us keep our best &amp; wisest &amp; holiest feelings to ourselves,
               lest we should be thought to resemble them. Under an apprehension of this kind I have
               sometimes been silent, when my heart would have led me to speak, &amp; when perhaps the
               hearts of others have been open. I could hardly <span class="strikethrough">xx</span>&nbsp;<span class="ital">say</span> to you what I have here written. Philosophy may teach us to bear affliction bravely,
               —but religion converts afflictions into blessings. When we attain the middle stage
               of life years pass away more rapidly then weeks in youth. The separations which death
               makes are only for a season, &amp; it is no light benefit that they bind our feelings
               to our faith; — that they make us regard the termination of our mortal existence,
               not with distrust &amp; unwillingness, but with hope &amp; with desire. This is my state of
               mind, &amp; I am thankful for the afflictions which have brought me to it. May yours be
               blest &amp; sanctified as mine have been.</p>
