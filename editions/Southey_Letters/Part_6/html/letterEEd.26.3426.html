               <p>With regard to the illustrations of my larger poems, I am glad you think of them,
                  because such things are now become so customary that the poet who goes without them
                  might seem to hold but a low place in public opinion; a point which I care for only
                  as it may affect the sale of my works. Would it not be worth while, as an experiment,
                  to print one of my poems with or without the notes, in a small cheap form, like those
                  little editions of Walker’s, Suttaby’s, &amp;c., which are found at every country bookseller’s,
                  however small his stock?

                           produced without Southey’s sanction on the continent. For example in 1820 a pocket

                  buy books till they are lowered in price to their means; but this class is numerous,
                  and always on the increase, and is plainly worth printing for, because so many books

               <p>I should expect that the third volume of “Brazil” will get up with the second as soon

                  not regard the advertisements. But as to the first volume, many copies must, by the
                  death of the first possessors or other chances, have fallen into the possession of
                  persons who care nothing about books, or have got into the hands of booksellers as
                  odd volumes, – a necessary evil arising from the lapse of time between the first and
                  last publication.

                  </div> I must not, however, regret that so long a time elapsed, because some of the most
                  important materials for the last volume did not come to light till that volume was
                  half through the press; so that, had the work appeared earlier, it must have been
