                  </div> whereof only about two sheets remain to be printed. Some persons have expressed their
                  expectations that the book will have a huge sale; – I am much more inclined to think
                  that it will obtain a moderate sale, &amp; a durable reputation. <span class="strikethrough">Xx</span> Its merit will hardly be appreciated by any person unless it be compared with what
                  his former biographers have done: then indeed it would be seen what they have overlooked,
                  how completely the composition is my own, &amp; what pains it must have required to collect
                  together the pieces for this <span class="strikethrough">xxxxxxx tablet</span> &lt;great&gt; tesselated tablet. The book contains many fine things, – pearls which I have
                  raked out of the dunghill, – my only merit is that of finding &amp; setting them. It contains
                  also many odd ones, – some that may provoke a smile, &amp; some that will touch the feelings.
                  In parts I think some of my own best writing will be found. It is written with too
                  fair a spirit, to satisfy any particular set of men. For the “religious public” it
                  will be too tolerant &amp; too philosophical; for the Liberales it will be too devotional:
                  the Methodists will not endure any censure of their founder &amp; their institutions;
                  the high Churchmen will as little be able to allow any praise of them. Some will complain
                  of it as being heavy &amp; dull; others will not think it serious enough. I shall be abused
                  on all sides, – &amp; you well know how little I shall care for it.</p>
