                  of place, &amp; society, was in itself a pleasure of high degree: &amp; then the comfort of

                  no engagement for tomorrow, – Christian in the Pilgrims Progress, when the burthen

                  </div> To my great surprize the review is violently Anti-Anglican, which I think must proceed
                  more from his coadjutors than himself. He says I shall not think an apology for this
                  necessary when I call to mind the language of certain English journals respecting
                  America. I shall tell him in reply that none was needed, but that certainly if I had
                  the direction of a Journal, nothing should appear in it concerning America but what
                  was conciliatory in its spirit &amp; tendency. The Yankees suppose that they are of as
                  much importance in our eyes, as we are in theirs, &amp; it is strange that <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#EverettEdward">Everett</a> after being in England should continue in this error. We have more important things

                  </div> It is very likely that his peculiar manners, his love of paradox, &amp; his uncomfortable
