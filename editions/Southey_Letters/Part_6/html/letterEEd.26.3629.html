               <em>DNB</em>), the estranged wife of George IV, during the time she was living in Como. In it,
               Landor insisted, ‘whatever I may have heard relating to the Queen, I know nothing
               positive, and never made a single inquiry that either could inculpate or acquit her
               in the cause now pending’.
