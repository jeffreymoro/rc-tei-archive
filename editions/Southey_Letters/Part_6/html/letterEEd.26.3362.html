               The people however ate drank &amp; were merry, – &amp; I among others, went on quietly with
               my usual pursuits, tho I never laid down at night, without thinking it likely that
               I should hear the plague had appeared among us in the morning. The present state of
               things reminds me of what my feelings were then. This danger also may pass away, &amp;
               in spite of all appearances I cannot think it can be in the order of Providence that
               a country like this should be brought to ruin. But it is upon this persuasion that
