                  on that day; – &amp; a request to write verses for the said dinner, for the equally good
                  reason that I am too busy, &amp; have no talent for occasional poetry.

                           fundraising dinner, which was held on 10 May 1821. The ‘conviviality of the Meeting
                           was sustained with unabated spirit till near midnight’, Morning Post, 11 May 1821.

                  Stock Company of Patronage, does in fact nothing more than relieve literary pauperism
                  by donations of five &amp; of ten pounds, – which just serves to purchase a reprieve from
