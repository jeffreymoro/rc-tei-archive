            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have had a visit from Mrs. Fry upon the subject of George Fox, for my intention
                  has made a stir among the Quakers.

                           Southey. She had been prompted to do so by news that he planned to write a life of
                           George Fox (1624–1691; DNB), founder of the Society of Friends. When Fry failed to
                           change Southey’s mind, she offered him access to sources for his book; see Southey
                           to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 27 October 1820, Letter 3544.</span></div>
                  </div> The first wish (I think) was to dissuade me from the undertaking; but that being in
                  vain, every offer of assistance is made. I thought it proper to show Mrs. Fry the
                  introduction which I had written, that she might see in what light I viewed the subject,
                  and that I should neither dissemble the errors of the Society and its founder, nor
                  detract from their just merits. And having made it clearly understood that I shall
                  write with perfect freedom, as well as perfect sincerity, I shall avail myself without
                  scruple of all the advantages and facilities which are offered me.</p>
