                           his letters, his prayers, and his hymns, will afford ample and interesting proofs.
                           I must be permitted to say, that my own views of the religion of Christ Jesus differ

                           it is, indeed, my anxious wish to do full justice to piety so fervent. It was in him
                           a living and quickening principle of goodness, which sanctified all his hopes, and
                           all his affe…</span></div>

                  though, had <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</a> lived till this time, I believe there would scarcely have been a shade of difference
                  between us. I am perfectly sure that, with a heart and intellect like his, he would
                  have outgrown all tendency towards Calvinism, and have approached nearer in opinion
                  to Jeremy Taylor than to the Synod of Dort.

                  duties any government was ever called upon to perform, obstructed as it is by such
                  a body of priests, who can effectually prevent any better instruction than they themselves
                  bestow. I want more information concerning certain parts of Irish history than I possess
                  at present; but in one or more of the works which I have in hand I shall trace the
                  evils of Ireland to their source.

                  </div> Meantime, this I may safely assert, as a general deduction from all that I have learnt
                  in the course of history, that the more we know of preceding and coexisting circumstances
                  and difficulties, the more excuse we shall find for those men and measures which,
                  with little knowledge of those circumstances, we should condemn absolutely. This feeling
                  leads not to any thing like indifference concerning right and wrong, nor to any lukewarmness
                  or indecision in opinion; but certainly to a more indulgent and charitable tone of
                  mind than commonly prevails.</p>
