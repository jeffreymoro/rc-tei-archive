               <p>You propose a question to me which I can no more answer with any grounds for an opinion,
                  than if you were to ask me whether a lottery ticket should be drawn blank or prize,
                  – or if a ship should make a prosperous voyage to the East Indies. If I recollect

                           deathbed in Alexander Chalmers (1759–1834; DNB), The Works of the English Poets, from

                           Southey followed, emphasised that Scott had been troubled by fears of his own unworthiness,

                  wanted him to repent of his poetry as of a sin. The Quakers are much altered since
                  that time. I know one, a man deservedly respected by all who know him, (<a class="link_ref" href="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">Charles Lloyd the elder of Birmingham</a>) who has amused his old age by translating Horace &amp; Homer;

            <p class="indent1">Judging however from the spirit of the age as affecting your Society, like every thing
               else, I should think they would be gratified by the appearance of a Poet among them,
               who confines himself within the limits of their general principles. They have been
               reproached with being the most illiterate sect that has ever arisen in the Christian
               world; &amp; they ought to be thankful to any of their members who should assist in vindicating
               them from that opprobrium. There is nothing in their principles which should prevent
               them from giving you their sanction: &amp; I will even hope that there are not many persons
               who will impute it to you as a sin, if you should <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> call some of the months by their Heathen names. I know of no other offence that you
               are in danger of committing. They will not like virtuous feelings &amp; religious principles
               the worse, for being conveyed in good verse. If poetry in itself were unlawful, the
               Bible must be a prohibited book.</p>

                  within my power. For tho I bear a part in the Quarterly Review (&amp; endure a large portion
                  of the grossest abuse &amp; calumny for opinions which I do not hold, &amp; articles which
                  I have not written) I have long since found it necessary, for reasons which you may
                  easily apprehend, to form a resolution of reviewing no poems whatever. My principles
                  of criticism indeed are altogether opposite to those of the age. I would treat every
                  thing with indulgence, except what was mischievous. And most heartily do I disapprove
                  of the prevailing fashion of criticism, the direct tendency of which is to call bad
                  passions into full play.</p>
