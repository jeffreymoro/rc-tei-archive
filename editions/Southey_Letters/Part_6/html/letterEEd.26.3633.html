                  </div> to thank you for the drawing, &amp; for the feeling which induced you to send it. I know
                  the spot well, &amp; the poplar tree, but among the nearest buildings are some high tower-like
                  chimnies, which look as if they belonged to a manufactory, &amp; which I think have been
                  erected since my time. For my recollections of Bristol are in the eighteenth year
                  of their age: – a large part of human life!

                  meet one person whom I remembered, or who would remember me. – When my poem reaches
                  you, you will see that I do not think of Bristol without a natural feeling.
