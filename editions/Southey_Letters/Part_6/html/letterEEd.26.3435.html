            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>I have had an uneasy doubt upon my mind whether I had written to thank you for your
                  Lyrical Dramas, or not.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                           no. 2024 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library.</span></div>
                  </div> For the volume arrived when I was in the hurry of preparing for a journey into the
                  Highlands, &amp; the succession of scenes in which I was for several weeks engaged made
                  me incapable of recollecting what duties of this kind I had performed, &amp; what had
                  been left undone.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

            <p class="indent1">Excuse me, for what was the effect of hurry, not of intentional or conscious neglect.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I read your volume with much pleasure, &amp; those of my family who are old enough to
               be readers were much pleased with it also. Few volumes contain such specimens of sweet
               &amp; unaffected versification, – of language easy &amp; natural, of fancy always active where
               it ought to be, &amp; of feeling which is always right. And no volume could ever <span class="strikethrough">convey a more</span> impress upon the reader a more favourable opinion of the author.</p>
            <p class="indent1">The Quarterly Review has a very mischievous effect incidentally upon those books which
               it does not notice. This ought not to be the case, because its notice is capricious.
               It sometimes brings forward things which will be left in the shade, &amp; more frequently
               neglects others that are well deserving of praise.</p>
            <p class="indent1">I have myself for some years found it necessary to resolve against <span class="strikethrough">criticizing</span> reviewing any contemporary poetry. On a very few occasions (the present &lt;is&gt; one)
               I have regretted the necessity of declaring this resolution – But in how many instances
               has it served me in good stead, &amp; afforded me the only reply which could be made <span class="strikethrough">which</span> without inflicting pain, or giving offence!</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Remember me to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#ConderJosiah">M<sup>r</sup> Conder</a>. I have behaved very ill to him, – &amp; if I were to speak of good intentions, he would
                  perhaps remember what such things are said to serve for in the other world.

                  before we meet. I shall endeavour to find you also, if you should then be in town,
                  &amp; assure you in person of that respect &amp; regard with which I remain</p>
