               not only praising Britain’s victory in the war against France, but stating: ‘The same
               perfect integrity has been manifested in the whole administration of public affairs’
               (vi), not a view the Whig opposition endorsed. However, the earlier draft of the ‘Dedication’,
               in Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733, shows Southey had intended to go much
               further and urge that ‘adequate remedy should be applied to that intolerable licentiousness
               of the press … either by the vigorous application of existing laws or by the enactment
               of such new ones as the suspension of the abuse may render necessary’.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note9_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
