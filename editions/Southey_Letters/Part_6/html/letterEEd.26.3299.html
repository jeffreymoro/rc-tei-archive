ALS; 4p.<br> Previously published: John Wood Warter (ed.), <em>Selections from the Letters of Robert Southey</em>, 4 vols (London, 1856), III, pp. 139–141.<br> Dating note: The letter is misdated 30 June 1819 by Southey. The content, in particular
               the references to the age of Cuthbert Southey, Caroline Bowles’s stay in Bristol,
               Southey’s progress with the <em>History of Brazil</em> and his plans to visit London rather than Scotland, make it clear that the letter
               belongs to c. 21 May 1819; see also Southey to Caroline Bowles, 21 May 1819, Letter
