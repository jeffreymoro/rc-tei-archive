               <p>Thank you for your little volume.

                  </div> It always gives me great pleasure to hear from you, – &amp; that pleasure would have had
                  no drawback upon this occasion, if the letter had contained a better account of your
                  eyesight. I agree in the main with the opinions which you have expressed in the preface,
                  except as to the censure which you have pronounced upon the Alexandrine.

                           </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Cottle, Messiah: in Twenty-Four Books. Part the Second (London, 1819). The preface
                           justified the experimental metre of Cottle’s poem. This was ridiculed in the Monthly
                           Review, 92 (August 1820), 406–409. The review concluded that ‘Mr. Cottle must undeceive
                           himself … He has not a ray, nor a shadow, of the genius of a poet’ (409).</span></div>
                  </div> <span class="strikethrough">But I cannot say that</span> My own practise is to say as little as possible by way of preface, &amp; when I make any
                  innovations upon established usages of poetry, &amp; introduce any experiments in versification,
                  to leave the reader to find them out for himself, &amp; discover if he can upon what principle
                  I have proceeded. Kehama I believe passed thro the reviews without the slightest remark
                  upon the novelties of this kind which it contained: whereas if I had called attention
                  to them, they would <span class="strikethrough">of xx</span> have been abused as a matter of course.

                           critics had pointed out its irregular metrics. See, for example, the Edinburgh Review,
                           17 (February 1811), 429–465, which critiqued the use of irregular metre and singled
                           out passages that were ‘extremely offensive to … [the reviewer’s] ears’, ‘detestable
                           in rhythm, style and conception’, full of ‘harsh and noisy bombast’ and characterised
                           by ‘pure childishness and sing-song’ (451–453), though it did find sections of which
                           it approved.</span></div>
                  </div> It is best to keep ones own counsel in such cases. By &amp; bye critics will take merit
