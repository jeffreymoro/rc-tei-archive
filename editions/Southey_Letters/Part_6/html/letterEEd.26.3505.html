               <div class="indent0">Dear Sir</div>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">You will have heard, from private or public sources, that when your two last letters
               were written, I was absent from home; &amp; I hope you will have accounted for &amp; excused
               my silence, as judging rightly of the whirl &amp; hurry of occupations in which I have
               been involved. During an absence of eleven weeks, I have very rarely slept more than
               three nights successively in the same bed.</p>
            <div class="wrapper">
               <p>Thank you for your volume.
                  <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">
                           (1)

                  </div> Whatever its immediate reception may be among your own sect, you need not doubt that
                  in due time they will learn <span class="strikethrough">th</span> to appreciate the service you have done them, &amp; will be proud both of the book &amp; of
                  its author. It will win its way surely, tho perhaps slowly. I have heard it spoken
                  of in high terms, as it deserves. And whenever opportunity offers, or can be made,
                  of noticing it in the manner that I could wish, you may be assured that I will not
                  let the occasion pass.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">I am returned to &lt;find&gt; heavy arrears of correspondence, &amp; business of every kind.
               Excuse therefore the haste &amp; brevity with which I write &amp; believe me with much respect.</p>
