                  great annual meeting which is called the Commemoration. There are two reasons for
                  this: first that the University may do itself honour, by bringing persons of distinction
                  to receive the degree publicly as a mark of honour; &amp; secondly that certain persons
                  in inferior offices may share in the fees paid by those upon whom the ceremony of
                  ell-ell-deeing is performed. For the first of these reasons the Emperor Alexander
                  was made a Doctor of Laws at Oxford, &amp; the King of Prussia, &amp; old Blucher, &amp; Platoff.
