                           not been elected, a meeting of Brougham’s friends in the yard of Appleby Castle endorsed
                           resolutions forming a ‘Grand Association to Secure the Independence of Westmorland
                           and Cumberland’, i.e. to work to promote future Whig candidates. Southey attributes
                           this idea to the radical, Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope (1753–1816; DNB), who
                           had helped organise a county association in Kent in 1780 to promote reform and petition
                           parliament.</span></div>

                           It was normal in hotly contested elections, as at that in Westmorland in 1818, for
                           candidates to attempt to obtain freeholds for known supporters.</span></div>

                  might have in reality been adv[MS missing] from a different quarter,

                           this would in effect buy his vote.</span></div>
                  </div> &amp; therefore in case an election had occurred before it was repaid have exposed me
                  to an unpleasant feeling in tendering <span class="strikethrough">x</span> my vote: – the other, a determination never to <span class="strikethrough">eng</span> enter into an engagement which it may be difficult or <span class="strikethrough">perhaps impos</span> inconvenient for me to fulfill, if I can possibly help it. For the greater part of
                  my yearly expences must still be supplied by the years labour, &amp; is therefore wholly
                  contingent upon the continuance of health, eye sight &amp; the use of my faculties, –
                  either of which may fail me at any moment.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent1">It appears to me that you <span class="strikethrough">rather</span> undervalue your own weight in Parliament, &amp; do not perhaps see the state of the board
               so well as a looker on. The great pieces are cleared off, &amp; you may come in like a
               Castle toward the end of the game. It appears to me that the question of the Criminal
               Law cannot long be evaded; – that Ministers will not take it into their own hands
               as they ought to do, because they never have courage enough or foresight enough to
               anticipate the public feeling &amp; thereby to direct it: but that they would be glad
               to see it in your hands, rather than in those of a thick-&amp;-thin oppositionist, to
               whom it would give <span class="strikethrough">xx</span> popularity at their expence; &amp; by whom it certainly &lt;will&gt; be taken up, if no better
               person steps forward. – Among the things to be desired, one I think is – that transportation
               should always be for life, &amp; the gradation of punishment be measured by the term for
               which the convict was to be employed in public works. – I wish too, seeing the constant
               increase of crimes, that from among the numbers &lt;of soldiers&gt; &amp;c whom we have discharged,
               a strong patrole had been formed, who might have retained as much of their discipline
               as would have been convenient, &amp; been subjected to the civil power. They would have
               been better employed in preventing robberies &amp; murders, – than in committing them.
               – which in too many instances will be the alternative.</p>

                           (1780–1845; DNB), who had defeated Wynn for the post in 1817. Canning paid a generous
                           tribute to Wynn, stating The Speaker had been ‘elected to the chair of this House,
                           after a contest with a gentleman, to be put in competition with whom is no disparagement,
                           but a high credit to any man, be his character what it may.’ It must be doubtful whether

               not been elected, a meeting of Brougham’s friends in the yard of Appleby Castle endorsed
               resolutions forming a ‘Grand Association to Secure the Independence of Westmorland
               and Cumberland’, i.e. to work to promote future Whig candidates. Southey attributes
               this idea to the radical, Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope (1753–1816; <em>DNB</em>), who had helped organise a county association in Kent in 1780 to promote reform
               and petition parliament.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note3_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>

               General Election of 1818, its first duty was to re-elect The Speaker, Charles Manners-Sutton
               (1780–1845; <em>DNB</em>), who had defeated Wynn for the post in 1817. Canning paid a generous tribute to
               Wynn, stating The Speaker had been ‘elected to the chair of this House, after a contest
               with a gentleman, to be put in competition with whom is no disparagement, but a high
               credit to any man, be his character what it may.’ It must be doubtful whether this
               tribute, or Southey drawing attention to it, made Wynn feel any better about having
               lost out to Manners-Sutton.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note8_return"><em>[back]</em></a></div>
