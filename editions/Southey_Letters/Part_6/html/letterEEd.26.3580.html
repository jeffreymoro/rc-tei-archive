               <p>Your letter arrived yesterday, by which post you know (being Thursday) it could not
                  be answered. By this nights I shall write to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</a> saying that you will deliver the drawings to him, &amp; informing him of the price. That
                  they have in them that which is common to poetry &amp; painting, I do not doubt, – &amp; I
                  only wish it were possible for you to engrave them yourself. The first edition of
                  the book would then bear a high value hereafter.

                           Letter 3546. This book eventually appeared as Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the

               Any offence that he may have given was entirely unintentional. Forget it, I intreat
