                           Charles Bedford, 3 February 1821, Letter 3625, contained two versions, of which the
                           least controversial was used, omitting such advice as: ‘adequate remedy should be
                           applied to that intolerable licentiousness of the press … either by the vigorous application
                           of existing laws or by the enactment of such new ones as the suspension of the abuse
                           may render necessary’. The third version, mentioned here to Henry Herbert Southey,
                           was Bedford’s own composition.</span></div>
                  </div> agrees very well with my own, – &amp; the first should without hesitation have been sent
                  to the press if the work had not been one which was published <span class="ital">ex officio</span>. But I felt that tho RS. may be perfectly qualified to offer advice to <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">his Majesty</a>, &amp; is as ready to do it as Alderman Wood

                  within the limits of the P.L’s duties. Upon this point I desired <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> to ask <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries’s</a> opinion, – he being so much an official man as to know in what manner such <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> a thing was likely to be taken, – &amp; as you know, a man of good sense. If he felt an
                  impropriety when I suspected one, his opinion would decide me upon a question which
                  I cared very little about. Upon his decision I took out all that was useful, &amp; left
                  the complementary part, <span class="strikethrough">&amp; a xx which was</span> &lt;much&gt; the worse for the separation. <a class="link_ref" href="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</a> will by this time have seen that his performance was not very graciously received.

                  </div> When he sits down to composition he has a fine talent for bad writing. So the second
                  is to stand. – You wonder why I <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> let other <span class="strikethrough">xxx</span> people act for me. I like to let them please themselves by taking into their serious
                  consideration matters which to me are of no consideration whatever. Upon matters of
