                  in honour of the cloth) had some humour. In repairing the public road, the labourers
                  came so near his garden wall, that they injured the foundations &amp; down it fell. He
                  complained to the waywardens, &amp; demanded reparation, which they would have evaded
                  if they could, telling him it was but an old wall, &amp; in a state of decay. Gentlemen,
                  he replied, old as the wall was, it served my purpose. But however I have not the
                  least objection to your putting up a second-hand one in its place. This anecdote I
                  heard full five &amp; thirty years ago from one of my schoolmasters, who had been a rival
                  of Collins’s, &amp; is satirized in the Miscellanies.
