					who are lucky enough to have better winter quarters allotted them than this island affords. – The woodcocks &amp;
					snipes have arrived, by this token that my bookbinder here sent me a brace of the latter last week.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s bookbinder was based in Ulverston; he possibly used John Soulby (b. 1795),
						who succeeded his father, John Soulby (1771–1817), in the business.</note> And this reminds me to tell you that if
					you ever have an owl drest for dinner, you had better have it boiled &amp; smothered with onions, for it
						<del>x</del> is not good roasted. Experto crede Roberto.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Trust in Robert,

						Raisley Calvert (1803–1838), later a clergyman.</note> had committed the great sin of shooting an owl. The
					criminality of the act was qualified by an ingenious confession that he did not know what it was when he fired at
					it, <del>xx</del> the bird was brought in to show us, &amp; then given me that I might show it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">your godson</ref>. <hi rend="ital">oodle-oos</hi> &amp; <hi rend="ital">muckens</hi> (πιθηκοι)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">‘Monkeys’.</note> being of all created

						<title>DNB</title>) <title>The Fables of Aesop and Others</title> (1818), which he had ordered a copy of from Longman on 19 February 1819 (Letter 3249).</note> or in some other of his books.

					It was served up without the head, &amp; a squat-looking fellow it was, about the size of a large wild pigeon but
					broader in proportion to its length. The meat was more like bad mutton than any thing else. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> was not valiant enough to taste it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthMary">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> W.</ref> did. &amp; we agreed that there could be no
					pretext for making owls game, &amp; killing them as delicacies. But if ever you eat one, by all means try it
					boiled, &amp; with onion sauce.</p><p rend="indent1"> I asked your opinion a good while since concerning a dedication for the Peninsular war,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832) was dedicated
						to George IV.</note> &amp; hitherto you have not opined upon the subject in reply. It has this moment, while I am
					writing, occurred to me that I could with sincere satisfaction in so doing, inscribe it to Lord Sidmouth.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth (1757–1844; <title>DNB</title>), Prime
						Minister 1801–1804, Home Secretary 1812–1822. Sidmouth was Prime Minister at the time of the Treaty of Amiens (15
						March 1802), which ended the war between France and Britain until May 1803. Southey had met Sidmouth on 26 April
						1817, just before leaving for a continental tour.</note> I have always felt thankful to him for the Peace of
					Amiens &amp; should like to tell him so in public, as I once did vivâ voce. And I should do it the more willingly,
					if he is going out of office – which I rather think he is. Some of his colleagues wish to get rid of him, &amp; he
					would willingly retire, but <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> wishes to keep
					him. I told you what had past with <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord Grenville</ref> concerning
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref>.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The

						Hanover.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">George IV’s visit to Ireland ended on 3 September 1821, and he had
						then proceeded to Hanover, of which British sovereigns were also rulers, on 27 September, not returning until 8
						November 1821.</note> It is that connection to which they look for strength.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> will have a paper upon
