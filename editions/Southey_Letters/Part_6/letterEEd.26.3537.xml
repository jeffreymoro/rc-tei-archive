                     with Respect to the Opportunities they Offer for the Encouragement of Painting</title> (1818) appeared in <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 23 (July 1820), 549–591, published on 5 October 1820. When Southey first submitted it, Gifford asked Southey to
                  rewrite it to make it longer and he then made considerable alterations to the second draft before it was published; see Southey to
                  John Murray, 19 October 1819, Letter 3368, and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 8 October [1820], Letter 3535.</note> I had

               gaining thereby this advantage at least, that those persons who should be impressed by the facts stated, or the arguments adduced in
               the earlier part of the essay, would be disposed to agree with the writer throughout, &amp; thus follow him with willing minds to the
               end.</p><p rend="indent1"> The press has great power for producing immediate evil, – much less for bringing about any immediate good. But tho
               truth &amp; good principles make their way slowly, they are sure to make it at last. And I have no doubt that whenever the Government
               finds itself at ease concerning the revenue the Arts will feel the benefit. The disposition is not wanting.</p><p rend="indent1"> You have great subjects in hand, – &amp; if any man can be equal to them – you are.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Haydon had embarked on a series of biblical and classical subjects.
