        <p rend="indent1"> At last I hope there appears to be an end to the anxiety in which one
               thing after another has kept me with little intermission for more than two months. I
               cannot say that either <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">child</ref> or <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">mother</ref> are well; but both are materially better. The little
               one has been very ill with a spasmodic cough, the probability of an abscess is over,
               for the tumour is diminishing, as soon as it began to appear, one of the breasts was
               affected, &#8211; &amp; that complaint also after some ten days fomentation seems to be
               going away. &#8211; All this tried my spirits severely, &#8211; &amp; they are now pretty much
               like my ways &amp; means, that is, they reach out with good husbandry, but are very
               unequal to any extraordinary demand upon them. &#8211; But of this you may always rest
               assured, that when I make most progress at my desk I am in best health both of body
               &amp; mind. Nothing exhilarates me so much as a good days work at those employments
               by which no passion is excited.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your stewardship. When you receive the next quarter
               send me the balance &#8211; for I shall need it as soon as it can be had. It will be very
               inconvenient for me if <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> does not give place in his next number (that is the one after that
               which is now due) to my sepulchral paper.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s article was published as he hoped: &#8216;Cemeteries and Catacombs of
                  Paris&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (April 1819), 359&#8211;398.</note> I am
               overdrawing upon the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmen</ref> at present, &#8211; which however I may very well do, &amp; feel no
               reluctance at doing. Wesley &amp; the Tale of Paraguay (when I set to in earnest to
               compleat that poem) will presently turn the scale.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress
                     of Methodism</title> (1820) and <title>A Tale of Paraguay</title>
                  (1825).</note> But I can neither stir from home, nor do anything else (except by
               fits of relief) till the Brazil is finished, &#8211; &amp; surely never did any task so
               grow under the workmans hands.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s

               that it was utterly impossible to estimate the extent <del>of the work</del>, because
               there existed no previous work by which I could measure my scale, &amp;
                  <del>discover</del> &lt;see&gt; what lay before me. It was travelling in an undiscovered
               country. The historical part is finished, &amp; I am half way thro the concluding
               chapter, &#8211; which gives a view of Brazil as it was in 1808, &#8211; a tremendous chapter
               both in length &amp; labour.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 44,

               compleated, that there does not exist in this or in any other language, so full an
               account of any country from the earliest times &#8211; of its rise, progress, <del>state of
                  its manners &amp; civilization</del>, geography, the manners of its aborigines, &#8211;
                  <del>th</del> &amp; its actual state at the point of time when the writer
               concludes, &#8211; as I <del>have</del> shall have prepared of Brazil; &#8211; a country of which

               Britain, &amp; is in a fair way of becoming the greatest country of the New World, &#8211;
               having I think <del>x</del> as much to hope as Yankee-<del>Xxxxxxx</del> &lt;Land&gt; &#8211;
               &amp; less to fear. &#8211; There is yet a months work more, tho 706 pages are
                  printed.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey dated the completion

I saw his two children in the Exhibition<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Chantrey&#8217;s famous &#8216;The Sleeping Children&#8217;,
                  exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817 and now in Lichfield Cathedral, was a
                  sensation. Antonio Canova&#8217;s (1757&#8211;1822) statues, &#8216;Hebe&#8217; (now at Chatsworth House,
                  Derbyshire) and &#8216;Terpsichore&#8217; (Cleveland Museum of Art), were well-received by
                  critics, but did not attract as much attention. Southey probably saw these works
                  on his visit to London in May 1817.</note> &amp; preferred them to the works of
               Canova in the same room.</p>
