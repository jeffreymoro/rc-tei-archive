        <p rend="indent1"> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Neale speaking of Constantinople says &#8216;Consumptions are not infrequent; &amp; generally they are
               as fatal as elsewhere; altho the Turks have a popular remedy, which in some instances I have observed to be beneficial, namely a few
               grains of pitch, made into pills, &amp; administered several times a day. A similar mode of cure has I understand, been long employed
               by the Scottish peasantry. The decoction of the sprouts of the young pine has been strongly recommended by the late D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Porterfield<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Porterfield (c. 1696&#8211;1771), Scottish physician.</note> of Eden,
               who is said to have been very succesful in the exhibition of this simple medicine. Oriental nations have at all times put great faith
               in the juices of terebinthate &amp; balsamic shrubs. The balsam of Mecca or Gilead<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A resin
                  extracted from the tree <title>Commiphora gileadensis</title> and used as a perfume and a drug.</note> is still considered by the
               Turks as a sort of panacea in stomachic &amp; chronic visceral affections: the difficulty of obtaining it pure &amp; unadulterated &#8211;
               &amp; its high price &#8211; are perhaps the real reasons why, like other vaunted remedies, it still maintains so high a reputation.&#8217;</p>

               paragraph appeared saying so many pressing letters had been addressed to him, that tho a sum of money would have been most highly
               useful to him, he could not <del>with</del> conscienciously delay the publication of a remedy for want of which so many of his fellow
