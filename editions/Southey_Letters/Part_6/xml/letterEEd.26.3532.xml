               When I set about the work in earnest, perhaps he will lend it me, if he has it, &amp;
               if I cannot obtain it by any other means. This will be some time first, for till I
               have cleared some engagements of greater pecuniary import, I shall only indulge
               myself now &amp; then in making notes for this, &amp; perhaps composing the
               introductory chapter, which will be a view of the progress of Sectarianism in
               England, from the time of the Lollards till G Fox.</p>

                  his Cabinet into preparing a Bill of Pains and Penalties to dissolve the marriage
                  and deprive her of the title of Queen. She rejected compromise terms offered by
                  the Cabinet and arrived in England on 5 June 1820. The House of Lords began to
                  debate the Bill on 17 August and what was effectively a trial of Caroline for
                  adultery continued until 10 November. One of the Queen&#8217;s counsels was Stephen
                  Lushington (1782&#8211;1873; <title>DNB</title>), Whig MP for various seats 1806&#8211;1841,

               Gloss with liberal interpretation declares that a woman is not to be called meretrix
