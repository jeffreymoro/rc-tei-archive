                     <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821). Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 3 February 1821, Letter 3625, contained two
                  versions, of which the least controversial was used, omitting such advice as: ‘adequate remedy should be applied to that intolerable
                  licentiousness of the press … either by the vigorous application of existing laws or by the enactment of such new ones as the
                  suspension of the abuse may render necessary’. The third version, mentioned here to Henry Herbert Southey, was Bedford’s own
                  composition.</note> agrees very well with my own, – &amp; the first should without hesitation have been sent to the press if the
               work had not been one which was published <hi rend="ital">ex officio</hi>. But I felt that tho RS. may be perfectly qualified to offer
               advice to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">his Majesty</ref>, &amp; is as ready to do it as Alderman Wood<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet (1768–1843; <title>DNB</title>), MP for the City of London 1817–1843
                  and Lord Mayor of London 1815–1817. He was a well-known Whig and supporter of George IV’s estranged wife, Queen Caroline (1768–1821;
                     <title>DNB</title>).</note> himself, or any other member of the Common Council, – it does not fall quite so clearly within the
               limits of the P.L’s duties. Upon this point I desired <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to ask
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries’s</ref> opinion, – he being so much an official man as to know in what
               manner such <del>xxx</del> a thing was likely to be taken, – &amp; as you know, a man of good sense. If he felt an impropriety when I
               suspected one, his opinion would decide me upon a question which I cared very little about. Upon his decision I took out all that was
               useful, &amp; left the complementary part, <del>&amp; a xx which was</del> &lt;much&gt; the worse for the separation. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> will by this time have seen that his performance was not very graciously

               sits down to composition he has a fine talent for bad writing. So the second is to stand. – You wonder why I <del>xxx</del> let other
                  <del>xxx</del> people act for me. I like to let them please themselves by taking into their serious consideration matters which to
               me are of no consideration whatever. Upon matters of consequence, or to which any real interest is attached, you will find me always

               There are men in the world (&amp; they are perhaps the majority) who would be more likely to serve you for a trifling gratification of
