							<title>The Legend of St Loy, with Other Poems</title> (1820).</note> which having lain about ten days at <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Messrs. Longmans’</ref>, performed its journey to Cumberland by the
					waggon, subject, moreover, to sundry delays by change of conveyance on the way.</p><p rend="indent1"> I thank you for the volume, and for the honourable manner in which you have mentioned me
						therein.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>The Legend of St Loy, with Other Poems</title> (London,
						1820) was dedicated to the memory of Henry Kirke White and concluded with a ‘Sonnet to Robert Southey, Esq. Poet
						Laureate’ (p. 223). The latter lauded Southey as a ‘Prolific Mind – spontaneous Muse – bright Star,/ In the pure
						Heaven of Verse benign and clear!/ Friend of the Dead! who pierced each scattered scroll,/ Preserving to all time
						the Poet’s name,/ Of that young, resolute, weak, yet ardent soul,/ Which burnt out its own fire, and went in
						flame/ To be renewed above the dulcet pole –/ Friend of the Dead! – and this shall be thy fame.’</note> On such
					occasions as this it is a painful task to reply to an author, if a mere acknowledgement of thanks, couched in the
					language of common courtesy, is all that I can offer, consistently with truth. But it becomes a very gratifying
					one, when I can with perfect sincerity give commendation and encouragement. Your legend,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The title poem of Heraud’s volume, ‘The Legend of St. Loy’ (pp. 3–167). </note> though crude in the
					plan and faulty in composition, as so juvenile a production needs must be, contains the strongest and most
					unequivocal proofs, not of poetical feeling alone (which may exist without genius), but of genius also. The
					interest which this alone would have excited concerning you, is much increased by what I gather of your history
					from some of the smaller poems, and by the tone of moral principle which everywhere prevails. And when I came to
					your assertion that no duty has ever been neglected by you for the pursuit of poetry,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In ‘On Attaining the Age of Twenty-One’, Heraud had challenged ‘Malice’ self to make appear,/ I have
						neglected aught of man’s concerns,/ Where man had claim upon me’, <title>The Legend of St Loy, with Other
							Poems</title> (London, 1820), p. 211.</note> the main apprehension which I should otherwise have felt for your
					success in life was removed. Time enough may be found for business and for literature – even by those whose
					employments are most laborious. I could give you examples of this, but happily you stand in no need of admonition
					on this score.</p><p rend="indent1"> Respecting your progress in poetry, and the course of reading by which your mind is to be
					enriched and strengthened, it is probably in my power to offer you some useful advice, and perhaps to direct you
					into a shorter and safer path than you would find for yourself. But I must know more of your circumstances, and
					schemes, and hopes. Write to me, therefore, as fully as you may feel inclined. Though with more employments than
					you or any person would suppose, I will yet find time to advise you faithfully and frankly. – Meantime, believe me
					to be truly your well-wisher,</p><closer><signed rend="indent2">ROBERT SOUTHEY.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
