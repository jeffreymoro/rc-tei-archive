        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry you have thought <del>it</del> proper to conceal your name
                  <del>from me</del>, because it would have been a pleasure to me to know to whom I
               am indebted to for a letter so complimentary, &amp; in other respects so judicious.
               Since my intention of writing the Life of George Fox<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">George Fox (1624&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>), founder of
                  Quakerism. Southey did not write his biography.</note> &amp; the Rise &amp;
               Progress of Quakerism has gone forth, I have received many letters from members of
               the Society, the general tendency <del>of which</del> has been to express an
               apprehension that I should <del>judge</del> &lt;speak&gt; harshly &lt;or unfavourably&gt; of
               their founders, &#8211; <del>&amp;</del> a wish that I should judge of these<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Initially &#8216;their&#8217;.</note>
          <del>temper</del> &lt;persons&gt; rather by the principles &amp; conduct of their
               descendents than by their own writings, &#8211; &amp; some thing like a fear lest certain
               parts of their history should be brought into the light. But upon the only points
               where they have reason to fear the light none of these letters have touched, &#8211; that
               is, upon the question of the doctrines which the<del>y</del> &lt;primitive Quakers&gt;
                  <del>originally</del> advanced, &amp; upon the suppression of certain passages in
               some of their <del>printed</del> works, which materially affected the pretensions of
               the writer.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to the first of these <del>questions</del> &lt;points&gt; I
               believe that George Fox very often did not know what he meant, &amp; that, as is
               often the case with mystic &amp; enthusiastic writers, so with him &amp; many of his
               early disciples their expressions are not to be taken in the sense which
                  <del>their</del> &lt;the&gt; literal interpretation warrants, but in the no-sense from
               which they proceeded. They were blasphemers by chance-medley, &amp; not by design. &#8211;
               This is my present impression. Of course it is impossible to <del>say</del> &lt;tell&gt;
               how far farther investigation may lead me to alter or modify it, for as yet, tho well
               acquainted with the history of the Society, I am only on the threshold of my
               work.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The second <del>question</del> &lt;point&gt; involves a charge against
               which I can see no such reasonable defence. What the suppressions are which have been
               made in <del>the re-impressions of</del> G Fox&#8217;s writings, I have not yet had the
               means of ascertaining. A very important one in those of Edward Burroughs has been
               pointed out by their old enemy Francis Bugg.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Burrough (1634&#8211;1663; <title>DNB</title>) was an early English Quaker
                  and writer. Francis Bugg (1640&#8211;1727; <title>DNB</title>) was a Quaker from
                  Mildenhall, Suffolk, who left the Society and became an anti-Quaker polemicist.
                  Bugg&#8217;s <title>Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress from Quakerism to Christianity</title> (London,
                  1700), pp. 74&#8211;77, no. 393 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, pointed out
                  that Burrough&#8217;s <title>A Trumpet of the Lord Sounded out of Sion</title> (1656)
                  had been substantially altered in its second edition of 1672, particularly by
                  omitting Burrough&#8217;s &#8216;Prophecy to the Cavaliers&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The truth seems to be that the Quakers are as much hampered by the
               infallibility of their <del>Church</del> &lt;Teachers&gt;, as the Romanists; &amp; that
               &lt;like&gt; some of the Monastic Orders they would be very glad if the history of their
               Founder could be buried in oblivion. If the secrets of the heart were known perhaps
                  <del>any</del> many of them would be found to respect him less than I do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for the offer of your books. Bennetts name I was
               unacquainted with, &#8211; you have therefore rendered me a service by mentioning it.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">This may refer to Edward Burrough,
                     <title>Answers to Severall Queries put Forth to the Despised People called
                     Quakers, by Phillip Bennett</title> (1654), which led some commentators to
                  believe Bennett (dates unknown) had written an anti-Quaker book, to which Burrough
                  was replying.</note> &amp; I shall <del>endeavour</del> &lt;no doubt easily be able&gt;
               to obtain his <del>book</del> &lt;work&gt;. For the rest, I can only say that I
                  <del>may</del> wish you may be as well satisfied with my history in other
               respects, as you will be with its perfect fairness. Upon this point I know myself,
               &amp; I have a well-grounded hope that such a work written with <del>xxxxtions</del>
               intentions which cannot be mistaken, will produce some good.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have replied to you with more frankness than an anonymous
               correspondent is entitled to expect. But your letter indicates <del>more</del> &lt;a

               object of his life to deserve.</p>
