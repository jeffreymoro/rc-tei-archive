        <p rend="indent1"> I need not, &amp; indeed cannot say how much I feel the true kindness of your letter. It so happens however that I
               stand in no need of the assistance which you offer, &amp; that my arrangements could not be altered without inconvenience to others as
               well as myself. Two months, if there be no interruption to my steady course, will <del>provide</del> provide ways &amp; means for the
               next half year, &amp; discharge my engagements both with <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murraylemagne</ref>, &amp; with
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Our Fathers which are in the Row</ref>. In that time I shall hope to finish

                  (1820).</note> &amp; to compleat two papers for the Q.R. at the price of 100&#163; each.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                  review of William Coxe, <title>Memoirs of John Duke of Marlborough, with his Original Correspondence; Collected from the Family
                     Records at Blenheim, and Other Authentic Sources. Illustrated with Portraits, Maps, and Military Plans</title> (1818&#8211;1819),

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to my own complaint,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was suffering from a rectal prolapse,
                  see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 3 October 1819, Letter 3356.</note> it is certainly <del>xxxxx</del> much less troublesome
               since the winter began, &#8211; I cannot ascribe this to any change of living, or any thing but the bracing effect of the weather, &#8211; if the
               weather can be supposed to brace a man who sits by the fire all day, <del>weather</del> wears a good leathern jerkin to keep the cold
               out, &amp; always has his bed warmed. So however it is, I think I should be disposed to take <del>Edith with</del>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith-May</ref> with me, if I could dispose her to be of the same mind. But she is painfully
               shy, &amp; will not be persuaded to feel that she is old enough to be separated from <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">her mother</ref>. Of course I should over rule this if there appeared any reason for serious uneasiness. But any thing which
               affected her spirits would do her more harm at present, than the probable benefit of the journey would counteract.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have just finished my yearly task-verses,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s duty as Poet Laureate was
                  to produce a New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1820; this was later published as &#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode I&#8217; in <title>The Englishman&#8217;s Library:
                     Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National Information</title> (London, 1824), pp. 381&#8211;383.</note> &amp; sent
               them off. These things which I regard merely as impositions, &amp; which I have succeeded in keeping from the newspapers, (which is
               doing all I can to prepare the way for the abolition of a foolish custom) &#8211; are fit only to be befiddled,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s odes were sent to William Shield, the Master of the King&#8217;s Music, so he could set some of their verses to
                  music. Traditionally, these settings were performed at court, but the practice had been suspended since 1810.</note> tho they cost
               me more time than they are worth. In the present case there seems a chance that I may lose my labour, by being beforehand with it. For
               if the King dies<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>)
                  died on 29 January 1820. Southey responded with <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> what I have done will not do for
               the fiddlers ears, &#8211; &amp; something more will be required. My thoughts therefore are taking this direction. &#8211; &amp; the plan is
               already so far shaped, that I am more in doubt just now as to the metre, &#8211; the mold in which the ore is to be cast, than about any
               thing else. My scheme extends to something rather longer than the Carmen Nuptiale,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title> (1816), written on the occasion of the marriage of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WalesCharlottePrincess">Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales</ref>. This ran to 77 pages, only two pages
                  shorter than <title>A Vision Judgement</title> (1821), even though the <title>Vision</title> was bolstered by 32 pages of &#8216;Notes&#8217;
                  and &#8216;Specimens&#8217;, compared to <title>The Lay of the Laureate</title>&#8217;s modest five pages of &#8216;Notes&#8217;.</note> &#8211; but the manner of the
               fiction <del>would be</del> rather that of Dante than of Spenser<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The proposed model for <title>A
                     Vision of Judgement</title> (1821) was Dante Alighieri (c. 1265&#8211;1321), <title>Divine Comedy</title> (1308&#8211;1321), rather than
                  Edmund Spenser (c. 1552&#8211;1599; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Faerie Queene</title> (1590&#8211;1596). Spenser had influenced some of
                  Southey&#8217;s earlier Laureate compositions, notably <title>The Lay of the Laureate</title> (1816).</note> &#8211; the tone however will in a
               great degree depend upon the metre which I may chuse, &#8211; &amp; I hesitate between blank verse, &#8211; the measure of Thalaba,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801), which used irregular, unrhymed verse

               &amp; a more elastic movement, &#8211; the third would have all the advantages &amp; disadvantages of perfect novelty &#8211; which are pretty
               equally balanced. It would excite notice, &amp; ridicule, &#8211; it would <del>draw in</del> &lt;invite&gt; attacks, &amp; &lt;it would&gt; make
               partizans, &#8211; the great advantage is in the freshness of phraseology which it would necessarily produce, the cadence being so different
               from that of any other measure. As for its practicability in English, I know that it is manageable, &amp; that I can manage it. So I
               incline to make this my choice.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821) was written in

               would have been better to have gone farther with regard to the press, &amp; half-measures meet with the same opposition as whole ones.
