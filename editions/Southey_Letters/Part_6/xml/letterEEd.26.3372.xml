        <p rend="indent1"> I am really glad to see your handwriting once more, after so long an interval, &#8211; for I was begining to fear some
               mishap</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The history of the Address (no doubt the one which you have seen in the M Chronicle)<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Following the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre of 16 August 1819, Whigs in Cumberland organised a County Meeting on 13 October
                  1819 to protest at the local authorities&#8217; actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew up a conservative response
                  &#8211; an Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the press. The Address was circulated by Lord
                  Lonsdale and a copy was leaked to the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 23 October 1819. However, the <title>Chronicle</title>
                  correctly reported that &#8216;several of the most respectable of the LOWTHER party have refused to sign the Loyal Address, and cry out
                  against it as <hi rend="ital">ultra</hi>&#8217;. The Address was not proceeded with and government supporters in Cumberland produced a
                  more moderate document.</note> &#8211; is somewhat curious, &amp; would furnish no bad topic for that amiable newspaper, if it knew all.
               The story is briefly this. James Brougham<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">James Brougham (1780&#8211;1833), younger brother of Henry
                  Brougham and one of the main organisers of the Whig cause in the Lake District.</note> wrote to <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref> to join in the Requisition for a meeting to censure the <hi rend="ital">Massacre</hi> at Manchester &amp;c. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calvert</ref> not only refused to act with
               his old party on this occasion, but came to me, <del>reqxxxtxxx</del> expressed his desire that some counter-declaration might be set
               on foot, &amp; in short asked me to draw up an Address, &#8211; I did so, &amp; sent it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref>. Lord L. rode over the next day, called on <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">C.</ref> brought him on to me, &amp; suggested some
               alterations, which were of course made. He then had the Address printed &amp; circulated. This was at the end of the week. <del>X</del>
               On Tuesday he called <del>xx</del> on me again, on his way to Whitehaven, &amp; asked me to spend a day or two with him there, &#8211; as he
               had been disappointed of seeing me at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Lowtherestate">Lowther</ref> when P Leopold was there.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>),
                  widower of Princess Charlotte, had visited Lord Lonsdale at Lowther Castle 25&#8211;28 September 1819; he met &#8216;a numerous party of the
                  gentry in the neighbourhood&#8217; and received the Freedom of the Borough of Appleby, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 2 October
                  1819.</note> So I promised to go the next day, &#8211; for I had never been to Whitehaven,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Whitehaven Castle, a mansion owned by William Lowther, Earl of Lonsdale. </note> &amp; was glad of the opportunity of seeing it,
               while discharging a visit which had long been due. But on the Wednesday morning came a letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord L.</ref> inclosing one from Wallace,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Wallace
                  (1768&#8211;1844; <title>DNB</title>), MP for various seats 1790&#8211;1828, including Cockermouth 1813&#8211;1818, member of the Board of Control
                  1807&#8211;1816, Vice-President of the Board of Trade 1818&#8211;1823, created 1st Baron Wallace 1828. He had inherited Carleton Hall, near
                  Penrith.</note> &#8211; a wordy epistle, objecting to the Address as too strong. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord
                  L</ref> said he could not act in opposition to the opinion of the only gentleman in the county who was connected with
               Administration, &amp; had therefore withdrawn mine, &#8211; but he should see me in the course of the day. I went over accordingly, &amp;
               found that Wallace had produced an Address himself, which was substituted for mine.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 29 October 1819. The new Address was notably circumspect in its reference to events at
                  &#8216;Peterloo&#8217;.</note> You know me well enough to know that this was a matter of perfect indifference to me &#8211; so the thing was done I
               cared not who did it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord L.</ref> however had the disagreable task of calling
               together more than fifty persons who had already signed the first paper &amp; making a speech to them about the propriety of exchanging
               it for another in more guarded language. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord L.</ref> is a very sensible man, &#8211;
               &amp; one of the most obliging of men. Wallace is a pompous fellow, &#8211; always swelling like the frog in the fable,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The fable of the &#8216;Frog and the Ox&#8217;, in which the frog tries to inflate himself to the size of the ox,
                  from Phaedrus (fl. 1st Century AD), <title>Fabulae Aesopiae</title>.</note> &amp; affecting to give himself an appearance of
               consequence by means which are quite farcical. It is certain that some few persons besides himself objected to the wording of my
               Address, &#8211; (observe, no one knew it to be mine except <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord L.</ref>) &#8211; but it would
               have passed had it not been for him; &#8211; his vanity was wounded, &#8211; &amp; he <del>forgot the</del> did not stop to recollect that even if
               the first paper <del>were in</del> &lt;had been in&gt; some points objectionable, it was better to retain it, than give the enemy an
               advantage, by withdrawing what had been once put forth. &#8211; But the truth is that I had stated nothing more than what is borne out by
               notorious facts, published in all the newspapers. And so far is the manner of stating it from being objectionable, &#8211; that while I was
               at Whitehaven &#8211; there came a letter from Becket<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Beckett (1775&#8211;1847), Under-Secretary of
                  State for Home Affairs 1806&#8211;1817, Judge Advocate-General 1817&#8211;1827, 1828&#8211;1830, 1834&#8211;1835.</note> saying that it had been shown to

               &amp; saying he had good reason to think it would be most graciously received by <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Prince</ref>, &#8211; &amp; lastly <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord L.</ref> has sent me a second note from
               Becket, saying that this unlucky address is thought to be the best which has yet appeared. The end of all this will be that the
               mob-journals in this country will harp upon the subject, till parliament or an insurrection in the meantime afford them a fresher
               topic: That I shall get plentifully bespattered with abuse, if my part in the business transpires, (as I dare say it will,) &#8211; that
               Wallace will undergo some quizzing in London from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord L&#8217;s</ref> friends, for having
               set aside a paper which had at least the merit of attracting notice, to substitute a lathery composition of his own, &#8211; &amp; that all
               this signifies nothing, hurts nobody, &amp; will presently be forgotten. &#8211; I should tell you that while I was at Whitehaven a handbill
               in abuse of the first Address was circulated, &#8211; &amp; that by <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord L&#8217;s</ref> desire I
               took advantage of this handbill to vindicate <del>the address</del> &lt;it&gt;. What I wrote was to appear in the Cumberland Packet of
               yesterday under the signature of A.B. &#8211; if I had the paper I would send it to you, &#8211; for it has some good things.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to the Editor of the <title>Cumberland Packet</title>, [before 26 October 1819], Letter
