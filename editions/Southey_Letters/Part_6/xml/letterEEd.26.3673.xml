        <p rend="indent1"> To my great surprize I have lately met with proof positive that Siphilis was known by its French
					name as the prevailing pest of the age, before the discovery of America, &amp; that it had taken the Greek
					Professor at Salamanca by the nose, four years before Columbus sailed on his first voyage.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Arias Barbosa (c. 1465/70&#8211;1540), Portuguese scholar and Professor of Greek at the University of
						Salamanca 1495&#8211;1530. Christopher Columbus (1450/1&#8211;1506), Italian explorer, was commissioned by the Spanish crown
						to sail west across the Atlantic in 1492; he discovered America rather than Asia. Southey had been collecting information that seemed to disprove the view that syphilis had an American origin; see Robert Southey to Herbert Hill, 8 April 1821, Letter 3666.</note> &#8211; It is quite
					unaccountable how the passage which states this should have escaped notice, &amp; yet if it had been noticed, the
					controversy upon that subject must have been <del>xxx</del> decided. I found it in the Epistles of Peter Martyr (of
						Angleria)<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Martyr d&#8217;Anghiera (1457&#8211;1526), <title>Opus
							Epistolarum</title> (Amsterdam, 1670), p. 34, no. 1902 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; one

							<title>DNB</title>), <title>History of America</title> (1788), no. 2456 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
						library. <title>Opus Epistolarum</title> (1670) is listed in the book&#8217;s &#8216;Catalogue of Spanish books and
						Manuscripts&#8217;. Southey was habitually dismissive of Robertson&#8217;s work.</note> of which he made little or no use, referring to them only, instead of reading them. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do you know that <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref> has recommended
					me for execution,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a reference to the following passage by Cobbett:
						&#8216;When my two-penny trash was ringing throughout the nation, in spite of Stewart, Walter, William Gifford and
						Southey, these ruffians called for <hi rend="ital">dungeons</hi> to answer me with. Are not daggers <hi rend="ital">as good logic</hi> as dungeons? Aye, and more manly logic too, because the use of them exposes the
						killers to danger; whereas the dungeon-logicians entrench themselves safely behind an army&#8217;, <title>Cobbett&#8217;s
							Political Register</title>, 35 (4 September 1819), 92.</note> &#8211; as one of the first acts of the Radical
					Government? </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As a set off to this, certain Journeymen who propose to better their own condition by adopting
					the practicable part of Owens plan quote a stanza in their Report from one of my Odes, as &#8216;worthy to be written in
						diamonds.&#8221;!<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Report of the Committee appointed at a Meeting of
							Journeymen, Chiefly Printers, to Take into Consideration Certain Propositions, Submitted to them by Mr George
							Mudie, Having for their Object a System of Social Arrangement, Calculated to Effect Essential Improvements in the

						&#8216;Ode, Written in December, 1814&#8217;, published in <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp. 235. The
						Report was based on plans put forward by the journalist George Mudie (b. 1788) to form a community exemplifying
						the principles of Robert Owen (1771&#8211;1858; <title>DNB</title>), manager and owner of the mills and model community
