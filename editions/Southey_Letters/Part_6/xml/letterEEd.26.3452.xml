					Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have for some time been hoping that the course of your affairs would bring you to the North,
					&amp; more than once upon hearing a ring at the door, have indulged the thought that perhaps it might be D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bell. &#8211; The bell, you know, is seldom disturbed at this season of the year: during the summer
					&amp; autumn it is not suffered to rust for want of action. &#8211; However I shall see you ere long. In about four
					weeks, if the printer<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Andrew Strahan (1749&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>), MP for
						various constituencies 1796&#8211;1820 and printer of Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of
							Methodism</title> (1820).</note> pleases. I intend to leave home on my way to London; halting in Montgomeryshire
					for a few days, if <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Charles Wynn</ref> be in the country at that
					time, &amp; also at Ludlow, &#8211; then straight to town, &#8211; in or near which I shall continue about two months, engaged
					in hard work &amp; hard visiting. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Did I tell you that during my Scotch tour I saw an excellent man, who was your contemporary, at
						S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Andrews, &amp; would be delighted to renew his acquaintance with you, if anything should
					take you to Perth? His name is D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wood.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">James Wood (d.
						1825), of Keithick, Perthshire. Southey had visited him on 24 August 1819, <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in
							1819</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (London, 1929), pp. 49&#8211;51.</note> An old friend of mine has married his
						niece,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Collins (c. 1777&#8211;1841), Captain in the 21st Light Dragoons
						and brother of Southey&#8217;s friend from Westminster School, Charles Collins, had married Dr Wood&#8217;s niece, Margaret
						Wood (d. 1852), in 1810.</note> &amp; transplanted himself from <ref type="m" target="places.html#MaizeHill">Maize
						Hill, Greenwich</ref>, into Perthshire in consequence. One of their sons,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified. Andrew Bell&#8217;s &#8216;native city&#8217; was St Andrews, but it is not clear which school is being referred to
						here. The two long-established institutions were the Grammar School (which Bell had attended) and the &#8216;English&#8217;
						School (because instruction was in English rather than Latin). The latter had adopted Bell&#8217;s monitorial system.
						There were, however, also a number of other, less prestigious, schools in St Andrews that used this system.</note>
					who is very backward in consequence of ill health, is at that school in your native city of which I have heard you
					speak with so much pleasure, &#8211; &amp; these good people are perfectly delighted with the progress which he has made
					under your system. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We have lost poor good <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
						Wilson</ref>, in her seventy eighth year. She was struck down by a paralytic seizure, &amp; lay senseless till the
					eighth day. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> And now let me give you some tidings of myself. Lord Somervilles<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; DNB), agricultural reformer and Southey&#8217;s
						third cousin. His death gave Southey some hope of inheriting Somerville&#8217;s estates at Fitzhead in Somerset.</note>
					death gives me some reason to expect a &#8211; lawsuit, in the hope of recovering his estates in Somersetshire, worth
					about a thousand a year. They were bequeathed to him &amp; his issue by his mothers Uncle, a certain John Cannon
						Southey:<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cannon Southey (d. 1768), uncle of Lord Somerville&#8217;s mother,
						Elizabeth Cannon Lethbridge (d. 1765).</note> &#8211; he has died without issue, &amp; I am the testators heir at law.
					But Lord Somerville sold part of the estates &amp; has willed away the rest, &#8211; all sorts of legal niceties are
					involved, &amp; whether either in law or equity I may ever receive what in justice ought to be mine, is a doubtful
					matter, concerning which I am now taking advice. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am waiting at home till the printer compleats my life of Wesley, long-lookd for, but finished
					at last, as far as I am concerned. To the various attacks which it will draw upon me, I shall make no reply, nor
					take any other notice of them, if they fall in my way, than that of silently correcting any errors if they point
					out any, into which I may have fallen. The printer is about a dozen sheets behind <del>xx</del> me. &amp; this will
					give me time to clear off some other matters, &#8211; among others a poem upon the Kings death.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was writing <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821) on the death of George III
						(1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>).</note> You will readily believe that I should
					never voluntarily write upon subjects of this kind which raise expectations that cannot be answered, &amp; at which
					moreover every body is trying his strength.</p>
