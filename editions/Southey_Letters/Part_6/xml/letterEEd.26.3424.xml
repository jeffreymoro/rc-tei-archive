        <p rend="indent1"> Of all frail things the life of an infant is the frailest, &#8211; &amp; it
               seems to be ascertained by observation that the more intellectualized the race in the
               human species, (as the more acutely sensitive among brutes) the less chance has the
               individual for being reared. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">This godson of
               yours</ref> makes me more continually anxious than I ought to be, &#8211;
               for that anxiety can do him no good, &amp; certainly does me none. He is now just
               eleven months old, &amp; being as you may suppose a sort of pet &amp; play thing for
               every body, has been brought more forward than I could have wished, or would have
               permitted if I could have prevented it; &#8211; better would it have been to have left him
               to his mere animal functions as far as possible. The consequence is that he is far
               more forward in intellect than any of my other children have been at the same age:
               &amp; this is by no means desirable. He is very subject to bilious affections &#8211;
               nothing worse as yet, &#8211; but these come frequently, &amp; when they begin there is no
               knowing how they may end. But enough of this.</p>
