        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your parcel, which has reached me this afternoon. The last portion of
						Marlborough<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of William Coxe, <title>Memoirs of John Duke
							of Marlborough, with his Original Correspondence; Collected from the Family Records at Blenheim, and Other
							Authentic Sources. Illustrated with Portraits, Maps, and Military Plans</title> (1818&#8211;1819), <title>Quarterly
							Review</title>, 23 (May 1820), 1&#8211;73.</note> should have reached you in the middle of last week. &#8211; You mention
						Burchardt<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Swiss traveller and orientalist, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt
						(1784&#8211;1817). Murray had published his <title>Travels in Nubia</title> (1819) on behalf of the Association for
						Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa.</note> in your note, but it is not in the parcel.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have made a good beginning of a little book upon the dangers of the times &amp; the prospects
					of society, &#8211; &amp; as my thoughts would not have been so much occupied upon this subject, if they had not been
					directed that way by the Q. R. you have a right to the publication.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829), published by
						Murray.</note> The form upon which I have fixed is that of a dialogue between the author &amp; the spirit of Sir
					Thomas More,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Thomas More (1478&#8211;1535; <title>DNB</title>), Lord
						Chancellor 1529&#8211;1532 and opponent of the Reformation.</note> &#8211; or rather a series of dialogues, in which a
					parallel between the present age &amp; that of the Reformation is drawn, as two grand climactericks of society.
					Under this form I can advance more than I should chuse to make myself responsible for, without occasion. I shall
					bring together <del>a great</del> some curious historical matter, &amp; relieve the subject by interspersing a few
					pieces of poetry, (as Boethius has done, from whom indeed the conception of the book was taken)<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s model was Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (c. 480&#8211;525), <title>De
							Consolatione Philosophiae</title>, a dialogue between the author and the character of Lady Philosophy, consisting
						of both prose and verse.</note> &amp; by some local descriptions so managed as to be introductory of the dialogue.
					And it may be worth while to give the volume an attractive appearance by a few views, which <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Westall</ref> may make when he comes next into this
						country.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir Thomas More</title> (1829) contained a frontispiece of
						More and six engravings of scenes in the Lake District taken from drawings by Westall.</note> I have very little
					doubt that it will excite considerable attention, &amp; lead many persons into a wholesome train of thought. The
					first dialogue in which the Ghost introduces himself is finished much to my satisfaction;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">An early version of &#8216;Colloquy I&#8217;, <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and
							Prospects of Society</title>, 2 vols (London, 1829), I, pp. [1]&#8211;21. </note> &amp; I shall take great pains with
					the composition of the whole, &#8211; for there is scarcely any form of composition which requires so much care as the
					dialogue. When I come to town, which will be in the course of five or six weeks, I must endeavour to borrow Sir T.
					More&#8217;s works from some <del>blackletter libr</del> collector.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey

						Southey to Richard Heber, 25 November 1820, Letter 3566. Southey later acquired More&#8217;s <title>Opera Latina</title>
						(1565), no. 1918 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> I have only his Utopia,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, no. 2001, indicates that he owned an edition of More&#8217;s

					collected for me have been of the greatest service, &amp; I have also obtained some curious papers connected with
					this subject from the <ref type="m" target="people.html#HowleyWilliam">Bishop of London</ref>. As soon as these two
