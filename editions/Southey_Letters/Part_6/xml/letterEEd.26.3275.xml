               for about a week after I wrote to you, by the application of a roll of blotting paper, dipt in honey &amp; soap, once in 24 hours: how
               much better was this than physicking him would have been! He is now natural in his non-naturals, &amp; thrives prodigiously. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have begun the fourth book of Oliver Newman,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s unfinished epic, set in
                  New England. The completed sections were published after Southey&#8217;s death in <title>Oliver Newman: A New-England Tale (Unfinished):
                     With Other Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1&#8211;90.</note> &amp; am getting very much in earnest with it. &#8211; It was
               tried on <ref type="m" target="people.html#TicknorGeorge">a New Englander</ref> last week, with great success. &#8211; For the first time in
               my life I have taken up a subject which has a local <del>interest</del> &amp; national interest for a people who can read the poem, &#8211;
                  <del>xx</del> that advantage will not be worth one penny to me, in clean lucre<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">If the poem
                  sold well in America, Southey would not receive any royalties, as there were no international copyright agreements at this
                  time.</note> &#8211; (why should I call it filthy?) &#8211; but it will ensure me an inheritance of popularity among the best of the Americans.
               I like what is done, well, &#8211; &amp; what I have in prospect. the interest will be worthy, &#8211; the action diversified, &#8211; the circumstances
               picturesque, &#8211; the situations dramatic, &amp; the characters distinctly conceived. <hi rend="ital">More meo</hi>,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Moreover&#8217;.</note> while my mind has been led into this train of invention by one poem, I have

                  Southey&#8217;s note of 23 March 1819, developing an idea he first jotted down on 11 June 1808, <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John

               important upon this subject is, &#8211; that Guaycurus who keep up their number by making war for the purpose of carrying away children, are
               so well acquainted with the fact in physiology that the action of the infants mouth will occasion a secretion of milk, that they rely
               upon it; &amp; it is common among them for women of more than fifty years &lt;of age&gt; who have ceased from child bearing or never borne a
               child, to suckle these captives, when they are so young as to require the breast. &#8211; The chapter &amp; verse for this you will see in my

          <p rend="indent0">Qu&#230;dam nobilis matrona, Domina Isabella de Sousa dicta, edito masculino f&#230;tu ex prim&#226; partus conceptione, tam gravem
                  in alter&#226; mamill&#226; contraxit infirmitatem, humore superfluo ibidem coagulato, ut medicis omnia exquisita sanitatis remedia
                  tentantibus, omnino cassus fuerat illorum sollicitus labor. Anni jam unius integri spatium decucurrerat in illo medicando ulcere.
                  Atque resolvend&#230; sanici grati&#226; fistula qu&#230;dam plumbea, a medicis et chirurgis fuerat excogitata, longitudinis digitalis, qu&#226; in
                  putrid&#230; carnis hiatum immiss&#226;, interius sanguinis putor foras ut efflueret conabantur. Post aliquot ver&#242; dies ulcere interius
                  serpente, fistula taliter se intrinsecus recondidit, ut medici varia remedia adhibentes non solum non extrahere, sed nec etiam ut
                  appareret efficere poterant ullo modo. Itaque plumbeum illud organum spatio quinque mensium intra pectus ejus latuit. Demum mortali
                  jam periculo occurrere tantum cupientes chirurgi, communi consensu incisionem faciendam esse in mulieris pectore decreverunt. Post
                  illam finalem ab illis jam latam sententiam, grati&#226; visitandi infirmam, vir illustris Joannes de Sousa, socer illius, supervenit, et
                  cognita medicorum deliberatione, &#230;grotantis nurus compatiens, illam verbis fide plenis admonere incepit, ut Beato Gondisalvo
                  Amarantho volo emisso, tamquam c&#339;lesti et probatissimo medico curandam se commendaret. Paruit confestim dictis soceri sui afflicta
                  matrona, ejusque consilio acquiescens, votum vovit D. Gondesalvo, tot&#226;<del>m</del> illam comitante famili&#226;. Et lacrymis deinde
                  obortis, humiles preces pro mortis periculo evadendo, atque sanitate pristin&#226; recuperand&#226; effundere coepit. Quid plura? Eademmet
                  die, cum medici et chirurgi vespertine tempore venientes, emplastrum pectore femineo appositum purificandi humoris caus&#226;
                  extraxissent, fistulam a tanto tempore reconditam, fasciis et linamentis medicinalibus sponte su&#226; adh&#230;rentem invenerunt. Denique ne
                  dubium aliquod suboriretur D Gondisalve meritis hoc factum esse, intra spatium octo tantum dierum perfectissime se sanatam

                     having produced a male baby from her first pregnancy, contracted such a serious indisposition in one breast, superfluous humour
                     having coagulated in that place, that, although all the doctors had tried every obscure remedy to restore her health, their
                     solicitous labour had been completely fruitless. A period of one whole year had now gone by while that sore was being treated.
                     And, in order to restore her health, a lead pipe had been devised by the doctors and surgeons, of a finger&#8217;s length; after
                     inserting this into an opening in the putrid flesh, they were trying to make the putridity of the blood inside flow out. However,
                     after a few days, since the sore was creeping further inside, the pipe buried itself so far in that the doctors, employing
                     various remedies, were unable not only to extract it, but even, as it seemed, to achieve anything by any means. So that lead
                     instrument lay hidden within her breast for a period of five months. At length, the surgeons, who now desired only to relieve the
                     mortal danger, by common agreement decreed that an incision must be made in the woman&#8217;s breast. After that final judgement had
                     already been passed by them, the illustrious man Joannes de Souza, her father-in-law, arrived in order to visit the sick woman,
                     and on learning of the doctors&#8217; deliberation, suffering along with his sick daughter-in-law, he began to advise her, with words
                     full of faith, that she should voluntarily entrust herself to Blessed Gondisalvus Amaranthus, as though to a celestial and most
                     esteemed doctor, to be looked after. At once the afflicted matron obeyed the words of her father-in-law, and acquiescing with his
                     advice, made a vow to D. Gondesalvus, accompanied by her whole family. And then, when tears had sprung up, she began to pour out
                     humble prayers that she might escape the danger of death and recover her former health. Why say more? On that selfsame day, when
                     the doctors and surgeons had come at Vespers time and taken off the plaster that had been placed on the woman&#8217;s breast to cleanse
                     the humour, they found that the pipe, which had been concealed for such a long time, was clinging of its own accord to the
                     bandages and medical linens. Finally, lest there should arise any doubt that D Gondisalvus did this by his merits, within the
                     space of just eight days she saw herself most completely healed.&#8217;</note>
