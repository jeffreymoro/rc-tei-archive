        <p rend="indent1"> If I can get a place at Kendal in the night coach, I shall reach Liverpool by eight <del>in
						the</del> on Tuesday morning; but as the coach passes thro Kendal, instead of starting from thence, I cannot
					secure a place. However the chances are much in my favour. From Liverpool I shall take the first conveyance to
					Chester, <del>and may perhaps xxx xxxxx</del> &amp; <del>xxxx</del> get on to Oswestry by the first stage. In case
					of being detained <del>there</del> &lt;at Chester&gt; till the next morning, I <del>xxxxxxx</del> &lt;may&gt; find something at
					the booksellers wherewith to while away the time. But if the hours suit, I will make no delay. When you set off for
					town I can accompany you as far as our road lies in the same line, &#8211; <del>for I</del> probably to Shrewsbury. I
					have to make a visit at Ludlow.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The dirty trick by which Curwen has got in for the County, may possibly lose a vote to his party
					by the issue of the next election at Carlisle;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Christian Curwen
						(1756&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>), Whig MP for Carlisle 1786&#8211;1790, 1791&#8211;1812, 1816&#8211;1820, was elected one of the two
						MPs for Cumberland on 17 March 1820. The &#8216;dirty trick&#8217; was that Curwen was firstly elected for Carlisle, and then
						launched a late campaign in Cumberland, which did not challenge the Tory incumbent, John Lowther (1759&#8211;1844), MP
						for Cumberland 1796&#8211;1831, but instead attacked the moderate and inactive Whig, George Howard, Viscount Morpeth
						(1773&#8211;1848), MP for Morpeth 1795&#8211;1806, MP for Cumberland 1806&#8211;1820. Curwen&#8217;s victory in Cumberland precipitated a
						by-election in Carlisle. Unfortunately for Southey, the seat was not won by a government supporter, but by the
						radical, William James (1791&#8211;1861), MP for Carlisle 1820&#8211;1826, 1831&#8211;1834, MP for East Cumberland 1836&#8211;1847.</note>
					&amp; must I think divide Whig from Radical at the next General Election. &#8211; There is a talk of petitioning that
					some <del>proper</del> person may be appointed to act as High Sheriff in Westmorland during elections, in
					consequence of Lord Thanets conduct.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sackville Tufton, 9th Earl of Thanet
						(1769&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), was the main financial supporter of the Whig cause in Westmorland, where he was
						Hereditary High Sheriff 1786&#8211;1825.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I look with much anxiety, &amp; no little fear, to the meeting of the Cortes.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Spain in January 1820 led to the re-establishment of the liberal
						Constitution of 1812 in March 1820.</note> Had it been convoked without reestablishing the Constitution of the
					Liberales, I should have augured more happily. But that Constitution is full of absurdities, &amp; must lead to
					anarchy. Something worse than the deposition of Ferdinand<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Ferdinand VII
						(1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833).</note>
          <del>are</del> is to be apprehended. Quoad Ferdinand nobody
					would care. But a Jacobine Revolution in Spain would be a tremendous evil. The convulsion would not stop there.
					Germany would feel it, &#8211; &amp; God knows what might happen in France. &#8211; Spain is in a dreadful state. Ferdinand has
					been over thrown less by his own faults, &amp; the spread of popular opinions than by his distresses. If he could
					have paid his troops &amp; his <del>ser</del> civil servants there would have been no opposition to his caprices.
					But the same distress must continue to felt. The Government used to depend mainly for revenues upon S America. Half
					or more of those resources have been cut off, &amp; the people at home have been ruined by war &amp; pestilence. A
					revolutionary Government may &amp; probably will, plunder the Church &amp; the nobles; but this plunder will not
					support it long &amp; will not even afford a supply of <del>xxx</del> money for immediate emergency the French
					having taken care of all that was convertible into bullion.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">During the
						French occupation of Spain in 1808&#8211;1813 a good deal of the country&#8217;s portable wealth had been looted.</note> There
					will be only lands to sell, &#8211; in a country where there is nobody to purchase them.</p>
