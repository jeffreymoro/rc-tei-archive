        <p rend="indent1"> Your grand weather-glass arrived yesterday, &#8211; &amp; great was my dismay upon opening it, at finding that one of the
               tubes was broken. By good fortune it is only the smaller one in which the weight plays, &amp; no inconvenience will result from it, a
               small piece of the main tube also was knocked off upon the journey, but in such a part &amp; so small as not to be material. But more
               care ought certainly to have been taken in securing the inside, &#8211; a little cotton, or tow would have prevented these mishaps. It is
               fixed on the first landing place, opposite the Spanish map of S America, &amp; indicates I hope a change of weather, of which we shall
               be very glad, &#8211; for a bitter East wind is now prevailing.</p>

               her at this time so much concern with a severe cold &amp; cough, <del>that</del> as to make her forget herself. To day there seems to
               be an amendment in him.</p>

                  establishments to research the latest theories and practices in the field. He described his visit to Southey in <title>A Year in
                     Europe: Comprising a Journal of Observations in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Switzerland, the North of Italy, and Holland

                  Girard (1765&#8211;1850), Catholic priest and director of primary schools in Fribourg, Switzerland, 1804&#8211;1823. He was an influential
                  practitioner of Bell&#8217;s system, which was adopted in Fribourg in 1816. His methods attracted criticism for their supposedly
                  irreligious nature, and Girard was eventually deprived of his post.</note> &#8211; but he saw his great patron, &amp; tells me he is
               afraid that the good Father will be driven from Friburg. The people feel the full benefit of his <del>xxxstitu</del> labours, &#8211; but the
               aristocracy oppose <del>xxx</del> him, &#8211; &amp; the Jesuits, who are reestablished there will leave no stone unturned for
                  <del>overthrowing</del> &lt;demolishing&gt; a better system than their own. One of the Magistrates said, pointing to his school, &#8211; behold
