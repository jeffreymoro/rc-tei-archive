                  health of Southey&#8217;s wife, Edith.</note> &#8211; this I believe is certain, but the cause, whatever it may be, seems still to exist in the

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">The infant</ref> has been so ill with a spasmodic cough since

               but still with a cough, &#8211; for which a pitch plaister has been put on. More relief may be expected from change of weather than from
               medicine. At present a severe East wind prevails.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> And thus we go on. It is nearly twelve months since <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has had
               one day of comfortable health. My spirits are the worse for all this, &#8211; &amp; my health not the better. A journey would do me good, &#8211;
               but I know not when I shall be able to leave home with a mind at ease, &#8211; &amp; till I can do that, it is better to remain on the

                  (London, 1819), pp. [iii]&#8211;v.</note> It is a truly original poem. There are one or two lines which might easily have been made
               unexceptionable, &#8211; &amp; seem placed as if to invite mockery. And in one part I think the Poet is hardly serious enough for his
               subject, &#8211; where he is asking <hi rend="ital">what</hi> Peter saw in the water.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

               tears, &#8211; &amp; the Prologue is exquisite in its kind, &#8211; &amp; indeed the whole, &#8211; take it as a whole, what no man but <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> could have written.</p>

                  because my last chapter is a view of Brazil at the time when my history concludes, &#8211; &amp; I believe I shall have the population of
                  every other considerable place.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 44, <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London,
                     1810&#8211;1819), III, pp. 696&#8211;879. Southey described Para at pp. 741&#8211;744, but without giving its population.</note> Therefore it would
                  be desirable to have this also.</p>
