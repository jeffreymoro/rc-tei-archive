               than you deserved?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have more than one reason for writing just now. The first is a sort
               of apprehension that a draft from the Q.R. may have been lost. &#8211; When <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">G.</ref> wrote to say that he

                  (January 1821), 462&#8211;510, published 6 April 1821.</note> till <del>the</del>
               another number, he added that <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">M.</ref> would send me a draft for it at that time, &#8211; &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">M.</ref> himself in a note which I
               received <del>him</del> from him about the same time used some expression which could
               only mean that he meant to send it the next day. It did not come however, &#8211; &amp; I
               raised the wind in another quarter. But as I have not heard either from <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">G.</ref> or <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">M.</ref> since the publication of this
               last number, I really begin to apprehend that it may have been sent three months ago,
               &amp; lost on the way.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Another thing which I have to say is to entreat you to get the <hi rend="ital">proofs</hi> of this last paper for me, which I requested both of the
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Megistos</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">the Castrator</ref> to
               reserve for me.</p>

               Sartor-Major vacated by poor Hydes death,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Hyde (d. 1820) was Southey&#8217;s London tailor.</note> will you order me a black
               coat &amp; waistcoat, &amp; a pair of loose pantaloons, trowsers perhaps they should
               be called, of some serviceable mixture.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have received invitations to dine with the Literary Fund,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royal Literary Fund, established in 1790
                  to aid British writers in financial difficulties. It received a Royal Charter in
                  1818. Much of the charity&#8217;s money came from its annual fundraising dinner, which
                  was held on 10 May 1821. The &#8216;conviviality of the Meeting was sustained with
                  unabated spirit till near midnight&#8217;, <title>Morning Post</title>, 11 May 1821.
                  Southey did not attend.</note> (a society which I do <hi rend="ital">contempt</hi>

                  Benevolent Institution, founded in 1814, assists professional artists in financial
                  difficulties. Their fundraising dinner was on 4 May 1821. Southey did not
                  attend.</note> These compliments were never before paid me. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref> has also paid me a
               complement equally <del>sincer</del> well deserved, &amp; of undoubted sincerity: he

               Reformation, are, as one of the first measures of the new Government, to be &#8211;
                  executed.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a reference to the
                  following passage by Cobbett: &#8216;When my two-penny trash was ringing throughout the
                  nation, in spite of Stewart, Walter, William Gifford and Southey, these ruffians
                  called for <hi rend="ital">dungeons</hi> to answer me with. Are not daggers <hi rend="ital">as good logic</hi> as dungeons? Aye, and more manly logic too,
                  because the use of them exposes the killers to danger; whereas the
                  dungeon-logicians entrench themselves safely behind an army&#8217;, <title>Cobbett&#8217;s
                     Political Register</title>, 35 (4 September 1819), 92.</note> As a curious
