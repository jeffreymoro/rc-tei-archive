					to see you allude to her weak health; &#8211; if however that weakness be the effect of the severe trial she underwent in
					the summer, it is hardly possible that she should yet have thoroughly recovered from such an exhaustion.</p>

					week we had flattered ourselves with the hope of seeing you while he was here. &#8211; Among the few enjoyments to which
					he looks on in winter, that of your wintering in town seems to be one of the greatest.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> was illuminated last night in honour of
						<hi rend="ital">Carolina purissima sin pecado concebida</hi>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Purest
						Caroline, conceived without sin&#8217;; a parody of the prayer of intercession &#8216;Ave Maria&#8217; and thus an ironic comment on
						the moral character of Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of George IV.
						Parts of Keswick were celebrating the withdrawal of the Bill of Pains and Penalties, which had aimed to deprive
						Caroline of the title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King. The decision not to continue with it was
						made after the Third Reading of the Bill in the House of Lords on 10 November 1820, when the government majority
						was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House of Commons.</note> King Mob however
					for once was magnanimous, &amp; offered no violence to those windows which were in darkness.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> I am grieved to hear of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdales</ref>

						(1787&#8211;1872), MP for Cockermouth 1808&#8211;1813 and Westmorland 1813&#8211;1831, 1832&#8211;1841. This would mean Lowther would have
						to vacate his seat in Westmorland and there would be a by-election, which Southey feared would be contested by
						Brougham, who had fought the seat in 1818 and earlier in 1820.</note>
