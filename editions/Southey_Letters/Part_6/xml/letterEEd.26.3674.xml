						catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> reached me, &amp; I thank you for Lord Waldegraves Memoirs &amp; the
					Chinese Volume,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Two recent publications by Murray&#8217;s firm: James, 2nd Earl
						Waldegrave (1715&#8211;1763; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Memoirs, from 1754 to 1758</title> (1821), and Sir George

					age of paltry politics, &amp; the latter exciting a wish that we had more novels &amp; dramas of that singular
					people translated.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are two reasons why the paper on Brazil had better be postponed,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had asked Murray on 19 February 1820, Letter 3442, if he could review Prince Maximilian zu
						Wied-Neuwied (1782&#8211;1867), <title>Travels in Brazil in the Years 1815 to 1817</title> (1820). In the event, Southey
						did not review it for the <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> &#8211; the one is that it might clash with a reviewal
					(which I suppose you will have) of the third vol. of my History,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The third
						and final volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819); it was not reviewed in the

							<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 4 (November 1810), 454&#8211;474, and <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (October
						1817), 99&#8211;128.</note> &#8211; &amp; the other, &#8211; that events may be looked for in that country, which will make it more
					an object of immediate curiosity a few months hence, than it is just now.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">An
						army revolt in Porto in August 1820 led to the election of a Cortes in December 1820 and demands that the monarchy
						return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807&#8211;1808, following the French invasion. Events in Portugal produced a
						number of sympathetic military revolts in Brazil; one in the Province of Para was reported in <title>The
							Times</title>, 13 March 1821. These developments eventually led to the separation of Portugal and Brazil in
						September 1822</note> I think therefore that you shall have Cromwells Life<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Life of Cromwell&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 25 (July 1821), 279&#8211;347.</note> for your next

In fact,
						Bowles was in dispute with the journal over a hostile account of his <title>The Invariable Principles of Poetry,
							in a Letter Addressed to Thomas Campbell, Esq. Occasioned by Some Critical Observations in His &#8216;Specimens of
							British Poetry,&#8217; Particularly Relating to the Poetical Character of Pope</title> (1819) that had appeared in the
							<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 23 (July 1820), 400&#8211;434; published on 5 October 1820. The reviewer (<ref type="m" target="people.html#DIsraeliIsaac">Isaac D&#8217;Israeli</ref>) had described Bowles as &#8216;a sort of sentimental
						critic&#8217; (403) and &#8216;a poet and no commentator, [who] pours out his invention on old facts, and never discovers new
						ones&#8217; (419). Bowles responded in <title>A Reply to the Charges brought by the Reviewer of Spence&#8217;s Anecdotes in
							the Quarterly Review from October 1820 Against the Last Editor of Pope&#8217;s Works; and Author of &#8216;A Letter to Mr.

						(1786&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>) was a Whig MP with much radical support. He was MP for Westminster 1820&#8211;1833, MP
						for Nottingham 1834&#8211;1847 and MP for Harwich 1848&#8211;1851. Sir Matthew Wood, 1st Baronet (1768&#8211;1843;
							<title>DNB</title>) was MP for the City of London 1817&#8211;1843 and Lord Mayor of London 1815&#8211;1817. He was a
						well-known Whig and supporter of George IV&#8217;s estranged wife, Queen Caroline (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>).
						Samuel Phillips Eady (dates unknown) was much ridiculed in 1821 for a pamphlet he had written, claiming to offer a
						cure for syphilis. Hobhouse&#8217;s name had been removed from the final sentence of Southey&#8217;s article, <title>Quarterly
							Review</title>, 24 (January 1821), 510, which in the censored published version read thus: &#8216;And, perhaps, some of
						our readers may think that in the days of Alderman Wood, Jeremy Bentham, and Dr. Eady, whose fame is written in
						chalk upon all the walls, we have bestowed too much attention upon an inferior quack [Huntington].&#8217; </note>

						&#8216;deserted&#8217; his &#8216;principles&#8217; and &#8216;lost&#8217; his &#8216;reputation&#8217; (p. xxxiv) and singled out his violent rhetoric: &#8216;What
						seems to me chiefly admirable in his panegyric, is the temperate air with which the peaceful possessor of the butt
						and bays presents the axe of vengeance to the dynasty restored in France, and exhorts the reluctant Louis to the
						levelling of that upas, under the branches of which, when miscalled the tree of liberty, the youthful poet tuned
						his long forgotten lays&#8217; (p. xxxv). Southey had visited France in May 1817 during his continental tour of that
						year.</note> &#8211; I do not recollect whether I told you that Hobhouse is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> the author of that

						March 1818 on the Indemnity Act (1818). The pamphlet, <title>A Letter to the Right Hon. George Canning</title>,
						was withdrawn the day after it was published, but circulated under blank covers by the radical bookseller and
						printer James Ridgway (1745&#8211;1838). Canning&#8217;s response was to write, via Ridgway, on 10 April 1818, effectively
						challenging the anonymous author to a duel. This letter became public on 12 April. Many thought the pamphlet to
						have been the work of Hobhouse, but no reply was received and a duel was avoided. </note> So I am assured by one
					who from accidental circumstances (having little sympathy with him) knows him well, &amp; made the disavowal to me
					(as I certainly believe) on H&#8217;s own authority.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">It is not clear from where
