					Turner</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> During my long journey in Scotland<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s tour of
						Scotland lasted from 17 August until 1 October 1819. He was accompanied by Rickman and <ref type="m" target="people.html#TelfordThomas">Thomas Telford</ref>. </note> I had not time to thank you for the Prolusions
					(which I received from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>) &amp; for the manner in which
					my name is introduced in them.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sharon Turner, <title>Prolusions On the
							Present Greatness of Britain; On Modern Poetry; and On the Present Aspect of the World</title> (London, 1819).
						The final poem (&#8216;On the Present Aspect, Progress, and Spirit of the World&#8217;) was addressed to Southey (p. 135), and
						the second (&#8216;On Modern Poetry&#8217;) praised his &#8216;high-glanc&#8217;d aim&#8217; and &#8216;The noblest feelings [which] in &#8230; [his] bosom
						glow&#8217; (p. 111).</note> You know how little leisure there is in travelling, when the traveller wishes to see all
					that can be seen, &amp; to preserve as many recollections as he can by means of a full journal.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had, as was his custom, kept up an account of his journey; see <title>Journal
							of a Tour in Scotland in 1819</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (1929). </note> I am now once more left to
					myself, &amp; to my habitual employments. <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> &amp; his
					family departed this morning, &#8211; &amp; it will require some little time <del>befo</del> to reconcile myself to their
					departure <del>for we have been together</del> &lt;after&gt; seven weeks of uninterrupted intercourse. We went up the
					East coast of Scotland, as far as Fleet Mound,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Fleet Mound was a massive
						causeway, commissioned in 1803, designed by Telford, and built between 1814&#8211;1816, to carry the road over Loch
						Fleet. It comprised an earthwork, and a bridge with self-regulating sluice gates that allowed the waters from the
						river to flow out, but prevented seawater from coming in.</note> which is within sight of the Ord of Caithness: &#8211;
					&amp; we crossed to the <del>xxxxxxx</del> &lt;Western&gt; Sea first from Dingwall to Jean town, &amp; afterwards by the
					line of the Great Canal. And we returned from Fort William by way of Inverary &amp; Glasgow. In most parts, or in
					all, there were the most unequivocal marks of rapid improvement, agreeing well with the view which you take of our
					increased &amp; increasing civilization.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your Prolusions are full of knowledge, &amp; evince a range of reading as wide as the subjects
					upon which you have speculated. I go with you always in principle &amp; in hope, &#8211; but not always in chearful
						expectation.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Turner&#8217;s sense of Britain&#8217;s future, both at home and abroad,
						was distinctly more optimistic than Southey&#8217;s. Although it acknowledged a period of potential crisis, his first
						prolusion (&#8216;On the Present Greatness of Britain&#8217;) championed native common sense and argued that: &#8216;What now
						remains to keep our Britain blest/ But steady fortitude and social rest;/ The growing worth of every active mind,/
						With justice, moral faith and hope combin&#8217;d;/ The blending of the free and loyal heart,/ Gracing the patriot with
						the subjects part:/ Obedient to the laws; respecting power;/ Conscious of rights; contented with the hour:/
						Pursuing firmly all that&#8217;s great and fair,/ And happiest in the good which others share!/ Be this thy spirit
						Britain! and the earth/ Will hail thy empire as its noblest birth./ Mankind will gaze to emulate thy fame;/ But to
						attain it, must thy virtues claim&#8217;, <title>Prolusions On the Present Greatness of Britain; On Modern Poetry; and
							On the Present Aspect of the World</title> (London, 1819), pp. 82&#8211;83.</note> For I fear that instead of going on
					easily &amp; steadily from good to better, there lies a dismal stage of evil before us &#8211; that the age of Revolution
					is not over, &amp; that we in this country shall go on from folly to folly, &amp; from madness to madness, till we
					lose those liberties which are at this time so grossly &amp; perilously abused. God grant that I may be mistaken in
					this judgement.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The end I doubt not, will be for the best, upon the great scale, &#8211; whatever it may be for
					England. And the light which <del>we have</del> &lt;has been&gt; diffused &lt;from hence&gt; will continue to shine when it may
					be darkness &amp; desolation here, &#8211; if ever that unhappy day shall be brought on by our own insanity &amp;
					guilt.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My last Volume of Brazil<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The third and final volume of
						Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> has been delayed by some accident about a proof
					sheet the whole time of my absence. I expected to have found it on my return. You will find in it a great deal of
					curious matter, of which a great portion is now for the first time made public. I am still seeking materials for
					improving it (with a full sense of its inevitable imperfections) &amp; have <del>indeed</del> at this time a
					manuscript which is said to be of great value on the way.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">When the parcel
						containing this work arrived, Southey found it to be nothing more than another copy of Manoel Aires de Casal
						(1754&#8211;1821), <title>Corografia Brazilica, ou Rela&#231;&#227;o Historico-Geografica do Reino do Brazil</title> (1817), no.
						3252 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s Library.</note> Whether a second edition may be called for in my time is
					indeed somewhat doubtful, &#8211; &amp; perhaps hardly to be expected: but this will make no difference in my
						purpose.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">A second, revised, edition of the first volume of the
							<title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819) appeared in 1822; the remaining two volumes did not go into second
						editions.</note> I will leave it as full &amp; as correct as it can be made by my utmost diligence in procuring
					documents, &amp; in using them. &#8211; The government of Brazil, I fear, is going on in the old way, &#8211; as if all its
					members were satisfied with believing that things will last their time, &amp; were altogether indifferent in what
					state they may leave them to their successors. The prime minister is at this time amusing himself in England.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a reference to Pedro de Sousa Holstein, Conde de Palmela (1781&#8211;1850), Portuguese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, 1812&#8211;1817.  He had been appointed Foreign Minister of the United Kingdom of Portugal and Brazil, but declined to make the journey to Brazil to take up his post until 1820.</note>
					Yet bad as the Government is, &amp; blind &amp; besotted as the rulers appear to be, I hope they may escape the
					revolutionary plague, which is laying Spanish America waste.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">After Spain
						was occupied by France in 1808 its American colonies became effectively independent and gradually started to
						declare themselves to be Republics from 1811 onwards.</note> A despotism may thro the influence of the spirit of
					the time be gradually improved into a good government; but anxiety &amp; civil war end always in the tyranny of the
					sword. &#8211; The worst symptom <del>of</del> &lt;in&gt; Brazil is the prevalence of atheism among the educated classes. What
					remedy for this is to be hoped for in a Catholic country I confess I cannot see.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> After so long an absence from home I feel a fresh appetite for work, &#8211; which is well when there

					About a third part of the second volume is printed, &amp; I shall not be long in arranging the materials for the
					remainder. The Methodists remind me of a curious pamphlett published by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Chalmers; he wants
					to establish a religious discipline in large cities:<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Chalmers
						(1780&#8211;1847; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Considerations on the System of Parochial Schools in Scotland: and on the
							Advantage of Establishing them in Large Towns</title> (1819). Southey requested a copy from John Murray, 19
						October 1819, Letter 3368. He needed it to expand his article on Benjamin Haydon, <title>New Churches, Considered
							with Respect to the Opportunities they Offer for the Encouragement of Painting</title> (1818), <title>Quarterly
							Review</title>, 23 (July 1820), 549&#8211;591.</note> &#8211; Methodism effects this, but in an objectionable way. But the
					want of any discipline of this kind, opens a way for so many evils, that I am glad to see public attention moved to
					the subject.</p>
