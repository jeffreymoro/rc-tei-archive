						information was probably Henry Hobhouse (1776&#8211;1854; <title>DNB</title>), Under-Secretary at the Home Office
						1817&#8211;1827. He did not have any brothers, but Southey may have been under the impression that he was the brother of
						John Cam Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton (1786&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>), radical MP for Westminster 1820&#8211;1833,
						Nottingham 1834&#8211;1847, Harwich 1848&#8211;1851, at this time briefly imprisoned for a breach of parliamentary privilege

							<title>DNB</title>), leading radical and campaigner against the Cabinet&#8217;s &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; (1819) to suppress radical
						dissent. Wynn did not move this motion in the House of Commons.</note> committal to Newgate. <del>Upon</del> Your

						try and commit Burdett to prison to a number of MPs, but failed to receive much support and did not proceed with
						the idea.</note> &amp; forced Ministers into the most salutary act of vigour that could possibly have been shown. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have ascertained that I am Cannon Southeys heir at law:<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex will gave Southey some hope of inheriting property at
						Fitzhead in Somerset, following the death of Southey&#8217;s third cousin, and John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey
						Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>). Southey was John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir at law,
						i.e. he was entitled to inherit his real property if he was intestate. However, this did not help Southey&#8217;s claim
						on the Fitzhead property.</note> &amp; that two of the estates<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Pyleigh farm
						in Lydeard St Lawrence and Preston farm in Milverton (worth &#163;300 p.a.).</note> were not sold by Lord S. one of
					them worth about 300 &#163; a year. More than this I know not as yet. If I should by this chance obtain an independance,
					it would come in good time, &#8211; there is no likelihood of any other chance.</p>

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Your godson</ref> has been very ill this
					week. We should think him perfectly recovered were it not <del>for</del> that he seems to have totally lost his
					appetite, &#8211; &amp; this of course gives <del>xx</del> considerable uneasiness, &#8211; for we cannot in any way account
					for it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I see by todays paper that <ref type="m" target="people.html#DoyleyThomas">Badger
						Doyley</ref>
          <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas D&#8217;Oyly married Elizabeth Simons (dates unknown),

        <p rend="indent1"> You will not see me till we meet in town. Poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#StracheyGeorge">Strachey</ref> will have many a heart&#8211;ache from the recollections which he will meet in London. His father dead &#8211;

						roll call of Strachey&#8217;s deceased relatives: his father, the Venerable John Strachey, Archdeacon of Suffolk
						(1738&#8211;1818); one of his younger sisters, Caroline Strachey (1783&#8211;1815); and his older brother, John Strachey
						(1773&#8211;1808), Junior Merchant and Revenue Assistant with the East India Company in Malabar. His younger brother,
						Christopher Strachey (1778&#8211;1855), was only &#8216;as good as dead&#8217; in that he was in the Royal Navy (and rose to be a
						Rear-Admiral).</note> Separations of this kind are a foretaste of death. I would rather be as I am with respect to
					worldly wealth, than have paid the same price for his fortune, &#8211; or for any fortune however ample.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I think I know how to obtain some information concerning Probert.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">William Probert (1790&#8211;1870; <title>DNB</title>), Welsh Unitarian Minister and polymath. Wynn had

						from a well-known family of Irish scholars. His book was an edition of some of the Irish manuscripts in the
						library at Stowe, where he worked as chaplain to Mary, Marchioness of Buckinghamshire (d. 1812), the sister-in-law
