						of Miss Pigott&#8217;s identity, but she might have been Emma Pigott (dates unknown), younger daughter and co-heiress of
						James Pigott (d. 1822) of Fitz-Hall, Iping, Sussex. Fitz-Hall was only five miles from Susannah Rickman&#8217;s home at
						Harting. Emma Pigott married, in 1824, Edward Brice Bunny (d. 1867) of Speen Hill, Berkshire.</note> &amp; there

And hunting the booksellers shops I had the

						(1597&#8211;c. 1676), <title>Nuevo Descubrimiento del Gran R&#237;o de las Amazonas</title> (1641). The second volume Southey
						purchased was Francois Cauche (1616&#8211;1699), <title>Relations Veritables et Curieuses de l&#8217;Isle de Madagascar et du
							Bresil</title> (1651), no. 2363 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Both were purchased from the
						bookseller William Laing (1764&#8211;1832), father of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LaingDavid">David
						Laing</ref>.</note> On Friday we set out with a coach &amp; four horses, hired at Edinburgh for the whole journey.
					That day we went by Linlithgow &amp; Stirling to Callander. The next day was given to Loch Kattern,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. Loch Katrine.</note> one end of which exceeds any thing of that kind which I have
					ever seen. But the rivers rather than the Lakes appear to be the glory of Scotland: in general there is a coldness
					&amp; dreariness about the Lake scenery, very different from the habitable &amp; inviting character which they wear
					with us. Our course was then by the head of Loch Earn to Killin at the head of Loch Tay. Taymouth at the end of
					that Lake, Dunkeld, Perth, Dundee &amp; so along the coast to Aberdeen. Then across the country to Banff &amp;
					along the coast again to Elgin. From Elgin we went a days journey inland to Grantown, &amp; back to the coast at
					Forres the next day, entering the town at one end while Prince Leopold<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (1790&#8211;1865; King of the Belgians 1831&#8211;1865; <title>DNB</title>), the widower of

					coast as far as Fleet mound &#8211; one of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TelfordThomas">Telfords</ref> great works &#8211;
					990 yards in length, across an estuary.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Fleet Mound was a massive causeway,
						commissioned in 1803, designed by Telford, and built between 1814&#8211;1816, to carry the road over Loch Fleet. It
						comprised an earthwork, and a bridge with self-regulating sluice gates that allowed the waters from the river to
						flow out, but prevented seawater from coming in.</note> This was the northern limit of our journey &#8211; We returned
					to Dingwall, sent the Ladies &amp; children to wait for us at Inverness, &amp; crost the island by one of the new
					roads to Jeantown on the Western sea &#8211; Our chaise was the first carriage which had ever arrived at Strome ferry, &#8211;

						Collins (c. 1777&#8211;1841), Captain in the 21st Light Dragoons and the brother of Charles Collins, Southey&#8217;s old
						schoolfriend. Southey missed seeing him, as Collins had travelled south to deal with matters arising from the
						death of his father, William Collins (c. 1751&#8211;1819), naval engineer and inventor, on 23 April 1819 at his home in
						Maize Hill, Greenwich. Southey did see Collins&#8217;s wife, Margaret (d. 1852), and her uncle, James Wood (d. 1825), of
						Keithick, Perthshire. Dr Wood was &#8216;a delightful old man&#8217; who &#8216;set me at ease concerning one of the tumours on my
