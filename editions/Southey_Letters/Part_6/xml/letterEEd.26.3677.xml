        <p rend="indent1"> I heartily give you joy of your dear wife&#8217;s safe deliverance, and of
               the birth of your first child,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Neville
                  White had married Charlotte Sewell (1799&#8211;1873) in 1820. Their first child, Henry
                  Kirke White (1821&#8211;1849), named after his deceased uncle, the poet, had just been
                  born. The second Henry Kirke White was a life-long invalid.</note> &#8211; an event
               which, of all others in the course of human life, produces the deepest and most
               permanent impression.</p>

          <l rend="indent3">The feeling of that stirring hour, &#8211; the weight</l>
          <l rend="indent3">Of that new sense; the thoughtful, pensive bliss.</l>

          <l rend="indent3">Even from the cradle to the grave, I wis</l>

        <p rend="indent1"> So I have written in that poem which will be the next that I hope to
               send you; but I transcribe the lines here because you will feel their truth at this
               time. Parental love, however, is of slower growth in a father&#8217;s than in a mother&#8217;s
               heart: the child, at its birth, continues, as it were, to be a part of its mother&#8217;s
               life; but, upon the father&#8217;s heart it is a <hi rend="ital">graft</hi>, and some
               little time elapses before he feels that it has united and is become inseparable. God
               bless the babe and its parents, and spare it and them, each for the other&#8217;s sake,

                  hexameters.</note> His reasons were founded upon some musical theory, which I did
               not understand farther than to perceive that it was not applicable. His opinion is
               the only unfavourable one that has reached me; that of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">my friend Wynn</ref>, from whom I
               expected the most decided displeasure, was, that he &#8216;disliked them less than he

               feel and like the metre universally, without attempting to understand its
               construction. My brethren of the art approve it,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">For example, John Heraud and Ebenezer Elliott; see Southey to
                  John Heraud, 15 March 1821, Letter 3653, and Southey to Ebenezer Elliott, 25 March
                  1821, Letter 3658.</note> and those whom I acknowledge for my peers are decidedly
               in its favour.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Grosvenor
                  Charles Bedford, 21 December 1820, Letter 3587, for his account of the approval of
                  hexameters by Wordsworth, and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 3 April 1821,
                  Letter 3662, for Landor&#8217;s views.</note> Many persons have thanked me for that part
               of the preface in which <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> and
               his infamous works are alluded to.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  xvii&#8211;xxii, where Southey denounced &#8216;the Satanic school&#8217; of poetry without naming
                  any one poet. This was a response to the first two cantos of Byron&#8217;s <title>Don
                     Juan</title> (1819), which had been published by Murray. The coruscating and
                  hilarious &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, which attacked Southey and others, had been suppressed
                  (and was not published until 1833), but Southey knew of its existence.</note>
               &#8230;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am going on steadily with many things, the foremost of which is the
               History of the War.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> The first
               volume will be printed in the course of September next. Whether it will be published
               before the other two, depends upon the booksellers, and is a matter in which I have
               no concern. I am proceeding also with my Dialogues, and with the Book of the
