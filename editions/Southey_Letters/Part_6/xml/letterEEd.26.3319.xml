               make your arrangements to come then if you can, &#8211; &amp; if you can be here by 15 Sept. I will look upon it as an engagement to be back
               by that day, &#8211; provided Parliament does not sit later than is expected, in which case my outset would be delayed.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Parliament ceased sitting for the summer recess on 13 July 1819, thus allowing Rickman to leave his
