        <p rend="indent1"> The inclosed is to accept an offer of some peninsular papers which
               are in General Taylors possession.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Major-General Sir Herbert Taylor (1775&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>), whose
                  varied career included spells as Private Secretary to George III (1738&#8211;1820; King
                  of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) in 1805&#8211;1812 and Queen Charlotte
                  (1744&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>) in 1812&#8211;1818, as well as being MP for New Windsor
                  1820&#8211;1823 and Military Secretary 1820&#8211;1827. The offer of the use of his papers had
                  come through Edward Hawke Locker, who felt they might help with Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832); see Southey to Edward
                  Hawke Locker, 1 January 1820, Letter 3411.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have two things to tell you, both sufficiently remarkable. &#8211; Lord
                  Bathurst<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl
                  Bathurst (1762&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), Secretary of State for War and the
                  Colonies 1812&#8211;1827. A &#8216;writer&#8217; was a junior administrator in the East India
                  Company. The only way to gain such a post was through patronage &#8211; usually
                  nomination by one of the company&#8217;s directors.</note> supposing that I had a son
               growing up, called on <ref type="m" target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> lately, to offer me a Writership for him. I never saw Lord B. nor
               have I any indirect acquaintance with him. The intended kindness therefore is the
                  <del>xxx</del> greater.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A curious charge has been bequeathed me; &#8211; the papers of <ref type="m" target="people.html#HamondElton">a man</ref> who destroyed
               himself on the first day of this year, &#8211; wholly I believe from the misery occasioned
               by a state of utter unbelief. &#8211; I never saw him but once. Last year he wrote me two
               anonymous letters soliciting me to accept this charge. I supposed him from what he
               said to be in the last stage of some mortal disease, &amp; wrote to him under that
               persuasion. And I rather imagined that the religious character of my second
                  reply<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Elton Hamond, 2 March
                  1819, Letter 3256.</note> had offended him, &#8211; for I heard nothing more, &#8211; till
               last week there came a letter from an acquaintance of mine telling me his name, &#8211; his
               fate, &#8211; &amp; that the papers were deposited by the Suicide himself the day before he
               executed his fatal purpose, &#8211; to await my directions. &#8211; I have reason to believe
               that, with all proper respect to the dead as well as to the living, a most melancholy
               but instructive lesson may be deduced from them. &#8211; His letters are beautiful
               compositions, &#8211; &amp; he was a man of the strictest &amp; most consciencious
               virtue!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The <del>inquest</del> jury pronounced him insane,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Coroner&#8217;s jury on 4 January 1820 declared
                  Hamond insane.</note> &#8211; which perhaps they would not have <del>been</del> done,
               had they seen the paper which he addressed to them. That cruel law<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Suicides were buried at night without religious
                  rites and usually at a crossroads; this practice ended with the Burial of Suicide
                  Act (1823).</note> should be repealed, &#8211; &amp; I wish you would take the credit of
               repealing it. It is in every point of view barbarous. A particular prayer for cases
               of this kind should be added to our burial service: to be used in place of those
               parts that express a sure &amp; certain hope for the dead.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Order for the Burial of the Dead&#8217; in the Church of
                  England&#8217;s <title>Book of Common Prayer</title> (1662) noted the &#8216;sure and certain
                  hope of the resurrection to eternal life&#8217; of the deceased.</note>
