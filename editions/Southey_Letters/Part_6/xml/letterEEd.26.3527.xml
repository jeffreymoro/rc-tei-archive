        <p rend="indent1"> It seems very strange that the Duke of Gloucester<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Prince
						William Frederick, 2nd Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1776&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>).</note> should give you
					information of any projects or intentions of mine. The state of the case is this. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hastings
					being very desirous that a life of her husband should be written &amp; a selection made from his papers,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Warren Hastings (1732&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>), Governor-General of Bengal 1773&#8211;1785;
						his second wife was Anna Maria Apollonia [Marian] Chapuset (1747&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>). Southey did not write
						Hastings&#8217;s biography. See Southey to John Murray, 10 July 1820, Letter 3509 for details of the proposal that he
						should write this work.</note> consulted Sir George Dallas<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir George
						Dallas, 1st Baronet (1758&#8211;1833), poet, and friend and supporter of Warren Hastings.</note> about it, &amp; he
					proposed Sir James Macintosh<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir James Mackintosh (1765&#8211;1832;
							<title>DNB</title>), Whig politician, historian and Recorder of Bombay 1804&#8211;1811. Charles James Fox had been an
						opponent of Warren Hastings.</note> as a person of distinguished talents, high reputation, &amp; conversant with
					Indian affairs. &#8211; tho there might be an objection to him as being possibly disposed to think with <ref type="m" target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fox</ref> on that, as on other subjects. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hastings however desired that enquiry might be made whether I would undertake it, because she
					knew what her husbands opinion of me had been, &amp; that he would have preferred me for such a task to any other
					person. Sir G. D. spoke to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, &amp; two or three days only
					before I left town <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> asked me the question. I saw at once
						<del>that</del> the splendour of the subject, &#8211; the extent &amp; variety of matter which it included, &amp; in
					what manner it might be arranged: &amp; having a vague knowledge of the leading facts of Hastings life, but a great
					admiration of his talents, &amp; of all that I had heard of him in his private character, &amp; believing
						<del>that</del> moreover that he been vilely persecuted, I expressed a willingness to the business. My place in
					the Mail was taken at this time, &amp; all my arrangements made accordingly. On the morning of my departure <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> went with me to Sir G Dallas&#8217;s. There I learnt that the
					materials were as ample as could be desired, &#8211; the most important being a journal <del>which</del> kept by
					Hastings, I believe, from the time when he first went to India. Sir G. afterwards called at <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brothers</ref> &amp; left word written on his card that M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> H. wished particularly to see me the next day &#8211; but this could not be &#8211; for I had engagements
					at Birmingham, &amp; was to meet <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt Southey</ref> there on her
					way from Taunton. So there the matter ended, &#8211; except that <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has sent me down a parcel of books for preliminary reading, &amp; that I hold myself engaged to it
					as soon as the Hist: of the War<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular
							War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> is compleated. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have no fear of the labour, &amp; none of any difficulty in writing with perfect integrity: if
					indeed I had any such apprehension I would at once decline the task. It is a noble subject, &#8211; &amp; admits
						<del>of</del> in perfection of that ornamental relief which is always delightful to meet with, &amp; which I
					delight in introducing. &#8211; If it extends to two quartos (as I suppose it will) I shall have two thousand guineas. &#8211;
					If things go on quietly &amp; I live &amp; do well, there is a fair prospect of my realizing five thousand pounds
					in the next five years.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am as little fond of prophesying evil as you are, &#8211; mine indeed is a chearful nature, &amp; I
					hardly know what it is to despond. With regard to the present crisis<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of George IV, had returned to England
						on 5 June 1820. Her arrival and the series of events that followed, as attempts were made to deprive her of the
						title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King, made her a figurehead for radicals, and also triggered
						public protests in her support.</note> my best ground of hope indeed is not of the pleasantest kind, &#8211; it being
					simply this that <del>xx</del> things must be worse before they can be better, &#8211; &amp; that the sooner the abscess
					breaks the more strength will there be in the constitution to struggle thro the disease. We are already under the
					tyranny of the Press, &#8211; &amp; that tyranny must inevitably destroy itself, &#8211; the question how much or how little
					evil we must go thro before that good end is arrived at is a momentous <del>question</del> &lt;concern&gt; to the present
					generation. We must hope the best, &amp; do the best we can. In the present filthy business I have only to wait the
					event; &amp; I shall be glad if the storm breaks while you are far from the sphere of its action for something as
					bad as Lord G Gordons riots<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Lord George Gordon (1751&#8211;1793;
							<title>DNB</title>); his anti-Catholic activities inspired the Gordon Riots of 1780, in which nearly 300 people
						were killed.</note> may reasonably be expected. Bennet (the Wilts. B.) bill<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Benett (1773&#8211;1852), MP for Wiltshire 1819&#8211;1832, MP for South Wiltshire 1832&#8211;1852. He had been one of the
						leading figures in supporting the Appointment of Special Constables Act (1820), which increased the powers of
						local Justices of the Peace to recruit special constables at times of civil disorder.</note> which passed thro
					both Houses without a single observation on either side, &amp; perhaps was hardly known to the Ministers, certainly
