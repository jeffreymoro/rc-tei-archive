        <p rend="indent1"> Supposing that you will by this time be in London, I was intending to
               write &amp; thank you for your company, &amp; your laver, when the loitering
               intention was quickened into effect by some intelligence which this days post has
               brought.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will not have forgotten the two remarkable letters from the
               anonymous writer who wished to entrust his papers to my care after his death. I now
               learn that the unhappy writer put an end to his life on New Years day; &amp; that on
               the day preceding he deposited the papers at a house in town to await my directions.
               He proves to have been <ref type="m" target="people.html#HamondElton">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Elton Hamond</ref>, a person well known to <ref type="m" target="                      people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my
               brother</ref>, &amp; whom I once met at dinner some years ago, at <ref type="m" target="people.html#GoochDrRobert">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gooch&#8217;s</ref>,
               &amp; well remember as a mild, melancholy, <hi rend="ital">introspective</hi> man.
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Henry
               Robinson</ref> (a friend of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth&#8217;s</ref> &amp; of mine)
               informs me of this, &amp; gives me a very singular &amp; interesting account of the
               deceased, with whom he had long been intimate. He describes him as thoroughly
               virtuous, good &amp; gentle hearted, but intense feeling, intense vanity,
               self-centering thoughts, miserable metaphysics &amp; a morbid temperament combined to
               produce &lt;in him&gt; that sort of insanity, which is incurable by any human means. &#8211; I
               anticipate a melancholy task with his papers, but it may possibly be an useful
               one.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Cases of this kind are seldom laid before the world either faithfully
               or charitably. The same elements which made <ref type="m" target="people.html#HamondElton">Elton Hamond</ref> an utter unbeliever in every
               thing which it is desirable to believe, &amp; a suicide at last, would have made him
               a Saint in the middle ages of monachism, &#8211; or a martyr in the age of the Reformation.
               &#8211; And what should I have been in those days? &#8211; A pilgrim to Jerusalem, &#8211; a chronicler
               (if I had learnt to write) &amp; a maker of verses.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If your brother<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward
                  Kenyon (d. 1856); he was still living in Vienna.</note> is still at Vienna will
               you ask him if he can obtain any account, &#8211; such for instance as a German Necrology,
               &#8211; or a biographical Dictionary may supply &#8211; of my old friend Dobrizhoffer;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Martin Dobrizhoffer (1717&#8211;1791), Jesuit missionary

                  Massacre on 16 August 1819, in which eleven people had died, the government had
                  succeeded in passing the &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; to suppress radical agitation, including a new
                  Criminal Libel Act (1819).</note> The disease is till in the system, &amp;
               stronger measures with regard to the press must be adopted before it can be removed.
               The necessary consequence of general education must be a licensed press, &#8211; that is, a
               press under the control of government; so that nothing inflammatory, nothing hostile
               to the existing institutions be suffered to appear. And the alternative is, whether
               you will submit to this to prevent revolution, or come to it thro revolution &amp;
               the military government in which revolution inevitably ends.</p>
