        <p rend="indent1"> The event<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bill&#8217;s wife, Louisa Bill, n&#233;e Dauncey, had given birth to their first
                  child, Mary Louisa (1820&#8211;1835), on 12 October 1820.</note> which you communicate could not be uninteresting to me, who spent so many
               happy days in childhood &amp; boyhood with Louisa Dolignon, &amp; received more kindness from her mother<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Here Southey has slightly confused the names of the Dolignons. Louisa Bill&#8217;s mother, and Southey&#8217;s childhood friend,
                  was Marie Dolignon (1769&#8211;1805); her mother was <ref type="m" target="people.html#DolignonElizabeth">Elizabeth Dolignon</ref>, who
                  acted as a kind of surrogate parent for Southey when he was at Westminster School 1788&#8211;1792.</note> than I ever experienced from any
               other human being, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my own mother</ref> alone excepted. When I see this infant, my
               acquaintance will then have extended to four generations of that line. May God bless &amp; preserve both the child &amp; the parents.
               You have now to expect pleasures &amp; anxieties altogether different from any that you have ever felt before. So different indeed is
               the parental affection from every other, that it seems to show more aptly than any other illustration, how possible it is that man may
               contain within him <del>xxxx</del> instincts &amp; senses which are not evolved in this state of being, but will be developed in
               another.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I now very much regret that I did not see M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Mary Delamare<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Delamare (c. 1740&#8211;1820) had died on 20 September 1820 at her home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. She was the sister of Southey&#8217;s
                  childhood guardian, <ref type="m" target="people.html#DolignonElizabeth">Elizabeth Dolignon</ref>.</note> when I was in the South.
               Death is the best thing which can happen to a good old age, &amp; hers might truly be called so. But I shall think more mournfully of
                  <ref type="m" target="places.html#TheobaldsH">Theobalds</ref>, which will be no longer the same place that I remember so vividly,
               &amp; which many circumstances bring to my mind so often.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Should you be at Farley when next I travel southward &#8211; it will give me great pleasure to take that place in my way. But
               it will be a long while before I <del>shall</del> &lt;can&gt; leave my desk &amp; my fire side, where I am fixed down by inclination &amp; by
