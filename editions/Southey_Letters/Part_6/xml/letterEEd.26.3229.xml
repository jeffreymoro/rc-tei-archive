        <p rend="indent1"> Many happy new years to you &amp; yours, &amp; may you go on well however the world goes; &#8211; go as it may, it is some
               satisfaction to think that it will not be the worse for any thing that you &amp; I have done in it. And it is to be hoped that our work
               is not done yet. I have a strong hope that something may be effected in our old scheme about the reformed Convents,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Thomas Fosbrooke (1770&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), <title>British Monachism; or,
                     Manners and Customs of the Monks and Nuns of England</title> (1817), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), 59&#8211;102,
                  dealt extensively with the need for communities to provide support for single women (90&#8211;102). In particular (96&#8211;101), it praised the
                  work of Lady Isabella Lettice King (1772&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), who founded the Ladies&#8217; Association at Bailbrook House, near
                  Bath, in June 1816. This provided a home for orphaned gentlewomen with no income.</note> &#8211; &amp; that would be as great a step towards
               amending the condition of educated women, as the establishment of Saving Banks has been for bettering the state of the lower
                  classes.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The first savings bank, which accepted and paid interest on small cash deposits, was
                  instituted by Henry Duncan (1774&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>) in Ruthwell, Dumfriesshire in 1810, and the movement spread
                  rapidly.</note>

               Have you seen Fearons Sketches of America?<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Bradshaw Fearon (c. 1793&#8211;1842), <title>Sketches
                     of America. A Narrative of a Journey of Five Thousand Miles Through the Eastern and Western States of America</title> (1818).
                  Fearon was a Unitarian and a radical, but was not uncritical of America. His book was reviewed, vituperatively, by John Barrow
                  (1764&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (January 1819), 124&#8211;167.</note> It is very amusing to see a
               man who hates all the institutions of his own country, compelled to own that every thing is worse in America, &amp; groan while he
               makes the confession, &#8211; too honest to conceal the truth, &amp; yet bringing it up, as if it were got at by means of emetic tartar,
               sorely against his stomach. I wish I were not too busy to write a careful review of this book. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Did I tell you concerning Morris Birbeck<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">William Gifford had reviewed (in a very
                  hostile fashion), in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 54&#8211;78, the recent writings of Morris Birkbeck (1764&#8211;1825;
                     <title>DNB</title>). Birkbeck came from a Quaker family based in Westmorland and was a radical. Leaving his farm, he travelled to
                  France and published <title>Notes on a Journey through France</title> (1814). In 1817 he emigrated to Illinois, bought public land
                  there and in 1818 established a new town&#8212;Wanborough. His <title>Notes on a Journey in America from the Coast of Virginia to the
                     Territory of Illinois</title> (1817), a book designed to inform would-be emigrants, and notable for its radical views, went
                  through eleven editions in two years. However, Birkbeck faced claims that he had emigrated to America without settling his
