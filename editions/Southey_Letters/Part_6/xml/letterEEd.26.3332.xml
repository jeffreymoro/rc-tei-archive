               volumes to do it justice. But what I can bring within this compass will serve its
               purpose well, &#8211; that of introducing the Braybrooks institution, &amp; contrasting it
               with the nunneries which are multiplying in this country, &amp; for which funds are

                  no income and was duly praised by Southey in his article in <title>Quarterly

                  information for Roman Catholics in England. It was published from 1800 by the
                  leading Catholic firm Keating and Brown, run by George Keating (1762&#8211;1842;
                     <title>DNB</title>) and Richard Brown (d. 1837).</note> &#8211; &#8211; &amp; also their

                  this was not published by Keating and Brown. Alternatively, Southey might be
                  referring to Keating and Brown&#8217;s monthly publication, <title>The Catholic
                     Spectator and Selector; or Catholicon</title> (1815&#8211;1826), though this had
                  suspended publication December 1818&#8211;January 1823.</note> in which undoubtedly
               there must be something to the purpose. &#8211; I hope the paper will do its work</p>

                  of Southey&#8217;s library. It was published by Murray.</note> is a poet whose works
               will continue to increase in value as they grow older, &#8211; for they belong to the moral
               &amp; domestic history of these times. Their merit is very great in other respects, &#8211;
               but this gives them a peculiar value. Moreover they have the stamp of originality,
               without which no poetry can live.</p>
