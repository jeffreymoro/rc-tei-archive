               by the Portugueze Ambassadors in this country of the negociation for Charles the

                  May 1662. The manuscript account of the marriage negotiations Southey mentions
                  here was no. 3857 in the sale catalogue of his library. The leading figure on the
                  Portuguese side in the marriage negotiations was Francisco de Melo e Torres (c.

                  subject was topical as an army revolt in Porto in August 1820 had led to the
                  election of a Cortes in December 1820 and demands that the monarchy return from
                  Brazil, where it had fled in 1807&#8211;1808, following the French invasion. Events in
                  Portugal produced a number of sympathetic military revolts in Brazil; one in the
                  Province of Para was reported in <title>The Times</title>, 13 March 1821. These
                  developments eventually led to the separation of Portugal and Brazil in September
                  1822; but Brazil did not become a republic until 1889, nor did it disintegrate, as
                  Southey feared.</note> There is no reason why it should kept back a la mode the

               averted. I know it is in my power to give that information upon the subject without
