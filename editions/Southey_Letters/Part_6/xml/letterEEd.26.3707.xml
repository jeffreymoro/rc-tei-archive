        <p rend="indent1"> I ought ere this to have thanked you for the perry, which arrived safe, &amp; in such high-flying condition, that if
               hot weather had overtaken it on the way, &amp; the demolition of bottles had occurred in the hampers, which has taken place since, the
               carrier would have been suspected of careless usage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When your last letter arrived I was in hopes that the disturbances in the Turkish empire would soon have been
                  appeased.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Wade Browne, 28 December 1820, Letter 3593, where he stated: &#8216;We
                  shall soon begin to think of Turkey as a good settled government.&#8217; Following the conclusion of peace with Russia in 1812, the
                  Ottoman Empire had gradually re-established much of its severely shaken authority in Anatolia and Syria. However, the Empire then
                  had to face a war with Persia (1821&#8211;1823) and an, ultimately successful, revolt in Greece, which began in 1821.</note> Have you
               heard from Wade?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Wade Browne (1796&#8211;1851), only son of Wade Browne and later a country gentleman
                  at Monkton Farleigh in Somerset. He had graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1819 and was travelling in the Near
                  East.</note> The news of the insurrection must have reached Egypt sooner than it did England; I think therefore that he must have
               heard it either before he left Egypt, or in Syria; &amp; in either of those countries he would be safe, where there is no Turkish
               feeling among the people, &amp; Europeans are regarded with respect, since their power was shown there.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Egypt was occupied by France 1798&#8211;1801, and French forces had invaded Palestine in 1799. They were ultimately
                  defeated by a British expedition in 1801.</note> &#8211; Pray let me know if you have received tidings of him. What I hope is that he will
               have embarked at Alexandria in some English or French vessel.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Much as the funds are affected by the prospect of a war between Russia &amp; the Turks, that quarrel <del>would</del>
               &lt;need&gt; never in its remotest consequences involve this country.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">It was widely believed that
                  Russia would intervene to support the Greek revolt, both in order to help fellow Orthodox Christians and to expand the Russian
                  Empire in the Balkans. Britain, France and Russia eventually did intervene and forced the Ottoman Empire to recognise Greek
                  independence in 1832.</note> The Greeks may free themselves, &amp; pass into a state of anarchy &amp; intestine wars, worse, if
               worse be possible, than the barbarous yoke which they are endeavouring to shake; but there is no danger of their becoming part of the
               Russian empire. The Russians may defeat the Turkish armies, &amp; lay open the way to Constantinople, but they cannot maintain their
               conquests in Turkey; &amp; Constantinople would sustain a siege like Zaragoza, or prove as fatal to those who took possession of it, as
               Moscow did to the French.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The city of Zaragoza was besieged by French forces in June&#8211;August 1808
                  and December 1808&#8211;February 1809, during the Peninsular War of 1808&#8211;1813; Spanish forces successfully defeated the French in the
                  first siege. French forces had occupied Moscow in September 1812, but little more than a month later they began to withdraw. Over
                  400,000 French troops and their allies died in the long retreat from Russia.</note> There need be no apprehensions from the
               aggrandizement of the Russian empire in that direction.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">There was a brief Russo-Turkish War in
                  1828&#8211;1829, which led to substantial Russian territorial gains on the west shore of the Black Sea and in Armenia.</note> Our danger
               is from an explosion in the Prussian states;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey feared that the areas of the Rhineland
                  incorporated into Prussia in 1815 might rebel against Prussian rule. The Rhenish elites were at this time fighting a long battle
                  with the government in Berlin to defend their local government system and legal code. But there was no revolutionary outbreak until
                  1848.</note> which might either produce a shock in <del>xx</del> France that would shake the Bourbons from the throne, &#8211; or induce
               them to fall in with the national feeling, &amp; take advantage of that opportunity for recovering their lost conquests on the side of
                  Belgium.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The Bourbon dynasty had been restored to the French throne by the Allies in 1814,
                  but lacked legitimacy in the eyes of many French people. Southey feared that any disturbances in the Rhineland would lead to the
                  overthrow of the Bourbons or force them to attempt to recover Belgium, which the French revolutionaries had annexed in 1795.</note>
               &#8211; &#8220;Give peace in our time, O Lord!&#8221;<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">From the Anglican service of evening prayer; see <title>The

        <p rend="indent1"> The Coronation did not draw me to London.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The Prince Regent was crowned as
                  George IV on 19 July 1821. Southey did not attend and also did not write an official poem for the occasion.</note>

                  War; as Deputy Earl Marshal he was responsible for organising the coronation. Henry Herbert Southey acted as one of the Deputy
                  Earl Marshal&#8217;s Officers at the ceremony &#8211; in effect he was an usher. His role was signified by the possession of a gold stick (as
                  well as a blue and gold lace uniform, and a black hat with feathers). He had probably obtained this job through the influence of his

               prospect for those poor countries were as hopeful now, as it was then! We have seen the end of Buonaparte,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French 1804&#8211;1814, 1815) had died on 5 May 1821. However, Spain and
                  Portugal had both witnessed revolutions in 1820 and their political future was in doubt.</note> but we shall not live to see the end
               of the evils which he produced.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our new Vicar<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">James Lynn (1776&#8211;1855), Perpetual Curate of Strood 1805&#8211;1814,
                  Rector of Caldbeck 1814&#8211;1820, Vicar of Crosthwaite, Keswick 1820&#8211;1855; he had married Charlotte Alicia Goodenough (1782&#8211;1822) in
                  1805. Her father, Samuel Goodenough (1743&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>), was Bishop of Carlisle 1808&#8211;1827, which may well explain Lynn&#8217;s
                  appointment to Crosthwaite.</note> has almost rebuilt the vicarage, &amp; in the course of his improvements has unluckily demolished
               the old horse-block, which ought to have stood for ever as Gray&#8217;s station.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">When Thomas Gray
                  (1716&#8211;1771; <title>DNB</title>) visited the garden of Crosthwaite vicarage on 4 October 1769, he described the view as seen through
                  his glass when he stood next to the horsing-block: &#8216;From hence I got to the parsonage a little before sun-set, and saw in my glass a
                  picture, that if I could transmit it to you, and fix it in all the softness of its living colours, would fairly sell for a thousand
                  pounds. This is the sweetest scene I can yet discover in point of pastoral beauty; the rest are in a sublimer stile&#8217;, reported in
                  Thomas West (1720?&#8211;1779; <title>DNB</title>), <title>A Guide to the Lakes: Dedicated to the Lovers of Landscape Studies, and to All
                     who have Visited, or Intend to Visit the Lakes in Cumberland</title> (London, 1778), p. 113. An edition of 1799 was no. 3024 in
                  the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. This was Station VIII in the viewing points in Keswick and its environs singled out by
                  West. By demolishing the horsing-block, Lynn had unwittingly deprived the tourist of an important marker.</note> He did not know
               what he was doing; &#8211; a word would have prevented it if I had been aware of his intention. &#8211; I had a pike lately from this lake of 24
               pounds; had it been caught a few days sooner I would have sent it up, as worthy of a place at the Coronation Dinner. &#8211; The new Vicar
               reads &amp; preaches well, &amp; fills the Church, so much so that a gallery is talked of, &amp; an organ.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">An organ was not installed in Crosthwaite church until 1837.</note> The parishioners have created a monument to his
                  predecessor,<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Isaac Denton (c. 1758&#8211;1820), Vicar of Crosthwaite, Keswick 1786&#8211;1820, whom
                  Southey called &#8216;Reverend Porpoise&#8217;. The firm of Francis Webster and Sons of Kendal created the wall tablet enumerating his
                  virtues.</note> praising him for his duties, &#8211; to the non-performance of which this popularity must be ascribed.</p>
