I projected it for <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</ref>, while he was spending two years as tutor in a private family,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Derwent Coleridge lived with the Hopwood family, well-connected Lancashire landowners, at Summerhill,
                  near Ulverston 1817&#8211;1819. Robert Gregge Hopwood (1773&#8211;1854) had married in 1805 Cecilia Elizabeth Byng (1770&#8211;1854), daughter of John
                  Byng, 5th Viscount Torrington (1743&#8211;1813). Derwent Coleridge was tutor to the Hopwoods&#8217; sons, Edward (1807&#8211;1891), Frank (1810&#8211;1890)
                  and Hervey (1811&#8211;1881).</note> &#8211; as a means of facilitating his way thro the University. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">His sister</ref> offered to assist him; &#8211; he soon grew tired of the task (the little

               indefatigable girl went thro with it. I am now about to review it, in such a way, I hope, as may make the sale remunerate her.</p>
