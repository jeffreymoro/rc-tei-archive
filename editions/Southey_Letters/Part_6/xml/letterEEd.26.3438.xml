					near his door, I wish you would make it a reason for calling) will you tell him that among the many persecutions to
					which, like himself, I am exposed on account of the Q.R. there is one from <ref type="m" target="people.html#DouglasHoward">Sir Howard Douglas</ref>,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">General Sir
						Howard Douglas had sent Southey some of his papers to aid in the <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
						(1823&#8211;1832). The book in question was Douglas&#8217;s <title>Observations on the Motives, Errors and Tendency of M.
							Carnot&#8217;s System of Defence</title> (1819), which offered a detailed critique of Lazare Nicolas Marguerite
						Carnot&#8217;s (1753&#8211;1823) classic work on fortifications, <title>Traite de la D&#233;fense des Places Fortes</title> (1810),
						on issues such as the effectiveness of vertical fire by defending forces.</note> concerning whose book I wrote to
					him some three or four months ago. I very much wish he would get Pasley<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir
						Charles William Pasley (1780&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>), military engineer, whose <title>Essay on the Military Policy and
							Institutions of the British Empire</title> (1810) was much admired by Southey. At this time Pasley was Director
						of the School of Military Fieldworks at Chatham and had given Southey a practical demonstration of some techniques
						of besieging and defending fortifications on 9 May 1817. Pasley did not review Douglas&#8217;s book for the
							<title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> to review that book. It would hardly require more than half a dozen
					pages; &amp; I believe the book deserves to be brought forward, as being of great practical importance. If as I
					apprehend, it shows that we are as much superior to the French in the most important branch of war in theory, as we
					have proved ourselves to be in the field, the work which demonstrates this ought to be brought prominently into
					notice, &#8211; more especially as the notoriety which the Q.R. may give to <ref type="m" target="people.html#DouglasHoward">Sir Howards</ref> refutation of Carnots theories, may tend to prevent our
					allies, from committing errors the consequence of which must be severely felt, whenever France is able to resume

						misspelled in the hope that the fraudulent publisher may be enabled to evade the law. Other newspapers, we trust
						will insert this notice as an act of justice to the individual on whose reputation the fraud is practiced; and as

					verses. However as I hope not to go beyond two or three hundred lines,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">As
						usual, Southey underestimated his task; <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821) was over 600 lines
