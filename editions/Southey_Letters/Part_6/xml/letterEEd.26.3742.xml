               erelong, &amp; which I should feel the want of if it were not at hand, that I even replaced it on the shelf, for the present. &#8211; I have

               many pence. But it has been <del>xx</del> willingly &amp; well bestowed, &amp; the worth of the book will one day be known. &#8211; Humboldt
               refers often to it in his &lt;last&gt; volume, &amp; says that he finds its geographical statements very correct, &#8211; tho I think he had only
               seen my first vol. when he wrote.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#8211;1859), <title>Personal Narrative

                  311, no. 1463 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> He forms the same conclusion as I had done respecting the Amazons.
               And it is also pleasant to find that the notion which he advanced of Aguirre&#8217;s<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Lope de Aguirre
                  (c. 1510&#8211;1561), explorer and conquistador.</note> having got to the sea by some other course than that of keeping the stream of the

                     <title>Valeroso Lucideno e o Triunfo da Liberdade</title> (1648). Southey extracted information concerning the Dukes of Braganza,
                  a prominent Portuguese noble family, and their residence at Vila Vicosa. The volume had been lent to Southey by Sir Charles Stuart,
                  Baron de Rothesay (1779&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal 1810&#8211;1814.</note> I
               never had any other from him. I have extracted the Villa-Vi&#231;osa part, which is very curious. Indeed the book is altogether so original

               the whole time enabled me to make good use of long mornings among old books. There is a most extensive collection there of tracts

               magnificent place, &amp; I know enough of the family, &amp; like them well enough to be quite at ease there. The Dutchess of
