                  <del>when</del> &lt;since&gt; I have learnt in perfection the art of writing with difficulty. However I had begun to think upon the
               subject when the alarm was given in December, &amp; had even just made a beginning &#8211; for the sake of pitching the <del>tone</del> tune.
               How the plan may turn out remains to be seen &#8211; it is somewhat in the manner of Dante&#8217;s invention, &#8211; not of his style.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Dante Alighieri (c. 1265&#8211;1321), <title>Divine Comedy</title> (1308&#8211;1321).</note> The measure will be a
               nine days wonder, for I am writing in hexameters, &#8211; written of course by accent <del>xx</del> not by quantity,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The hexameter was borrowed from Latin poetry, which did not depend on accent, or stress, but on the number of
                  syllables per line.</note> &amp; (I think) so written that they cannot, in a single instance, be possibly mis-read, if read
               according to the natural pronunciation of the words. I have composed about an hundred lines, which may be perhaps a third of the
                  whole.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In fact <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821) ran to over 600 lines.</note> It
               is not more difficult than blank verse, or if more difficult in some respects, it affords greater facility in others. And it is a full,
               sonorous, stately measures, capable of great variety great sweetness &amp; great strength. The pleasure of making the experiment takes
               off the tedium of the task, &amp; its success or failure will be so much a matter of indifference, that when it is once sent into the
               world, I shall scarcely ever think of it again</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Another cause of delay has arisen since I began this letter. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> tells me he means to reprint the first volume of the Brazil, in order to make up the sets, there being about 170
               copies of the second &amp; third which would otherwise serve only for waste paper.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The second

               made a good many improvements in the first volume, chiefly from Jaboatam,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Antonio de Santa Maria

                  library. Pedro Vaz de Caminha (c. 1450&#8211;1500) was a member of the fleet led by Pedro Alvares Cabral (c. 1467&#8211; c. 1520), which
                  discovered Brazil in 1500. Caminha&#8217;s letter of 1 May 1500 announced the discovery to Manoel I (1469&#8211;1521; King of Portugal

                  National Archive in Lisbon.</note> At first I suspected its authenticity, because it contains the words <hi rend="ital">sertoens</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="ital">inhame</hi>, the former I had supposed to have been coined in Brazil, the latter to be of Tupi
               growth: but I have since recollected that <hi rend="ital">sertoens</hi> is also used in Portugueze Africa, &amp; that <hi rend="ital">inhame</hi> is as likely to be Angolan as Tupi, &amp; has indeed more of an Angolan physiognomy.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Manoel Aires de Casal (1754&#8211;1821), <title>Corografia Brazilica, ou Rela&#231;&#227;o Historico-Geografica do Reino do

                  was a term used by the Portuguese in Africa; and &#8216;inhame&#8217; (yam) was a word derived from the Spanish &#8216;name&#8217;, possibly from the Fula
