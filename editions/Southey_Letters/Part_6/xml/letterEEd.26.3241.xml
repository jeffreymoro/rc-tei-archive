        <opener>
          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been desired to trouble you upon two subjects, &#8211; luckily there will not be much trouble in
					either: &#8211; first, did you some time ago receive a poem submitted to you by <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesCaroline">an anonymous Lady</ref>, &#8211; concerning which poem I had previously
						written?<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles&#8217;s &#8216;Ellen Fitzarthur&#8217;, which Southey had drawn to Murray&#8217;s
						attention for possible publication; see Southey to John Murray, 9 June 1818, <title>The Collected Letters of
							Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3149. Murray had expressed a cautious interest, and Bowles had then
						sent her manuscript to him.</note> &#8211; And if you have received it, as probably you have, &#8211; am I to tell the
					Authoress that you do not deem it advisable to publish it?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Murray did reject
						Bowles&#8217;s poem; see Southey to Caroline Bowles, 18 March 1819, Letter 3268.</note> this will probably be the
					answer, &#8211; but let me be told to communicate it, when you can spare time. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Secondly: there are two newspapers published at Kendal, the one Broughamite,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle</title> (1811&#8211;1834) was a
						weekly newspaper which supported the Whigs and <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Henry
							Brougham&#8217;s</ref> candidacy for Westmorland in 1818 and 1820.</note> that is to say thoroughly Jacobinical, the
					other is the one which <ref type="m" target="people.html#DeQuinceyThomas">De Quincey</ref> edites, &#8211; employing in
					this manner time, talents, &amp; knowledge worthy of a much better direction.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Westmorland Gazette</title>, founded in 1818 and edited by De Quincey, July
						1818&#8211;November 1819.</note> Your Review is advertised in the Kendal Chronicle, which is the Jacobine paper, &amp;
					which never notices the Review except to abuse it. And it is not advertised in the Westmorland Gazette. Now I am
					asked if it be not in my power to get this advertisement in future transferred from the wrong paper to the right
					one: &#8211; &amp; my answer was that I would represent the matter to you. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Having thus dispatched the business of my letter, &#8211; I thank you for Antar,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Antar, A Bedoueen Romance. Translated from the Arabic by Terrick
							Hamilton</title> (1819).</note> which is exceedingly curious. Some booby in the New M. Magazine has been abusing
					it, with about as much reason as <del>he might have</del> &lt;if he had&gt; abused the Author for not writing it
					originally, <del>his En</del> &lt;in&gt; English.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>New Monthly
							Magazine</title>, 13 (January-February 1820), 12&#8211;18, 152&#8211;161. The review&#8217;s author was the Austrian orientalist
						Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall (1774&#8211;1856), who complained about the lack of information about &#8216;the discovery and
						state of the copy [of <title>Antar</title>], the extent and value of the romance, or the nature of the translation
						itself&#8217; and &#8216;whether it is a literal or free translation, whether of the whole or of extracts&#8217; (14). </note> We
					have no other picture of Arabian manners in that age (except indeed the Moallakat,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">A series of seven Arabian poems. When undertaking preparatory research for <title>Thalaba the
							Destroyer</title> (1801), Southey had read them in translation in <title>The Works of Sir William Jones</title>,
						6 vols (London, 1799), IV, pp. 244&#8211;335. For Southey&#8217;s notes on them, see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed.
						John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1850), IV, pp. 106&#8211;107. See also, Southey to Charles Watkin Williams
						Wynn, [30 August 1801], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Two</title>, Letter 603. </note>
					where the pieces have too little narrative to afford much matter of fact) &#8211; this therefore is a most valuable
					accession to our <del>knowledge of</del> stores. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The reviewal of Samor is the best poetical criticism (in my judgement) that has yet appeared in
					your Journal,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#MilmanHenryHart">Henry Hart
							Milman&#8217;s</ref> epic <title>Samor, Lord of the Bright City</title> (1818), reviewed by <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeJohnTaylor">John Taylor Coleridge</ref> in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July
						1818), 328&#8211;347.</note> &#8211; this, might be no great commendation, &#8211; for some of your critics have written in as bad a
					spirit, &amp; with as little comprehension of the primary laws of poetry, as <ref type="m" target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Jeffrey</ref> himself. But this paper is right in feeling &amp; in principle;
					&#8211; Mathurin is properly exposed,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Robert Maturin (1780&#8211;1824;
							<title>DNB</title>), <title>Women: or, Pour et Contre</title> (1818), reviewed by John Wilson Croker in
							<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July 1818), 321&#8211;328.</note> &#8211; tho the manner of the exposure <del>ha is the
						same as</del> has lost its novelty. &#8211; The paper upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#PhillipsRichard">Sir R
						Phillips</ref> is as heavy as the Knight himself.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Sir R. Phillips, on the
							<hi rend="ital">Phenomena of the Universe</hi>&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July 1818), 375&#8211;379, a
						short and humorous piece that took aim at Phillips&#8217;s conceit in attacking Newtonian physics: &#8216;His [Phillips&#8217;s]
						mind, unfettered by prejudice, unincumbered by knowledge, can at one glance, and apparently without any remarkable
						expenditure of thought, see through the fallacies of those systems of philosophy which have till now deluded the
						world, and dive into the secret foundations of nature. He has kindly and boldly determined to communicate his
						discoveries to the world&#8217; (375). Phillips, a strict vegetarian, was notoriously careful about his diet.</note> &#8211; Upon the Northern Courts<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Brown&#8217;s Northern Courts&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July 1818), 379&#8211;390; a review of John Brown (d.
						1826?; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Northern Courts, containing Original Memoirs of the Sovereigns of Sweden
							and Denmark, Since 1766</title> (1818). </note> two things occur to me. p. 386 &#8211; Brown seems to have alluded to a
					most extraordinary fact, which his Reviewer disbelieves,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The reviewer had
						disagreed with Brown&#8217;s statement that &#8216;&#8220;<hi rend="ital">many instances</hi> should occur in Sweden of <hi rend="ital">honest and respectable</hi> persons&#8221; committing crimes with a view to place themselves in a
						predicament where they may fairly be entitled to the aid of clergy, and thereby ensure their future salvation&#8217;,
							<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July 1818), 386. </note> &#8211; but which I perfectly well remember to have read
					of in some Magazine or Ann: Register some thirty years ago, &#8211; the fact being ten or twenty years older than my

						disorder of mind that is extremely dangerous to society. This is an imagination, that, by committing premeditated
						murder, and being afterwards condemned to die for it, they are better able, by public marks of repentance and
						conversion, as they go to the scaffold, to prepare themselves for death, and work out their own salvation. A
						little while ago, one of these wretches murdered a child out of the same principle. In order, however, to take
						from these wretches all hope of obtaining their end, and to extirpate the evil, the king has issued an ordinance,
						by which his majesty forbids the punishing them with death; and enacts, that they shall be branded in the forehead
						with an hot iron, and whipped: that they shall afterwards be confined, for the rest of their days, in an house of
						correction, in order to be kept there to hard labour; and lastly, that every year, on the day of their crime, they
