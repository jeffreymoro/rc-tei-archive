                  publisher John Murray, not by Nicol.</note> to wit that I had received no proof sheet at which I marvelled greatly, that <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> having told me he would put it into Bulmers<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Bulmer (1757&#8211;1830; <title>DNB</title>), famous printer of high-quality publications. On his retirement in

               to take an opportunity of asking <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">M.</ref> about it, when he meant to give it the printer,
               &amp; to say how conveniently you could manage the transmitting certain proofs to certain persons (<hi rend="ital">inter nos</hi> a
               matter of little or no importance, &#8211; but a good ostensible reason for my request concerning the printing, in aid of others.</p>

               that Rodney<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney (1718&#8211;1792; <title>DNB</title>), naval
                  commander. This story is as mythical as the Enchanted Island.</note> was once instructed to search for land to the W. of Ireland &#8211;
               in consequence of the frequent reports about O Breasile the Enchanted Island. I wished <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> to procure for me this fact in an official form, &#8211; that is, the letter &amp; date of the instruction, if it would not
               give him more trouble than it is worth. There is a curious note upon the subject in my first volume of Brazil,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  Breasil, which can be seen from the Isles of Arran.</note> &amp; in the reimpression of that volume, now in the press, I have some
               curious additions to make to it, &#8211; to which I should like to add this.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">See the revised second
                  edition of the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (London, 1822), pp. v&#8211;vi. Southey did not mention the
                  story about Rodney.</note> What else the letter contained I have forgotten, &#8211; except that <del>xxxx</del>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> was unwell at the time &amp; that I was apprehensive the appearance of
               his convalescence was doubtful. That apprehension was well founded, &amp; he had a somewhat severe attack of bilious fever afterwards.
               Now however thank God he is perfectly recovered, &#8211; &amp; a finer creature of his age you never saw. <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> has made an excellent portrait of him.</p>

               rendered them necessary? &#8211; I have been really uneasy at not hearing from you. I have had a severe cold myself, which prevented my

                  He had eleven sons, but the two who Southey met were the youngest: <ref type="m" target="people.html#NoelLeland">Leland Noel</ref>;
                  and Baptist Wriothesley Noel (1798&#8211;1873), later an evangelical clergyman at St John&#8217;s Chapel, Bedford Row 1827&#8211;1848 and then a
                  Baptist Minister. Both were at this time also students at Cambridge.</note> There are some fine things upon the way. When you come

                  different explanations of his motives: that he had been passed over for promotion and was owed money by the government; and that the
                  House of Commons&#8217; Remonstrance of 28 June 1628 had convinced him Buckingham was an enemy of his country. However, Sir Henry Wotton
