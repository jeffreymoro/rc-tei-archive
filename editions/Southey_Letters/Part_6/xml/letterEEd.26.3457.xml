        <p rend="indent1"> Before I see you, you will receive the Life of Wesley,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise
                     and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> whereof only about two sheets
               remain to be printed. Some persons have expressed their expectations that the book
               will have a huge sale; &#8211; I am much more inclined to think that it will obtain a
               moderate sale, &amp; a durable reputation. <del>Xx</del> Its merit will hardly be
               appreciated by any person unless it be compared with what his former biographers have
               done: then indeed it would be seen what they have overlooked, how completely the
               composition is my own, &amp; what pains it must have required to collect together the
               pieces for this <del>xxxxxxx tablet</del> &lt;great&gt; tesselated tablet. The book
               contains many fine things, &#8211; pearls which I have raked out of the dunghill, &#8211; my only
               merit is that of finding &amp; setting them. It contains also many odd ones, &#8211; some
               that may provoke a smile, &amp; some that will touch the feelings. In parts I think
               some of my own best writing will be found. It is written with too fair a spirit, to
               satisfy any particular set of men. For the &#8220;religious public&#8221; it will be too tolerant
               &amp; too philosophical; for the Liberales it will be too devotional: the Methodists
               will not endure any censure of their founder &amp; their institutions; the high
               Churchmen will as little be able to allow any praise of them. Some will complain of
               it as being heavy &amp; dull; others will not think it serious enough. I shall be
               abused on all sides, &#8211; &amp; you well know how little I shall care for it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But there are persons who will find this work deeply interesting, for
               the subjects upon which it touches, <del>xx</del> the many curious psychological
               cases which it contains, &amp; the new world to which it will introduce them. I dare
               say that of the 12000 purchasers of <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murraylemagnes</ref> Review,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Life of Wesley</title> was reviewed in <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 24 (October 1820), 1&#8211;55, by Reginald Heber. This issue was
                  published on 19 December 1820 and sold about 13,000 copies.</note> 999 persons out
               of 1000 know as little about the Methodists as they do about the Cherokees or the
                  Chiriguanas.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Cherokees are a North

               that <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">the Master of the
               Rolls</ref> will like it, &amp; also that he will believe in Jeffrey,

                  experienced to witchcraft. Southey, on the other hand, believed in the existence
                  of ghosts.</note>

               you are ready to ask. I have stuck in it &#8211; I hardly know why: for it is nearly done,
               &amp; what is more, done, as far as it goes, much to my satisfaction. Tomorrow I will
               try at it doggedly: &amp; you may peradventure receive it before I arrive. And yet I
               would rather you should hear it before you saw it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As far as I can foresee my work &amp; my movements, I intend to set
               off on Monday April 17. &amp; to be about 9 or 10 days on the road.</p>
