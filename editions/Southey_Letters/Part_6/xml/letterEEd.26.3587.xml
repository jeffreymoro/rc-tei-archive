                     Judgement</title> (1821).</note> goes by this post, but the frank will be too heavy to take any thing else under its cover, so I
               direct this to <ref type="m" target="places.html#StaffordRow">Stafford Row</ref> first for the purpose of acknowledging the half notes,
               &amp; secondly to have a little talk with you at the distance of three hundred miles.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Poor Hyde!<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Hyde (d. 1820) was Southey&#8217;s London tailor.</note> I am truly sorry
               to hear of his death, my introduction to him by you in 1801, &amp; the scene which followed when he denied the existence of the coat on
               my back, being one of those things not to be forgotten, &#8211; but now no longer to be remembered with the same kind of hilarity. By all
               means pay my bill to the widow; &amp; if the business is continued on her account, she shall have my custom, &#8211; a kind of debt this
               which one owes to an honest man.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Next, when you are near your tea-dealer (N.B. do not go out of your way to do it, but, at your leisure, there being no
               hurry) order for me 24 pounds of souchong at 6/6<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. 3 D<hi rend="sup">o</hi> at 8/. 3 D<hi rend="sup">o</hi> at 10/
               &amp; 6 pounds of green at 10/. If this be paid for when it is bought, I suppose you are entitled to the usual discount of five per
               cent, which is worth asking for.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">Now concerning the Vision. You may growl as much as you like. But before you begin to put on your critical cap, observe with respect to
               the metre, that I write upon the postulate of using in the four first feet of the verse, any foot of two or three syllables: the
               English hexameter in this respect bearing the same loose resemblance to the Latin, that the English heroic verse of ten syllables does
               to the ancient Iambic verse, after which it is sometimes called. This of course is to be explained in the preface.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), &#8216;Preface&#8217;, pp. ix&#8211;xxvii.</note> &#8211; I have tried the verse
               upon ears enough to judge of its effect. Those persons who were most inclined to disapprove, were shaken in their decided prejudice
               against it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> instead of exclaiming against the possibility of the design,
               objected to the quantity of one or two syllables. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesWilliamLisle">Bowles</ref> protested
               against the attempt, &amp; acknowledged its success when he heard the first thirty lines. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> &amp; Barry <del>xxxx</del> Cornwall<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth&#8217;s view of the applicability of hexameters to English was certainly not uncritical; see Southey to William Taylor, 20
                  February 1800, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Two</title>, Letter 491. Bryan Procter (1787&#8211;1874;
                     <title>DNB</title>) wrote under the pseudonym, &#8216;Barry Cornwall&#8217;. Southey possessed presentation copies of his <title>Dramatic
                     Scenes</title> (1819) and <title>A Sicilian Story</title> (1820), no. 617 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> admit it
               to be a legitimate English metre, no ways unsuited to the language. &#8211; You can answer for its effect upon your own ears. No person has
               thought it forced, or uncouth or ludicrous. Recollect I do not propose it as a better metre than blank verse; any more than I should
               offer <del>xxx</del> venison as a better thing than turtle, &#8211; but as something else, there being room for both. Let it be abused, &#8211; I
               care not. I have wished for &lt;more than&gt; twenty years to make the experiment, &amp; the experiment reconciled me to a subject which I
               should otherwise not willingly have taken up.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> may determine whether to print it in common
               quarto or in foolscap quarto.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821) was published as a
                  quarto volume. The &#8216;Preface&#8217; occupied 18 pages, the poem itself ran to 46 pages, and the &#8216;Notes&#8217; and &#8216;Specimens&#8217; a further 31 pages.
                  The poem was printed with a running title and about 20 lines per page, as <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814) had
                  been, and was dedicated to George IV.</note> The poem you see will make 38 pages &#8211; notes &amp; preface may extend it to nine sheets,
               which if a good thick paper be used may make a substantive appearance in boards. If the common quarto be preferred, it must be printed
               in the same type as Roderic, &#8211; with a running title, &amp; twenty lines in a page.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To whom shall I dedicate it? Not to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref> I think, for the
               reason which you gave, &amp; which I anticipated. The <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">great Peter</ref> I hope will pay
               me a visit next summer; &amp; one of these days I will prefix his name to something to which he will have no dislike.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824) was dedicated to Elmsley.</note> &#8211; When you have
               perused the whole, you will judge whether there be any thing in the matter which would make a dedication to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> improper. If there be not, I should like to do it, &#8211; because my blood is up,
               &#8211; &amp; <del>x</del> it would gratify me at this time to wear the Kings colours. Perpend this, if it is to be done, I suppose it would
