        <p rend="indent1"> I have this day received your Latin volume, &amp; in cutting open the leaves (while the other contents of the parcel
               are left unexamined) I find my own name <del>is</del> mentioned in prose &amp; verse in that manner which brings with it the greatest

                  1820), no. 1598 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. It contained two poems addressed to Southey: &#8216;Ad Sutheium&#8217; (p. 123), and
                  &#8216;Ad Sutheium Quum Interciderant Epistolae&#8217; (p. 157). The first poem concerned the death of Herbert Southey. Southey returned the
                  compliment by quoting from Landor&#8217;s book (p. 197) in <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), pp. xix&#8211;xx.</note> &#8211; The

               a fortnight, the title is A Vision of Judgement: &#8211; the personage brought to judgement is the late King, &amp; the verse is a metre
               constructed in imitation of the hexameter.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), prompted

               that, as by the Germans, the trochee is used for the spondee, with the farther alteration of employing any foot of two or three
               syllables in the first place in the verse (for the sake of beginning with a short syllable) &amp; occasionally, but with a rarer
               license, in the second, third or fourth place. I have satisfied my own ear, &amp; that of every person, learned or unlearned upon whom
               the measure has as yet been tried. There is no one &lt;of&gt; whose opinion I stand so much in doubt, as of yours, <del>who</del> for you

          <l rend="indent2">Derwent retaining yet from eve a glassy reflection,</l>

          <l rend="indent2">Under the woods reposed; the hills that calm &amp; majestic,</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Lifted their heads in the silent sky, from far Glaramara,</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Bleacrag &amp; Maidenmawr, to Grizedal &amp; westermost Withop.</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Dark &amp; distinct they rose; the clouds had gatherd above them</l>
          <l rend="indent2">High in the middle air, huge, purple, pillowy masses,</l>
          <l rend="indent2">While in the west beyond was the last pale tint of the twilight; &#8211;</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Green as a stream in the glen whose pure &amp; chrysolite waters</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Flow oer a schistous bed, &amp; serene as the age of the righteous.</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Earth was hushd &amp; still; all motion &amp; sound were suspended;</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Neither man was heard, bird, beast, nor humming of insect</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Only the voice of the Greta, heard only when all is silence.</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Pensive I stood &amp; alone, the hour &amp; the scene had subdued me,</l>
          <l rend="indent2">And as I gazed in the West, where infinity seemd to be open,</l>
          <l rend="indent2">Yearnd to be free from time, &amp; felt that this life is a thraldom.</l>

                  October 1820, Letter 3546. Landor&#8217;s letter had appeared in <title>The Times</title> on 4 December 1820. It related to the conduct of
                  Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of George IV, during the time she was living in Como. In
                  it, Landor insisted, &#8216;whatever I may have heard relating to the Queen, I know nothing positive, and never made a single inquiry that
                  either could inculpate or acquit her in the cause now pending&#8217;. The letter had reached <title>The Times</title> via Landor&#8217;s friend
                  and mentor Samuel Parr (1747&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), clergyman, schoolmaster, writer, Whig and supporter of Queen Caroline.

                  November 1820 Landor had sent Southey a copy of his letter on Caroline of Brunswick, asking him to send it to the

                  Southey, who disagreed with what it said and who took a stance that was violently opposed to Caroline, refused to do so and
                  suppressed it; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 8 January 1821, Letter 3602.</note> The madness is now abating;<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. the public agitation surrounding government attempts to deprive Caroline of the title of Queen and to dissolve
                  her marriage to the King. The Bill of Pains and Penalties that would have accomplished this was withdrawn after its Third Reading in
                  the House of Lords on 10 November 1820, when the government majority of only nine votes had made it very unlikely the Bill could
                  pass the House of Commons. </note> still this is the time for the Catholics to attempt the reestablishment of their religion,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Catholic Emancipation, to which Southey was violently opposed. </note> for if the people of

               intentions, nor more uprightly. The Whigs are acting as basely as they did in the days of Titus Oates.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">The Whigs had supported Titus Oates (1649&#8211;1705; <title>DNB</title>) in his fraudulent claims of a &#8216;Popish Plot&#8217;
