        <p rend="indent1"> During the last year or year &amp; half that I was at Westminster one imposition served me: &#8211; after it was given up
               &amp; laid on the table, it was regularly abstracted either by myself or the &#913;&#957;&#945;&#958; &#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#969;&#957;,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;King
                  of men&#8217;; i.e. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CombeEdward">Edward Combe</ref>.</note> for whom I performed the like service; &amp;
               so it lasted till the appearance of the <hi rend="ital">quartan</hi>
          <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Something occurring every
                  fourth day; in this case, a schoolboy exercise.</note> might have betrayed its history to an observant eye. Something like this I
               have now good hope of effecting with my Official Odes. It was notified to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Shield</ref>
               that one would be required this year; &amp; one having been made ready (which to him is really a serious labour, the mere transcribing
               the music being a weeks work for an industrious copyist!) he is plainly mortified that it has not been called for. I on the other hand,
               am exceedingly well pleased, meaning not to write any thing else upon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Georges Day, as long as this can be kept
               in reserve.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey feared that, as Poet Laureate, he would have to write an annual Birthday
                  Ode, as well as a New Year&#8217;s Ode. George IV chose to celebrate his &#8216;official&#8217; birthday on St George&#8217;s Day (23 April), unless it fell
                  on a Sunday, in which case it would be celebrated on 24 April. For this occasion in 1821, Southey composed the &#8216;Ode for St George&#8217;s
                  Day&#8217;, unpublished until <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), III, pp. 258&#8211;262; it was not performed in 1821,
                  or subsequently, and Southey never wrote another Birthday Ode.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am very glad to hear that you are concerned with the Records, especially if it is likely to accelerate a work so much
               wanted as that of a Corpus Hist.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn was one of the Commissioners on the Public Records of the
                  Kingdom, a body periodically appointed since 1800 to look into the nation&#8217;s archives. He actively supported plans to publish
                  collections of medieval records, as well as series like <title>Statutes of the Realm</title> (1810&#8211;1825).</note> What I fear is that
               it will be very slowly performed, &#8211; which to a man who wishes to make use of it is a serious consideration. These things are best done
               by an efficient Academy, where there are no monastic institutions, or none who maintain a character for erudition. Such an Academy
               might render very great service to British literature, &#8211; but the scheme which was lately talkd of was absurd enough to make the very
               name ridiculous.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The Royal Society of Literature, set up in 1820.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do you know that the late Ld Lansdown<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne
                  (1737&#8211;1805; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1782&#8211;1783.</note> while he was in office transferred some very valuable papers from
               the public records to his own possession? So Lyon of the Record Office<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Lysons (1763&#8211;1819;

               great indignation, he having a <del>xxxx</del> proper sense of the value of such things.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should like to know what your Corpus is to comprehend, &amp; how far you purpose to come down with it. I hope the
               Saxon &amp; Welsh remains may be included, &#8211; with literal Latin versions. You will want more labourers than one. Paley<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey probably meant John Caley (1760&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), Secretary to the Record Commission
