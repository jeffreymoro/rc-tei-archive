          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear R.</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Highland R &amp; B Report, &#8211; the enormous labour of which I can very well understand.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Commission for Highland Roads and Bridges, 9th Report (1821), part of the collection of reports, no.
                  2170 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. It contained lengthy Appendices detailing all the activities carried out since the
                  Commission began work in 1803, for example, Appendix Y, &#8216;Plans and Dimensions of Harbours, Wharfs, and Ferry Piers made or improved
                  under the direction of The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, 1806&#8211;1821&#8217;. Construction of new roads continued until 1828.
                  Southey had viewed these works with Rickman and Telford in August&#8211;September 1819.</note> &#8211; The plans provoke <del>x</del> me by the
               inconvenience &amp; ugliness of their oeconomy. If we are too poor to afford any thing <del>like xxxx</del> ornamental, they might at
               least have been given upon plates the size of the page, as many in each as that size would allow. The Report tells me of much that I
               did not know, &amp; pleasantly reminds me of what I did.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was about to ask you a question which you are more likely than any other person to answer. When was slavery abolished
               in England?<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Slavery was widespread in England in 1066, but seems to have almost entirely died
                  out by 1200. There was no one piece of legislation that created this situation, though the Church strongly disapproved of the slave
                  trade. Southey dealt with the extinction of &#8216;Feudal Slavery&#8217; in <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects
                     of Society</title>, 2 vols (London, 1829), I, pp. 64&#8211;76. </note>
          <del>is</del> was it ever abolished by any specific act? I find
               that a great many villeins emancipated themselves during the wars of Y &amp; Lancaster,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  dynastic conflict for the English throne 1455&#8211;1487, between the houses of York and Lancaster. A villein was a farmer legally tied to
                  a particular place or Lord of the Manor. The system died out in the sixteenth century, a process confirmed by the decision to end
                  any remaining villeinage on Crown lands in 1574.</note> by taking refuge in large towns, &amp; taking advantage of frequent changes
               of property &amp; the general insecurity; &#8211; &amp; I find that when Holinshed compiled his Chronicles, any bondsman setting foot in
               England became free, such being &#8216;the privilege of our country by the especial grace of God, &amp; bounty of our Princes.&#8221;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Raphael Holinshed (1529&#8211;1580; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Chronicles of England, Scotland and
                     Ireland</title> (1577). Southey possessed an edition in the <title>Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland</title>
                  (1807&#8211;1812), no. 654 in the sale catalogue of his library. This quotation is from William Harrison (1535&#8211;1593; <title>DNB</title>),
                     <title>Historical Description of the Island of Britain</title>, which appeared in the expansion of Holinshed&#8217;s
                     <title>Chronicles</title>, 2 vols (London, 1587), I, lines 276&#8211;277.</note> But I do not find when this became law or custom; nor
               can I discover any time, or state of things when such an act was likely to have past.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Dialogues (which I believe I have mentioned to you) lead me to this enquiry, &#8211; &amp; indeed to every thing
               connected with the progress of society in <del>this</del> England.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The progress of my Peninsular volumes depends now upon the Printer.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832). It was printed by Thomas Davison (1766&#8211;1831).</note> I have corrected
               21 sheets, &amp; expect that the first volume will be carried thro the press in the course of the autumn. Whether it will be published
               then, or detained till the whole <del>can be</del> is ready, is as the Booksellers think proper.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Poor King of Portugal &amp; Brazil! His coming to Europe is, I have no doubt, a forlorn hope that he may find an asylum
               in England.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Porto on 24 August 1820 had established a junta to run the
                  country; it declared its intention of organising elections to a Cortes, which were held in December 1820, and demanded John VI
                  (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826) return from Brazil, where the Portuguese court had fled in 1807&#8211;1808. The King reached
                  Portugal on 3 July 1821.</note> &#8211; Were it not for Spain, the business at Lisbon might be settled as easily as at Naples<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">A revolution in Naples in July 1820 had been crushed by the intervention of an Austrian army, which
                  entered the capital on 23 March 1821. Southey suggests foreign intervention would be more difficult in Portugal because Spain was
                  ruled by liberals who had ended royal absolutism and forced the restoration of the Constitution of 1812 in March 1820.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am glad you are satisfied with the Vision<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of
                     Judgement</title> (1821).</note> as a metrical experiment, concerning which different opinions reach me, &#8211; the most conclusive
               being that women readily catch the rhythm &amp; like it. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">The King</ref> took
