					Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I did not receive your friendly letter, &amp; the books which you sent to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref>, till the last week in May, at which time I supposed you would be on
					your voyage homeward.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Ticknor had sailed back to America on 16 April
						1819.</note> Long ere this I trust you will have reached your native shores, &amp; enjoyed the delight of
					returning to your friends after a long absence. Life has few greater pleasures.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have sent me a good specimen of American divinity. I very much doubt whether we have any
					contemporary sermons so good. For tho&#8217; our pulpits are better filled than they were in the last generation, we do
					not hear from them such sound reasoning, such clear logic, &amp; such manly &amp; vigorous composition as in the
					days of South &amp; Barrow.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert South (1634&#8211;1716; <title>DNB</title>),
						Anglican preacher and theologian; Isaac Barrow (1630&#8211;1677; <title>DNB</title>), Anglican preacher and Lucasian
						Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge 1663&#8211;1669.</note> What is said in the Memoir of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Buckminster<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Stevens Buckminster (1784&#8211;1812),
						subject of &#8216;Memoir of Mr. Buckminster&#8217;, <title>Sermons by the Late Rev. J. S. Buckminster</title> (Boston, 1815),
						pp. xxxv&#8211;xxxvi, no. 392 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Buckminster was a Unitarian and a great
						influence on Edward Everett.</note> of the unimpassioned character of our &lt;printed&gt; sermons is certainly true, &#8211;
					the cause of it is to be found in the general character of the congregations for which they were composed, &#8211; always
					regular church-going people, &#8211; persons of wealth &amp; rank, &#8211; the really good part of the community, &amp; the
					formalists &amp; Pharisees; none of whom would like to be addressed by their Parish Priest as miserable sinners
					standing in need of repentance. Sermons of country growth seldom find their way to the press; in towns the ruder
					classes seldom attend the church service, &#8211; in large towns because there is no room for them: &amp; indeed
						<del>both</del> in country as well as town, the subjects who are in the worst state of mind &amp; morals never
					enter the Church doors. Wesley &amp; Whitefield<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791;
							<title>DNB</title>) and George Whitefield (1714&#8211;1770; <title>DNB</title>), founders of Methodism.</note> got at
					them by preaching in the open air, &amp; they administered drastics with prodigious effect. Since their days a more
					impassioned style has been used in the pulpit, &amp; with considerable success. But the pith &amp; the sound
					philosophy of the elder divines are wanting. Your Buckminster was taking the right course. The early death of such
					a man would have been a great loss to any country</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have sent me also a good specimen of American politics in the works of Fisher Ames.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Fisher Ames (1758&#8211;1808), <title>Works of Fisher Ames</title> (1809), no. 43 in
						the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Ames was a lawyer and an arch-conservative Federalist Representative from
						Massachusetts.</note> I perused them with great pleasure, &amp; have seldom met with a more sagacious writer. &#8211; A
					great proportion of the words in the American Vocabulary<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">John Pickering
						(1777&#8211;1846), <title>A Vocabulary; or Collection of Words and Phrases which have been supposed to be Peculiar to
							the United States of America</title> (1816), no. 2238 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> are as
					common in England as in America. But provided a word be good, it is no matter from what mint it comes. Neologisms
					must always be arising in every living language; &amp; the business of <del>our</del> criticism should be, not to
					reprobate them because they are new, but to censure &lt;such&gt; as are not formed according to analogy, or which are
					merely superfluous. The authority of an English Reviewer passes on your side of the Atlantic for more than it is
					worth; with us the review of the last month or the last quarter, is as little thought of as the last weeks
					newspaper. You <del>x</del> must have learnt enough of the constitution of such works to know that <del>in</del>
					upon questions of philology they are quite unworthy of being noticed. &#8211; The manner is which they are referred to in
					the Vocabulary led me to this, &amp; this leads me to the criticisms upon Bristed &amp; Fearon&#8217;s books in the
						Q.R.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Bristed (1778&#8211;1855), <title>America and her Resources</title>
						(1818) and Henry Bradshaw Fearon (c. 1793&#8211;1842), <title>Sketches of America: A Narrative of a Journey of Five
							Thousand Miles Through the Eastern and Western States of America</title> (1818). Both books were reviewed,
						vituperatively, by John Barrow (1764&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (January
						1819), 1&#8211;25 and 124&#8211;167.</note> I know not from whom they came, but they are <del>xxxxxxx of them</del> not in a
