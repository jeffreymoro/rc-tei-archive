                  under the title <title>Carmen Triumphale, for the Commencement of the Year 1814: Carmen Aulica. Written in 1814, on the Arrival of

                  This &#8216;Postscript&#8217; had originally been written in 1818 as a response to Brougham&#8217;s reported attack on Southey from the hustings on 30
                  June 1818 during the General Election contest in Westmorland.</note> &#8211; The first poem<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e.
                  &#8216;Carmen Triumphale&#8217;, the first poem in the 1821 volume.</note> is a respectable copy of task verses, &#8211; originally it was something
               better, but the conclusion not being thought proper for an official poem, because negociations with Buonaparte were then going on, the
               ode was cut in half, &amp; sprouted like a polypus, a new tail growing to the &lt;one&gt; portion which was published with my name as
                  P-L;<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s first Laureate ode &#8216;Carmen Triumphale&#8217; had a complex history, which he
                  outlines here. The first version of the poem had contained a rousing finale that called on the people of France to rise up and
                  assassinate Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French 1804&#8211;1814, 1815). This was clearly a potential embarrassment to the
                  government, and in late 1813 these parts of the poem were removed on the advice of Croker and Rickman. A heavily revised version of
                  the poem was published by Longman as <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> on 1 January 1814. </note> &#8211; &amp; a new head to the other,
               which I sent anonymously to the newspapers, &amp; which is now to be found in the second volume of my Minor Poems.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The material removed from &#8216;Carmen Triumphale&#8217; in late 1813 formed the basis of a second ode, &#8216;Who
                  counsels peace&#8217;, which was published in the <title>Courier</title> on 3 February 1814. This was not issued in Southey&#8217;s official
                  capacity as Poet Laureate, and was therefore free (in principle at least) from the restrictions that post imposed on him. It had
                  been retitled &#8216;Ode, Written During the Negociations with Buonaparte, In January 1814&#8217; and included in <title>Minor Poems</title>, 3

        <p rend="indent1"> I wish you could have given me a more chearful account of your own mercantile concerns, in which you are made so

                  liberal revolution in Portugal in August 1820 had led to the election of a Cortes in December 1820 and demands for the monarchy to
                  return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807&#8211;1808.</note> The progress of revolution is not likely to be rapid there, &#8211; the desire
               for it at Pernambuco was confined to the movers, &amp; to a few great proprietors.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">There was an

               beginning with the popular feeling in his favour. The disposition that has been indicated of uniting with Spain is also in favour of
               the Government, because it will provoke a Portugueze spirit; &amp; if they only keep within bounds, till the Spaniards advance in their
               career, &amp; plunge into all the horrors of revolution, that example may give them a timely warning. &#8211; In your case what I hope &amp;
               trust is that your brother will wind up his affairs with the Government as soon as possible, &amp; secure himself against any other
