							The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 359&#8211;360
						[undated]. Note on MS: The letter is a reply to that sent by Shelley, 26 June 1820. Southey&#8217;s letter survives

          <salute rend="indent0"> Sir,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have done me justice in believing that I am not the author of the criticism in the Quarterly
					Review upon the Revolt of Islam.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">In a letter of 26 June 1820, Shelley had
						accused Southey of writing a hostile review of <title>Laon and Cythna, or the Revolution of the Golden
							City</title> (1818; published late 1817) and <title>The Revolt of Islam. A Poem, in Twelve Cantos </title>(1818);
						see Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin and
						London, 1881), pp. 358&#8211;359. This review had appeared in the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (April 1819),
						460&#8211;471. It concluded with an ad hominem attack that suggested the reviewer knew a great deal about Shelley&#8217;s
						personal affairs: &#8216;if we might withdraw the veil of private life, and tell what we <hi rend="ital">now</hi> know
						about him, it would be indeed a disgusting picture that we should exhibit, but it would be an unanswerable comment
						on our text; it is not easy for those who <hi rend="ital">read only</hi>, to conceive how much low pride, how much
						cold selfishness, how much unmanly cruelty are consistent with the laws of this &#8220;universal&#8221; and &#8220;lawless love.&#8221;
						But we must only use our knowledge to check the groundless hopes which we were once prone to entertain of him&#8217;
						(471). The article had, moreover, described Shelley as &#8216;an unsparing imitator&#8217; and <title>The Revolt</title>&#8217;s
						language and versification as a &#8216;copy&#8217; of Southey&#8217;s, though &#8216;altogether more luxuriant and ornate than the
						original&#8217; (461). Shelley was mistaken in attributing the review to Southey, who had a policy of not reviewing
						contemporary poetry. Its author was John Taylor Coleridge. </note> I have never in any of my writings mentioned
					your name, or alluded to you even in the remotest hint, either as a man, or as an author. Except the Alastor<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Alastor; or, the Spirit of Solitude</title> (1816), no. 2547 in the sale
						catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Shelley had sent Southey a copy on 7 March 1816, accompanied by a letter that
						stated his admiration for Southey &#8216;as a poet&#8217; and acknowledged the gap between their &#8216;moral and political
						opinions&#8217;; see Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title>
						(Dublin and London, 1881), p. [357].</note> which you sent me, I have never read or seen any of your publications
					since you were at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Shelley had visited Keswick, and met Southey, from November 1811 until February 1812. Initially somewhat taken
						with one another, mutual disillusionment had soon set in.</note> The specimens which I happen to have seen in
					reviews &amp; newspapers have confirmed my opinion that your powers for poetry are of a high order &#8211; but the manner
					in which those powers have been employed is such as to prevent me from feeling any desire to see more of
					productions so monstrous in their kind &amp; so pernicious in their tendency. You perceive Sir that I speak as I
					think, and therefore you will not ascribe my ready and direct denial of the criticism to the sort of menace which
					your note conveys &#8211; nor understand it as acknowledging in any man a right to call upon me for such a denial upon no
					better grounds than a mere suspicion which he or his friends may chuse to entertain. Those friends of yours who
					have persisted in affirming that I am the author can have had no other grounds; they have committed the gross
					impropriety of affirming positively what they could not possibly know to be true, &amp; what happens to be
					absolutely false. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I reply to you Sir because I cannot think of you without the deepest compassion. Eight years ago
					you were somewhat displeased when I declined disputing with you upon points which are beyond the reach of the human
					intellect telling you that the great difference between us was, that you were then nineteen &amp; I was eight &amp;
					thirty. Would that the difference were no greater now! You wrote to me when you sent me your Alastor that as you
					tolerated my opinions, you supposed I should tolerate yours.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A paraphrase of
						Shelley&#8217;s letter of 7 March 1816: &#8216;believing that you [Southey] have so much general charity as to forget, like
						me, how widely in moral and political opinions we disagree, and to attribute that difference to better motives
						than the multitude are disposed to allege as the cause of dissent from their institutions&#8217;, Edward Dowden (ed.),
							<title>The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin and London, 1881), p.
						[357].</note> Few persons are less intolerant than myself by disposition as well as by principle but I cannot
					admit that any such reciprocity is justly to be claimed. Opinions are to be judged by their effects &amp; what has
					been the fruit of yours? Do they enable you to look backward with complacency or forward with hope? Have you found
					in them a rule of life conducive either to your own happiness, or to that of those who are most nearly and dearly
					connected with you? Or rather have they not brought immediate misery upon others &amp; guilt &#8211; which is all but
					irremediable, on yourself.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">A direct reference to Shelley&#8217;s abandonment of
						his first wife, <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyHarriet">Harriet</ref>, and her subsequent
						suicide.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The tone of your letter gives me a right to address you thus &amp; there is one passage in it
					which induces a hope that I may not be addressing you in vain, for it appears that deadly as your principles have
					proved, they have not yet wholly hardened your heart. Attend I beseech you to its warnings. Do not let any feeling
					of pride withold you from acknowledging to yourself how grievously &amp; how fatally you have erred. You rejected
					Christianity before you knew, before you could possibly have known, upon what evidence it rests: how utterly unlike
					in this &amp; in every other respect to the superstitions &amp; fables of mens devices with which you in your
					presumptuousness have classed it. Look to that evidence while you are yet existing in time, &#8211; &amp; you may yet
					live to bless God for any visitations of sickness <del>xx</del> &amp; suffering which by bringing you to a sense of
					your own miserable condition may enable you to hope for forgiveness &amp; teach you where to look for it. God in
					his infinite mercy bring you to this better mind!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This is not the language of party animosity or of personal ill will. Of the latter you will at
					once acquit me, &#8211; &amp; if you do not acquit me as readily of the former it is because you do not know me enough,
					&amp; are too much under its influence yourself. I can think of you only as of an individual whom I have known
					&amp; of whom I once entertained high hopes, admiring his talents &amp; giving him credit for good feelings &amp;
					virtuous desires, &amp; whom I now regard not more with condemnation than with pity. Believe me therefore to be </p>
