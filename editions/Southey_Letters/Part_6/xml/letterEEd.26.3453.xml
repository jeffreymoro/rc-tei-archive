                     Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> is fairly carried thro the press, because in correcting the proof sheets,
               it is very necessary to have ones documents at hand. It is about a month since I desired <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> to hurry the printer, (Strahan)<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Andrew
                  Strahan (1749&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>) was MP for various constituencies 1796&#8211;1820 and ran a highly successful printing
                  business.</note> &amp; this he has attempted to do, but with so little effect, that I have not a proof for the last ten days. The
               whole of the copy is in his hand, except a few notes, which are merely kept back till the text is printed, that I may know how to
               arrange them. There are, as nearly as I can calculate twelve or thirteen sheets yet to print. If he compleats these in the course of
               four weeks, by that time, I shall have rid my hands of other work, some of which is hanging heavy upon them.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> Of all versifyers I verily belief that I am the most
               unfit to be employed upon occasional subjects. For I have an insuperable <del>objection</del> dislike to treat commonplace themes in a
               commonplace way, &#8211; &amp; the result <del>x</del> naturally is that I neither satisfy myself &#8211; nor any one else.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the present instance I have made so bold an attempt in metre, &amp; so successful a one in my own judgement, as far
               as it has gone, that I wish the subject had been different;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great
                  Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) had died on 29 January 1820, thus providing Southey&#8217;s subject. The finished poem exceeded 600
                  lines.</note> &#8211; for the subject it is which makes it hang upon hand, I have written 200 lines, <del>wh</del> but this hardly
               expresses the quantum unless you call to mind that such lines must be estimated by measure as well as by tale. Some three or fourscore
                  <del>xxx</del> more may bring it to an end; &#8211; &amp; then perhaps so long a time may have elapsed that it may be thought better to
               withhold it altogether, rather than come so long after the occasion. This would be no loss, as if it be printed I shall only have my
               labour for my pains. But if it lies by me, it may acquire value by keeping. I shall finish it as soon as I can, &amp; take council
               concerning the publication, with perfect indifference as to the result. But I am satisfied with the experiment.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the course of next week I shall send the first vol. of Brazil to the press.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819) was published in 1822.</note>
          <ref target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> says it will be wanted as soon as it can be printed. The latter part I shall
               correct at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> should have returned to London before my departure, my
               only stoppage on the road will be at Ludlow, where I shall remain about three days. It is an awkward place to get at, for there are so
               many stages to change upon the way.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We have had a death in the house, &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">an excellent old woman</ref>, whom we
               found here, seventeen years ago, &amp; who to the great comfort of her latter years, attached herself to us, &amp; took as much
               interest in the children as if they had been of her own blood. Of her little money she has left them five pounds each, &#8211; &amp; has made
               me one of her Executors. We had all of us a great regard for her, &#8211; &amp; tho latterly from her great age &amp; growing infirmities,
               she had become an object of anxiety, we feel her release as a loss to ourselves.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I shall be glad to see the boys, &#8211; I expect to find them all greatly altered, but <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillEdwardJnr">Edward</ref> the least. <ref target="people.html#HillRobertSouthey">My namesake</ref> will be just
               of a proper age to ride pocko, a feat which <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> has not yet
               achieved. &#8211; At present thank God the children are all well, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">the young
                  one</ref> especially thrives as we could wish, &amp; promises well. He is backward with his feet, but appears to have plenty of
               strength, &amp; to want nothing but aptitude, which will come in due time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is an ill-wind that blows nobody good. But the event which gives you your black cloth, is likely to cost me as much
               in fees for a new sign manual as it will save you in clothes.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Following George III&#8217;s death many
                  people were expected to go into mourning and wear black &#8211; no great hardship for clergymen as this was the usual dress for many of
                  them. However, the King&#8217;s death put Southey to some expense. The Royal sign-manual is the sovereign&#8217;s signature on an order or
                  warrant; the death of George III and accession of George IV meant Southey was required to pay fees for a new court document
                  confirming his appointment as Poet Laureate.</note>
