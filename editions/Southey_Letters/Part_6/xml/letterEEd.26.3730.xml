        <p rend="indent1"> Dont rub your eyes at that word Bedford, as if you were slopey. &lt;The purport of&gt; this letter which is to be as precious
               as the Punic scenes in Plautus,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Titus Maccius Plautus (c. 254&#8211;184 BC), Roman playwright. His
                     <title>Poenulus</title> (c. 195&#8211;189 BC) contains two speeches in Punic, the language of Carthage, which would have been
                  unintelligible to a Roman audience, but preserved a rare example of the language.</note> is <del>xxxxxx in</del> &lt;to <del>convey
                  the</del> give you some account tho but an imperfect one of the language spoken in this house by&gt; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridge</ref>
          <del>s language</del>, &lt;&amp; invented by her&gt;, a
               vocabulary of which I have carefully composed by the help of <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">her
                  daughter</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">mine</ref>, when she has been red-raggifying in full
               confabulumpatus. True it is that she has called us &lt;persecutorums, &amp;&gt; great improprietors for performing this meritorious
                  <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;task&gt;; &amp; has often told me not to be such a stuposity; threatening us sometimes that she will never say
               anything that ends in lumpatus again; &amp; sometimes that she will play the very dunder; &amp; sometimes bidding us get away with our
               toadywidferings. And she asks me how I can be such a Tom-noddycum &lt;(tho my name as she knows is Robert)&gt; &amp; calls me detesty, a
               mafrum, a goffrum, a chatterpye, a sillycum, &amp; a great mawkinfort.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But when she speaks of you it is with a kinder meaning. You are not a vulgarum, nor a great ovverum govverum; the
               appellations which she has in store for you are either words of direct endearment, or of that <del>kind</del> &lt;sort&gt; of objurgation
               which is the playfullest mood of kindness. Thus you are a Stumparumper, because you are a shortycum; &lt;&amp; you are&gt; a wattlykin, a
               tendrum, &#8211; a detestabumpus, &amp; a figurumpus. These are the words which come from her chapset when she speaks of you; &amp; you need
               not be told what they signifump.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I dare say you have set up a whickerandus at this, &amp; I hope you will not be dollatory in expressing the
               satisfaction which you derive from knowing that you are thus decidedly in her good graces. Perhaps you may attempt an answer in the
               same strain, &amp; show yourself none of the little blunderums who deserve to be bangated, but an apt pupolion which if you do you will
               deserve to be called as clever as De-Ciiggle.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Great light has been thrown upon the philosophy of language by Humboldt<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#8211;1859), German geographer, naturalist and explorer, especially in Latin America, who Southey may have
                  confused with his brother, William von Humboldt (1767&#8211;1835), linguist, author of <title>Researches into the Early Inhabitants of
                     Spain by the Help of the Basque Language</title> (1821) and expert on native American languages.</note> the traveller, who if we
               consider the variety &amp; the extent of his attainments may justly be considered the most accomplished of living men. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Duponceau<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Stephen Du Ponceau (1760&#8211;1844), authority on native American
                  languages.</note> of New York is treading <del>upon</del> &lt;in&gt; his steps. From their researches &amp; those of our countrymen in
                  India<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">For example, Sir William Jones (1746&#8211;1794; <title>DNB</title>), &#8216;On the Chinese&#8217;,

                     Asia</title>, 2 vols (London, 1792), I, 209&#8211;234.</note> it appears that &lt;there&gt; are two kinds of languages essentially different
               from those of Europe; the monosyllabic, which prevails in China &amp; the adjacent countries; &amp; the polysynthetic to which the
               various languages of the American Tribes belong.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Du Ponceau had invented the term
                  &#8216;polysynthetic&#8217; to describe native American languages in his &#8216;Report of the Corresponding Secretary to the Committee, of his
                  Progress in the Investigation Committed to Him of the General Character and Forms of the Languages of the American Indians: Read,

                  (1819), xvii&#8211;xlvi, no. 63 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Du Ponceau referred to Wilhelm von Humboldt&#8217;s work in this
                  article and the two men later corresponded.</note> It is much to be regretted that <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Coleridges</ref> new language is not in like manner &lt;investigated&gt; by some profound philologist. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSamuelTaylor">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Coleridge</ref> perhaps by <del>xxxxxxx</del> &lt;the&gt;
                  <del>xxxxxxx</del> application of Kants<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Immanuel Kant (1724&#8211;1804), German philosopher, much
                  admired by Coleridge.</note> philosophy might analyze &amp; discover the principles of its construction. I tho an <del>xxxxxly</del>
               a diligent &amp; faithful observer, &lt;must confess that I&gt; have but little insight into it. I can indeed partly guess why
                  <del>asses</del> donkeys in this language are called jacks, &amp; why peck is a nose; why some part of an Elephants trunk is a
               griper, but not why it is a snipe; why nog is a lump, bungay a bundle, &amp; why trottlykins should stand for childrens feet; &#8211; but not
               why my feet &amp; yours should be opprobriously termed hocksen &amp; hormangorgs. So too when I hear needles called nowgurs, &#8211; ladies,
               laduls, whispering, twistering, &#8211; vinegar, wiganar, &amp; a mist fogogrum, or fogrogrum, I have some glimpse, tho but a glimpse, of the
               principle upon which these neologisms are introduced. I can perceive also the analogies by which the new vocabulary is to be extended;
               for example, pie being called pie-&#299;e-&#299;e; it follows that pudding should be pudding-&#363;dding-&#363;dding. And a pew being called pewdiddledoo,
               to be consistent, we should speak of the Churchdiddledurch, the Clerkdiddlederk, &amp; the Parsondiddledarson, &#8211; only that this might
               appear disrespectful to the Vicar.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But I should in vain seek to discover the <hi rend="ital">rationale</hi> of other parts of this speech, though I were
               to study the subject till I were as tired as a dogs detested hinder. And tho I get at the meaning by asking an explanation, still no
               clue to the <del>x xxx</del> derivation is afforded. Thus for instance when it was said don&#8217;t roakin there &amp; I desired to know what
               was intended by this <del>xxxx</del> prohibition, the answer was &#8216;every body says roakin&#8217;, &amp; when I prest for farther explanation,
               I was informed that roaking was digging &amp; grumping in a work-box. So too on the way from M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Calverts<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Calvert, n&#233;e Mitchinson (dates unknown).</note> one evening, I was desired to stop till she
               had gathered up her doddens; &amp; that word was interpreted to mean a plaid, a pair of pattens &amp; an umbrella. If my foot happens
               to touch her chair, I am told that anything whidfetting the chair makes her miseraboble. If the children &#8211; the childer&#333;pusses I should
               say, are bangrampating about the house, they are said to be rudderish &amp; roughcumtatherick. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthberts</ref> mouth is called sometimes a jabberumpeter, sometimes a towsalowset. When
               the word comfortabuttle is used, I suppose it may be designed to mean that there is comfort in a bottle. But by what imaginable process
               of language and association Snoutarumpeter can be, as she declares it to be, a short way of calling Mother I am altogether unable to
               comprehend.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> On one occasion however I was fortunate enough to see this extraordinary language, if I may so express myself, in the
               mint, &amp; in the very act of its coinage. Speaking of a labourer, she said &#8211; the Thumper, the What-dye-callder, &#8211; the Undoer &#8211; I cant
               hit upon it! &#8211; the cutter-up. &#8211; these were the very words received &amp; noted as they came fresh from the die; &#8211; &amp; they meant a
               man who was chopping wood.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must now bring this letter to a conclusion. The account indeed is very incompleat, but you may rely upon its
               fidelity. And tho of necessity I have spelt the words according to their pronunciation, I hope that this has not occasioned any
               disvuegurment, &amp; that none of them in reading will stick in your thrapple. The subject cannot be so important to you, as it is to
               me, who live in a house where this language is spoken &amp; therefore have been obliged to <del>acquire some knowledge</del> pay
               attention to it. Yet it will not <del>be</del> &lt;appear&gt; altogether <del>uninteresting to you</del> &lt;incurious&gt;, connected as it is with
                  <del>the philosophy of language</del> &lt;the science of philology&gt;; &amp; perhaps your regard for the inventor may give it a more than
               ordinary interest in your eyes.</p>
