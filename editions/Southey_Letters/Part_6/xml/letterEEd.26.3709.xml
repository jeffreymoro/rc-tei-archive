               a difficulty in the way, because he could only have a high situation.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Negotiations had started in June 1821 to bring the
                  followers of Lord Grenville, including Wynn, over to the government. Wynn was
                  their most prominent spokesman in the House of Commons, and it was always intended
                  he would receive a Cabinet post. However, Wynn wished to be Home Secretary or
                  Secretary for Ireland and for there to be a wider reshuffle, including moves to
                  include some Whigs. He did not finally take up the post he had initially been
                  offered, President of the Board of Control, until January 1822.</note>

                  Commons. He finally became a Commissioner at the Board of Control 1822&#8211;1826 and

                  a member of the Irish Revenue Commission on 15 June 1821, the first public sign of
                  a possible juncture between the Grenvillites and the government, and held a
                  variety of posts down to 1830.</note> The latter has got something, &amp; I rather
