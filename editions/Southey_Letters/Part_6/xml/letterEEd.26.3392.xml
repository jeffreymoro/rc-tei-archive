        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wish for your sake that the next few months were over &#8211; that you
               had passed your examination, and were quietly engaged in the regular course of
               parochial duty.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">White had taken the
                  decision to give up his work in the hosiery trade and pursue a clerical career. He
                  enrolled at Peterhouse, Cambridge, on 26 June 1819 to study for a Bachelor of
                  Divinity degree as a &#8216;ten-year man&#8217;, i.e. a part-time, mature student (he
                  graduated in 1829). However, White was more immediately concerned with his
                  approaching ordination examination, which required knowledge of Greek, Latin,
                  works of divinity and the Bible; he duly passed and was ordained as a Deacon on 12
                  December 1819, becoming a Curate at St Edmund the King, Norwich.</note>
          <hi rend="ital">In labore quies</hi> you know is the motto which I borrowed from my
               old predecessor Garibay.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;In labour is
                  rest&#8217;, the motto on Southey&#8217;s seal. He had borrowed it from the prolific Spanish
                  historian, Esteban de Garibay y Zamalloa (1533&#8211;1600).</note> It is only in the
               discharge of duty that that deep and entire contentment which alone deserves to be
               called happiness is to be found, and you will go the way to find it. Were I a bishop,
               it would give me great satisfaction to lay hands upon a man like you, fitted as you
               are for the service of the altar by principle and disposition, almost beyond any man
               whom I have ever known. I have long regarded it as a great misfortune to the Church
               of England that men so seldom enter it at a mature age, when their characters are
               settled, when the glare of youth and hope has passed away; the things of the world
               are seen in their true colours, and a calm and sober piety has taken possession of
               the heart. The Romanists have a great advantage over us in this.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You asked me some time ago what I thought about the Manchester
                  business.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre on 16
                  August 1819, when at least eleven people were killed after local magistrates
                  ordered the dispersal of a huge radical meeting in Manchester.</note> I look upon
               it as an unfortunate business, because it has enabled factious and foolish men to
               raise an outcry, and divert public attention from the great course of events to a
               mere accidental occurrence. That the meeting was unlawful, and in <hi rend="ital">terrorem populi</hi>
          <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;To the terror of
                  the people&#8217;; a legal phrase used in indictments for riot.</note> is to me
               perfectly clear. The magistrates committed an error in employing the yeomanry instead
               of the regulars to support the civil power; for the yeomanry, after bearing a great
               deal, lost their temper, which disciplined troops would not have done.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">When the Manchester magistrates ordered the arrest
                  of the main speakers at the meeting at St Peter&#8217;s Field on 16 August 1819, the
                  task was delegated to the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, a body of upper-class
                  local volunteers; they began to attack the crowd indiscriminately, and the crowd
                  responded by throwing brickbats at the Yeomanry. Finally, the meeting was
                  dispersed by regular troops, primarily the 15th Hussars.</note> The cause of this
               error is obviously that the magistrates thought it less obnoxious to employ that
               species of force than the troops, &#8211; a natural and pardonable mistake. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is no longer a question between Ins and Outs, nor between Whigs
               and Tories. It is between those who have something to lose, and those who have
               everything to gain by a dissolution of society. There may be bloodshed, and I am
               inclined to think there will before the Radicals are suppressed, but suppressed they
               will be for the time. What may be in store for us afterwards, who can tell? According
               to all human appearances, I should expect the worst, were it not for an abiding trust
               in Providence, by whose wise will even our follies are overruled.</p>
