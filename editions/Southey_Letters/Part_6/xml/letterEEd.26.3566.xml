        <p rend="indent1"> I trust by this time that you have received certain books of yours,
               which had been some time in my possession, &amp; of which I have made considerable
               use. They are all with which you had entrusted me, three excepted which I still
               retain, viz. Sir T. More&#8217;s works,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">An
                  edition of the writings of Sir Thomas More (1478&#8211;1535; <title>DNB</title>), which

                  acquired editions of 1618 (no. 3672 in the sale catalogue of his library) and 1733

                     de Todos los Santos en Brasil</title> (1628). Southey later owned two editions,
                  nos 3747 and 3748 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> From the first I
               have a great many extracts to make, &amp; the last will speedily be required for

        <p rend="indent1"> You will have heard that I am preparing for a Life of George Fox, an
               intention which has already excited some sensation throughout Quakerdom.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The plan was to follow his controversial

                  of the Society of Friends. Southey had wanted to keep this under wraps, but news
                  leaked out via his friend Mary Calvert, n&#233;e Mitchinson (dates unknown), who had
                  been born a Quaker. It was greeted with some concern, occasioning letters from
                  Quakers and a visit from Elizabeth Fry (1780&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), the Quaker
                  philanthropist and prison reformer; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 27
                  October 1820, Letter 3544. Their alarm was groundless, as Southey&#8217;s life of Fox
                  was not written.</note> It is a curious subject &amp; has wide ramifications. The
               introductory chapter will contain a view of religious dissentions in England, &amp;
               their consequences, from the rise of the Lollards, to the days of G. Fox.</p>
