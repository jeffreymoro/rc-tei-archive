        <p rend="indent1"> You may imagine with what pleasure I find myself once more at my desk
               by my own fire-side, after so long an absence &amp; so fatiguing a course of life as
               that from which I have escaped.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey
                  had spent the months of May and June 1820 in London.</note> I found all well, God
               be thanked. The children are perfectly recovered from the measles &amp; all its
               consequences. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Your god-daughter</ref> is
               looking as well as I could wish to see her. She thanks you for your present, &amp;
               will wear it on high days &amp; holy days with more pleasure &#8211; for the donors sake. I
               very much &lt;wish&gt; that you could see this girl, &amp; see enough of her to know her
               character. You would be pleased with it in all points. She has a quickness of
               comprehension which is quite delightful: &#8211; frankness, perfect simplicity, lively
               feelings all of the right kind, &amp; a love of <del>all</del> &lt;those&gt; useful womanly
               employments, which are perfectly compatible with <del>the</del> every womanly
               accomplishment but are worth all the accomplishments in the world. I could not have
               had a daughter more after my own heart. The other three, tho all as different as
               sisters can well be from each other, promise excellently well, each after her
               kind.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">

               His hair has learnt to curl, &amp; he has begun to walk alone. A few minutes seemed
               to bring me to his recollection, &#8211; &amp; when the book was produced &amp; I talked to
               him in the respective languages of Rhinoceros, the Hyena, the Lynx the Eagle, the
               Cuckoo &amp; the Serpent, he became presently as fond of me as he had been before my
               departure.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our journey was remarkably fortunate, tho I was disappointed on not
               finding <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt</ref> at Birmingham. She had
               reached Bristol but was deterred by the heat from attempting to proceed. When <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> &amp; I embarked in the Mail at the Green
               Man &amp; Stile,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">An inn on Oxford Street,
                  from where mail coaches and wagons left for the Midlands.</note> the thermometers
               in the window of the Optician next door, were standing at 85, &amp; this at eight o
               clock in the evening! Yet as soon as we were fairly out of town, there was just
               breeze enough to refresh us, &amp; about one in the morning, I was wakened by the
               rain coming in upon my face. A good thunder shower laid the dust &amp; compleatly
               cooled the atmosphere. We slept the next night at Birmingham in the house of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">Charles Lloyds father</ref>, &amp; on
               Friday morning proceeded in the Manchester Mail. When we reached Manchester there was
               only room for one inside, &amp; one out, in the Kendal mail, &amp; that only as far
               as Preston, where the chance of getting places for the remainder of the journey
               depended upon the coach which was to join this mail, from Liverpool. To pass a night
               however at a Manchester Inn is so great an evil, that putting <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> in the inside, I mounted the roof at nine o clock at night. It was a
               threatening sky, &amp; both my great coats (an old one &amp; a new) were quietly
               lying packed up for the waggon in London. I cannot tell by what <del>good</del> happy
               adaptation <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash&#8217;s</ref> great coat was found to fit me
               perfectly well in every thing, except in length, which was of no consequence. The
               moon rose about eleven, &amp; to my great delight <hi rend="ital">comio poco a poco
