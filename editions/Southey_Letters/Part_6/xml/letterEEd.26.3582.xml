        <p rend="indent1"> I shall have a poem to send you in the course of a few weeks, planned upon occasion of the King&#8217;s
					death (which you may think no very promising subject), laid aside eight months ago, when half written, as not
					suited for publication while the event was recent, and now taken up again, and almost brought to a conclusion. The
					title is, &#8216;A Vision of Judgment.&#8217;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title>
						(1821), prompted by the death of George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820;
						<title>DNB</title>).</note> It is likely to attract some notice, because I have made &#8211; and, in my own opinion,
					with success &#8211; the bold experiment of constructing a metre upon the principle of the ancient hexameter. It will
					provoke some abuse for what is said of the factious spirit by which the country has been disturbed during the last
					fifty years; and it will have some interest for you, not merely because it comes from me, but because you will find
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry&#8217;s</ref> name not improperly introduced in it.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 11, lines 68&#8211;73, where Henry Kirke
						White appeared among the &#8216;Young Spirits&#8217;.</note> My Laureateship has not been a sinecure: without reckoning the
					annual odes, which have regularly been supplied, though I have hitherto succeeded in withholding them from
						publication,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">This was not quite accurate. The first of the New Year Odes
						Southey produced in his capacity as Poet Laureate &#8211; <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> &#8211; had been published in 1814.
					</note> I have written, as Laureate, more upon public occasions<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had
						commemorated the following: the visit of the allied sovereigns in June 1814 (<title>Congratulatory Odes</title>
						(1814)); the marriage of Princess Charlotte of Wales (<title>The Lay of the Laureate. Carmen Nuptiale</title>
						(1816)); and the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 (<title>The Poet&#8217;s Pilgrimage to Waterloo</title> (1816)). He
						had, however, not been required to write a Birthday Ode for the monarch until the accession of George IV in 1820,
						and he did not go on to commemorate the coronation of 1821. </note> (on none of which I should otherwise have ever
					composed a line) than has been written by any person who ever held the office before, with the single exception of
					Ben Jonson, if his Masques are taken into the account.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Ben Jonson

						of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), the estranged wife of George IV, who had returned to London on 6
						June 1820. Her arrival and the series of events that followed, as attempts were made to deprive her of the title
						of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King, made her a figurehead for radicals, and also triggered public
						protests in her support across the country.</note> has reached <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, as well as all other places; and the people here, who believe, half of them, that the <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">King</ref> concealed his father&#8217;s death ten years for the sake of
					receiving his allowance, and that he poisoned the <ref type="m" target="people.html#WalesCharlottePrincess">Princess Charlotte</ref> (of which, they say, there can be no doubt; for did not the doctor kill himself?<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales had died in childbirth on 6 November 1817.
						Sir Richard Croft, 6th Baronet (1762&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>), the man-midwife and one of the physicians who had
						attended the Princess, was much criticised for not intervening earlier in the delivery. In January 1818, while
						attending a similar case, Croft shot himself. At the inquest that followed, it was revealed that a copy of
							<title>Love&#8217;s Labour&#8217;s Lost</title> had been found in the room with his corpse, and that it was opened on the
						page containing the line &#8216;Good God, where is the Princess?&#8217;.</note> and why should he have done that if it had not
					been for remorse of conscience?), believe, with the same monstrous credulity, that the Queen is a second
						Susannah.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In <title>Daniel</title> 13, Susannah is a virtuous wife who is
						falsely accused of sexual misconduct.</note> The Queenomania will probably die away ere long; but it will be
					succeeded by some new excitement; and so we shall go on as long as our Government suffers itself to be insulted and
					menaced with impunity, and as long as our Ministers are either unwilling or afraid to exert the laws in defence of
					the institutions of the country.</p>

            <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and

					without leading some persons both to think and to feel as they ought. In more than one instance I have had the
					satisfaction of being told that my papers in the Quarterly Review have confirmed some who were wavering in their
					opinions, and reclaimed others who were wrong &#8230;</p>
