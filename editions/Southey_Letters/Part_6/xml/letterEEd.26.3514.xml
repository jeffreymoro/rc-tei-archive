        <p rend="indent1"> Some old Divine has said that Hell is paved with good resolutions;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A proverb of
                  very long standing; it has been traced back to St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090&#8211;1153).</note> &#8211; if Beelzebub has a tesselated pavement
               of this kind in one of his state rooms, I fear I shall be found to have contributed largely to its unsubstantial materials. But that I
               may save one good resolution at least from being trodden under hoof by him &amp; his imps, here I begin the performance, hoping rather
               than promising even to myself, that I <del>shall</del> &lt;may&gt; find leisure &amp; courage to pursue it to the end, &#8212; courage, I mean, to
                  <del>write of</del> live again in remembrance with the dead. There <del>were</del> are certain Savages <del>who never mention</del>
               &lt;among whom&gt; the name of a deceased person is never mentioned; some superstition may have attached to this custom, but the feeling in
               which it originates is a natural one. My children<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In July 1820, five of Southey&#8217;s children were
                  living: four daughters, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref>, and an only son <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>, who was still an infant and had been born three years after the death of his brother Herbert. </note> never

               prayers, without some special cause, acting upon me like a moral obligation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I begin <del>xx</del> in the cloudy evening of a showery, lowering, ungenial day. No <del>very</del> desirable omen for
               one who is about to <del>write</del> record the recollections of six &amp; forty years, but a most inappropriate one in the present
               case. For I have lived in the sunshine, &amp; am still looking forward with hope.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot trace my <del>fathers</del> family farther back by the Church Registers than Oct 25. 1696 on which day my
               grandfather Thomas,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Southey (1696&#8211;1777), a farmer. The parish register at Wellington,
                  Somerset, ancestral home of the Southeys, went no further back than 1683, as Southey had discovered in his fruitless investigations
                  into the will of John Cannon Southey (d. 1768), under which he had hoped to have some claim on the Fitzhead estate; see Southey to
                  Henry Herbert Southey, 28 February 1820, Letter 3447.</note> ye son of Robertt Sowthey &amp; Ann his wife<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey (1670&#8211;1726) and his wife Anne Locke (b. 1675).</note> was baptized at Wellington in Somersetshire. The
               said Robert Sowthey had seven other children,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Southey (b. 1698); John Southey (b. 1700);
                  Ann Southey (b. 1701); Robert Southey (b. 1703); Mary Southey (b. 1704); Hannah Southey (b. 1706); and William Southey (b.
                  1708).</note> none of whom left issue, &amp; in the subsequent entries of their birth (for Thomas was the eldest) he is designated
               sometimes as yeoman &amp; sometimes as farmer. The Register at Wellington goes back only to the year 1683. But I have heard that
               Roberts grandfather<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Southey (1545&#8211;1601), though he had eleven <title>children</title>
                  (six sons and five daughters) rather than eleven sons. He was a successful clothier at Wellington, Somerset.</note> (that is my
               great-great-great-grandfather) was a great clothier at Wellington, &amp; had eleven sons, who peopled that part of the country with
               Southeys. In Roberts days there were not less than seven married men of the name in the same parish. Robert himself was the younger of
               two sons, &amp; John<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey (1666&#8211;1728), a lawyer.</note> his elder brother was the head
               of the family. They <del>were</del> must have been of gentle blood, (tho so obscure that I have never by any accident met with the
               name) for they bore arms in an age when armorial bearings were not assumed by those who had no right to them. The arms are a chevron
               argent, &amp; three cross crosslets in a field sable. I should like to believe that one of my ancestors had served in the crusades, or
               made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">These arms were certainly displayed on Southey family monuments
                  in Fitzhead and Bishops Lydeard churches in the eighteenth century. The legend that the three crosslets represented the three
                  crusades that a Southey ancestor had embarked on was much-repeated.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One of them left behind him the reputation of having been a great soldier, in the great rebellion<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The English civil war of 1642&#8211;1651.</note> I guess it must have been, &#8211; but I neither know his name, nor
               on what side he fought. Another, (&amp; this must have been the Robert with whom my certain knowledge begins) was out in Monmouths
                  rebellion.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth (1649&#8211;1685; <title>DNB</title>), illegitimate

        <p rend="indent1"> My grandfather settled at Holford Farm, an estate belonging to his Uncle John, in the parish of Lydiard S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Laurence, about ten miles North of Taunton, under the Quantock Hills. This is a very retired place, containing only three

               became troublesome, away went his wife to the poor old woman with a tale about writs, bailiffs, the jail, &amp; the jail-fever; &amp;
               in this manner was she continually fleeced, &amp; kept in continual fear, till the rascal died at last of close attendance at the

        <p rend="indent1"> The removal from Wellington to a lonely village seems to have brought my Grandfather within the pale of the Church, for
               he had been bred up as a Dissenter. (The old sword therefore was probably pursuing its old courses when it went into the field in
               rebellion.) Aunt Hannah however retained so much of the essential acid of dissent in her composition, that she frequently chastized

                  book wherein they had been &#8220;flourished&#8221; was frequently preserved; to the son it became a point of comparison, and an object of
                  blameless emulation; to the father it brought back the remembrance of his youth; and though the Arabians tell us that &#8220;the
