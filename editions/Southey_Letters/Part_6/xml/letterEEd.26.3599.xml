        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> The half-bills are safe. &#8211; While that word serves as a catch-word for my recollection, let me say
					that poor Hyde&#8217;s bill<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Hyde (d. 1820) was Southey&#8217;s London tailor.</note> has
					been sent to me, &#8211; by mistake perhaps for you, &#8211; the amount is 15.13&#8211;6. When you pay it, enquire if the business is
					to be carried on. If it is not I shall be at a loss how to get a new coat in the spring.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am very glad you like the last part of the Vision best,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821); a poem in hexameters, dedicated to George IV.</note> &#8211; because
					being better pleased with the first part <del>itself</del> &lt;myself&gt;,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <del>itself</del> &lt;myself&gt;,: deletion and insertion possibly in another hand.</note> we like the whole
					between us, which is a good Hibernian conclusion. As for the metre it has been tried upon ears enough to convince
					me that it will have its admirers, &amp; if the Gods would <del>but</del> allow, might excite a wholesome
					controversy concerning its merits. The question of dedicating it is of no consequence, &#8211; unless it be necessary to
					ask permission, which I suppose is not the case. If I can strike off a few sentences to my own satisfaction, well
					&amp; good: &#8211; if not, why it may go without them. Your hit about the life guardsmen is a very good one.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Concerning the Ode<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s duty as Poet Laureate was to
						produce a New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1821; his ode was later published as &#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode II&#8217; in <title>The
							Englishman&#8217;s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National Information</title> (London,
						1824), pp. 384&#8211;389.</note> my intention is to print it with others of the same family, as seasoning to the
					Dialogues, or Colloquies, (as I rather incline to call them)<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir
							Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> &#8211; which with the
					local descriptions, &#8211; the sort of Montaigne-ishness,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Michel de Montaigne
						(1533&#8211;1592), <title>Essais</title> (1580), also a series of short treatments of various subjects, derived from a
						classical model, and with a strong element of personal reflection. </note> the fine prints from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westalls</ref> drawings,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Six prints
						from Westall&#8217;s drawings were included in <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of
							Society</title> (1829).</note> &amp; the good solid matter for which these things are to serve as garnish, will I
					hope make a very attractive book. &#8211; If however you would rather see the said Ode come forth while it is in full
					season (tho I fear the season will last quite long enough!) &#8211; it may be printed with the Vision, &amp; help to
					stuff the book. It gratifies me that you like it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The word to which you object is quite scriptural. Your objection however has led me to improve
					the second line by substituting <del>xxx xxxx xx</del>
          <hi rend="ital">relenting</hi> instead of <hi rend="ital">uplifted</hi>. <note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In &#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode II&#8217;, line 181, Southey did
						change &#8216;uplifted&#8217; to &#8216;relenting&#8217;. The poem was not printed with <title>A Vision of Judgement</title>
						(1821).</note> If you advise it to be printed with the Vision, let me know in your next, &amp; I will make a
					transcript for the press, a process which generally produces some corrections, <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;that&gt; fully
					repay the trouble. I might insert also the last years ode &#8211; tho sans doubt the Whore would be interpreted to mean
					Queen Caroline.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode I&#8217;,
