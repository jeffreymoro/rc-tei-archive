        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for <ref type="m" target="people.html#DIsraeliIsaac">D&#8217;Israeli&#8217;s</ref> note, &amp; am well pleased to find
               that other opinions accord with that which he, in his abundant good nature, has been pleased to express. It is the first of my papers
               which has ever been printed without mutilation. One alteration only has been made to it. I had said that Hampden might have left a name
               scarcely inferior to that of Washington, &amp; this has been altered to <hi rend="ital">a memorable name</hi>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">This paragraph deals with Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Life of Cromwell&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 25 (July 1821), 279&#8211;347
                  (293). Southey&#8217;s comparison was between George Washington (1732&#8211;1799; President of the United States 1789&#8211;1797) and John Hampden
                  (1594&#8211;1643; <title>DNB</title>), Parliamentarian and opponent of Charles I (1600&#8211;1649; King of Great Britain 1625&#8211;1649;
                     <title>DNB</title>).</note> The meaning of the sentence is thus destroyed, for his name <hi rend="ital">is</hi> memorable, but it
               is not, like Washingtons, deservedly held in reverence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To enlarge this sketch into a popular history of Cromwells life might be a useful task, &amp; would be a pleasant
                  one.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write a fuller biographical account of Oliver Cromwell (1599&#8211;1658; Lord
                  Protector 1653&#8211;1658; <title>DNB</title>).</note> But it could not be done in less compass than the life of Nelson,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Life of Nelson</title> (1813), an expansion of his article in <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 3 (February 1810), 218&#8211;262.</note> &amp; I could not make use of more of the sketch than was done in that
               instance. A moments reflection will convince you of this. I am willing to do it as soon as the Book of the Church<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> is finished, &#8211; &amp; this will go to the

                  (January 1822), 277&#8211;323. Her book was a translation of Martin Dobrizhoffer (1717&#8211;1791), <title>Historia de Abiponibus Equestri,

               with your character for liberality in such transactions, I shall be glad to accept it. Otherwise I will share the eventual profits. &#8211;
               Provision for my family there will be, whenever I may be removed to a better world; my copy-rights, my papers, &amp; a life
