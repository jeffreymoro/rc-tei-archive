                  produced a further round of legal tangles over the Fitzhead estate in Somerset, which Somerville had inherited and on which Southey
                  felt he had some claim. However, a legal opinion that Southey had received on the matter was not very hopeful; see Southey to
                  Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 28 March 1820, Letter 3459.</note> I am not sanguine on this score, &#8211; but in other things I am going
