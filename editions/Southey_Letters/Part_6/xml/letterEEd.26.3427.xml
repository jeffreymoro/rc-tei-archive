						January 1820, containing a great deal of information on the history and finances of the Church of England. Southey
						was collecting information to expand his review of Benjamin Haydon, <title>New Churches, Considered with Respect
							to the Opportunities they Offer for the Encouragement of Painting</title> (1818) and other volumes, which
						appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 23 (July 1820), 549&#8211;591; see Southey to John Murray, 19 October 1819,
						Letter 3368.</note> My knowledge is never so ready as yours. The less you trust your memory the worse it serves
					you, &amp; for the last five &amp; twenty years I have hardly trusted mine at all; the consequence has been that I
					must go to my notes for every thing, except the general impression &amp; conclusions which much reading leaves
					behind.</p>

						1812&#8211;1823, drew attention to statistics collected on the deficiency of Church of England places of worship and
						proposed &#163;1,000,000 be spent on constructing new churches. This proposal was embodied in the Church Building Act
						(1818).</note> &#8211; Your letter gives me notices &amp; views which I had not found, or had failed to observe

        <p rend="indent1"> I must borrow from some of the Black-letter-men Sir T Mores works,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The works of Sir Thomas More (1478&#8211;1535; <title>DNB</title>), Lord Chancellor 1529&#8211;1532 and
						opponent of the Reformation, required for Southey&#8217;s <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and
							Prospects of Society</title> (1829). Southey later acquired More&#8217;s <title>Opera Latina</title> (1565), no. 1918
						in the sale catalogue of his library. Black letter was the Gothic script used in European books until the
						seventeenth century. Such books were usually expensive, so Southey hoped to borrow an edition of More&#8217;s work from
						a bibliophile. He eventually borrowed a copy from Richard Heber; see Southey to Richard Heber, 25 November 1820,
						Letter 3566.</note> which are tolerably numerous: &#8211; &amp; when I am in London I must ask you to turn me loose for
					two or three mornings among the Statutes at Large,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Owen Ruffhead

					backward. There is something about the process of sheep farming in those days which I am not sure that I
					understand. The double grievance is complained of, that it <del>destro</del> appropriated commons, &amp; turned
					arable land into pasture. How could this latter commutation answer in a country where the demand must have been as
					great for meal &amp; malt, as for wool &amp; mutton? &#8211; What I perceive this, &#8211; that down to the union of the Two
						Roses,<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">The union of the Houses of York and Lancaster in 1485 on the
						accession of Henry VII.</note> men were the best stock that <del>xxxx or xxxxxxx</del> &lt;a Lord&gt; could have upon
					his estates. &#8211; But when the age of rebellions, disputed successions &amp; chivalrous war was over, money became of
					more use than men, &amp; the question was not who could bring most vassals into the field, but who could support
					the largest expenditure, &#8211; &amp; in Sir T. Mores &lt;day&gt; the expenditure of the fashionables was infinitely beyond
					any thing that is ever heard of in ours. So I take it that they did as the Great Cat<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland (1758&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), fantastically wealthy

						(1765&#8211;1833; <title>DNB</title>), and gained control of her vast landholdings in northern Scotland. The Chief of
						Clan Sutherland was traditionally known as &#8216;The Great Cat&#8217;. Southey commented on the programme of Highland
						clearances on the Sutherland estates in his journal for 6 September 1819, <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in
							1819</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (London, 1819), pp. 136&#8211;139.</note> is now doing, &#8211; got rid of

        <p rend="indent1"> Guessing in the dark about Spain, the likeliest event seems to be that Ferdinand will be shut up
					in a convent as <del>an</del> non compos, &#8211; &amp; one of his brothers placed at the head of a constitutional
						government.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833) had
						restored royal absolutism in 1814. A mutiny at Cadiz on 1 January 1820 among troops who were to be sent to fight
						the revolutionaries in South America eventually led to Ferdinand VII agreeing, on 10 March 1820, to restore the
						liberal Constitution of 1812. However, he never accepted this situation and royal absolutism was restored by a
						French invasion in 1823. It would not have helped to reconcile Spain&#8217;s political differences if Ferdinand had been
						replaced by either of his brothers, Charles, Count of Molina (1788&#8211;1855) or Francisco, Duke of Cadiz (1794&#8211;1865),
						as Charles was a determined reactionary and, while Francisco was more moderate, he always supported his brother,
						Ferdinand VII.</note> A scheme of this kind would not be unpopular. But if the insurrection is headed by the
					fierce Liberales, they will put him to death, &amp; the Spaniards will show us that they never-do-things by halves,
					&#8211; for their civil war would exceed all others in obstinacy &amp; in vengeance. The former is the more likely. I
					apprehend the discontent of the army proceeds from want of pay, &amp; this is no fault of Ferdinands. Whoever, or
					whatever government may succeed him, will find the same impossibility of raising money in a country without
					manufactures, without industry, wealth or credit: &#8211; Spain was getting all these when the French Revolution broke
					out &amp; in its consequences destroyed them all.</p>
