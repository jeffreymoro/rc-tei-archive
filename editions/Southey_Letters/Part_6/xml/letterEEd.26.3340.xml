        <p rend="indent1"> I have behaved very ill in having so long delayed replying to a Lady&#8217;s letter, &amp; that letter
					too one which deserved a ready &amp; a thankful acknowledgement.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Ann
						Attersoll had sent Southey a copy of her play, <title>Peter the Cruel King of Castile and Leon: an Historical Play
							in Five Acts</title> (1818).</note> Forgive me. I am not wont to be thus discourteous, &#8211; &amp; in the present
					instance there has been some excuse for it. For <del>it</del> your letter arrived at a time of much anxiety. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">My wife</ref> had a three months illness after the birth of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">a child</ref>, &#8211; &amp; during that time it was as much as I
					could do to force my attention to business which could not be left undone. My heart was not enough at ease to be
					addressing you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The number of unknown correspondents whom I have had in my time, does not lessen my desire of
					seeing you, nor <del>xxxxxx</del> &lt;abate&gt; that curiosity which men feel as strongly as women, &#8211; except that they
					have not the same leisure for thinking of it. &#8211; There is <del>xxxxxded</del> mention of a namesake of yours in one
					of John Wesleys<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>) kept an
						extensive journal, some of which (though not this entry) Southey was able to draw on for his <title>The Life of
							Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820); see <title>The Works of the Rev. John
							Wesley</title>, 3rd edn, 14 vols (London, 1829&#8211;1831), IV, p. 196.</note> Journals, for the year 1781. He says
						&#8220;Jan<hi rend="sup">y</hi> 23 I went to Dorking, &amp; buried the remains of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Attersal, a
					lovely woman, snatched away in the bloom of youth: I trust it will be a blessing to many, &amp; to her husband in
					particular.&#8221; The latter part of the sentence might be taken in a very different meaning from what the writer
					intended. The name is so peculiar a one that I suppose it to be the same as yours, &amp; that Wesley has mis-spelt
					it; &#8211; &#8211; but this brings me no nearer you than to induce a guess that Surry may be your country. You tell me that
					the whole of your happiness is dependent upon literary pursuits &amp; recreations. It is well that you have these
					resources, &#8211; but were we near each other, &amp; were I to like you half as well upon a nearer acquaintance, as it
					appears to me at this distance that I should do, &#8211; I think that when I had won your confidence I should venture to
					tell you that something better than literature is necessary for happiness.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To confess the truth, one of the causes which have prevented me from writing to you earlier has
					been the wish &amp; half-intention of touching upon this theme, &#8211; checked by that <del>xxxx xxxxxxxx thought</del>
					sort of hesitation which sometimes (&amp; that too often) prevents us from doing what we ought, for fear of
					singularity. That you are a woman of talents I know, &#8211; &amp; I think you would not have given me the preference
					over more fashionable poets, if there had not been something in the general character of my writings which accorded
					with your feelings, &amp; which you did not find <del>elsewhere</del> in theirs. But you have lived in
						<del>the</del> high life, &#8211; you move in circles of gaiety &amp; fashion, &#8211; &amp; tho you sympathize with me when I
					express myself in verse, it is more than probable that the direct mention of religion may startle you, as something
					unwarranted as well as unexpected.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am no Methodist, no Sectarian, no Bigot, no Formalist. My natural spirits are buoyant beyond
					those of any person man, woman or child, whom I ever saw or heard of. They have had enough to try them &amp; to
					sink them &amp; it is by religion alone that I shall be enabled to pass the remainder of my days in chearfulness
					&amp; in hope. Without hope there can be no happiness, &amp; without religion no hope but such as deceives us. Your
					heart seems to want an object, &#8211; &amp; this would satisfy it: &#8211; <del>it</del> if it has been wounded, &#8211; this &amp;
					this only is the cure.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Are you displeased with this freedom? &#8211; Or do you receive it as a proof that <del>xxx</del> I am
					disposed to become something more than a mere literary acquaintance, &#8211; &amp; that you have made me feel an interest
					concerning you which an ordinary person could not have excited?</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> has damned himself by the licentiousness
					of his Don Juan, &amp; the unmanly manner in which he has insulted his wife.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819&#8211;1824); the first two cantos were published anonymously on 15 July 1819. The
						&#8216;Dedication&#8217;, which attacked Southey and others, was suppressed. It soon became very well known, though it was not
						published until 1833. Southey disliked <title>Don Juan</title>&#8217;s &#8216;licentiousness&#8217;, calling it &#8216;a foul blot in the
						literature of this country, &#8211; an act of high treason in English poetry, for which the author deserves damnation&#8217;;
						see Southey to Walter Savage Landor, 20 February 1820, Letter 3443. Dona Inez, the mother of Don Juan, was seen as
						a thinly veiled portrait of Byron&#8217;s estranged wife, Anne Isabella [Annabella] (1792&#8211;1860; <title>DNB</title>). As
						was pointed out in the <title>London Literary Gazette and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences,
							&amp;c.</title>, 130 (17 July 1819), [449]: &#8216;It has been the fashion to make an application of Lord Byron&#8217;s
						portraits to living characters; and we fear that some of his nearest connexions will be recognised in these
						sketches&#8217;.</note> There is something fiendish in this mans nature, &#8211; &amp; his genius will serve only to
					perpetuate his name for infamy. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> is very ill. He
					suffers dreadfully, &#8211; but bears his sufferings with admirable equanimity, &amp; looks on to the probable
					termination of them with calmness &amp; well-founded hope. The immediate danger is from spasms in the stomach, &#8211;
					gall stones I believe are the cause. God grant that he may recover. He is a noble &amp; generous-hearted creature,
					whose like we shall not look upon again.</p>
