        <p rend="indent1"> When I wrote to thank you for Montgomerys Poems,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Poems of Alexander Montgomery: With
                     Biographical Notices, by D. Irving</title> (1821). The volume, a presentation
                  copy from Laing, was no. 1981 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library; see
                  Southey to David Laing, 29 August 1821, Letter 3720.</note> I did not know to whom
               I was writing. A note which <ref type="m" target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Henry Robinson</ref> left for me during my
               absence, made me first apprehend that you are the M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Laing with
               whom I had half an hours pleasant &lt;conversation&gt; in 1819, when I laid my hand on two
               books relating to Brazil, after having for many years sought them in vain.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had visited Laing&#8217;s Edinburgh bookshop
                  during his Scottish tour of 1819. He had found there two books he had long sought.
                  The first was Marin le Roy de Gomberville (1600&#8211;1674), <title>Relation de la
                     Rivi&#232;re des Amazones</title> (1682), no. 7 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
                  library &#8211; the book was a translation of Crist&#243;bal Diatrist&#225;n de Acu&#241;a (1597&#8211;c.
                  1676), <title>Nuevo Descubrimiento del Gran R&#237;o de las Amazonas</title> (1641).
                  The second volume Southey purchased was Francois Cauche (1616&#8211;1699),
                     <title>Relations Veritables et Curieuses de l&#8217;Isle de Madagascar et du
                     Bresil</title> (1651), no. 2363 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
                  library.</note> And I now learn from <ref type="m" target="people.html#FeldborgAndreas">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Feldborg</ref> that
               this apprehension was right.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am much obliged to you for your offer of assistance in my
               Quaker-collections, &amp; shall be very thankful for any materials with which you can
               supply me. The materials for a view of the rise &amp; progress of Quakerism must be
               picked out from a prodigious mass of rubbish.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Laing had offered to supply materials for Southey&#8217;s planned, but unexecuted,
                  life of George Fox (1624&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>), the founder of the Society of
                  Friends (Quakers). </note> But the object is worth the labour; &amp; interesting
               facts are not unfrequently found where they are least to be expected.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Whenever you may be disposed to make this place in your way to or
               from London, I shall be very glad to have an opportunity of showing my sense of your
               civilities. Present my remembrances to your father.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The bookseller and publisher William Laing (1764&#8211;1832;
                     <title>DNB</title>), whom Southey had first met in Edinburgh in 1805.</note> I
               learnt the curious device which Whitefield used for his seal, from the letter which
               he gave me.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">George Whitefield (1714&#8211;1770;
                     <title>DNB</title>), leader of the Calvinistic Methodists. As Southey explained
                  in <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2
                  vols (London, 1820), II, p. 599: &#8216;The device upon Whitefield&#8217;s seal was a winged
                  heart soaring above the globe, and the motto <title>Astra petanius</title>. The
                  seal appears to have been circular, and coarsely cut. A broken impression is upon
                  an original letter of his in my possession, for which I am obliged to Mr. Laing,
                  the book seller, of Edinburgh.&#8217;</note>
