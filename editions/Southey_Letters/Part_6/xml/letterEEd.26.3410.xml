					story has not the slightest foundation, nor can I guess how it should have arisen, unless <del>that</del> &lt;it&gt; be
					that a paper of mine upon the New Churches which was printed a year ago, has been sent back to me with a wish that
					I would enlarge it &#8211; but there is not a word about the Catholic Question there.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Benjamin Haydon, <title>New Churches, Considered with Respect to the
							Opportunities they Offer for the Encouragement of Painting</title> (1818) appeared in <title>Quarterly
							Review</title>, 23 (July 1820), 549&#8211;591. It does not deal with Catholic Emancipation.</note> In truth I should
					most gladly have entered into that question in all its bearings long ago, if I had not known how impossible it was
					to obtain admission for opinions such as mine upon the subject in the Q. R. &#8211; I am as little pleased as you can be
					with the manner in which <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> mutilates whatever is sent
					him, upon no imaginable principle, &amp; as far as I can discover, in most cases, for no other reason, than that of
					indulging a habit which he cannot help. He has repeatedly promised me that he would not do it, &amp; yet every one
					of my papers comes forth castrated from under his hands. It would be a great satisfaction to me if I could do
					without this Review, &amp; at present there seems to be some probability that my connection with it may be broken
					off, however great the immediate inconvenience. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> has
					thought proper to send me a less sum for my last paper<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of
						Thomas Fosbrooke (1770&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), <title>British Monachism; or, Manners and Customs of the Monks
							and Nuns of England</title> (1817), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), 59&#8211;102, published 11
						December 1819.</note> than I chuse to accept for it. I therefore sent the draft back to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, from whom it came, treated the matter as a mistake (as indeed
					at first I really supposed it to be) &amp; told him I expected an hundred pounds, <del>for the paper. For</del> Six
					posts have elapsed, &amp; I have received no reply. I shall wait patiently, &amp; let him chew the cud as long as
					he pleases. But if the answer when it comes is not what it ought to be, the QR. shall never <del>contain another
						line</del> receive another communication from me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This will leave me very much abroad for my ways &amp; means at first. However this is of no great
					consequence, &#8211; I shall make my way somehow or other, &amp; probably more to my own contentment at the end.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is not unlikely that one of the first things which I may undertake will be a little volume in

							Great Britain</title> (1743&#8211;1752), no. 1432 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> might have passed
					for your likeness? I am not the only person who has perceived it. &#8211; I have a good deal to say upon the dangers
					&amp; the prospects of society, &amp; have thought a good deal upon the parallel circumstances of this age &amp; of
					Henry 8-ths<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry VIII (1491&#8211;1547; King of England 1509&#8211;1547;

						<del>his were</del> Sir Thomas More&#8217;s were in his day. The fiction would have the double advantage of relieving
					the subject, &amp; allowing me to bring forward views &amp; opinions which it might <del>be</del> not be advisable
					directly to avow.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will set about reading your Oraisons Funebres<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Valentin

							Comedy</title> (1308&#8211;1321).</note> than of any other poet. &#8211; One of my plans which I have for some years
						<del>been</del> looked forward to as a work worthy of great pains &amp; likely to recompense the labour bestowed
					upon it is a view of the Age of George 3. a work in which, avoiding all detail because of the almost <del>xx</del>
					immensity of the subject, I should seize the prominent features &amp; general results trace things to their causes,
					&amp; look forward to their consequences. Three or perhaps four octavos volumes would comprize it, &amp; this is a

							<title>The Faerie Queene</title> (1590&#8211;1596), which uses stanzas of nine lines, the first eight in iambic
						pentameters and the ninth an iambic hexameter.</note> which stanza is exceedingly difficult for a man who is not
					satisfied unless what he writes will bear the test of <del>xxx</del> a strict examination. Thirty years ago I could
					write it as rapidly as any other measure, &#8211; &amp; at that time I planned &amp; made some progress in a continuation

					character of the story, &amp; I am entirely contented with what is done.</p>
