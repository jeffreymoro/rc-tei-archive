					from one in whose poems there is so much to approve &amp; admire.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard
						Barton&#8217;s <title>A Day in Autumn; a Poem</title> (London, 1820) carried an epigraph from Southey: &#8216;It was a day
						that sent into the heart/ A summer feeling&#8217;, from <title>Madoc</title> (1805), Part One, Book 13, lines 67&#8211;68; and
						an extended Dedication to &#8216;Robert Southey, Esq.&#8217;, pp. v&#8211;vii.</note> I thank you for this mark of kindness, &amp;
					assure you that it is taken as it is meant.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It has accidentally come to my knowledge that a brother of yours is married to the daughter of my
					worthy &amp; respected friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#SmithThomasWoodruffe">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
						Woodruffe Smith</ref>.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton&#8217;s half-brother, the economist John
						Barton (1789&#8211;1852; <title>DNB</title>), was married to Ann Woodruffe Smith (d. 1822). The Smiths were friends of
						Grosvenor Bedford&#8217;s family; Southey had visited them at Stockwell Park.</note> When you have an opportunity, it
					would oblige me if you would recall me to her remembrance by assuring her that I have not forgotten the kindness
					which I so often experienced at her fathers house.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Perhaps you may consider it an interesting piece of literary news to be informed that, among my
					various employments, one is that of collecting &amp; arranging materials for the Life of George Fox<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">George Fox (1624&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>), founder of Quakerism. Southey did not
						write this book.</note> &amp; the Rise &amp; Progress of the Quakers. You know enough of my writings to understand
					that the consideration of whom I may please or displease would never make me turn aside from what I believed to be
					the right line. I shall write fairly &amp; freely, in the spirit of Christian charity. My personal feelings are
					those of respect toward the Society (such as it has been since its first effervescence was spent) &amp; of good
					will because of many of its members whom I have known &amp; esteemed. Its history I shall relate with scrupulous
					fidelity, &amp; discuss its tenets with no unfavourable or unfriendly bias, neither dissembling my own opinion when
					it accords, nor when it differs with them. And perhaps I may expose myself to more censure from others on account
					of the agreement, than from them because of the difference. But <del>the one</del> neither the one result nor the
					other will in the slightest degree influence me: my object being to compose with all diligence &amp; all possible
					impartiality an important portion <del>of</del> not of Ecclesiastical History alone, but of the History of human
					opinions.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will only add that in this work I shall have the opportunity which I wish for, of bearing my
					testimony to the merit of your poems.</p>
