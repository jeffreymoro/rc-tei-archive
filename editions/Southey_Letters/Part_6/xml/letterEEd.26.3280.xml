					my packages, in company with books, old cloaths &amp;c.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have had a dismal time since you heard from me. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has had one ailment after another from the time of her delivery,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Charles Cuthbert Southey</ref> had been
						born on 24 February 1819.</note> &amp; is now confined with an abscess, large as a hens egg, &amp; hard as a
					board, so that it may be long before it is in a state to be discharged. It is now a fortnight since it first
					appeared. I am less apprehensive of the consequences than I was, seeing that her general health bears up
					wonderfully well, tho she is in bed 18 hours out of the 24, &amp; scarcely able to sit for the tumour. <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> thinks it the termination of <del>xxx</del> &lt;a long&gt;
					inflammatory dia thesis.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A hereditary or constitutional predisposition to a
						disease.</note> Had it not been for this I think I should have been able to fix my departure for the first week in
					May &#8211; but I cannot leave home till she is in a state <del>which</del> of evident convalescence, &#8211; &amp; meantime
					anxiety has slackened my <del>head</del> hand. Not that I have been idle, &#8211; indeed far from it, &#8211; but that I have
					done less than would have been done if my mind had been at ease.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope it will not delay me above a week or ten days beyond my intended time. But even if I were
					in town I certainly should not go to the Westminster meeting.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">An annual
						reunion of ex-pupils at Westminster School, the school that Southey had attended 1788&#8211;1792.</note> The chance of
					seeing some half dozen men with whom I might like to exchange a few words of recognition &amp; shake hands, would
						<del>xx</del> not make amends <del>for</del> for the melancholy recollection of those whom I lovd better, &amp;
					need to see at the same time. &#8211; Moreover I have an absolute hatred of all public meetings, &amp; would rather go
					without a dinner, than eat it in such an assembly. I went to the Academys dinner,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">As Poet Laureate, Southey was invited to, and attended, the Anniversary Dinner of the Royal Academy
						on 3 May 1817. He did not meet William Smith at this occasion.</note> for the sake of facing the <ref type="m" target="people.html#SmithWilliam">Slander-Smith</ref>, &#8211; but I go to no more such.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My wish will be to see as much of my friends as I can, &amp; as little of my acquaintance, &#8211;
					&amp; therefore I mean to refuse all such invitations as would throw me among strangers, or indifferent persons,
					except in cases where I owe something for civilities received. For I do not want to see Lions, &amp; still less do
					I desire to be exhibited as one, &amp; go where I should be expects to open my mouth &amp; roar.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is another reason why I would not attend the Westminster Meeting. As I never went during
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#VincentWilliam">Vincents</ref> life, it might seem as if I felt myself at
					liberty to go there now, &amp; had not done so before. Whereas so far was I from harbouring any resentment toward
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#VincentWilliam">Vincent</ref>, or any unpleasant feeling of any kind, that I
					have long, &amp; with good reason, looked upon my expulsion from Westminster as having been in its consequences the
					luckiest event of my life. And for many years I should have been glad to have met the old man, in full persuasion
					that he would not have been sorry to have met with me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had a beautiful letter yesterday from poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> &#8211; who has been on the very brink of the grave, &#8211; &amp; feels how likely it is that any day, or
					hour may send him there.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Walter Scott to Southey, 4 April 1819, John Gibson
						Lockhart, <title>Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott</title>, 7 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), VI, pp.
						237&#8211;241.</note> If he is sufficiently recovered I shall meet him <del>for</del> &lt;in&gt; London. But his health is
					broken beyond all prospect or hope of compleat recovery. He intreats me to take warning, &amp; beware of
					over-working myself. I am afraid no person ever took that advice who stood in need of it. And still more afraid
					that the surest way of bringing on the anticipated evil, would be to apprehend it. &#8211; But I believe that I manage
					myself well, by frequent change of employment, frequent idling, &amp; keeping my mind as free as I can from any
					strong excitement</p>
