        <p rend="indent1"> I am busy from morning till night, &amp; very much tired with visiting every day, walking about so much &amp; seeing so
               many people. So you must not wonder if I should not have time to finish this sheet, nor if I cannot write so nice a letter as that from
                  <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>, where I had time &amp; leisure. Tell your <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">Aunt Coleridge</ref> that of all people in the world Joey Lock<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified, but possibly an old acquaintance from Bristol.</note> called upon me yesterday to claim acquaintance as

                  She had been suffering from smallpox.</note> is getting well very fast, &amp; will not be marked. The other children show no
               symptoms of having taken the complaint nor is it expected that they will. Here is <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Westall</ref>. </p>
