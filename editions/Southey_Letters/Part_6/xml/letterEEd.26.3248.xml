        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you most warmly for your own book,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a copy
						of Wilberforce&#8217;s <title>Practical View of Christianity</title> (1815), no. 3014 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
						library.</note> &amp; for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Venns Sermons,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Venn
						(1759&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Sermons</title> (1814&#8211;1818). Venn was a friend of Wilberforce and an
						influential evangelical clergyman.</note> &#8211; which I have received in a parcel from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray-le-magne</ref>. The former I perused carefully, &amp; not I trust without
					permanent advantage, when it was first put into my hands, some five years ago by Lady Olivia Sparrow.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Olivia Sparrow (c. 1778&#8211;1863), daughter of the Irish peer, Arthur Acheson, 1st
						Earl of Gosford (c. 1745&#8211;1807). She married Robert Sparrow (1773&#8211;1805) on 14 March 1797 &#8211; Sparrow had bullied
						Southey during their time at Westminster School. A religious woman, Lady Olivia was interested in welfare and
						education. She visited the Lake District and met Southey in October 1814.</note> The copy with which you have now
					favoured me I shall preserve as an heirloom, &#8211; but not as a mere one, &amp; only to be looked at. &#8211; Venns Sermons
					are in the right strain; &#8211; in that manner I should have endeavoured to preach had I been in orders. &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I lost my way in early life, &#8211; &amp; yet my ways have been so ordered that the paths into which I
						<del>hav</del> strayed have truly been paths of pleasantness &amp; peace. What presumptuousness I had proceeded
						<del>xxxxx</del> &lt;more&gt; from ardour &amp; enthusiasm than from pride, &#8211; &amp; yet there <del>was</del> must have
					been a large portion of that leaven. I would not take orders at that time, tho no man ever felt a stronger
					inclination for a clerical life, because I honestly disbelieved many of the articles of our Church; &#8211; time, &amp;
					some of those visitations which reach us in our heart of hearts have humbled me, &#8211; thoroughly, &#8211; if I know myself,
					&#8211; &amp; I should now be as much incapacitated for subscription by humility, as I was once by presumption. &#8211; I
					should neither dare to affirm not to deny propositions which <del>attempt to</del> relate to the hypostatic
						union,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The term in Christian theology used to refer to the union between
						Christ&#8217;s human and divine natures. It, and the following two terms, have been much-debated in the history of
						Christianity.</note> &amp; the procession of the Holy Spirit,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Another term
						from Christian theology, defining the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Father and the Son in the
						Trinity.</note> &amp; the Prescience of the Almighty.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">God&#8217;s foreknowledge
						of all events (and the relationship of this concept to ideas about free will and predestination).</note> &#8211; I
					believe in my Creator my Redeemer &amp; my Comforter. I love Him with all my heart &amp; with all my soul &amp;
					with all my strength. &#8211; There are difficulties in the scheme of Christianity, &#8211; but there are impossibilities in
					every other. Without it existence would be a mystery too dreadful to be endured; &#8211; but revelation makes every thing
					coherent &amp; intelligible. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Yet I have latitudinarian notions,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The latitudinarian
						theologians of the Anglican Church in the seventeenth century were greatly admired by Southey. They insisted on
						the need to conform to the practices of the Church of England, but argued that many matters of doctrine, liturgy
						and church organisation were of little significance.</note> (relating to opinions &#8211; not to conduct) &lt;some of&gt;
					which you would not acknowledge, &#8211; &amp; herein it is that the difference between you &amp; me exists, not in
					matters of <del>faith</del> &lt;doctrine&gt;, &#8211; for in these there is no difference between us. I think you would agree
					with Wesley<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>), founder of
						Methodism, whose life Southey was writing in his <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of
							Methodism</title> (1820). This letter, as Southey makes clear in a subsequent paragraph, enclosed a draft chapter
						of the <hi rend="ital">Life</hi>. The enclosure appears not to have survived.</note> that the grace of God may reach those who have never heard of the Christian
					dispensation; &#8211; I think you will believe that the poor Jews who have given their bodies to be burnt by the accursed
					Inquisition, &#8211; &lt;may be&gt; <del>are</del> at this day in Abrahams bosom.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The
						place of comfort for the Jewish dead until Judgement Day.</note> &amp; that the poor wretches who from a mistaken
					sense of duty have tormented themselves all their lives, like the Yoguees in India, or F. Joam de Almeida in
						Brazil,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">John Almeida (1571&#8211;1653), English-born Jesuit missionary in
						Brazil.</note> &#8211; have <del>xxx xx</del> suffered enough in this world for their mistake. &#8211; But there is a point of
					considerable magnitude in which you will think me greatly erroneous &#8211; I believe that the prophets &amp; apostles
					were inspired, &#8211; but it does not appear to me that the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">The view in Christian theology that every word in the Bible was inspired by
						God.</note> can in sound reason be deduced from that belief, or that it can be maintained without many
					inconveniences. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You see how I am led on to lay my heart open upon a subject which interests it so nearly. &#8211; But
					you will see also that against such Clergy as you describe, I have no prepossessions. &#8211; Against those who preach
					high Calvinism, I have; &#8211; &amp; some horror for those who push it its full length to Antinomianism.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The idea that salvation for Christians is only achieved through faith and God&#8217;s grace
						and that, therefore, Christians who have been elected for salvation are not bound to obey moral laws.</note> But
						<del>intemperance</del> &lt;some degree of error&gt; in these cases is not so injurious as indifference, &#8211; &amp; the
					fever of zeal is better than that dead palsy. &#8211; <del>These</del> this <del>are</del> &lt;is a&gt; subject<del>s</del>
					which must be touched upon in the work which I have in the press; &#8211; a work which will probably displease all
					parties, &amp; draw upon me a sufficient share of obloquy from more quarters than one: but if it be read I think it
					may do good, &#8211; &amp; am sure that it is written with that intention. &#8211; I send you now the whole chapter of which I
					could only show you a part when you were at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. It will show
					you the temper &amp; general tendency of the book. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You asked me in a former letter concerning the later volumes of the Edinburgh Register. I do not
					know who wrote the 5 &amp; 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> volumes:<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1812</title> (1814) and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1813</title>
						(1815) were the two editions following Southey&#8217;s departure from the <title>Register</title>. The historical
						sections were written by James Russell (1790&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>), a Scottish barrister and writer.</note>
					but the manner in which the 7 &amp; 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> were advertised implied that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref> had at least borne a part in them.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was correct: Walter Scott did write the historical sections of <title>Edinburgh Annual
							Register, for 1814</title> (1816) and <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1815</title> (1817).</note> &#8211; It is
					somewhat remarkable that in one of the earlier volumes I should have expressed a wish to have our prisons placed
					under the <del>xx</del> management of the Quakers.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Edinburgh Annual
							Register, for 1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 359: &#8216;Place our prisons under the superintendence of the Quakers, and
						they will be made schools of reform and industry which will do honour, not only to our age and country, but even
						to our nature.&#8217; At this time the Quaker Elizabeth Fry (1780&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>) was coming to increasing
						prominence in the campaign for prison reform.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I had the ophthalmia once &amp; found great relief from a prescription of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BeddoesThomas">Beddoes&#8217;s</ref>, &#8211; an infusion of Cayenne-pepper, just strong enough to make
					the eyes smart severely. &#8211; For mere weakness I can testify to the good effects of bathing the <hi rend="ital">eyelids</hi> (taking care that it does not enter the eye,) &amp; the temples with camphorated spirits of wine. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I rejoice that you are about to assist in reforming the Criminal laws, &#8211; a good work which ought
					to be in good hands. There is undoubtedly a &lt;prevailing&gt; disposition to amend the evils of society at this time; &#8211;
					it is mingled with much error, &amp; <del>accompanied</del> &lt;managed&gt; with great indiscretion, &amp; accompanied
					with great danger; &#8211; but the disposition is good, &amp; among the better signs of the age. </p>
