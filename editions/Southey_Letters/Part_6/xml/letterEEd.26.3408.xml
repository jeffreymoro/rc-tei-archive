                     Methodism</title> (1820).</note> &#8211; which will be done in five weeks, taking it coolly &amp; quietly. I have to finish the review

                  published 11 December 1819. Southey was in dispute with Murray over how much he should be paid for this article.</note> I shall

               or I shall not be able to keep my head above water. The sum of all this is, that I intend to work closely at home till the end of
