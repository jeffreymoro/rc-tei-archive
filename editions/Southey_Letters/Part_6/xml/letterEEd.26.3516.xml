        <p rend="indent1"> It is very seldom that a whole month elapses without some interchange of letters between you
					&amp; me. And for my part, on the present instance, I cannot plead any unusual press of business, or any remarkable
					humour of industry. But then I can plead a great deal of enjoyment. I have been staying in the house all day, a
					great happiness after the hard service upon which my ten-trotters were continually kept in London. I have been
					reading, &#8211; a great luxury for one who during eleven weeks had not half an hour for looking thro a book. I have been
					playing with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>, giving him the Cries of
					London to the life, as the accompaniment of a series of prints thereof,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A
						popular series of prints of London street-sellers by Francis Wheatley (1747&#8211;1801; <title>DNB</title>). The book
						could have been <title>The Cries of London: for the Instruction and Amusement of Good Children</title>
						(1810).</note> &amp; enacting Lion Tyger, Bull, Bear, Horse, Ass, Elephant, Rhinoceros, the Laughing Hyena, Owl,
					Cuckoo, Peacock, Turkey, Rook, Raven, Magpye, Cock, Duck &amp; Goose, <del>gre</del> &amp;c &amp;c, greatly to his
					delight, &amp; somewhat to his edification, for never was there a more apt or more willing pupil. Whenever he
						<del>sets</del> comes near the study door, he sets up a shout, which seldom fails of producing an answer: in he
					comes, tottering along, with a smile upon his face, &amp; <hi rend="ital">pica pica</hi> in his mouth, &amp; if the
					picture-book is not forthwith forth<del>xxxxx</del>&lt;coming&gt;, &#8211; he knows its place upon the shelf, &amp; uses most
					ambitious &amp; persevering efforts to drag out a folio. And if this is not a proper excuse for idleness,
					Grosvenor, what is?</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But I have not been absolutely idle, &#8211; only comparatively so. I have made ready about five sheets
					of the Peninsular War<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
						(1823&#8211;1832).</note> for the press, (the main part indeed was transcription) &amp; William Nicol<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Nicol (d. c. 1855), printer and bookseller. <title>The History of the

							Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin and London, 1881), pp. 358&#8211;359. This review had appeared in the <title>Quarterly
							Review</title>, 21 (April 1819), 460&#8211;471. It concluded with an ad hominem attack that suggested the reviewer knew
						a great deal about Shelley&#8217;s personal affairs: &#8216;if we might withdraw the veil of private life, and tell what we
							<hi rend="ital">now</hi> know about him, it would be indeed a disgusting picture that we should exhibit, but it
						would be an unanswerable comment on our text; it is not easy for those who <hi rend="ital">read only</hi>, to
						conceive how much low pride, how much cold selfishness, how much unmanly cruelty are consistent with the laws of
						this &#8220;universal&#8221; and &#8220;lawless love.&#8221; But we must only use our knowledge to check the groundless hopes which we
						were once prone to entertain of him&#8217; (471). The article had, moreover, described Shelley as &#8216;an unsparing
						imitator&#8217; and <title>The Revolt</title>&#8217;s language and versification as a &#8216;copy&#8217; of Southey&#8217;s, though &#8216;altogether
						more luxuriant and ornate than the original&#8217; (461). Shelley was mistaken in attributing the review to Southey, who
						had a policy of not reviewing contemporary poetry. Its author was John Taylor Coleridge.</note> Some of his
					friends (<ref type="m" target="people.html#GodwinWilliam">Godwin</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HuntLeigh">Leigh Hunt</ref> to wit) &lt;had&gt; persisted in assuring him that I was the author of a
					criticism concerning him in the Q.R. From internal evidence &amp; from what he knew of me he did not &amp; would
					not believe it; &#8211; nevertheless they persisted, &#8211; &amp; he writes that I may enable him to confirm his opinion. The
					letter then, still couched in very courteous terms, talks of the principles &amp; slanderous practices of the
					pretended friends of Order, as contrasted with those which he professes, hints at challenging the writer of the
					Review, if he should prove to be a person with whom it would not be <del>worthy</del> &lt;beneath him&gt; to contend,
					tells me he shall certainly hear from me, because he must interpret my silence into an acknowledgement of the
					offence, &amp; concludes with Dear-Sir-ship &amp; civility. &#8211; If I had an amanuensis I would send you copies of
					this notable epistle, &amp; of my reply<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Percy Bysshe Shelley,
						[c. 29 July 1820], Letter 3517.</note> to it, in which I have given him <del>a lecture</del> any thing rather than
					an anodyne.</p>
