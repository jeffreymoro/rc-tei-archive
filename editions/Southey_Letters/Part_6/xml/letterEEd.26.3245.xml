                  was reported to have attacked both Southey and Wordsworth for their part in opposing him, <title>The Times</title>, 4 July 1818.
                  This led to Southey beginning to write a pamphlet in response; part of it was finally published as a &#8216;Postscript&#8217; to the second
                  edition of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp. 45&#8211;53.</note> For <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthMary">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>

               omitted in the publication of his harangues at Kendal.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a reference to
                     <title>Westmorland Election, 1818: an Account of the Proceedings at Appleby, from Saturday, the 27th of June, to the Final Close
                     of the Poll</title> (Kendal, 1818).</note> This probably was because somebody asked him why he went out of his way to insult a
               man who had taken no part in the election &amp; was capable of handling him roughly in return. &#8211; He lied like a villain when he spoke
               of me, &#8211; &amp; he lies like a scoundrel when he <del>denies</del> &lt;disowns&gt; what he said. &#8211; But you know what <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> is as well as I do. He is not a malignant man, &#8211; but from an insolence of
               disposition, an ungovernable intemperance, &amp; an insanity of mind he does to day, what he would gladly undo tomorrow, &amp; veers
               about like a weather&#8211;cock with every gust of passion, having no <del>principle of any</del> principle to steady him, &#8211; &amp; wanting

        <p rend="indent1"> My paper upon the Copyright<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Mr Brougham. &#8211; Education Committee&#8217;,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July 1818), 492&#8211;569, published on 2 February 1819. Canning did have a hand in this article,
                  which was mainly written by John Wilson Croker with a number of others. Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Inquiry into the Copyright Act&#8217;, <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 21 (January 1819), 196&#8211;213, was delayed.</note> was postponed to make room for that excellent article versus <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref>, &#8211; of which I suppose the best part (&amp; nothing can be better in
               its way) came from <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>. For his own interest <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> might better have turned out something else, as there are two or three things in the
               number that might very well have been spared. My paper might have been useful thus far, that it would have given some members of
               parliament a clear view of the case, who would have read it, &#8211; &amp; will not read any thing upon the subject in any other form. I have
               stated the point fully &amp; strongly, &amp; said a word at the close upon that right of perpetual copyright which authors possessed by
               common law, till it was taken from them by statute.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Inquiry into the Copyright Act&#8217;,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (January 1819), 196&#8211;213, mainly dealt with the law that required copies of every publication
                  to be delivered to eleven public and university libraries. But (at 211&#8211;213) Southey ended with a plea for perpetual copyright in
                  order to benefit the families of authors after their death. The &#8216;Statute of Anne&#8217; or Copyright Act (1709) had first created the idea
                  of a limited period of copyright protection for published works, but this was not finally confirmed until the House of Lords&#8217;
                  decision in the case of Donaldson <hi rend="ital">v.</hi> Becket (1774).</note> If that right were recovered &#8211; I should think the
               interests of my family would be sufficiently provided for. There is no chance of this at present; &#8211; but the injustice of the existing
               laws is so apparent that if it be fairly brought forward, the general sense of equity will in time bring about a remedy. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been for many weeks exclusively working upon my history of Brazil; the desire of compleating it has urged me on;
               &#8211; &amp; it seems to lengthen under my hand. 520 pages are printed, &#8211; &amp; you will suppose that I cannot be far from the end. I think
               that six weeks will bring me there, &#8211; &amp; were it not that other employments are immediately awaiting me, I should feel that I had
               lost a great source of pleasure in getting rid of a subject which has occupied so large a portion of my thoughts for more than ten
               years. There are two chapters &#8211; &amp; a half to write, &#8211; the last being a general view of the state of Brazil at the time of the
