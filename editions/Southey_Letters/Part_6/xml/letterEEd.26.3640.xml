							the Last of the Goths</title> (1814); these could then be inspected, purchased and bound into readers&#8217; own copies
						of the poem. The result was a set of six engravings based on drawings by Richard Westall (1765&#8211;1836;
							<title>DNB</title>) and entitled <title>Illustrations of Roderick, the Last of the Goths. A Poem, by Robert
							Southey, Esq. from the Drawings of R. Westall R.A.</title> (1824). </note> in a manner which must needs be very
					gratifying to me, I ought to tell you that two translations of that poem were published at the beginning of last
					month in Paris, just at the same time;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Pierre Hippolyte Amillet de Sagrie
						(1785&#8211;1830), <title>Roderic, Dernier Roi des Goths</title> (1821), no. 2700 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
						library; and Antoine Andr&#233; Brugi&#232;re, Baron de Sorsum, <title>Roderick, le Dernier des Goths</title> (1820), no.
						2697 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &amp; that a third is said to be making ready.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably the material relating to <title>Roderick</title> in Abel Hugo (1798&#8211;1855),
							<title>Romances Historiques Traduites de l&#8217;Espagnol</title> (Paris, 1822), pp. 1&#8211;32.</note> One French critic has
					declared war against the poem,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> &amp; an English or
					Scotch or Irishman by name Thomas Mulock who lectures upon English poetry in French to the Parisians demonstrates
					that I am a bad poet, &amp; that I must of necessity be so, because I am a bad Christian, not regenerate, &amp;
					therefore in a state of reprobation.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had heard reports from Ann
						Attersoll of the lecture series on English literature given in Paris in 1820 by the Irishman Thomas Mulock
						(1789&#8211;1869), a failed merchant, political reactionary, and associate of George Canning. Something of the tone of
						Mulock&#8217;s lectures is encapsulated by Thomas Moore, who was in Paris at the time they were given. On discovering
						that he &#8216;was to be one of the victims of &#8230; [Mulock&#8217;s] tomahawk&#8217;, Moore put off his proposed attendance at them
						until a later day, <title>The Journal of Thomas Moore</title>, eds Wilfred Sellars Dowden, Barbara Bartholomew,
						and Joy L. Linsley, 2 vols (East Brunswick, N.J., 1983), I, p. 367. Moore had earlier described Mulock as &#8216;a
						pedantic young Irishman, and a mighty genius in his own estimation&#8217; (I, p. 63). Mulock found ungodliness
						everywhere and in everyone. He attacked Byron in <title>The Answer Given by the Gospel to the Atheism of All
							Ages</title> (1819), pp. 43&#8211;44 n*; 99&#8211;100 n*; 101&#8211;102 n*. During his Paris lectures he informed his audience that
						France was &#8216;by her follies and her crimes, least and lowest in the scale of European nations &#8230; an atheistic land
						scoured by squadrons of anti-christian missionaries, whose carnal cry is, up with the cross, and down with the
						bible&#8217;, <title>Literary Gazette and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c.</title>, 217 (17 March
						1821), 173. On his return to England in 1821 he became a dissenting preacher in Staffordshire and, in later life,
						was confined as a lunatic on several occasions.</note> On the other hand the cudgels are taken up in defence of
					the said poem, &amp; what with censure &amp; praise, the one probably as little discriminating &amp; as much
					exaggerated as the other, the book is becoming somewhat notorious. A few sets of the intended illustrations may
					perhaps find purchasers at Paris, in consequence.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your beautiful drawings<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall produced the following six

            <title>Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 1, lines 1&#8211;21. Southey&#8217;s note recorded: &#8216;THIS
						effect of twilight, and in the very scene described, has been lately represented by Mr. William Westall, in one of
						his Views of the Lakes, with the true feeling and power of genius. The range of mountains which is described in
						these introductory lines, may also be seen in his View of the Vale of Keswick from the Penrith road&#8217; (p. 49). The
						works by Westall referred to here are &#8216;Keswick Lake from the East Side&#8217; and &#8216;Keswick Lake from the Penrith Road&#8217;,

					will was made early in 1815.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Nash&#8217;s will was made before he met Southey in
