					have loaded them. I owe you thanks also on my own account for some of the pleasantest hours which I past in London.
					&#8211; You will readily suppose that I have been both very busy &amp; very idle since my return; busy in the regular
					course of things, &amp; idle by inclination, temptation, &amp; course of season. The very <del>pleasure</del>
					&lt;sense&gt; of being at rest, after eleven weeks of perpetual excitement &amp; continual change of place, &amp;
					society, was in itself a pleasure of high degree: &amp; then the comfort of breathing fresh air, without either
					dust or smoke; &#8211; of knowing that I had nowhere to go, &amp; nothing to do except what I chose to be doing, &#8211; no
					trouble for to day, &amp; no engagement for tomorrow, &#8211; Christian in the Pilgrims Progress, when the burthen drops
					off his back, is but a type of such a deliverance.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Bunyan (1628&#8211;1688;

						able to rid himself of the burden of sin.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I found all well on my return, &amp; God be thanked, all has continued so. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> runs about the room &amp; the garden, &amp; the
					greatest noise which I hear now is of my own making when I am exhibiting for his edification the Cries of London,
					in a book bought for that special purpose,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A popular series of prints of
						London street-sellers, by Francis Wheatley (1747&#8211;1801; <title>DNB</title>). The book could have been <title>The
							Cries of London: for the Instruction and Amusement of Good Children</title> (1810).</note> &amp; amusing his ears
					as much as his eyes, &#8211; or turning over the leaves of Bewick,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The engraver
						Thomas Bewick (1753&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>) had begun publishing illustrated editions of fables in the 1770s.
						Southey is probably referring to Bewick&#8217;s <title>The Fables of Aesop and Others</title> (1818), which he had
						ordered a copy of from Longman on 19 February 1819 (Letter 3249).</note> &amp; making more sounds &amp; stranger
					than were heard in Noahs Ark,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Genesis</title> 6&#8211;8 relates how the
						patriarch, Noah, saved his family and two of every kind of animal from a universal flood.</note> every day before
					the beasts were fed, &#8211; another of my domestic beatitudes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The other day I received a short note from <ref type="m" target="people.html#EverettEdward">Everett</ref>, with two numbers of a review whereof he is the Editor.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Everett was editor (1820&#8211;1824) of the <title>North American Review</title> (1815&#8211;1940), the first literary
						magazine in the United States.</note> To my great surprize the review is violently Anti-Anglican, which I think
					must proceed more from his coadjutors than himself. He says I shall not think an apology for this necessary when I
					call to mind the language of certain English journals respecting America. I shall tell him in reply that none was
					needed, but that certainly if I had the direction of a Journal, nothing should appear in it concerning America but
					what was conciliatory in its spirit &amp; tendency. The Yankees suppose that they are of as much importance in our
					eyes, as we are in theirs, &amp; it is strange that <ref type="m" target="people.html#EverettEdward">Everett</ref>
					after being in England should continue in this error. We have more important things to think of, &amp; they have
					not.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref> seems to make out
					that he has been rigorously dealt with at Oriel, &amp; it is very desirable that his friends should be so
						persuaded.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Hartley Coleridge had been elected a Probationary Fellow at
						Oriel College, Oxford, in 1819. On 30 May 1820 Oriel&#8217;s Fellows decided he had not passed his probation on the
						grounds of &#8216;sottishness, a love of low company, and general inattention to college rules&#8217;.</note> It is very
					likely that his peculiar manners, his love of paradox, &amp; his uncomfortable propensity to disputation may have
					prejudiced the fellows against him more than they are willing to acknowledge, &amp; perhaps more than they are
					conscious of themselves. If it teaches him self-command, &amp; that degree of conformity with the manners &amp;
					usages of the world which is necessary for ones comfort as well as for that of others, he will have made a good
					purchase, tho at a high price. [Remainder of MS missing]</p>
