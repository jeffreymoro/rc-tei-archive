            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, pp.
                  [v]&#8211;viii. The &#8216;Dedication&#8217; was controversial, not only praising Britain&#8217;s victory
                  in the war against France, but stating: &#8216;The same perfect integrity has been
                  manifested in the whole administration of public affairs&#8217; (vi); not a view the
                  Whig opposition endorsed. However, the earlier draft of the &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, in
                  Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733, shows Southey had intended to go much
                  further and urge that &#8216;adequate remedy should be applied to that intolerable
                  licentiousness of the press &#8230; either by the vigorous application of existing laws
                  or by the enactment of such new ones as the suspension of the abuse may render
                  necessary&#8217;. Southey had asked the opinion of Bedford and Herries on the
                  &#8216;Dedication&#8217;; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 22 January 1821, Letter
                  3614.</note> You will not regard the trouble of the discussion, neither do I
               regret the time employed in composing it; the spirit moved me, &#8211; &amp; I satisfied
               myself by writing according to my feelings. There ended all my interest in the
               affair, for I have lived long enough to know how little such things are thought of by
               any but the writers themselves &#8211; &amp; to apply that knowledge to things of more pith
               &amp; moment than a dedication. How differently did I feel on that Saturday when the
               first number of the Flagellant was published! -<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Flagellant</title> was the schoolboy magazine
                  published by Southey and Bedford; nine issues appeared 1 March&#8211;26 April 1792. 1
                  March 1792 was a Tuesday, though, not a Saturday.</note> tho there was not a line
               of my own in it still I felt that I had taken the field, &amp; my own Alphonso was
               not filled with higher hopes &amp; aspirations when first he put on the <del>x</del>
               armour which his father had worn in Wambas wars.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  of Peter, Duke of Cantabria (d. 730), putting on for the first time the armour

                  Wilson&#8217;s reply led Southey to believe that Mary Wesley (1709/10&#8211;1781), Wesley&#8217;s
                  estranged wife, might have forged the letter containing this information and that

                  Gallery, P 12 MS S.</note> &#8211; The type is necessarily small, but there is nothing
               uncouth in the appearance of the page, nor of the lines, they <hi rend="ital">look</hi> as well as blank verse. I am looking daily for the notes &amp; the
               Preface, with the intent of referring in the former to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westalls</ref> views, for the line of
               mountains, &amp; the evening effect described in the opening of the poem.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">

        <p rend="indent1"> The Almanacks are not arrived. I have long been expecting a parcel
               from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref>, &amp; begin to
               marvel at its delay.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Concerning poor dear <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash&#8217;s</ref> effects I know as little as you do. Nothing has been said to me
               about the drawings which his family must know to be mine, &amp; therefore I must
               write about them. He told me once that he either had left, or intended to leave me,
               two splendid drawings by <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref> of the Carli Cave in India:<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall made a number of drawings of the &#8216;Great Cave&#8211;Temple of

               will. I have some reason to suspect that those who are to share his property will not
               regret him so deeply &amp; so long as I shall do.</p>
