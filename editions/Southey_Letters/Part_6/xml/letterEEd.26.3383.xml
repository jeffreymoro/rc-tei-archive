                  Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex will gave Southey some hope of
                  inheriting property at Fitzhead after the death of his third cousin, and John
                  Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819;
                     <title>DNB</title>).</note> This case related to the bequest of the Fitzhead
               lease, &amp; the decision made the limitation to my father void, &#8211; leaving it of
               course to the right heirs of C. Southey. &#8211; Now whether I am the heir of a Cannon<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir at
                  law, i.e. the person who has a right to inherit the real property of someone who
                  dies intestate; but this fact did not help his claim on the Fitzhead
                  estate.</note> as sure as your boy is the son of a Gonne, &#8211; is what I cannot tell.
               But I think it is most likely. And moreover if it be so, it is very possible that the
               notions entertained by <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my
               Aunt</ref>, &amp; the people in that country respecting my expectations
               upon Lord S.s death may have some ground. For tho <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my Fathers</ref> name is
               only mentioned in the device of the Fitzhead lease, <del>there</del> &amp; it is by
               no means unlikely that the other property entailed upon Lord S. &amp; his issue, may
               revert to the heirs of the testator, upon the death of Lord S. without issue. So you
               see the whole will should be perused by <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have written to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my

               relationship stands &#8211; &amp; when the old piece of artillery <hi rend="ital">went
                  off</hi>. I guess about 1770, &#8211; but this may very likely appear in the Report of
               the Trial, &amp; it will not be difficult to find the other trials (for there were
               several) in the Report Books. Lord S. sold the whole property, &#8211; which he was not
               entitled to do till he had a son of age to consent to it. The first business is to
               discover whether I have any claims, &#8211; then what they are, &#8211; &amp; then whether they
               are worth pursuing. The <del>prospect</del> &lt;chance&gt; appears better than I thought
