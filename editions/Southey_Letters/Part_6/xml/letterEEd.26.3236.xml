					hearty hatred of his neighbours. But in every other point I could not have desired a more entire conformity. The
					most curious part of his book is a history of the insurrection of the Indians, under one of the Inca blood, during
					our American war.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Gregorio Funes, <title>Ensayo de la Historia Civil del

						Independence (1775&#8211;1783). The technique of damming rivers to attack towns was used (successfully) against Sorata
						and (unsuccessfully) against La Paz.</note> No details had ever before been published. It is a dreadful story, &#8211;
					the Peruvians displayed a degree of talent very superior to my poor friends the Guaranies. Twice when they were
					besieging Spanish towns, they dammed up a river, &amp; brought its waters to bear upon the walls. </p>
