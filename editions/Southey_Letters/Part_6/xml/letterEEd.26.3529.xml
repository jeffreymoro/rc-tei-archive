        <p rend="indent1"> The younger <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref> is making for me half
					a dozen views in this immediate neighbourhood to ornament a volume of Dialogues,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829). Six
						engravings from Westall&#8217;s views appeared in the book.</note> which being upon grave subjects concerning the past
					stages, <del>x</del> present state &amp; prospects of society, I mean to relieve with descriptive passages, &#8211; &amp;
					after the manner of Boethius<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s model was Anicius Manlius Severinus
						Boethius (c. 480&#8211;525), <title>De Consolatione Philosophiae</title>, a dialogue between the author and the
						character of Lady Philosophy, consisting of both prose and verse.</note> with occasional pieces in verse. The
					dialogue is a difficult form of composition, but it has its advantages. I have nearly finished the second, &amp; am
					thus far well pleased with my progress.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We have seen fewer strangers than usual, &#8211; which may perhaps be owing to the pending business in
						Parliament.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">The Second Reading debate had begun on 17 August 1820 of a
						Bill of Pains and Penalties to deprive Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), George IV&#8217;s
						estranged wife, of the title of Queen and to dissolve their marriage. The Queen&#8217;s case was supported by the
						majority of radicals and many Whigs, and while the Bill just passed the House of Lords on 10 November, the
						government declined to introduce it into the House of Commons.</note> That business I am inclined to think will do
					as much good as there was at one time reason to apprehend that it might occasion immediate evil. The glaring guilt
