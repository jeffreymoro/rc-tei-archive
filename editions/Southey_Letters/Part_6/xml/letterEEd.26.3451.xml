        <p rend="indent1"> We have lost poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">Wilsey</ref>, &#8211; &amp; I have this
					day seen her laid in the grave. She had for some time been sinking gradually under the weight of seventy seven
					years. Her memory with regard to recent occurrences was quite gone, tho, as usual in such cases, it retained
					clearly all its early impressions. On Monday the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> last she walked as far as the Church with
					the children, &amp; went down with them into the vault of the Stephenson family, which the representative of that
					family chuses to have opened whenever he comes to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, for the
					purpose I suppose of airing his ancestors.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Stephensons were a
						long-established and prominent Keswick family and included John Stephenson (1691&#8211;1768), MP for Sudbury 1734&#8211;1741,
						who made a fortune in India. John Stephenson had no children, and by this time his relatives were based in London,
						mainly engaged in banking (though the Stephensons still owned Scalesby Castle).</note> So long a walk she had not
					taken for many many weeks; but she came back in her usual good spirits, &amp; declared that she was not tired. The
					next day she was as well as she had been during the winter. On the Wednesday morning she fell in getting out of
					bed, &amp; grazed her forehead. She was found when <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> went down to her, much
					shaken, &amp; in a tremulous state. However she made a good breakfast, &amp; walked about. But there was a manifest
					change in her countenance, which one of the maids had perceived before she fell out of bed &amp; I have no doubt
					that the fall <del>xxxx</del> was occasioned by a slight stroke in the head. The head was inclined all that day a
					little on one side, &amp; she was what they call in this country <hi rend="ital">maffled</hi>, &#8211; that is, confused
					in her intellect. <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> saw her, &amp; said that she had
					been younger or stronger he would have bled her, &#8211; but in her case bleeding might have produced death. She kept up
					during the day, &amp; was left when we went to bed sleeping apparently well, &amp; breathing naturally. One of the
					maids however slept in the room with her, as indeed she had always slept within call in case of necessity during
					the winter. At one o clock she awoke, insisted that it was time to get up, &amp; could not be persuaded to the
					contrary, &#8211; drest herself, &amp; made a good breakfast. Between six &amp; seven we were <del>xxxxxx with a</del>
					called, &#8211; she was very ill, &amp; had had <del>a</del> one or two fits, &#8211; &amp; was then violently convulsed. When
					the convulsion left her, her sight, hearing &amp; speech were gone. <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> did not suppose she would have lasted six hours. But she lived till the eighth day, the
					convulsions returned more than once, &amp; while they lasted she moaned like one in pain. But on the whole there
					was little apparent suffering, &amp; I believe no return of intellect, certainly not of any of the senses which she
					has lost. The extraordinary thing is that so feeble &amp; exhausted a body should have continued to struggle with
					death so long, with no other sustenance than <del>x</del> now &amp; then a tea spoonful of tea or coffee, &#8211; indeed
					little more than merely wetting the lips.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> For some time she has been among our cares rather than our comforts &#8211; but her death makes a
					blank, <del>xxx</del> &amp; both young &amp; old will feel her loss. For there never lived a better creature. I
					never knew any one with a more generous spirit, or a more affectionate heart.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> She has left 20&#163; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDavidHartley">Hartley</ref>, 20 to

        <p rend="indent1"> It was gratifying to see how much interest her illness excited among the respectable people of
					the place, &#8211; those who had been taught to respect her by their parents, &amp; those who remembered her when she was

        <p rend="indent1"> She had been beyond this circle of mountains, &#8211; but was never out of sight of them. Carlisle was
					the farthest point of her travels, &amp; there she had been but once. &#8211; The chance which brought us here
					contributed very materially to the comfort of her age. We have been here nearly 17 years, <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerSarah">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> C.</ref> 20. &amp; in all that time I never knew her do
