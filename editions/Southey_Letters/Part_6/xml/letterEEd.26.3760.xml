          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> When the Life is reprinted, I can modify the passage which expresses
               an essential difference of opinion upon religious subjects with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Life&#8217; included in Southey&#8217;s <title>Remains of
                     Henry Kirke White, of Nottingham</title>, 2 vols (London, 1807), I, pp. [1]&#8211;58.
                  The passage in question was: &#8216;Of this fervent piety, his letters, his prayers, and
                  his hymns, will afford ample and interesting proofs. I must be permitted to say,
                  that my own views of the religion of Christ Jesus differ essentially from the
                  system of belief which he had adopted; but, having said this, it is, indeed, my
                  anxious wish to do full justice to piety so fervent. It was in him a living and
                  quickening principle of goodness, which sanctified all his hopes, and all his
                  affections; which made him keep watch over his own heart, and enabled him to
                  correct the few symptoms, which it ever displayed, of human imperfection&#8217; (I, p.
                  57). Southey did not modify this passage.</note> That difference is certainly not
               now what it was then, but it is still a wide one; though, had <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Henry</ref> lived till this time,
               I believe there would scarcely have been a shade of difference between us. I am
               perfectly sure that, with a heart and intellect like his, he would have outgrown all
               tendency towards Calvinism, and have approached nearer in opinion to Jeremy Taylor
               than to the Synod of Dort.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Church of
                  Ireland bishop and religious writer, Jeremy Taylor (c. 1613&#8211;1667;
                     <title>DNB</title>), was a great favourite of Southey&#8217;s. His writings contained
                  many criticisms of the theology of Jean Calvin (1509&#8211;1564), especially the idea
                  that God had ordained the salvation or damnation of all souls before the beginning
                  of the world. The Synod of Dort (1618&#8211;1619) had produced a definitive statement of
                  Calvin&#8217;s theology.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You wrong the Government with regard to Ireland. They neither now
               have, nor ever have had, a wish to keep the savages in that country in their state of
               ignorance and barbarity; and it would surprise you to know what funds have been
               established for their education.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">There
                  were a great many organisations providing Protestant education in Ireland at this
                  time, but they did not reach many pupils. Church of Ireland parochial schools
                  educated only 36,498 children in 1823, with diocesan schools catering for a
                  further 419 by 1831 and royal grammar schools in Ulster only 343 in that year. The
                  Incorporated Society for Promoting English Protestant Schools in Ireland (&#8216;charter
                  schools&#8217;) educated less than 2,000 children by the mid-1820s. The most successful
                  body was the Society for Promoting the Education of the Poor in Ireland (the
                  &#8216;Kildare Place Society&#8217;), which offered non-denominational education and reached
                  26,474 pupils in 1820. This Society had a government grant from 1815 onwards; but
                  the Irish Catholic bishops were becoming increasingly hostile to its
                  activities.</note> I know <ref type="m" target="people.html#BellAndrew">Dr.
                  Bell</ref> was surprised at finding how large the endowments were, and
               felt that on that score it was not means that were wanting, but the just direction of
               them. <hi rend="ital">How</hi> to set about enlightening such a people as the wild
               Irish is one of the most difficult duties any government was ever called upon to
               perform, obstructed as it is by such a body of priests, who can effectually prevent
               any better instruction than they themselves bestow. I want more information
               concerning certain parts of Irish history than I possess at present; but in one or
               more of the works which I have in hand I shall trace the evils of Ireland to their
                  source.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">See, for example, <title>Sir
                     Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>, 2
                  vols (London, 1829), I, pp. 262&#8211;302. </note> Meantime, this I may safely assert,
               as a general deduction from all that I have learnt in the course of history, that the
               more we know of preceding and coexisting circumstances and difficulties, the more
               excuse we shall find for those men and measures which, with little knowledge of those
               circumstances, we should condemn absolutely. This feeling leads not to any thing like
               indifference concerning right and wrong, nor to any lukewarmness or indecision in
               opinion; but certainly to a more indulgent and charitable tone of mind than commonly
               prevails.</p>
