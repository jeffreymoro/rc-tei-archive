          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith-May</ref> thanks you for the account of
					the Tapestry. She would have taken the advice if I had not deemed it better to bestow certain odds &amp; ends of
					time upon the transcription, &#8211; partly because the original is almost illegible to any person except myself, &amp;
					still more, because a hasty journal requires so many transpositions, additions, omissions &amp; little alterations
					to make it fit for perusal.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was sending Rickman fair copies of
						sections of the journal he kept on their tour of Scotland 17 August&#8211;1 October 1819, later published as
							<title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (1929).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Parl: Procs:<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The official <title>Report
							of Parliamentary Proceedings</title>, usually known as <title>Hansard</title>, after its publisher, Luke Hansard
						(1752&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; I hope you had a clear sky at Norwich for the Eclipse,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">There was a solar eclipse on 7 September 1820.</note> &amp; that you found time to put
					your thoughts upon paper. They will not be lost, tho the effect may not be so speedy as the times require. But I
					have lived to see some political truths admitted, &amp; in part acted upon, which were regarded as visionary or
					perilous when first they were advanced. The result of the present ferment you &amp; I can see clearly, &#8211; the press
					will destroy itself, &amp; power must revert to property, almost as exclusively as in the feudal time. There <hi rend="ital">must</hi> be more police, &amp; a stronger Government, taking upon itself the direction of education,
					&amp; of public opinion. The loss of some of our abused liberties is inevitable. What we cannot see is, the how
					many we are to lose, nor the length of the process, nor the extent of the mischief mean time. &#8211; But I am in good
					heart &amp; hope; &amp; think that this affair of Messalina<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline of
						Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), estranged wife of George IV. He had pressurised his Cabinet into
						preparing a Bill of Pains and Penalties to dissolve their marriage and deprive her of the title of Queen. She
						rejected compromise terms offered by the Cabinet and arrived in England on 5 June 1820. The House of Lords began
						to debate the Bill on 17 August and what was effectively a trial of Caroline for adultery continued until 10
						November. Southey compares her to Messalina (c. AD 17/20&#8211;48), the notoriously dissolute third wife of Claudius (10
						BC&#8211;AD 54; Roman Emperor AD 43&#8211;54).</note> will cure as many dupes as it has made.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Looking over some notes the other day I found a notable one which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
						Lushington,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Stephen Lushington (1782&#8211;1873; <title>DNB</title>), Whig MP for
						various seats 1806&#8211;1841, eminent lawyer and Judge of the High Court of Admiralty 1838&#8211;1867. He was one of Queen
						Caroline&#8217;s counsels.</note> as the Qs civilian ought to adduce on her behalf &#8211; The text of the decretal says that
					a woman is not to be called <hi rend="ital">meretrix</hi> unless she has transgressed with many men, &amp; the
					Gloss giving as large <del>an</del> a meaning to that indefinite <del>term</del> expression, as it is affixed to
					mutton broth at a city breakfast, says she is not be called <hi rend="ital">meretrix</hi>, unless she has lain with
					twenty three thousand men.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;ordinary&#8217; gloss to Gratian&#8217;s (mid-12th
						century) classic work of medieval canon law, <title>Concordia Discordantium Canonum or Decretum Gratiani</title>:
						&#8216;Meretrix est, quae multorum libidini patet&#8217; (Gl. vidua 16 disct. 34). A &#8216;meretrix&#8217; was a prostitute.</note>

						August 1820 had established a junta to run the country; it declared its intention of organising elections to a
						Cortes, which were held in December 1820, and demanded John VI (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826) return from
						Brazil, where the Portuguese court had fled in 1807&#8211;1808.</note> is the unavoidable effect of the state of Spain.
					If it ends thus the only evil will be in the example, &#8211; which God knows is evil enough; &#8211; but if it spread to
					Brazil a bad government, capable of easy improvement &amp; not unwilling to improve, will be exchanged for anarchy,
					civil war &amp; horrors of every kind, ending in a state as barbarous as our own heptarchy,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The period in which several warring Anglo-Saxon kingdoms ruled England, from the fifth to the ninth
						centuries.</note> &amp; dividing the country among as many ruffians as can keep together banditti enough to be
					called an army.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am making many additions of more or less importance to the first vol. of Brazil,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of the first volume only of the <title>History of Brazil</title>

          <del>enough</del> collectively of a great deal. &#8211; One or two packets I
