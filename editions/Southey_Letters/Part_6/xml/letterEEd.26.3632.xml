        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your book &amp; your drawing.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">An unidentified book, and a sketch by Bowles, a keen amateur
                  artist, of a Bristol scene; see Southey to Caroline Bowles, 14 February 1821,
                  Letter 3633.</note> They arrived this evening. I have been intending &amp;
               intending to write to you ever since my return home in July, &#8211; &amp; more especially
               since I got your poem<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Bowles&#8217;s
                     <title>Ellen Fitzarthur: a Metrical Tale, in Five Cantos</title>, published by
                  Longman in 1820. Her name was not on the title page. Bowles had sent a copy to
                  Southey in June 1820; see Edward Dowden (ed.), <title>The Correspondence of Robert
                     Southey with Caroline Bowles</title> (Dublin and London, 1881), p. 19.</note>
               in November, to have told you then how well I liked it in print, &amp; how much it
               was admired by the reading part of my family. But you know what becomes of good
               intentions &#8211; the Devil is said to pave his dominions with them, &amp; if it be so I
               have furnished him with as many materials as most men. My excuse must be not so much
               the number of my own employments, as the numerous interruptions to which I am liable,
               during part of the year, from unexpected visitors, &amp; all the year long from
               persons at a distance who, with or without a reason, write<del>s</del> to me upon all
               imaginable &amp; unimaginable subjects. &#8211; One man for instance requests an acrostic
               for his mistress, &amp; another consults me upon a scheme for paying off the national
                  debt.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;N.P.T.&#8217; had written to Southey
                  asking for &#8216;an acrostick upon the word Rebecca&#8217;, in order to help him win the
                  affections of Rebecca Rankin (1795&#8211;1871), daughter of a prominent farmer in
                  Bocking, Essex; see Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 26 August 1817, <title>The
                     Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3019. The scheme
                  for paying off the national debt is unidentified.</note> My collection of such
               letters is not a little curious. The evil is that in replying to them either for the
               sake of getting rid of the application, or in mere courtesy, or in the kinder mood
               which those of a better kind excite, things which I ought &amp; designed to do are
               left undone, time passes on; &amp; the arrears become like a prodigals debts, irksome
               to remember because they are too heavy to be cleared off.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wish I could have seen you again at Chelsea, &#8211; but my very minutes
               were numbered while I was in &amp; about London,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">When Southey had visited London in May&#8211;June 1820.</note> nor
               did I ever &lt;feel&gt; any thing like a sense of rest from the time I entered it, till I
               got into the mail-coach on my return. I heard of you once from D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               not deceived the subject will secure for it a favourable acceptance, relating as it
