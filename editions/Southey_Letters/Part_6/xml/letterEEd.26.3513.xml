        <p rend="indent1"> This proposed work of Mr. James Henderson<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">James Henderson (c. 1783&#8211;1848),
                     <title>History of Brazil</title> (1821). He had sailed to South America in 1819 and was Consul-General in Columbia
                  1823&#8211;1836.</note> is the book which I mentioned to you when I was last in <ref type="m" target="places.html#PaternosterRow">Paternoster Row</ref>. The author says, in his proposals, that &#8220;little
               authentic intelligence (concerning Brazil) has hitherto been published, and the accounts we have of its discovery, colonization,
               divisions, government, productions, are vague, and frequently contradictory.&#8221; He therefore promises to give &#8220;a genuine and
               well-authenticated history from original documents.&#8221; Now, if when he wrote these proposals he knew nothing of my work, it is plain that
               he must have known little of what has been written concerning Brazil, and lived little with persons who take any interest concerning
               its history. If he did know of my history, or if, knowing it as he now does, he continues to circulate the same proposals, the language
               which it contains is exactly that which a plagiarist would use who meant to make up his own book by pillaging mine. These remarks only
               affect the respectability of the author; but as for his works interfering with mine, it can do so no more than an abridgment would do,
               which any man has a right to make (as the law stands), and which I have no doubt this will prove to be in the whole historical part. In
               fact, there is no other connected history of Brazil than mine, either printed or in manuscript, and without the assistance which he can
               derive from mine, and mine only, he might as well pretend to write a history of the moon.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had good grounds for his fears. Alphonse de Beauchamp (1769&#8211;1832), <title>Histoire du Br&#233;sil</title> (1815), had
                  plagiarised from the first volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819); see Southey to Grosvenor Charles
                  Bedford, 3 October 1815, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Four</title>, Letter 2659. However, on this occasion
                  his concerns had no foundation. Henderson&#8217;s volume did draw on Manoel Aires de Casal (1754&#8211;1821), <title>Corografia Brazilica, ou
                     Rela&#231;&#227;o Historico-Geografica do Reino do Brazil</title> (1817) and <title>O Patriota, Jornal Litterario, Politico, Mercantil
                     &amp;c do Rio de Janeiro</title> (1813&#8211;1814), but it was not a work of plagiarism and offered an &#8216;account&#8217; of Brazil rather than
                  a &#8216;history&#8217;; see Southey to Herbert Hill, 8 December 1821, Letter 3755. Moreover, Henderson&#8217;s introductory &#8216;Notice to the Reader&#8217;
                  drew attention to Southey&#8217;s <title>History</title>, which &#8216;does as much honour to the talent of that gentleman as to his unwearied
                  research&#8217;, Henderson, <title>History of Brazil</title> (London, 1821), p. vi. Henderson sent Southey a copy of his volume,
                  presumably the same as that listed as no. 1182 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. </note>
