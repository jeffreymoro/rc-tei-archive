        <p rend="indent1"> Ld Frederick Bentinck whom I met at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Lowtherestate">Lowther</ref>, proffered his services in obtaining materials for me from Lord Hill, &amp; from his brother.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Lord William Frederick Cavendish Bentinck (1781&#8211;1828), MP for Weobley 1816&#8211;1824,
						MP for Queenborough 1824&#8211;1826; on 16 September 1820 he married Lady Mary Lowther (d. 1863), daughter of the 1st
						Earl of Lonsdale. His brother who could help Southey with his <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
						(1823&#8211;1832) was Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck (1774&#8211;1839; <title>DNB</title>), who served in Spain before
						commanding British troops in Sicily 1811&#8211;1815. Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill (1772&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>),
						was one of the most brilliant British commanders in the Peninsular War 1808&#8211;1813.</note> I have a letter from him
					to day. Lord W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B. will supply all the information &amp; documents in his power. But Lord Hill
					doubts whether he should be justified in so doing, as he acted the whole time in a subordinate capacity. &#8211; I
					suppose this is rather an excuse than a reason, perhaps he is afraid I might make some indiscrete use of his
					name.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The time will come when works of this kind will be written with the direct sanction &amp; aid of
					Government, &#8211; as voyages of discovery are now. For myself I am glad that time is not come yet, as unquestionably I
					can write with much more freedom. But <del>xx</del> a notion has got abroad that something like this is the case.
					An Italian wrote to offer me a manuscript memorial of the Prince of the Peace<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The letter was from Gaetano Bartorelli (dates unknown), offering for sale the memoirs of Manuel
						Godoy y Alvarez de Faria (1767&#8211;1851), Prime Minister of Spain 1792&#8211;1798. Godoy, who lived in exile in Rome
						1812&#8211;1832, published his <title>Mem&#243;rias del Pr&#237;ncipe de la Paz</title> in 1836 in Paris. Bartorelli suggested the
						memoirs would be of use for Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> in
					vindication of himself &#8211; as an important document for my history, &#8211; modestly asking 200 guineas for it. A son of
						Scarletts<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger (1769&#8211;1844;
						<title>DNB</title>), eminent lawyer, MP for various seats 1819&#8211;1835, Attorney-General 1827&#8211;1828, 1829&#8211;1830, Lord
						Chief Baron of the Exchequer 1834&#8211;1844. Scarlett had three sons: Robert Scarlett, 2nd Baron Abinger (1794&#8211;1861),
						lawyer and MP for Norwich 1835&#8211;1838, MP for Horsham 1841&#8211;1844; General Sir James Yorke Scarlett (1799&#8211;1871;
							<title>DNB</title>); and Peter Campbell Scarlett (1804&#8211;1881), diplomat and Envoy Extraordinary to Brazil
						1855&#8211;1858, Tuscany 1858&#8211;1859, Greece 1862&#8211;1864 and Mexico 1864&#8211;1867.</note> forwarded the proposal to me, &amp;
					upon my expressing to him in reply my sense of its folly &amp; extravagance, Young Scarlett said that he as well as
					his friend the Signor took it for granted Government would be at the whole expence of such a work. &#8211; The only thing
					I ever wished to ask of Government, if there had been a likelihood of obtaining it, was a set of their printed
					Records which I cannot afford to buy, &amp; which I shall want for use. It was to you that I applied to know if the
					thing were feasible, &#8211; without the least suspicion that you were any way concerned.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn was one of the Commissioners on the Public Records of the Kingdom, a body periodically
						appointed since 1800 to look into the nation&#8217;s archives. He actively supported plans to publish collections of
						medieval records, as well as series like <title>Statutes of the Realm</title> (1810&#8211;1825).</note> The answer is a
					good specimen of what Government can do to assist an historian in his studies.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have printed 424 pages of my first volume,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
							<title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &amp; it will be ready early in the spring. If
					the booksellers publish it before the whole is ready (which I suppose they will), Lord Hill will see whether the
					&lt;book is of such a character as that he&gt; would wish it to be as correct as possible in those parts wherein he
					is concerned. It is <hi rend="ital">not</hi> of much consequence: for what was actually done, of course I know. And
					in reality I have documents in such abundance, that any additional ones will be of more trouble than real utility.
					It would be a matter of duty with me to examine all, &amp; the additional information which I could now gain could
					not by possibility be worth a tythe of the time which it would cost. You will easily understand this. I have a
					dangerous love of detail, &amp; a <del>xxx</del> desire of accuracy, which is much more expensive (both in
					materials &amp; time) than I ought to afford.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My mornings at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Lowtherestate">Lowther</ref> were spent among

						(1600&#8211;1649; King of Great Britain 1625&#8211;1649; <title>DNB</title>).</note> There I found the Directory<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Directory for Public Worship</title> (1645), which replaced the Anglican
							<title>Book of Common Prayer</title> (1604) in churches under the Parliamentary regime.</note> which I remember
					you told me once you had never seen &amp; which I had long looked for. It is as the title imparts a mere directory,
					&#8211; telling the Preacher when he is to read, when to respond, when to pray &amp; when to preach, &#8211; but setting down
					no form of words, leaving that to his discretion, &#8211; just as old Italian Comedians had the story of their drama
					given them, &amp; were left to supply the dialogue themselves. &#8211; I found a great deal in this great collection of
					pamphletts which one might look for in vain whether in Rushworth or Whitelocke.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Rushworth (1612&#8211;1690; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Historical Collections of Private Passages

					The charge of Popery excited most hatred against him; and that was infamously false. And for all that he would have
