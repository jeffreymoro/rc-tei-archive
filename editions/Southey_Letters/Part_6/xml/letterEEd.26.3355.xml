        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I find your packet, a month after its date, on my return from a long
               tour in Scotland, where I have been &lt;seeing&gt; the great works <del>execu</del> already
               executed, or in progress, for the improvement of that country, &#8211; piers, roads,
               bridges &amp; the Caledonian Canal.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s tour of Scotland lasted from 17 August until 1 October 1819. For
                  his record of events, see <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819</title>,
                  ed. Charles Harold Herford (1929).</note> Had these things been done in France,
               all Europe would have been made to ring with them from side to side.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If I were disposed to produce an article upon the state of the
               country, there would not be time for it, &#8211; because you must certainly enter upon that
               subject in your next number, &#8211; before the meeting of Parliament,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Parliament met on 23 November 1819, primarily to
                  consider the &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; proposed by the Cabinet to suppress radical agitation. The
                  next issue of the <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), did not appear
                  until 11 December 1819.</note> &amp; I am a slow writer upon such topics. I am not
               sorry that there is this valid reason for declining the subject. To confess the
               truth, I see no use in attempting to serve a Government, which will make no effort to
               serve itself, but with its eyes open has suffered the country to be brought to the
               very brink of a <hi rend="ital">Bellum servile</hi>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Literally a &#8216;slave war&#8217;, i.e. a war of the poor against the
                  rich.</note> There is nothing unexpected, nothing surprizing in the present state
               of affairs. For these ten years I have seen it distinctly coming on, &#8211; &amp; at any
               time the evil might have been checked by a few salutary laws. Three years ago we
               succeeded in making a strong impression in favour of the Government, &amp; what use
               did Government make of the opportunity?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is here probably referring to his articles on &#8216;the state of the
                  country&#8217; for the <title>Quarterly</title>, including &#8216;Parliamentary Reform&#8217;,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (October 1816), 225&#8211;278, and &#8216;Rise and
                  Progress of Popular Disaffection&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 16 (January
                  1817), 511&#8211;552.</note> Could any thing be more miserably imbecile than to ask for
               a suspension of the Habeas Corpus for twelvemonths only<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Habeas corpus was the legal principle that prevented detention
                  without trial; it was suspended for a year from March 1817.</note>
          <del>x</del> instead of during the danger! And even during that year the wrong use
               was made of the power which they had obtained. Hunt<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry &#8216;Orator&#8217; Hunt (1773&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>), radical
                  politician.</note>
          <del>ought to have been</del> &lt;was&gt; the first man whom they ought to have seized, &#8211;
               &amp; after him the seditious writers.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We want new laws for the mob &amp; for the press. Transportation for
               life should be the punishment of sedition, any thing short of this is mere folly.
               <ref type="m" target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fox</ref> law of
                  libel<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The Libel Act (1792), sponsored
                  by Fox, which made the jury, rather than the judge, the main element in deciding
                  whether a publication was libellous.</note> should be repealed, for by putting the
               jury in the place of the judge it refers every question of that kind to be tried, not
               by the laws, but by the popular humour. The newspapers should be curbed by requiring
               securities from their proprietors, to a serious amount. All public meetings should be
               declared illegal unless a requisition for these were signed by a certain number of
               persons possessing a certain qualification, &amp; those persons should be made
               responsible for the resolutions passd at such meetings. &#8211; But things will go on from
               bad to worse till they produce a reaction which will call for stronger measures. Some
               great mischief may very probably take place: more houses will be pulled down, or
                  <del>set on fire</del> &lt;burnt&gt;, &#8211; perhaps some large manufacturing town may be set
               on fire; &#8211; more constables will be murdered,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Campbell (d. 1819), a special constable, was killed by a mob in Newton
                  Lane following the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre of 16 August 1819, in which local
                  magistrates ordered the dispersal of a public meeting in Manchester, resulting in
                  at least eleven deaths.</note> &amp; <del>perhaps</del> it is not unlikely that
               the system of assassination may extend farther. And then because we will not impose a
               few salutary restraints to prevent these evils, we must submit to more &amp; greater
               in the hope of <del>xxxxx</del> remedying them, &#8211; a suffering nation <del>will</del>

               made to suit better the importance of the subject. I will write shortly to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> for one or two books which will enable me to treat
               it more fully. As for <ref type="m" target="people.html#HaydonBenjamin">Haydon</ref>, I know too little of him
               to bear any personal feelings which might bias me concerning him, &#8211; but I know that
               those who dislike him speak with high respect of his professional talents. However I
               will endeavour to leave nothing objectionable upon that score.</p>

               &amp; I am sure that the writer regards Materialism with as much horror as you do.
