					worthy of exportation. Two small pots were sent as more convenient than one of the larger size, this article not

						fish found in Lakes Windermere and Coniston; potted char was (and remains) a local delicacy, often served for

        <p rend="indent1"> If you read Sir Ch. Wolseleys wise letter to Lord Castlereagh you would notice <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landors</ref> name very oddly mentioned as the one person (Sir C being the
					other) who had the best means of knowing what the Queens conduct was, at Como.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Charles Wolseley, 7th Baronet (1769&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>), radical. A public meeting in
						Birmingham on 12 July 1819 had elected him &#8216;legislatorial attorney and representative&#8217; for the town. In April 1820
						he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment for sedition and conspiracy for a speech he had given at
						Stockport on 28 June 1819. He had written from prison to Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1769&#8211;1822;
							<title>DNB</title>), Foreign Secretary 1812&#8211;1822, offering to go to Italy and collect information concerning
						Queen Caroline (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), who was facing a Bill of Pains and Penalties that would have
						dissolved her marriage to George IV on the grounds of her adultery. Not receiving a reply, Wolseley had published
						the letter in <title>The Times</title>, 11 October 1820, noting his acquaintance with Caroline when she lived at
						Como in 1817 and stating he could obtain information &#8216;that no Englishman but myself and a Mr. Walter Landon, who
						is now in Italy, can have the opportunity of knowing.&#8217; Southey saw the letter and transcribed it for Landor, who
						responded by sending a letter to <title>The Times</title> and writing to Southey, asking him to insert the letter
						in the <title>Courier</title> as well. <title>The Times</title> published Landor&#8217;s letter on 4 December 1820; in it he
						insisted &#8216;whatever I may have heard relating to the Queen, I know nothing positive, and never made a single
						inquiry that either could inculpate or acquit her in the cause now pending&#8217;.</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> has sent me a letter for the newspapers disclaiming any
					association with this mischievous blockhead. He has also sent it to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parr,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Landor had sent the copy of his letter for <title>The Times</title> to his friend and
						mentor, Samuel Parr (1747&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>), clergyman, schoolmaster, writer, Whig and supporter of Queen
						Caroline.</note> who I hope will suppress it, as I shall do, tho for other motives. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorWalterSavage">Landor</ref> with his usual precipitance, believes the lies concerning
					Ompteda &amp; the Milan Commission,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Friedrich August Philipp von Ompteda
						(1772&#8211;1819), a Hanoverian diplomat, had been instructed by George IV to obtain evidence of Caroline&#8217;s adultery
						when she lived in Italy in 1814&#8211;1815. He had collected a great deal of gossip, but found no decisive proof. George
						IV had also instructed John Leach (1760&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), MP for Sleaford 1806&#8211;1816 and his legal adviser
						as Chancellor of the Duchy of Cornwall 1816&#8211;1820, to set up an investigation in 1818 to gather evidence against
						Caroline. Leach sent two commissioners to Milan in September 1818&#8211;March 1819 to try and interview as many
						potential witnesses as possible.</note> with which the Italian papers are filled, by an obvious management; &amp;
					his letter is written under that belief, &#8211; tho as for the Q. he says of her (to me of course &amp; not to the
					public this) that her tongue is one firebrand &amp; her tail is another.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But of Sir Ch. he says in the private part of his letter &#8211; (&amp; it is worth quoting, to show
					you that this Sir C. is rogue as well as fool) &#8220;I admire the impudence of Wolseley. He attempted to defend the
					whoredoms of the Princess, but never hinted a thought of her innocence, when I constantly represented her what all
					Italy knows her to be, &#8211; not indeed with legal proofs, (such are almost impossible in similar cases) but according
					to all appearances, year after year.&#8217;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Landor to Southey, November 1820, John
