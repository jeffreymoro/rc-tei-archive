                  to be godfather to Charles Cuthbert Southey.</note> But <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> as
               soon as he learnt the probability of such an event, hoping for a chance which certainly I did not look forward to with hope myself,
               requested that in that case he might stand in the same relation to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">this
                  child</ref> as he had done to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">his poor brother</ref>. And so when the child was
               born I wrote to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> asking him to do the same.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">See Robert Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 24 February 1819, Letter 3253.</note> They have both desired that
               he might bear the name of Charles, &amp; therefore it will be prefixed to Cuthbert, &#8211; the name by which he will be called. &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">The boy</ref>, I hope, is going on well, &amp; is to all appearances uncommonly
               strong &amp; thriving. The <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">mother</ref> is not so well, she is compleatly lame at
               present. But I believe these kind of afflictions of the leg are not uncommon in such circumstances, &amp; our Esculapius<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Aesculapius, the god of medicine; in a Keswick context, the physician <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">John Edmondson</ref>.</note> treats it so lightly, that I conclude it is only a temporary evil
               &amp; of no long duration. But it is a very serious inconvenience so long as it lasts. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> After an interval of nearly seven years,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Isabel Southey was born on 2 November
                  1812 and Charles Cuthbert Southey on 24 February 1819.</note> the cry of an infant in the house is a strange sound. &#8211; It is as you
               may suppose an absolute carnival for the other children.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyKate">Kate</ref>, and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel Southey</ref>
                  and, possibly, their cousin <ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeSaraSTCdaughter">Sara Coleridge</ref>. </note> My own first
               feeling was thankfulness for the narrow escape of child &amp; mother. Afterwards <del>I have too much to</del> recollections &amp;
               forebodings left little room for joy. <del>For setting aside the xxx</del> passing over the frailty of an infants life, which is of all
               frail things the frailest, I know that according to <del>the</del> common chances it is little likely I should live to see him grow up,
               &#8211; &amp; perhaps I may never be able to do with him, what I was doing so successfully with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">Herbert</ref>. To do it in the same manner will assuredly be impossible. But there is no
               occasion to look on to a time which <del>very</del> one or the other, or very possibly both of us may not live to see. Sufficient for
               the day are the duties thereof. &#8211; &amp; there is no wisdom in anticipating anxieties which come quite soon enough of themselves. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hope to be in town by the end of April. By that time I expect to have finished Brazil,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> &amp; a paper for the QR.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s article &#8216;Cemeteries and Catacombs of Paris&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (April 1819),

                     Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> must be left unfinished till my return, for if I delay
               longer, I shall <del>lose too much of the summer</del> be absent from this place at the season when it is most desirable to be here.
               For three or four months past I have been unremittingly engaged in the Brazilian history &#8211; &amp; now the close is very near &#8211; ten days
               I think will bring me down to the time of the removal of the Court<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The flight of the Portuguese
                  court to Brazil in 1807&#8211;1808, covered in the <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), III, pp. 694&#8211;695.</note>
               &#8211; &amp; then there remains only the concluding chapter comprizing a general view of the state of Brazil at that time.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), III, pp. 696&#8211;879. At the conclusion of
                  this final chapter, Southey added the date &#8216;<hi rend="ital">Keswick, June 23d</hi>, 1819&#8217;.</note> This volume will be the largest of
               the three, &amp; in some respects the most curious, as containing a much greater portion of historical matter which had never before
               been published in any form. Indeed when I look at the materials from which it is composed I almost wonder at what I have achieved. &#8211;
               The completion will be a great advantage to my finances, &#8211; it has been the <del>xxx</del> sinking fund in which a large portion of my
               time has been absorbed: &#8211; no time so pleasantly, &#8211; nor so unprofitably. It is I think very doubtful whether the work will reach a
               second edition during my life.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">A second edition of the first volume of the <title>History of
                     Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819) appeared in 1822. The other two volumes did not go beyond first editions.</note> But I shall carefully
               prepare one, neglect no opportunity of consulting every document which may fall in my way, correcting what is erroneous, &amp; adding
               what is deficient. For I know the value of the book, &amp; know also that it will be acknowledged in due time. &#8211; The third volume of
               the Patriota has been very useful to me.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The Brazilian journal <title>O Patriota</title>

                  procuring the third volume of this for him, &#8216;when it was not to be obtained at Lisbon&#8217;. It was no. 3641 in the sale catalogue of his
