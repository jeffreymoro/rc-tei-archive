        <p>British Library, Add MS 47553. TR;
                  3p. .  Previously  published: Edward Dowden (ed.), The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles (Dublin
                  and London, 1881), pp. 363&#8211;366. Note on MS: The letter is a reply to that sent by Shelley, 17 August 1820. Southey&#8217;s letter
                  survives in an undated transcript by Edith May Southey (though the date written at the top of the transcript is in Southey&#8217;s hand).
                  Our copy text is from this transcript. It was sent by Southey to John Taylor Coleridge on 19 January 1821. The text contains some
                  verbal differences from the version published in Dowden, which was based on a transcript made by Caroline Bowles that seems not to
                  have survived; see Edward Dowden (ed.), The Correspondence of Robert Southey with Caroline Bowles (Dublin and London,
                  1881), p. 363 n. The text in Dowden contains some variants, notably the addition of two sentences to the paragraph on
                  Shelley&#8217;s marriage (see note 14 below). </p>
        <p>These letters were edited with the assistance of Ian Packer and Lynda Pratt</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> Such was my opinion of you when we parted. What I heard of your subsequent conduct tended always to lower it except as
               regarded your talents. At length you forsook <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyHarriet">your wife</ref> because you were tired

               would make me open my eyes. Perhaps they are already open. It is a matter of public notoriety that <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyHarriet">your wife</ref> destro[MS torn] herself
               &lt;destroyed herself&gt;.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Harriet Shelley committed suicide by drowning. Her body was recovered from

               attributed this to her sensibility on that score, &#8211; &amp; I have heard it otherwise explained. I have heard that she followed your
               example as faithfully as your lessons &amp; that this catastrophe was produced by shame.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  circumstances of Harriet Shelley&#8217;s death were not public knowledge. The inquest on Harriet Shelley described her as &#8216;Harriet Smith&#8217;,

                  that she was living apart from her husband, who was abroad, and that she was &#8216;far advanced in pregnancy&#8217;. However, Harriet Shelley&#8217;s
                  pregnancy and suicide were the subject of a great deal of gossip in literary circles and Southey could have learned of them on one
                  of his visits to London.</note> &#8211; Be this as it may, ask your own heart, whether you have not been the whole, sole &amp; direct
               cause of her destruction? You corrupted her opinions, you robbed her of her moral &amp; religious principles, you debauched her mind.
               But for you &amp; your lessons she might have gone through the world innocently &amp; happily. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will do you justice Sir. While you were at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> you told <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyHarriet">your bride</ref> that you regarded marriage as a mere ceremony, &amp; would live with
               her no longer than you liked her. I dare say you told her so before the ceremony &amp; that you persuaded her that there was nothing
               sacred in the tie. But that she should have considered this <del>xx</del> &lt;to be&gt; the condition upon which she was married, &#8211; or that
               you yourself at that time looked forward to a breach of the connexion I do not believe. I think still too well of your original nature
               to believe it. She trusted to your heart, not your opinions. Your first love, the wife of your youth, <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyHarriet">she</ref> relied upon your generosity your truth your affection your tenderness might well rely
               upon these, &amp; with the more confidence when she became the mother of your first children.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Shelley&#8217;s children by Harriet: Eliza Ianthe (1813&#8211;1876) and Charles (1814&#8211;1826).</note> No! Sir, you were not depraved enough to
               think you should ever desert her when you talked of it as a possible event, &#8211; &amp; if you had not tampered with your own heart by
               speculating upon such possibilities &amp; contemplating them as allowable, her confidence in you would not have been decieved. That

        <p rend="indent1"> You say that your only &lt;real&gt; crime is the holding opinions something similar to those which I once held respecting the
               existing state of society. That Sir, is not your crime, &#8211; it would only be your error. Your offence is moral as well as political, &#8211;
               practical as well as speculative. Nor were my opinions ever similar to yours in any other point, than that desiring, as I still desire,
               a greater equality in the condition of men, I entertained erroneous notions concerning the making of that improvement in society &amp;
               the means whereby it was to be promoted. Except in this, light &amp; darkness were not more opposite than my youthful opinions &amp;
               yours. You would have &lt;found&gt; me as strongly opposed in my youth as I am at this time to Atheism and immorality of any kind &amp; to
