        <p rend="indent1"> I have had an uneasy doubt upon my mind whether I had written to
               thank you for your Lyrical Dramas, or not.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Neale&#8217;s <title>Lyrical Dramas: With Domestic Hours, A Miscellany of Odes and
                     Songs</title> (1819), no. 2024 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
                  library.</note> For the volume arrived when I was in the hurry of preparing for a
               journey into the Highlands, &amp; the succession of scenes in which I was for several
               weeks engaged made me incapable of recollecting what duties of this kind I had
               performed, &amp; what had been left undone.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s tour of Scotland had lasted from 17 August until 1 October 1819.
                  For his record of events, see <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in
                  1819</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (1929). </note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Excuse me, for what was the effect of hurry, not of intentional or
               conscious neglect.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I read your volume with much pleasure, &amp; those of my family who
               are old enough to be readers were much pleased with it also. Few volumes contain such
               specimens of sweet &amp; unaffected versification, &#8211; of language easy &amp; natural,
               of fancy always active where it ought to be, &amp; of feeling which is always right.
               And no volume could ever <del>convey a more</del> impress upon the reader a more
               favourable opinion of the author.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Quarterly Review has a very mischievous effect incidentally upon
               those books which it does not notice. This ought not to be the case, because its
               notice is capricious. It sometimes brings forward things which will be left in the
               shade, &amp; more frequently neglects others that are well deserving of praise.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have myself for some years found it necessary to resolve against
                  <del>criticizing</del> reviewing any contemporary poetry. On a very few occasions
               (the present &lt;is&gt; one) I have regretted the necessity of declaring this resolution &#8211;
               But in how many instances has it served me in good stead, &amp; afforded me the only
               reply which could be made <del>which</del> without inflicting pain, or giving
               offence!</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Remember me to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ConderJosiah">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Conder</ref>. I have behaved very ill to him, &#8211; &amp; if I
               were to speak of good intentions, he would perhaps remember what such things are said
               to serve for in the other world.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  proverb, &#8216;The road to hell is paved with good intentions&#8217;.</note> But I shall see
               him in the early spring, &amp; he will hear from me &#8211; (in print at least) before we
               meet. I shall endeavour to find you also, if you should then be in town, &amp; assure
               you in person of that respect &amp; regard with which I remain</p>
