        <p rend="indent1"> I am sorry to hear the cause of your long absence from town, &amp; that so little benefit to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Murrays<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Murray&#8217;s wife Anne (1782&#8211;1845), n&#233;e
						Elliot.</note> health has been derived from it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Some weeks ago I wrote to you, &amp; I have no doubt that the letter shared the same fate with
					one written about the same time to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref>, which
					never reached him. You had sent me two Huntingtonian books, which were nothing more than separate portions of his
						works;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of <title>The Works of the Reverend William
							Huntington, S. S. Minister of the Gospel, at Providence Chapel, Gray&#8217;s Inn Lane, Completed to the Close of the
							Year 1806</title> (1811) appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24 (January 1821), 462&#8211;510.</note> but at
					the end was a list of Publications sold by his son in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Giles&#8217;s,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">S. Huntington (dates unknown) of 55 High Street, near St. Giles&#8217;s Church, sold his father&#8217;s works
						and other religious publications.</note> from which I selected the following titles of works furnishing matter
					either for the present article or the Book of the Church,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
							<title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824).</note> which is in steady progress [remainder of MS page
					missing]</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The peninsular war may be estimated at three volumes of from 6 to 700 pages, such pages as the H:
					of Brazil:<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
						(1823&#8211;1832) and <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). The latter had contained marginal notations and also
						endnotes. The three volumes of the <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> contained 806, 807 and 936 pages
						respectively, so Southey, as usual, underestimated the length of his work. The volumes also contained marginal
						references.</note> &#8211; but there will be no marginal references, &amp; the notes at the bottom may be printed so as
					to take up the least room.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the Sketch Book, &#8211; it is very clever, very amusing, &amp; in an excellent
						spirit:<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Washington Irving&#8217;s (1783&#8211;1859) <title>The Sketch Book of Geoffrey
							Crayon, Gent.</title> (1819), a collection of essays and short stories. Murray had taken on the publication of a
						British edition in 1820.</note> &#8211; And for knickerbocker,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Irving&#8217;s satirical
							<title>A History of New York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by Diedrich
							Knickerbocker</title>, first published in 1809; Murray published an edition in 1820, and had sent Southey a copy,
						no. 1486 in the sale catalogue of the latter&#8217;s library. </note> &#8211; this I should think will hardly bear
					transplantation from its native soil.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You ask me concerning the times, a subject on which, living in perfect peace, &amp; out of the
					sphere of the prevailing madness, I am little qualified to form an opinion, &#8211; except indeed the opinion which I
					have long held that things must be worse before they are better. The Whigs will go on as they have begun till an
					explosion takes place, &amp; then we shall see who among them are fools &amp; who traitors: the traitors will be
					five to one: but the fools are those who have most weight to throw into the scale, provided the balance be not
					destroyed. I shall probably have something for you when it is time; &#8211; some preventatives &amp; remedies to suggest,
					&#8211; but we must wait for the proper season. &#8211; I expect that my book of Dialogues<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>
						(1829).</note> will produce some [remainder of MS page missing]</p>
        <p rend="indent0"> impression now, &amp; some good in time. I mean to sweeten it that it may go down, &#8211; with
					descriptive sketches of this country, &amp; a few poems, so that there may be something for various tempers. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westall</ref> has made some sketches for it.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Westall produced the following six sketches of Lake District scenes that were engraved for

						Newlands&#8217;, and &#8216;Tarn of Blencathra&#8217;.</note> And I shall spare no pains in the composition, designing <del>to make
						it a</del> that my reputation hereafter for political sagacity should rest upon this work.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Book of the Church<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the
							Church</title> (1824).</note> will so certainly do good, that I feel a sense of duty among my motives for
					delaying it no longer. I could send you a portion now; but it will be better to advance farther, that I may more
					accurately estimate its extent, &#8211; the subject might easily tempt me to be more diffuse than I intended</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will really serve as well as oblige me, if you let me have a duplicate set of proofs of my
