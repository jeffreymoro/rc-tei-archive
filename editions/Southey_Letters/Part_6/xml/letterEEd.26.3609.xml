        <p rend="indent1"> I begin to be a little impatient for a proof of the Vision, &#8211; the newspapers I see announce it as

							Gospel, at Providence Chapel, Gray&#8217;s Inn Lane, Completed to the Close of the Year 1806</title> (1811) appeared in
							<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24 (January 1821), 462&#8211;510.</note> Many next days have past without any
					appearance thereof, &amp; I wish <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> would ask if it
					has been sent, there being a possibility that it may have been lost on the way, an accident which have befallen
					letters to or from me, three or four times in the course of my life, &#8211; one not very long since which was addressed
					to yourself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> has very often vexed me by turning
					a paper of mine over to the next number, whereby my budget is sometimes very inconveniently deranged, &#8211; more so
					than he perhaps is aware of. It lays me always under an obligation to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref>, &amp; in once instance it enabled him to take a very unfair advantage of me, &amp; pay me fifty
					pounds for one of my best papers instead of an hundred, &#8211; because it stood over for <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Giffords</ref> convenience, when it ought to have appeared, &#8211; two papers were
					then printed in one number, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> chose to abide by an
					offer he had made to insert two in every number, one at 100 &amp; the other at 50.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had in fact protested vehemently on two occasions when he had published two articles in the
						same issue of the <title>Quarterly Review</title> and felt he had been underpaid. The first was <title>Quarterly
							Review</title>, 15 (July 1816), where Southey reviewed a series of volumes by travellers in England under the
						title &#8216;Works on England&#8217; (537&#8211;574), and his review of &#8216;Ali Bey&#8217;, Domingo Badia y Leblich (1766&#8211;1818),
							<title>Travels of Ali Bey in Morocco, Tripoli, Cyprus, Egypt, Arabia, Syria, and Turkey, Between the Years 1803
							and 1807</title> (1816) also appeared at <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 15 (July 1816), 299&#8211;345; see Southey to
						John Murray, 17 November 1816, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 2864.
							In<title> Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 1&#8211;54, Southey reviewed <title>Memoirs, Illustrative of the
							Life and Writings of John Evelyn</title> (1818); his article &#8216;On the Means of Improving the People&#8217; appeared at
						79&#8211;118. For Southey&#8217;s protest, see Southey to John Murray, 7 October 1818, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert
							Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3201.</note> I made no remonstrance, but felt that I had not been well
					used.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There may however be some advantage ultimately in the frequent disappointments to which I have
					been subjected. They very much weaken the single motive which induces me ever to write under an editor who takes
					such unwarrantable liberties with my papers. If I cannot obtain the supplies which I want by this means <hi rend="ital">when</hi> I want them, I must seek for them thro some other channel. Say nothing about this. I shall
					withdraw quietly, &amp; derive larger sums from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> &#8211; in a
					manner much more worthy of myself, &amp; without having my works corrected like a school boys exercise.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Murray had offered Southey &#163;400 for a book derived from the journal of his continental
						tour of May&#8211;August 1817 (this was not written); and &#163;1,000 for a blank-verse poem occasioned by the death of
						Herbert Southey. Southey began, but did not finish, such a poem, entitled &#8216;Consolation&#8217;. Sections were published
						after his death as &#8216;Fragmentary Thoughts Occasioned by his Son&#8217;s Death&#8217; in <title>Oliver Newman: A New-England
							Tale (Unfinished): With Other Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp. 93&#8211;95, and &#8216;Additional Fragment,
						Occasioned by the Death of his Son&#8217;, <title>Poetical Works of Robert Southey. Complete in One Volume</title>
						(London, 1850), p. 815. Murray also published Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of the Church</title> (1824) and
							<title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829), and discussed a
						number of other projects with Southey on his visit to London in May&#8211;June 1820, including a series of biographical
						studies.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I can hardly tell you how much I was shocked by <del>the xxxxxxx</del> hearing of poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash&#8217;s</ref> death.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Brief notices
