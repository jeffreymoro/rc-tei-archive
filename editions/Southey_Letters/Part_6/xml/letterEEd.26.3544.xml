                  and philanthropist. He had been an important supporter of Andrew Bell&#8217;s
                  educational schemes and owned the Storrs Hall estate on Windermere. He was also
                  the uncle of the painter John Constable (1776&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>). His
                  daughter and heiress was Mary Watts-Russell (1792&#8211;1840), who had married, in 1811,
                  another heir to a business fortune, Jesse Watts-Russell (1786&#8211;1875), MP for Gatton
                  1820&#8211;1826. They lived at Ilam Hall in Staffordshire and had eight children.</note>

                  religious writer William Huntington (1745&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>) had added
                  &#8216;S.S.&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;Sinner Saved&#8217; &#8211; to his name to indicate his spiritual state. Southey&#8217;s
                  review of <title>The Works of the Reverend William Huntington, S. S. Minister of
                     the Gospel, at Providence Chapel, Gray&#8217;s Inn Lane, Completed to the Close of
                     the Year 1806</title> (1811) appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24

        <p rend="indent1"> I did not intend that my intention of writing a life of George Fox
               should have been publicly known for some time.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">George Fox (1624&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>), founder of the Society of

               thro this channel. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Calvert was bred a Quaker.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Calvert, n&#233;e Mitchinson (dates unknown). She
                  was the daughter of John Mitchinson (dates unknown), a Quaker conveyancer in
                  Carlisle, and had two sisters: Ruth Maude, n&#233;e Mitchinson (1772&#8211;1849), married to
                  Jacob Maude of Selaby Hall, Durham (1757&#8211;1840), a Quaker landowner and colliery
                  proprietor in the North East; and Abigail Salkeld, n&#233;e Mitchinson (1777&#8211;1831),
                  married to Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Salkeld (1761&#8211;1820) of Holme Hill, near
                  Carlisle, a retired Quarter Master General of the army of Bengal. Widowed in 1820,
                  Abigail married, in 1822, John Staig (1770&#8211;1855), Collector of Customs and later
                  Deputy Lieutenant of Dumfriesshire. </note> &#8211; I borrowed what books she happened
               to possess, &amp; she applied to her sisters for their share of her fathers

               from her in consequence. Her wish evidently was that I should not pursue my purpose &#8211;
               because the Qs. are ashamed of their early history. The interview ended however in
               her offering me access to books papers &amp;c. <ref type="m" target="people.html#LloydCharlesSnr">Old Ch. Lloyd</ref> has since
               written to me, &amp; the whole Mundus Quakerius will be in commotion. I
                  expect<del>s</del> to be inundated with letters &amp; civilities arising from an
               obvious motive. &#8211; On the whole the task of collecting materials will be facilitated
               &amp; the book be written just in the same unbiassed spirit as if I were anonymous
