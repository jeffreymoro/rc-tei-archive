        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been very much shocked at hearing of poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash&#8217;s</ref> death, the news of which was communicated to me by his brother-in-law,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> who tells me that you were called in to him but too late. I had spent more
					than one year out of the last five in company with him, at home or abroad, &#8211; &amp; here he had become so
					domesticated that the children almost regarded him as one of the family. His death therefore has cast a deep shade
					over what were the sunniest recollections of my latter years. Poor fellow, he bore his cross so meekly, that it was
					impossible to know him well, without <del>fee</del> becoming greatly attached to him, &amp; the more he was known
					the more highly he was valued.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I must write ere long to his brother in law about the portraits which he, poor fellow, took to
					London with him to have them framed, &#8211; you will be able to identify them, &#8211; they were <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">my Aunt
						Mary</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref>, &amp; one of those of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith May</ref>, of which there were three, little differing from each
						other.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">These pictures probably included the portraits of Edith May in three
						different dresses, &#8216;lilac&#8217;, &#8216;redder&#8217; and &#8216;uncoloured&#8217;, described in Southey to John May, 8 April 1821, Letter
						3667. </note> These are mine, &amp; I shall ask to have the others which he made of this family for himself, &#8211; as
					things of no interest to others, &#8211; but valuable here. There is moreover my <hi rend="ital">back</hi> portrait,
					designed as the frontispiece to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dove, &#8211; an intention which must be given up now that the
					drawing passes thro other hands.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Dr Dove project&#8217; was finally published
						as Southey&#8217;s anonymous novel, <title>The Doctor</title> (1834&#8211;1847). Nash&#8217;s picture of Southey from behind, the
						&#8216;reariture&#8217;, was used as the frontispiece to the one volume edition of <title>The Doctor</title> (London, 1848),
						[unpaginated], titled &#8216;Portrait of the Author&#8217;. </note> I should very much like also to have his little pocket
					book, full of sketches which he made in his walks here.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Archaica &amp; Heliconia (six quarto vols)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Egerton
						Brydges, <title>Archaica: Containing a Reprint of Scarce Old English Prose Tracts</title> (1814&#8211;1815); and Thomas
						Park (1759&#8211;1834; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Heliconia: Comprising a Selection of English Poetry of the
							Elizabethan Age</title> (1814). The two works were no. 168 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, where they
						were described as &#8216;FINE COPY, <hi rend="ital">calf extra, marbled leaves</hi>.&#8217;</note> went up in his trunk, when
					he wanted ballast; he was to send them to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref> to bind
					for me, &amp; we cut off the covers which lessened their bulk about a fourth. I must enquire if they had been
					delivered to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref>, &amp; if not, must trouble you to
					recover them for me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Had it not been for this heavy loss, the new year would have opened chearfully with me
						<del>x</del> in many respects, finding me well employed &amp; in good heart &amp; hope. On Xmas day I received the
					first proofs of the Hist: of the War,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the
							Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &amp; I am daily expecting the first proof of the hexameters, which

            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> I shall not get much by them, except abuse, &#8211;
					which falls upon me with as little annoyance as hail stones upon an umbrella. But they will be talked of, &amp;
					there will be parties for &amp; against the metre, &amp; the practicability of the metre is proved, &amp; the
					credit of the attempt will be worth having, hereafter. I shall probably append to it for the sake of adding three
					sheets to a thin book, my Odes of the two last years,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;The Warning Voice.
						Ode I&#8217; and &#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode II&#8217;, the New Year&#8217;s Odes for 1820 and 1821, were not published until they
						appeared in <title>The Englishman&#8217;s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National
							Information</title> (London, 1824), pp. 381&#8211;389. They were not published with <title>A Vision of
