               will now somewhat exceed 500 lines. I should like to dedicate it to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElmsleyPeter">Elmsley</ref>, if
               it were not for an apprehension that a poem upon such a subject coming from the P.L. could not with propriety be dedicated to any
               person but the <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">K.</ref> &amp; in that case it must go without one; for altho at

               act according to their conviction &amp; their judgement,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Under extreme pressure from George IV,
                  the Cabinet had reluctantly agreed to introduce a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King&#8217;s wife,
                  Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King. On the Third
                  Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass
                  the House of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore had announced the Bill would be withdrawn.</note> I should like
               to offer him a mark of respect, &#8211; so experimental a production as this is not what one would chuse for the occasion. Tell me, if you
               think there would be an impropriety in addressing it to the Czar.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander I (1777&#8211;1825; Tsar
                  of Russia 1801&#8211;1825).</note> By dividing it into sections, which is on every account desirable, &#8211; by adding a few notes, &amp;
               giving an account of former attempts in our language, &amp; similar ones in other modern tongues the book will gain a substantive bulk,
               &#8211; perhaps as thick as the Carmen Nuptiale, &#8211; but the size must be foolscap quarto.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">

                  47&#8211;65) and &#8216;Specimens&#8217; (pp. 67&#8211;79). It was not published in foolscap quarto, but in quarto. In fact, at 93 pages, <title>A Vision of
                     Judgement</title>, was longer than the <title>Lay of the Laureate</title> (1816), which comprised 77 pages.</note>
