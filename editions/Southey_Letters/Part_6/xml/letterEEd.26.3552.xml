					the gloomy thoughts &amp; feelings which the newspaper has produced.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Under
						extreme pressure from George IV, the Cabinet had reluctantly agreed to introduce a Bill of Pains and Penalties
						into the House of Lords to deprive the King’s wife, Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821; <title>DNB</title>), of the
						title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the
						government majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House of Commons. Lord
						Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore announced the Bill would be withdrawn.</note> – Come here early in May,
					&amp; I will put you in good condition, body &amp; mind. We will go over the whole of the Land of Lakes, making a
					compleat tour of them, – &amp; I will have a pair of riding breeches made for the nonce, to go on horseback with
					you. We will have mountain parties, – &amp; such tarn scenes as <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> will show you in his drawing, – make your arrangements accordingly, &amp; for me, I will live upon the
					exercise in anticipation, till you make your appearance.</p><p rend="indent1"> It is well that one has something to exhilarate one in private life, – for otherwise there is
					very little either at home or abroad, which can be regarded with hope, or with complacency. I am heartily ashamed
					of the English people, who have retained nothing of the old English character, except physical courage, &amp;
					extreme credulity. – <hi rend="ital">Physical</hi> courage I say, because there is very little of the moral virtue
					left. We are at this time under the tyranny of the Press, – &amp; the men who have the direction of <del>the</del>
					public opinion, &amp; thereby of public affairs, are precisely the greatest rascals in the country, the most
					profligate &amp; worst-principled adventurers of the age. Things cannot continue thus. &amp; whatever course they
					may take, if you &amp; I should reach the age of threescore years &amp; ten, we shall in all human probability have
					outlived the English constitution &amp; the liberties of England. The question is not whether we shall escape from
					despotism, but whether the process by which it is to be brought on will be longer or shorter, – more or less
					calamitous &amp; frightful. In the present <del>xx</del> condition of the world I am perfectly certain that no
					government can withstand the influence of a free press; – the freedom of the press is incompatible with public
					security, – &amp; yet we know that the inevitable tendency of despotism is to degrade mankind, &amp; that without
					the wholesome influence of the press governments tend to despotism. – But of what use is it to anticipate evils,
					against which no exertions can avail, till we have a resolute government.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> has now the whole article upon
					Huntington in his hands.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s review of <title>The Works of the

						462–510. Unfortunately for Southey, it did not appear in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 24 (October 1820),

					Nelson. He became so wretched that it was an act of mercy to put him in the river, – &amp; that service was
					rendered him by poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilson</ref>. Bona
					Fidelia reached a good old age, &amp; was found dead in the wood-house. There then remained Madame Bianchi, who was
					Bona’s daughter, &amp; Pulcheria who was Madames daughter. These poor creatures who lived with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilson</ref>, &amp; had possession of the chairs &amp; the
					fireside in her kitchen forsook the house the day that she had her mortal seizure. They became almost wild, – at
					length however we got them to come into the house for food, &amp; I had persuaded them to come to my call before I
					left home in the spring. When I returned Madame had disappeared (&amp; has never been seen since) – &amp; Pulcheria
					was in a miserable state, – dying of some disease which was then prevalent among the cats &amp; very fatal to them.
					It was pitiable to see her, &amp; yet in the hope of her recovery, I could not order an end to be put to her
					lingering. But I was glad when she was found dead. – A visitor from the town, by name Virgil, who haunted these
					premises, being probably driven from his own, died here also. And thus the old generation to which Bona Marietta,
					Sir Thomas Dido, &amp; Madame Catalani had belonged, was extinct. We have now only a young Othello, from Newlands;
					he has the defect of being of a miserably small breed, otherwise a worthy &amp; promising cat who has never looked
					into a boot; &amp; is safe from all such operators as the Editor of the Q.R.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. the cat was in no danger, unlike Southey’s articles, of being castrated by <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, who was a former shoemaker. Southey referred to Gifford’s
						habit of making changes to Southey’s articles as ‘putting them in the boot’.</note> – Sir I shall be very happy to
					introduce you to Othello. It is a good name, not merely as expressing his complection, but because he will
					undoubtedly be as jealous as beseems his Tomship. I trust he will be the founder of a new Dynasty, &amp; that in a
