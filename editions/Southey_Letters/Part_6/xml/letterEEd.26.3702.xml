        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had not leisure to reply to your former letter when it arrived; &#8211; a
               full reply to it, indeed, would require <del>xxxx</del> a dissertation rather than a
               letter. The Influence of the Holy Spirit is believed by all Christians, except the
               Ultra-Socinians, &#8211; the more pious Socinians would admit it, tho under a different
                  name.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Holy Spirit is the third
                  entity in the Christian Trinity, and &#8216;Socinian&#8217; was at this time another term for
                  the Unitarian strand in Christianity. Unitarians did not accept the existence of
                  the Trinity. Some were only willing to use the term &#8216;Holy Spirit&#8217; to describe an
                  aspect of God&#8217;s power, especially when directly inspiring or relating to human
                  beings; while others regarded the &#8216;Holy Spirit&#8217; as a subordinate divine being
                  created by God. </note> But the question what is, &amp; what is not, the effect of
               that Influence, is precisely asking where, in religious cases, reason ends, &amp;
               insanity begins. In all communities of Christians there have been, &amp; are persons,
               who mistake their own imaginations for inspiration; &amp; that this was done in some
               cases by the early Quakers, the present members of that Society would not deny.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is always my custom to have a work long in my thoughts before it
               is taken actually in hand: &amp; to collect materials &amp; let the plan digest while
               my main occupation is upon some other subject &#8211; which has undergone the same slow but
               necessary process. At present I am printing the History of the Peninsular War,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular
                     War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> &#8211; a great work, &#8211; &amp; it is probable that
               this is not the only work which I shall bring out, before the Life of George Fox
               becomes my immediate business.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                  proposed, but unexecuted, life of George Fox (1624&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>),
                  founder of the Society of Friends. </note> One great advantage arising from this
               practise is, that much in the meantime is collected in the course of other pursuits
               which would not have been found by a direct search: &#8211; facts &amp; observations of
               great importance frequently occurring where the most diligent investigator would
               never think of looking for them. The habit of noting &amp; arranging such memoranda
                  <del>I did not acquire till</del> is acquired gradually; &amp; can hardly be
               learnt otherwise than by experience.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So Buonaparte is now as dead as Caesar &amp; Alexander!<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the
                  French 1804&#8211;1814, 1815) had died in exile on the island of St Helena on 5 May
                  1821. News of his death took some time to reach Europe, and he did not receive an
                  obituary in <title>The Times</title> until 5 July 1821. The comparison here is
                  with the ancient conquerors, Alexander the Great (356&#8211;323 BC; King of Macedon
                  336&#8211;323 BC) and Julius Caesar (100&#8211;44 BC). </note> I did not read the tidings of
               his death without a mournful feeling, &#8211; which I am sure you also must have
               experienced, &amp; which I think you are likely as well as able to express in verse.
               It <del>will</del> is an event which will give birth to many poems, but I know no one
               so likely as yourself to touch the right strings.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Barton published <title>Napoleon, and Other Poems</title> in
