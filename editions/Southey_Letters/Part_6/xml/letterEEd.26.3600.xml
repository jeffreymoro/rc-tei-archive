               would pay for setting up a poem<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s duty as Poet Laureate was to produce a New Year&#8217;s Ode
                  each year. Southey regarded this as task work and was not happy with the quality of most of these poems. Since the publication of
                     <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (1814) he had ensured that none of them had appeared in print. His ode for 1821 was later
                  published as &#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode II&#8217; in <title>The Englishman&#8217;s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and
                     National Information</title> (London, 1824), pp. 384&#8211;389.</note> for the purpose of sending it round to the damnable newspapers,
               with a liberal attention to the feelings of their double-damned editor, that there might be no preference <del>or xxxxxxxx</del> shewn,
               but that Peter Finnerty<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Finnerty (c. 1766&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>), Irish journalist and

                  rival <title>New Times</title> (1817&#8211;1828). The <title>Courier</title> (1792&#8211;1842) was a pro-government daily evening paper, which
                  had employed Southey to contribute poetry, particularly in 1798&#8211;1799. He was still sent free copies by the <title>Courier</title>&#8217;s
                  co-owner, Daniel Stuart.</note> should have it as soon as the Courier! &#8211; I could not act with more imbecillity, nor with a &lt;more&gt;
               despicable subservience to the domination of these wretches, if I were actually a <del>member of</del> Cabinet Minister, Grosvenor; &#8211;
               rather than recognize, any claim in them to this sort of deference, or rather than show them any thing but defiance, I would put the
               ode behind the fire. I will not even send it to the Courier, &#8211; where a civility of this kind is due to <ref type="m" target="people.html#StuartDaniel">Stuart</ref>, for having sent me that paper so many years: because next to getting rid of the task
               which the Laureateship imposes upon me of writing verses at stated times, the best thing I can do is to avoid publishing them, except
               when at my own choice, &amp; my own time.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will publish both Odes under the title of The Warning Voice, with the Vision.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode I&#8217;, the New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1820, was not published until it appeared with its companion for 1821 in
                     <title>The Englishman&#8217;s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National Information</title> (London, 1824),
                  pp. 381&#8211;389. They were not published with <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> Allowing a blank title to each they
               will make twenty pages, &#8211; useful therefore in the way of stuffing. They will do as much good six weeks hence as they could now, &#8211; that
               is to say no great deal, &#8211; but still some; &amp; the extracts which the newspapers may then make will tend to assist the sale.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You are wrong in proposing that I should rewrite half the Ode for the purpose of altering the dithyrambick measure in
               which it was purposely <del>xxx</del> cast, <del>xx</del> which is laid aside when it becomes unsuitable &amp; taken up again in the
               last stanza, &#8211; &amp; which is quite necessary to the character of the poem. &#8211; I cannot part with the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> stanza.
               Those lines in the latter half are some of the best of the Ode, <del>x</del> the part which precedes them is the stalk upon which they
               grow, &amp; from whence they cannot be dissevered.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Every man who carries a watch in London ought to carry pistols. If the police will not protect us, we must protect
               ourselves &#8211; &amp; by the time two or three villains had been shot in the street Government would be shamed into a sense of its duty. I
               hope <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Henry</ref> is quite recovered. Remember me to him &amp; to <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</ref>. I wish I had you all three here, beside this comfortable fire. The out-of-door
               glass at the north side of the house has never been more than one or two degrees below the freezing point. The snow keeps off, &amp;

               about the end of the week.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When the book is finished you must get two copies bound alike, one for presentation, &amp; the other for <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my Governess</ref>, &#8211; the materials &amp; the manner at your worships choice.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
