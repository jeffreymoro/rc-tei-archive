        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I take the first opportunity after my return home to thank you for the very interesting &amp; valuable papers with
					which you have entrusted me;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Moor had lent Southey the papers of his brother-in-law, Sir
						Augustus Simon Frazer (1776&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>), to help with Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
						(1823&#8211;1832).</note> &amp; to assure you that I will <del>take</del> use them with that discretion which it is equally my duty
					&amp; my desire to observe. Indeed you will readily perceive that in using private materials it would be at once useless &amp;
					improper to refer to them as my authorities, &#8211; useless because the reader who should be desirous of comparing my statement with
					those authorities can have no opportunity of doing it; &#8211; improper because it might seem like a wish of transferring to others that
					responsibility which ought to rest wholly upon myself. I shall therefore acknowledge in the preface whatever favours of this kind
					I have received, but in no instance specify in the body of the work, the specific documents from which it has been drawn, except
					where those documents are before the public.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s recognition of his sources was less
						specific than he suggests here: &#8216;For the private sources of information which have been open to him, the author must content
						himself here with making a general acknowledgement&#8217;, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832),
						I, p. vi.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> After a long absence, &amp; so hurried &amp; restless a course of life (continually moving from one place to
					another) that I had not at any time after I received your packet leisure to acknowledge &amp; thank you for it, as I ought to have
					done, I am now just returned to the quiet of my own home.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had spent the months of
						May&#8211;June 1820 in London.</note> My work will now be sent immediately to press, &amp; I shall not leave home till it is fairly
					compleated, unless any unforeseen accident should call me away.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With many thanks for your obliging &amp; important communication</p>
        <closer>
          <salute rend="indent2">I have the honour to remain</salute>
