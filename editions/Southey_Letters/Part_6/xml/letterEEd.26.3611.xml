        <p rend="indent1"> I could not send you the accompanying letters before, because <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">Edith-May</ref> who officiates as scribe, was absent from home, on a visit to
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#HutchinsonSara">Miss Hutchinson</ref> at <ref type="m" target="places.html#RydalMount">Rydale</ref>. The transcripts are made for you, as you will probably like to
					possess a correspondence of which you have been unwittingly the occasion. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShelleyPercyBysshe">Shelley</ref> has not yet replied to my second letter.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Percy Bysshe Shelley, 12 October 1820 (Letter 3538).  This had condemned Shelley&#8217;s conduct as proceeding directly from his atheism.  As the final paragraph of this earlier letter had brought an &#8216;end&#8217; to their correspondence, Southey&#8217;s comment about Shelley&#8217;s failure to reply is surprising.</note> I have heard that
					he is in miserable health. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> has been told that
					he denies having written Atheist after his name in the Album, &amp; that he suspects me of having done it for
						him!<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">On 26 June 1817 Southey had seen the signatures of Shelley and his
						party in a visitors&#8217; album at Montanvert in Switzerland. The names had been bracketed together with a Greek
						inscription &#8211; &#949;&#954;&#945;&#962;&#959;&#943; &#945;&#952;&#949;&#959;&#943; (&#8216;atheists all&#8217;); see Southey to John May, 1 August 1817, <title>The Collected Letters
							of Robert Southey. Part Five</title>, Letter 3005. The &#8216;atheists&#8217; inscription had become public knowledge after
						it was mentioned in the review of Leigh Hunt&#8217;s <title>Foliage; or, Poems Original and Translated</title> (1818),
							<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 18 (January 1818), 329. The article&#8217;s author was John Taylor Coleridge. </note>
					But I do not believe that he would deny having done it himself, &#8211; &amp; am very sure that he could never dream of
					imputing such a fraud to me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will perceive that a great deal has been left unsaid in my letters, &#8211; which were written like
					mere letters, hastily, &amp; with no more consideration than a man who is much occupied <del>can</del> bestows upon
					his chance correspondence. There is enough however to rouse reflections which he will not find it easy to subdue. &#8211;
					You are right about his poetry; &#8211; it is too obscure to carry any danger with it,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sentiments expressed by John Taylor Coleridge in his review of Shelley&#8217;s <title>Laon and Cynthna,
							or the Revolution of the Golden City</title> (1817) and <title>The Revolt of Islam. A Poem, in Twelve
							Cantos</title> (1818) in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (April 1819), 460&#8211;471 (esp. 460, which described
						Shelley as the least &#8216;pernicious&#8217; of his poetic &#8216;brethren&#8217;).</note> &amp; guilty as he is, he is not wicked enough
					to be so flagitious a writer as his friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref>. &#8211; I have some
					intention of touching upon Don Juan in the preface to my hexameters, &#8211; of which the two first proofs are now on my
						table.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819&#8211;1824). While the &#8216;Preface&#8217; to
							<title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London 1821) did not name Byron or his poem, it described the &#8216;publication
						of a lascivious book&#8217;, which Southey believed <title>Don Juan</title> to be, as &#8216;one of the worst offences which
						can be committed against the well-being of society&#8217; (p. xviii). It also named and shamed the &#8216;Satanic school&#8217;, of
						which Byron was, by implication, a leading light (pp. xx&#8211;xxi).</note> You will receive them I hope in about three
					weeks.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I would write more at length if proofs, preface &amp;c &amp;c did not just now require all my
