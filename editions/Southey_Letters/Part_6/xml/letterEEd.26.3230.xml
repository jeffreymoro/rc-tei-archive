        <p rend="indent1"> I procrastinated my intended letter too long, till upon the belief that you would have left Como, I knew not where to
          direct, &#8211; &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SenhouseHumphrey">Senhouse</ref> whom I desired to obtain your address from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LandorRobertEyres">your brother Robert</ref>, has not written to me. &#8211; Therefore I was doubly glad to receive yours
          from Pisa. It came in eighteen days. &#8211; My house was purchased by a silversmith in Cockspur Street, a native of Borrodale here;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref>, of which Southey was the tenant, was sold in
            June 1817 to Isaac Fisher (c. 1773&#8211;1819), a member of a Borrowdale farming family and a gold and silversmith in Cockspur Street, London.
            However, legal complications arising from the previous landlord&#8217;s debts had halted the purchase.</note> &#8211; an injunction against the sale
          was obtained in favour of the widow of a former owner;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly the widow of Joseph Jackson (d.
            1815), Rector of Lowick (1797&#8211;1815), who had inherited the ownership of Greta Hall from his brother, William Jackson.</note> the matter is
          in Chancery; the actual Landlord is in Carlisle jail, &amp; I am paying rent to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WoodSara">a
            mortgagee</ref>.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Samuel Tolson, Jnr (dates unknown) had been committed to Carlisle jail for debt in
            April 1817, but he eventually retained his ownership of <ref type="m" target="places.html#GretaHall">Greta Hall</ref>. </note> Disturbed
          in possession of the house I cannot be for twelve years to come; &amp; as long as there is any litigation I am in no danger of being annoyed
          by cutting up the grounds. Unless some such annoyance should drive me away, in all likelihood I shall be settled here for life. This is the
          sixteenth year of my residence, &#8211; &amp; tho there are some local objections, &amp; some inconvenience in the distance from London, I know
          not where I could pitch my tent <del>to</del> more to my satisfaction. A better climate is not to be had without going out of England, &#8211;
          &amp; that cannot be done because of my pursuits, my books &amp; my family. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was quite certain that you would appreciate <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> justly.
          Nations you say are never proud of living genius. They are proud of it only as far as they understand it, &amp; the majority being incapable
          of understanding it, can never admire it, till they take it upon trust, &#8211; so that two or three generations must pass before the public
          affect to admire such poets as Milton<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Milton (1608&#8211;1674; <title>DNB</title>).</note> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>. &#8211; Of such men the world scarcely produces one in a millennium &#8211; has it
          indeed ever produced more than two? for Shakespere<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Shakespeare (1564&#8211;1616;
            <title>DNB</title>).</note> is of a different class. But of all inferior degrees of poets no age &amp; no country was ever so prolific as
          our own, every season produces some half dozen poems, not one of which obtains the slightest attention, &amp; any one of which would have
          the author celebrated above all <del>his</del> contemporaries five &amp; twenty years ago. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Let me know your movements, &amp; how I may direct a parcel to you in May, by which time the concluding volume of Brazil
          will be finished, &amp; the life of Wesley,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The third and final volume of Southey&#8217;s <title>History of
              Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819), and his two-volume <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note>
          &#8211; &amp; I will put in some thing else to make them the better worth their freight. The <del>history</del> &lt;former&gt; contains much
          curious matter, concerning stages of society which have hitherto obtained little notice, but are important links in our knowledge of the
          history of man &amp; of society. The life of Wesley<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>),
            founder of Methodism.</note> is full of extraordinary facts, &amp; will carry you into a world as little like the one with which you are
          conversant as if it were another planet. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Since I returned from the continent<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. since Southey&#8217;s return from his European
            tour in August 1817.</note> I have never been farther from home than <ref type="m" target="places.html#RydalMount">Rydale</ref>. I have
          been working on at these works, with my usual summer &amp; autumnal interruptions, &#8211; &amp; the usual expenditure of time for the Q Review.
          The verses which I have written are so few that they do not deserve to be mentioned.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">They included
            Southey&#8217;s task work as Poet Laureate, the New Year&#8217;s odes for 1818 and 1819; respectively, &#8216;Funeral Song for the Princess Charlotte&#8217; and
            &#8216;Ode on the Death of Queen Charlotte&#8217;. Neither had been published by this time; the former eventually appeared in <title>Friendship&#8217;s
              Offering: A Literary Album and Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Present, for 1828</title> (London, 1828), pp. 1&#8211;6, and the latter in

            1829), pp. 106&#8211;108.</note> As soon as these works are thro the press I go to London, &amp; put to press the history of the Peninsular War,
          of which good part is ready.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832); for this
            Southey made extensive use of the essays on the Peninsular campaign that he had contributed to the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
              1808 to 1811</title> (1810&#8211;1813).</note> I suppose we shall hear of a cabinet resolution from that poor country.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Frequent changes of government were commonplace under the absolutist rule of Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of
            Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833); at this time Carlos Mart&#237;nez de Irujo y Tac&#243;n, 1st Marquis of Casa Irujo (1763&#8211;1834) was briefly Acting First
            Secretary of State (1818&#8211;1819). </note> Any thing I do not expect, nor do I know what to wish for, where any change will too probably be
          but a change of evils. Some arrangement like that at Lisbon when Affonso 6. was set aside for incapacity, is the most likely catastrophe,
          &amp; the one which would produce least mischief.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1667 the Portuguese monarch Afonso VI
            (1643&#8211;1683; King of Portugal 1656&#8211;1683) had been made to sign over his powers to his brother, Pedro II (1648&#8211;1706; King of Portugal
            1683&#8211;1706), who became Regent. Southey thought that something similar might take place in Spain, and that the king, Ferdinand VII, whom he
            detested, would be declared unfit to rule and replaced by a regency led by one of his younger brothers, Charles, Count of Molina
            (1788&#8211;1855) or Francisco, Duke of Cadiz (1794&#8211;1865). This did not happen. </note> &#8211; Look where we will thro the civilized world, the
          materials for explosion seem ready; &#8211; &amp; this is no <del>chearful</del> exhilarating <del>xx</del> consideration for one who has lived
          long enough to know that order is the first thing needful in society. Here in England a fair harvest &amp; a flourishing trade give us a
          surface of tranquillity. But all our institutions civil &amp; religious, &#8211; nay &amp; whatever is sacred in public or in private life, &#8211; are
          continually attacked by the press in every shape, &#8211; by sapping &amp; mining, &amp; by battering in breach. On the other hand there are
          powerful counteracting causes at work, &amp; in the struggle between good &amp; evil, the destructive &amp; conservative principles, which
          this literally is, my faith &amp; my constitution are alike on the hopeful side. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> [MS missing] you have seen enough of Italy I think you will be [MS missing] disposed to tarry awhile in Switzerland than in
          any [MS missing] part of the continent; &#8211; if you can forgive them for speaking French. An Englishman feels more at home among the Swiss than
          with [MS missing] other people, &#8211; the religion &amp; their domestic character are more like what he has been accustomed to. And he feels
          that he is breathing free air, &#8211; which is a blessed thing. I should hesitate between Bern &amp; Lausanne. &#8211; Perhaps I may see you before you
          leave Italy. I dream of seeing Rome before I die, &#8211; &amp; should I live to carry the Peninsular War thro the Press (the work of two years
          from this time) I should endeavour to lay my plans so as to enter Italy by way of the South of France late in the autumn, &amp; leave it in
          the spring by way of the Tyrol. It is but a dream, &#8211; but one of those dreams which bring about their own accomplishment. </p>
