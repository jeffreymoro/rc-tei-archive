                  attacked the house of an unnamed prominent citizen because he refused to put candles in his window to celebrate the abandonment of
                  the Bill of Pains and Penalties against Queen Caroline (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>). Southey here reveals the citizen&#8217;s identity
                  as Thomas Woodforde (c. 1740&#8211;1828), Senior Physician at the Taunton and Somerset Hospital. Woodforde had two sons, Thomas (c.
                  1775&#8211;1842), who also worked as a doctor in Taunton, and James (b. 1781). The son mentioned by Southey is probably Thomas.</note>
