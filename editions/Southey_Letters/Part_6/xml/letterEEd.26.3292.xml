               &#8211; It seems more likely now that I shall see you in Wales this summer than in London, &#8211; for it is hardly possible that I should leave
               home in less than a month, &amp; by that time you will be longing to escape from the dust &amp; heat of the metropolis. On all accounts
               I should far rather have made my journey earlier <del>th</del> in the year. But the history of Brazil<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> has grown under my hands beyond what I either wished
               or expected, &#8211; my materials have proved so rich, &amp; it was not possible for me to calculate better, because no one had ever gone
               over the ground before, &#8211; so that there was not even the rudest map by which I could estimate my course. We are printing the last
               chapter, which is a general view of the state of the country at the time when the Court removed thither, &#8211; as to population, trade,
               manners &amp;c &amp;c.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 44, <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819),

                  invasion.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> The H of Commons appears to me in a sounder state of mind than it has been at any time within my remembrance, &#8211; I mean
               that questions are judged of more by their own <del>xxx</del> merit &amp; less from mere party spirit. I do not apprehend any thing
               worse from the Bullion&#8211;business<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The House of Commons was debating legislation to recommence the
                  convertibility of paper currency to gold, which had been suspended since 1797. The legislation passed on 2 July 1819 and
                  convertibility was restored on 1 May 1821, but the period 1819&#8211;1821 witnessed a fall in commodity prices and rising
                  unemployment.</note> in these times, than that the Bank must pay pretty smartly (which it can afford to do) for the experience of
               the country; &amp; when it is made plainer than a pike staff (<hi rend="ital">as</hi> plain it is already) that the issue of gold when
               in coin or ingots can answer no other purpose than that of enriching those who deal in it, the nation will be persuaded of the truth of
               what Lord Stanhope told them &amp; Berkeley (very different men) told their grandfathers.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope (1753&#8211;1816; <title>DNB</title>), for example, in his speech in the House of Lords, 16 July
                  1811: &#8216;To believe gold necessary to a circulating medium was an idea only fit for Hottentots&#8217;. George Berkeley (1685&#8211;1753;
                     <title>DNB</title>), philosopher and Bishop of Cloyne 1734&#8211;1753, argued in <title>The Querist</title> (1735&#8211;1737) that currency
                  had purely symbolic, rather than intrinsic, value.</note> &#8211; The Mr Cropper<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">James Cropper
                  (1773&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>), Quaker merchant and philanthropist from Liverpool. He had signed a petition from Liverpool bankers
                  and merchants against the resumption of cash payments and then added his own reasons for doing so, an aspect of the petition that
                  Canning drew attention to when he presented it to the House of Commons on 2 February 1819.</note> whose name was brought forward in
               Parliament is I believe a coarse sort of Quaker whose way of thinking upon most subjects is any thing but English, &#8211; at least so it was
               when I saw him accidentally twelve years ago. But upon the question of paper money I entirely agree with him. &#8211; Fifty years ago, &amp;
               for some twenty years, the Kings fifths of gold from Brazil<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The Portuguese Crown was entitled to
                  one fifth of all gold mined in Brazil.</note> averaged above 100 <hi rend="ital">arrobas</hi> yearly, the arroba being 28 pounds
               weight. They have decreased gradually till for the last 15 or 20 years they have not averaged <hi rend="ital">20</hi>. And I do not
               know that any other gold comes from the earth into the market, except what little is brought from Guinea. But it is very likely that
               more gold than ever <del>xxx</del> may in a very few years be brought from Brazil, &#8211; for their mines as yet have only been <hi rend="ital">scratched</hi>, <del>xx</del> there is a great spirit of enterprize there; &amp; a company has recently been formed for
               working what is supposed to be the best ground.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Since 1803 the Portuguese government had
                  encouraged the formation of joint stock companies to undertake gold mining in Brazil, and in 1817 foreign-owned companies were
                  allowed into the trade. Southey may be referring here to the Cuyaba Mining Company, founded in 1817.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I wish the Copy&#8211;right question, &#8211; or rather the affair of the Eleven Copies<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  publishing trade was campaigning to overturn the clause in the Copyright Act (1814) which confirmed that a copy of every published

                  General Election contest at Westmorland, he was reported to have criticised Southey for supporting his opponents. His speech was
                  reported in the national newspapers, for example, the <title>Courier</title>, on 4 June 1818.</note> &#8211; Whereas many hundred persons
               heard him, as well as the newspaper reporters who are pretty good evidence in such cases. This is a specimen of <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Broughams</ref> veracity, &#8211; for that he should forget what he had said on such an occasion

                  assertion that the descendants of the twelfth-century Welsh settlers would be found in America: &#8216;That country has now been fully
                  explored, and wherever Madoc may have settled, it is now certain that no Welsh Indians are to be found upon any branches of the
                  Missouri.&#8217;</note> There was one of the most valiant lies about them in the Courier some eight or ten weeks ago, that ever defied
               common sense.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">A letter from Owen Williams of Cardiganshire, who had settled in Baltimore as a
                  fur trader, dated 21 February 1819. He claimed to have met Welsh-speaking Indians, stating: &#8216;They are generally a tall and powerful
                  people, of fair complexion, and of amiable manners; they have the use of letters, and are in possession of numerous manuscripts
