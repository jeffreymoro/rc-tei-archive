                     had extensive business interests in north east England, especially in the coal industry. Southey suggests his commitment to
                     Whiggism had been shaken by a major strike by the keelmen (27 September&#8211;20 October and 4&#8211;9 November 1819), who transferred coal
                     from the banks of the Tyne and the Wear to larger ships. While Ridley was scarcely likely to have sympathised with the keelmen,
                     he remained a committed Whig. Southey&#8217;s information may refer to Ridley&#8217;s caution about the prospects for a County Meeting in
                     Northumberland to protest at the local authorities&#8217; actions in breaking up the meeting at St Peter&#8217;s Field, Manchester on 16
                     August 1819, which led to at least eleven deaths.</note>

                  Sudbury 1790&#8211;1796, 1802&#8211;1818, had broken with his Whig allies after 1813 over his doubts on Catholic Emancipation. He spoke often on
                  Catholic issues 1813&#8211;1817, usually requesting a Select Committee to investigate issues such as Catholic marriages, or nunneries.
                  Southey here asks for copies of Hippisley&#8217;s speeches in the House of Commons, as recorded in the official <title>Report of
                     Parliamentary Proceedings</title>, usually known as <title>Hansard</title>, after its publisher, Luke Hansard (1752&#8211;1828;

                  the Fitzhead estate in Somerset that Somerville had inherited and on which Southey possibly possessed a claim.</note> It will be no
               disappointment if he advises me to forego my claims; &#8211; &amp; certainly I should far rather refer them to arbitration than to
               Chancery.</p>
