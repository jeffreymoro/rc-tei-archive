                  Westmorland was held at Kendal on 21 October 1819 to protest against the
                  authorities&#8217; actions at the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; meeting in Manchester on 16 August 1819,
                  which led to eleven deaths. Brougham was present, and read out and denounced the
                  rival pro-government Loyal Address for Cumberland which Southey had written
                  (though Brougham was unaware of its author). He remarked that the Address &#8216;is very
                  long indeed, and extremely dull&#8217;, and described its authors as &#8216;fawning
                  sycophants&#8217; who had produced a &#8216;slavish&#8217; document, <title>Morning

                     New Theatrum Poetarum</title> (1812), supposedly a series of unsuccessful

                  opening night of the new Drury Lane Theatre. The book was actually a skilful
                  pastiche of the styles of leading writers, including Southey.</note> It was laid
               aside in complaisance to Wallace,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas
                  Wallace (1768&#8211;1844; <title>DNB</title>), MP for various seats 1790&#8211;1828, including

                  Carleton Hall, near Penrith. The second Address from Cumberland was published in
                     <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 29 October 1819, and was notably circumspect

               came) substituted a verbose composition of his own. &#8211; Meantime the former one had
               been in high places, &amp; been greatly approved there. Altogether it is a comical
               story. My name I believe has not transpired in the business.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Ministers I understand feel themselves strong, this I have no doubt
               means that they are sure of your support, &amp; of that of the country gentlemen.
               Strength of their own they have none, &#8211; nor is there a man among them from whom any
               thing like decision could be expected, &#8211; except <ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Ld
               Wellington</ref>. I wish the reins were in his hand. The main thing
               is to curb the press. Unless that be done every thing else is futile. Unless that be
               done, the total subversion of all our institutions is inevitable. It may be delayed a
               little while, but it must come, &#8211; &amp; then farewell to the liberty of the press for
               ever. But if that were put under such restrictions as the state of the country
               requires, we should be safe. All other causes of danger are temporary, &amp; will
               pass away; &#8211; or they may be remedied. </p>
