               to grow there) which will be very useful in more ways than one. In looking over one of them<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably John Callender (1706&#8211;1748), <title>An Historical Discourse on the Civil and Religious Affairs of the Colony of
                     Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations in New-England in America</title> (1739), no. 523 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
                  library.</note> this morning, a good many thoughts have occurred which will set Oliver Newman<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s unfinished epic set in New England. A fragment was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a

               again in progress. I shall keep up an intercourse with Boston, &amp; an interchange of books henceforward.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As you do not mention M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Burn<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">William Burn (1750&#8211;1821),

               hope he is better than when <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> wrote. His generation is now passing
               away fast, &amp; a few years more will make us among the elders of the world. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am returned to a great accumulation of epistolary &amp; other business. 42 sheets of the War<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832).</note> are printed; &#8211; &amp; another week will
               bring me to the end of my labour in correcting the first vol. of Brazil<note n="18" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of
                  the first volume only of the <title>History of Brazil</title> (1822).</note> to which I shall have added about 1/9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. In this I shall have my labour for my pains, &#8211; but the time has been satisfactorily bestowed.</p>

               well enough to think of extending it.</p>
