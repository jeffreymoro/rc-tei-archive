                  Assurance Company, of which he was a Director. Southey had received reminders from George Talbot (d. 1836), Paymaster of the
                  Household 1782&#8211;1836, and William Nicol (d. c. 1855), who held a minor court post, as Assistant Paymaster in the Lord Steward&#8217;s
                  office, that the salary had not been collected. Though the sum was only &#163;100, some of it was paid from the accounts of the Royal
