        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your letter, &amp; the books which accompanied it. &#8211;&#8211; I must reply to it point by
					point.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My German, tho it be even less than my Dutch (which is little enough) will yet suffice to make
					out the plain straight forward style of an old narrative. So I shall be very glad to receive the account of the
					Siege of S Salvador,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Johannes Gregorius Aldenburgk (1602&#8211;1628), <title>West
							Indianische Reise</title> (1627), an account of the capture of Salvador da Bahia by the Dutch in 1624 and its
						recapture by a Portuguese-Spanish force in 1625.</note> &#8211; it will be just in time. The latter part of this
						volume<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was working on a second edition of the first volume of the
							<title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). It was published in 1822. </note> will be much improved from Dutch
					authorities, viz &#8211; Aitzema,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieuwe van Aitzema (1600&#8211;1669), <title>Sakem van
							Staet en Oorlogh in ende Omtrent de Vereenigde Nederlanden</title> (1655&#8211;1671) with the continuation by Lambert
						van den Bos (1610&#8211;1698) of 1685&#8211;1699 and Aitzema&#8217;s <title>Verhael van de Nederlandsche Vrede-Handeling</title>
						(1671), no. 214 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &amp; Johannes de Laet&#8217;s Hist: of the West
					Indian Company,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Joannes de Laet (1581&#8211;1649), <title>Historie ofte Iaerlijk
							Verhael van de Verrichtinghen der Geoctroyeerde West-Indische Compagnie</title> (1644), no. 1671 in the sale
						catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Southey had bought the book from Jean-Baptise Ver Beyst (1770&#8211;1849), a celebrated
						Brussels bookseller, in 1817.</note> &#8211; a book of which I had been led to suspect the existence, but never could
					ascertain it, till I laid my hands upon a copy, in happy hour, at Brussels.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was always doubtful whether I had <del>xxxxx</del> hit upon the right manner of restoring the
					name of <hi rend="ital">Stadius</hi> to its vernacular form. And if your Dutch copy follows the original (as may
					reasonably be presumed) the name is Hans Stade<hi rend="ital">n</hi>. The version which I used is De Bry&#8217;s with
					which I will collate it.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Hans Staden (1525&#8211;1579), German soldier and
						mariner, who described his captivity in Brazil in <title>Warhaftige Historia und Beschreibung eyner Landtschafft
							der Wilden, Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser Leuthen in der Newenwelt America Gelegen</title> (1557). Southey
						read Hans Staden&#8217;s story in Theodore de Bry&#8217;s (1528&#8211;1598) <title>Peregrinationes</title> (1590&#8211;1592), no. 717 in
						the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library, and described him as &#8216;Hans Stade&#8217; in <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3
						vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), I, pp. 175&#8211;211. Heber&#8217;s Dutch version was <title>Hans Staden van Homborgs Beschryvinge
							van America</title> (1641).</note> In the case of Lery<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">By the time of his
						death, Southey&#8217;s library contained two editions (1578 and 1585) of Jean de L&#233;ry (1536&#8211;1613), <title>Histoire d&#8217;un
							Voyage faict en la Terre du Bresil</title>, nos 1709&#8211;1710 in the sale catalogue of his library. L&#233;ry had been
						part of the failed French colony in Brazil and was later a Protestant Minister in France. Southey had originally
						encountered this book in Theodore de Bry&#8217;s <title>Peregrinationes</title> (1590&#8211;1592).</note> I detected an
					abominable fraud of omission by comparing the authors original with De Bry.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Thomas Southey, 10 January 1809, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part
							Three</title>, Letter 1563. De Bry had omitted some salient facts about why the French colony in Brazil 1555&#8211;1567
						had failed, especially the conflict between Protestants and Catholics.</note> In Hans Staden this is not likely to
					be the case, as <del>there</del> the same motive for mutilating his narrative did not exist.</p>

							Geschichte einer Merkwurdigen Reise, Gemacht durch Schmidel von Straubingen, in America oder der Neuen Welt, von
							1534 bis 1554</title> (1557). Southey, whose Spanish was far superior to his German, obtained his version from
