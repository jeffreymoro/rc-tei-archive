        <p rend="indent1"> We are just in the same state, except that the evil of the haemorrhoids is abated, or for a time removed. It is now
               three weeks since the tumour began to appear, &amp; for full half that time it has been to all appearance stationary, without the
               slightest change. I have only discovered that <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> knows nothing about it,
               for having positively pronounced it an abscess, which must ripen &amp; be pierced, the last time I saw him, he talked of it being
               coagulated blood, &#8211; the consequence of the labour, &#8211; which ignorant as I was I knew to be nonsense.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was concerned about his wife Edith, who had been ill since the birth of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Charles Cuthbert Southey</ref> on 24 February 1819.</note> The tumour is
               well-defined, hard, &amp; Betty<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Thompson (c. 1777&#8211;1862), long-standing servant at
                  Greta Hall. She was buried in the Southey family grave in Crosthwaite, Keswick.</note> who applies the poultice, says it feels
               moveable: &#8211; the size of a hens egg: &#8211; there is a dull sensation about it, <del>x</del> it renders sitting uneasy, &amp; is felt in
               walking &#8211; this I suppose is from the straining the skin. I had a notion that it might accelerate either the suppuration or the
               absorption, whichever process may be intended, <del>x</del> by drawing sparks from it. What say you to this? There is an electrical
               machine in the town, which I could easily procure &amp; manage. &#8211; I forget whether I told you the strange effect it produced upon the
               woman for whom you advised it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; Southey was proposing to use one of a range of
                  devices that applied electric shocks to the body.</note> It made her partly perhaps from aweful apprehension so very ill after the
               second <del>xxxxxx</del> application that it was impossible to repeat it, &#8211; but some of the tumour disappeared almost instantly, &amp;
               her urine became bloody: &#8211; a very curious effect this, if it had fallen under the observation of a philosophical practitioner.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">

               with her: &#8211; last night however she slept, for the first time without it. Her health has hitherto borne up well, &#8211; but she is very
               uneasy: &#8211; &amp; I who do my best to keep up her spirits, &amp; my own too, suffer much anxiety, as you may well suppose.</p>
