                  set in New England. The completed sections were published after Southey&#8217;s death in <title>Oliver Newman: A New-England Tale
                     (Unfinished): With Other Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1&#8211;90.</note> when I return. &#8211; It will have the same kind of
               interest for the New Englanders that the first part of Madoc<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Madoc in Wales&#8217;,
                     <title>Madoc</title> (1805).</note> has for you. Did you ever meet with Cotton Mathers Magnalia<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Cotton Mather (1663&#8211;1728), <title>Magnalia Christi Americana, or the Ecclesiastical History of New England from 1620

               have, it is one of those works which you would not readily lay down, &amp; you will need no notes to explain the allusions in this
               fourth book to Marthas Vineyard,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Martha&#8217;s Vineyard is an island off Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
                  It was originally inhabited by the Wampanoag people, who accepted Christianity and did not take part in King Philip&#8217;s War of
                  1675&#8211;1676, the background to &#8216;Oliver Newman&#8217;. This process was greatly helped by the fact that early converts among the Wampanoag
                  survived the plague that swept through Martha&#8217;s Vineyard in 1646. The places, events and people from New England Southey refers to
                  in this letter are mentioned in &#8216;Oliver Newman&#8217;, Book 4, lines 698&#8211;731.</note> &amp; Eliot the translator of the Bible into the
               language of the Five Nations,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Eliot (c. 1604&#8211;1690) translated the Bible into the language
                  of the Massachusett people in 1663. The Five Nations were the confederation of tribes in upper New York State, often called the
                  Iroquois League: the Mohawk; Oneida; Onondaga; Cayuga; and Seneca. They speak Iroquoian languages, rather than Massachusett, which
                  was an Algonquian language. </note> &amp; Roger Williams,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Roger Williams (c. 1603&#8211;1683) was a
                  Londoner, not a Welshman. He founded Providence Plantation in 1636 as a religiously tolerant community, advocated peaceful relations
                  with native peoples and was an abolitionist.</note> &#8211; who was the most interesting man that your country ever produced as far as I

               book is to conclude with Olivers purchasing the Squaw &amp; her children; &#8211; the next lands them at Boston, &amp; in a scene with the
               Governor Leverett,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Leverett (1616&#8211;1679), Governor of Massachusetts 1673&#8211;1679.</note> lays
