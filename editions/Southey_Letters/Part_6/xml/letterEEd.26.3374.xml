        <p rend="indent1"> I had a great disappointment yesterday in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Burns parcel: instead of containing a manuscript
               history of Para, its contents proved to be the Corografia Brazilica of Cazal, a copy of which you had previously procured.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Manoel Aires de Casal (1754&#8211;1821), <title>Corografia Brazilica, ou Rela&#231;&#227;o Historico-Geografica do Reino
                     do Brazil</title> (1817), no. 3252 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Southey had been sent this work by William Burn
                  (1750&#8211;1821), an old acquaintance, whom he had first met in Portugal in 1796.</note> &#8211; The same package brought my third volume, &#8211; a
               welcome sight as you may well suppose.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).

                     <title>DNB</title>), agricultural reformer and third cousin of Southey, had died on 5 October 1819. This produced a further round
                  of legal tangles over the Fitzhead estate in Somerset, which Somerville had inherited.</note> death will give me some trouble, &amp;
               may very probably lead me into a law suit, which of all things in the world I abhor the most. My poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> is all alive with hope. I have a letter from her by this post. She talks of
               different farms worth in all about a thousand a year, &#8211; but I have reason to believe from some enquiries which I made after <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John Southeys</ref> death, that the only part of the property which was entailed upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref> was some land about the house at Fitzhead, &amp; that held only for a
               lease of 99 years, &#8211; about half of which term must be expired. Unluckily my extract from the will, with an opinion annexed to it, which

See Southey to Henry
                  Herbert Southey, 26 October 1819, Letter 3371.</note> Lord S. sold the property some years ago, but with respect to this part of it,
               the purport of the will is explicit, &amp; my remedy would be an action against the tenant whoever he may be. Were I a single man I
               believe I should rather leave him in <del>undis</del> quiet possession, than disturb myself with the trouble &amp; care which
               litigation must bring with it, &#8211; to say nothing of expences which I can very ill afford.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMary">Aunt Mary</ref> has found out that her grandmother was a relation of
               Locke, &amp; bore the same name.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Aunt Mary&#8217;s grandmother (and Southey&#8217;s great-grandmother) was
                  Anne Locke (b. 1675), who married Robert Southey (1670&#8211;1726). Anne Locke was believed by Southey&#8217;s Aunt Mary to be a relative of the
                  philosopher, John Locke (1632&#8211;1704; <title>DNB</title>), though the precise relationship was impossible to disentangle.</note> She
               seems pleased with this, as supposing that it will gratify me to find so great a man in the family. But as I happen to agree with

                  also argued that Locke&#8217;s work led to the position that there was no non-physical aspect of the mind and that the mind was merely
                  part of the body.</note> concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Lockes metaphysics, &#8211; &amp; with Dean Tucker<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Josiah Tucker (1713&#8211;1799; <title>DNB</title>), Dean of Gloucester 1758&#8211;1799. His <title>A Treatise Concerning Civil

               remarkably obliging man, &amp; I feel quite at ease in his family. There is a comical story about the Cumberland Address.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Following the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre of 16 August 1819, which led to eleven deaths, Whigs in Cumberland
                  organised a County Meeting on 13 October 1819 to protest at the local authorities&#8217; actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent.
                  Southey drew up a conservative response &#8211; an Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the
                  press. It was not proceeded with, and the government&#8217;s supporters in Cumberland produced a more moderate document. Southey&#8217;s
                  Address, though not his identity as its author, had been printed in the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 23 October 1819.</note> It

                  pro-government Loyal Address from Cumberland, which Southey had written (though Brougham was unaware of its author). He remarked
                  that the Address &#8216;is very long indeed, and extremely dull&#8217;, and described its authors as &#8216;fawning sycophants&#8217; who had produced a
