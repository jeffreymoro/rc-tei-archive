						produce a New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1820; he had sent the ode, later published as &#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode I&#8217; in
							<title>The Englishman&#8217;s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National Information</title>
						(London, 1824), pp. 381&#8211;383, to Bedford on 3 December 1819, Letter 3395.</note> if you please to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Shields</ref>,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Shield&#8217;s duty, as
						Master of the King&#8217;s Music, was to set part of Southey&#8217;s ode to music, though no such odes had been performed at
						court since 1810.</note> &amp; desire him to accommodate with music as little or as much of it as he pleases. He
					will probably chuse the second &amp; last stanzas, &#8211; any but the first, which is in its place in the poem, but
					would not be so at Court.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> With regard to your proposal you seem not to have considered the situation in which I should
					appear were such a thing to take wind (as the phrase is) &#8211; which most assuredly it would. Concerning the manner of
					the ode in question, I cannot say that I think the thing worth the additional waste of time which would be required
					to defend it. But for the <del>xxxxxx</del> fitness of expressing political opinions which are perfectly in unison
					with those of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Prince</ref> &amp; his ministers, as
					pronounced by him in his speech, &amp; by them in the measures which they are now adopting,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The government had announced their intention to suppress radical agitation in the Prince Regent&#8217;s
						Speech to the House of Commons on 23 November 1819, and had introduced the &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; to do this on 29 November
						1819. Southey&#8217;s &#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode I&#8217; was an explicit defence of these measures.</note> I can have no doubt.
					My opinion is that a New Years Ode should always relate to public circumstances &#8211; &amp; a Birth day one to the
					person or family of <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the Prince</ref> to whom it is addressed.
					When the latter comes upon me, I shall lower the tone to the subject.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey feared that when the Prince Regent acceded to the throne he, as Poet Laureate, would be required to
						produce an annual Birthday Ode as well as a New Year&#8217;s Ode.</note> As long as I can help it I will never suffer
					any of these compositions to get abroad. This is, as far as I can, lessening the folly of the custom, &amp;
					preparing the way for its abolition, for you may be sure it is generally supposed that I am not called upon to
					write as my predecessors were. If I give the composer more trouble than poor Pye<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry James Pye (1745&#8211;1813; <title>DNB</title>), Poet Laureate 1790&#8211;1813.</note> did &#8211; I am sorry
					for it, &#8211; but I can no more <del>xxx</del> write like M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pye, than M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Pye
					could write like me. His pye-crust &amp; mine were <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;not&gt; made of the same materials. But I suppose
					there can be no more difficulty in fitting my rhythm to the fiddle, than there is &lt;in&gt; setting an anthem.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am not so out of the world as you imagine, but know more of political intentions &amp; opinions
					in high places, without seeking it, than you would suspect, &amp; this from sundry quarters. &#8211; And this reminds me
					to tell you that Brooksbank<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly Joseph Brooksbank (1762&#8211;1825),
						Unitarian Minister at Haberdashers&#8217; Hall. </note> is acting very indiscretely in endeavouring to propagate his
					religious opinions by very objectionable &amp; offensive means: means indeed so offensive that I must notice them
					in the Q.R. when I enlarge the paper upon the New Churches, as I am preparing to do.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s article on &#8216;New Churches&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 23 (July 1820), 549&#8211;591. He
						condemned the Unitarian Church in Hillingdon for proclaiming its disbelief in the Trinity from placards on the
						London to Uxbridge Road and the doctrines of the Freethinking Christian congregation of Jewin-Street, Cripplegate
						(570&#8211;576), but did not mention Brooksbank.</note> Of course I shall not hint at him, nor make the slightest
					allusion which might imply a knowledge of the offender, but it is a strong case, &amp; should any measures be
					brought forward to prevent the religion of the country from being insulted, it is very likely to be mentioned from
					the Bench.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At present I am reviewing Marlborough,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of
						William Coxe, <title>Memoirs of John Duke of Marlborough, with his Original Correspondence; Collected from the
							Family Records at Blenheim, and Other Authentic Sources. Illustrated with Portraits, Maps, and Military
							Plans</title> (1818&#8211;1819) appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 23 (May 1820), 1&#8211;73.</note> &amp; shall
					send off the first portion to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> in a few days. And I
					am going on with Wesley,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise
							and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> in good spirits as I draw within sight of the end. &#8211; What you
					said about the King set my thoughts at work.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">With the demise of George III
						(1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) imminent, Southey had begun his response,
							<title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> I planned something which in the style of fiction will more
					resemble Dante<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Dante Alighieri (c. 1265&#8211;1321), <title>Divine Comedy</title>
						(1308&#8211;1321).</note> than any other writer. Of the manner I shall say nothing till there is a good specimen ready,
					which may astonish &amp; silence you at the same time. I have begun, &amp; am in high good humour with the design
					&amp; the fashion of the workmanship.</p>
