        <p rend="indent1"> That part of Lord Somervilles will which relates to his Somersetshire
               estates, is the only part in which I am concerned, &amp; that must be a very small
               portion of it.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The first part of the
                  letter deals with Southey&#8217;s continuing attempts to discover if he, and his
                  brothers, might benefit from the estate of their third cousin John Southey
                  Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>), who had died on
                  5 October 1819. Somerville had inherited the Fitzhead estate in Somerset from his
                  great-uncle John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). On his death, John Cannon Southey had
                  left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville his primary heir and,
                  should Somerville die without heirs, Robert Southey&#8217;s father and two uncles as the
                  residuary legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three
                  Southey brothers only the Poet Laureate&#8217;s father married, leading the Poet
                  Laureate to believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that he
                  and his brothers were now the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate. </note> Would
               not therefore an extract answer the purpose, as well as a copy of the whole? He had
               you know the property to dispose of which he inherited with his title;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. the lands that Somerville inherited from his
                  uncle, James Somerville, 14th Lord Somerville (1727&#8211;1796). These had nothing to do
                  with the Southeys.</note> &amp; he had also estates in Gloucestershire, which fell
               to him <del>xxx xx</del> upon the extinction of the English branch of his family, &#8211;
               of which branch the poet Somerville was the head.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">William Somervile (1675&#8211;1742; <title>DNB</title>), whose
                  best-known poem was <title>The Chace</title> (1735). When he died, his estates
                  passed to the Scottish branch of the Somerville family, whose head was James, 13th
                  Lord Somerville (1698&#8211;1765) and from whom these estates had descended to his
                  grandson, John Southey Somerville.</note> The disposal of these, &amp; the
               provision made for his natural children must take up much more of his will, than the
               property to which, if it had so pleased him, I might have succeeded.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Somerville&#8217;s main heir was his half-brother, Mark
                  Somerville, 16th Lord Somerville (1784&#8211;1842). There is no mention in contemporary
                  reports of any illegitimate children.</note> With all the rest we have nothing to
               do, &#8211; except as to the simple fact whether the will be attested by three
                  witnesses.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">If the will was not thus
                  attested it would have been invalid. Unfortunately for Southey, John Southey
                  Somerville&#8217;s will was valid, and was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 19
                  March 1820.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You may imagine how happy I was to reach home &amp; find all well
               after so long an absence.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had
                  spent May and June 1820 in London.</note> &amp; how much I enjoy leisure,
               tranquillity, fresh air, books &amp; regular employment, after the hurry &amp;
               disquiet, &amp; fatigue &amp; dissipation of London. &#8211; dissipation it may properly be
               called, when so much time is expended which produces nothing. I found my four younger
               children thoroughly recovered from the measles, God be thanked; &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> just beginning
               to walk. A finer creature of his age never was seen, &#8211; full of animation &amp; good
               nature. My arrival made a sort of jubilee in the house, &#8211; &amp; the arrival of my
               packages some days after occasiond a second. For some time I was idle for very
               happiness, &#8211; the mere <del>xxxxxxx</del> &lt;gxxxx&gt; of being at rest, &#8211; of knowing that
               I had no engagement of any kind, but that where I slept, there I should breakfast,
               &amp; that where I breakfasted, there I should dine, &amp; that where I dined, there
               I should drink tea, &amp; sup, &amp; sleep, was so unlike any thing which I had felt
               for the preceding three months, that <del>x</del> it was of itself a pleasure, of
               which it seemed I could never have too much. And I have not yet lost the perception
               of it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have however settled fairly to work, proceeding, <hi rend="ital">more meo</hi>,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;In my way&#8217;.</note>
               with many things at once; &#8211; having I believe learnt to manage my own mind almost as
               well as you manage your body, &amp; in like manner adapting my habits to its
               infirmity. Too much attention to any subject would disturb my sleep. I turn therefore
               from one to another, that no one may fasten upon my thoughts too strongly, &amp; this
               brings with it a great advantage, for if my mind does not flow freely on one subject,
               or I do not perceive how to arrange either the argument, or the narrative, &#8211; instead
               of persisting doggedly against the grain, I lay the paper by, &amp; turn to something
               else that the current may run free. &#8211; In another week perhaps, if I am not
               interrupted, I may send off the introductory chapter of the Peninsular War.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular

               inferences are as logical &amp; as clear &amp; as convincing, as you would expect
               them to be, from such a man. The historians of our reformation have not dealt fairly
               on either side. Indeed how can it be thought that they should have kept clear of the
               contagious passions which raged so violently? when even in our days it is so
               difficult to come to &lt;the&gt; question with an equitable mind. My own belief is this, &#8211;
               that if in those dreadful days I had been a young man, I should have courted
               martyrdom for the reformation, &#8211; if I have been an elderly one I should have suffered
               it for the old establishment: &#8211; in the first case youth hope &amp; ardour would have
               made me overlook all the immediate evils <del>of</del> &amp; dangers of the change;
               in the other, the good would have appeared so doubtful &amp; remote, the evil so
               certain &amp; immediate, that I should have thought it better to die than to assist
               in the work of destruction which was going on.</p>

               country, that the Revolutionist of this day have nothing reasonable to ask, &#8211; except
               for that melioration of the lower ranks, which they go the sure way to prevent, by
               their own excesses. But I fear that an explosion will be brought on by this

                  attempts were made in parliament to deprive her of the title of Queen and to
                  dissolve her marriage to the King, made her a figurehead for radicals, and also
