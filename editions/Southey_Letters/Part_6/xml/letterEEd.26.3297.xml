                  autobiographical poem &#8216;The Birth-Day&#8217;. It was never completed, but was published
                  in 1836.</note> to me, at <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Southeys (my brother)</ref> &#8211; <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">19 Queen Anne Street, Cavendish
                  Square</ref>, I shall find it there, sooner than it would find its way to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> thro the booksellers hands. I
               dare say you write blank verse, &#8211; your ear will lead you to the measure but if you
               should have written under any erroneous notion of its structure, it will be very easy
               to show you where you are wrong, &amp; what you have to correct.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Bristol is my native place, &amp; the first imagery which I ever drew
               from nature was from the rocks &amp; woods about Clifton. There was (&amp; probably
               still is) not far from Cook&#8217;s Folly<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A
                  Bristol landmark; a six-sided tower built in 1693.</note> a horse block upon the
               Down, close to the wall, &#8211; a point from whence strangers look down upon the river
               &amp; the opposite woods. Immediately under that horse block is a little cave
               overhung with ivy, &#8211; the access to which I should probably find difficult now, &#8211; but
               when I was between fifteen &amp; eighteen many &amp; many are the verses which I
               wrote in that cave.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The poems included the
                  inscription &#8216;For a Cavern that Overlooks the River Avon&#8217;, first published in
                  Southey&#8217;s <title>Poems</title> (Bristol, 1797), pp. 57&#8211;58. Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Catalogue of
                  His Juvenile Poems&#8217;, at Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, contains no fewer than ten
                  poems with titles such as &#8216;Cave&#8217;, &#8216;To the Cave&#8217; and &#8216;In the Cave&#8217;.</note> One of
               my schoolfellows seemed at that time to have an inclination for poetry, almost as
               decided as my own; &#8211; we called ourselves Nisus &amp; Euryalus,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">In Publius Vergilius Maro (70&#8211;19 BC),
                     <title>Aeneid</title>, Book 9, lines 168&#8211;459, Nisus is a follower of Aeneas and
                  famed for his loyalty to his friend Euryalus. Southey referred to himself as
                  &#8216;Nisus&#8217; in a few of his early poems, for example, &#8216;To Ignorance&#8217;, Southey to
                  Charles Collins, [c. 16 April 1792], <title>The Collected Letters of Robert
                     Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 6; and &#8216;To Lycon&#8217;, Southey to Horace Walpole
                  Bedford, 22&#8211;[24] December 1793, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.
                     Part One</title>, Letter 76. &#8216;Euryalus&#8217; was probably Grosvenor Charles Bedford,
                  as Southey indicates he was a friend from Westminster School with an &#8216;inclination
                  for poetry&#8217; that was not sustained.</note> &#8211; &amp; the former of these names I cut
               in the rock, where I used to take my seat.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One thing before I conclude. An old friend of mine, for whom I have a
               great regard &amp; affection, lives (I believe) within a few doors of your present
               abode. His name is <ref type="m" target="people.html#KingJohn">King</ref>, he
