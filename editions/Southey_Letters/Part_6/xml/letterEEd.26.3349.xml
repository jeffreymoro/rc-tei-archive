						a massive causeway, commissioned in 1803, designed by Telford, and built between 1814&#8211;1816, to carry the road over
						Loch Fleet. It comprised an earthwork, and a bridge with self-regulating sluice gates that allowed the waters from
						the river to flow out, but prevented seawater from coming in.</note> in the county of Sutherland, &#8211; the farthest
					point North of our expedition.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey toured Scotland from 17 August until
						1 October 1819. For his record of events, see <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819</title>, ed. Charles
						Harold Herford (1929). </note> We were there yesterday, slept at Bonar Bridge &amp; came back this afternoon to
					Dingwall. Tomorrow we strike for the western coast, return to Inverness on Saturday, &#8211; &amp; on the Wednesday
					following (possibly the Tuesday) begin our way home by ascending the locks at the Eastern end of the Caledonian
						Canal,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Caledonian Canal (constructed 1803&#8211;1822). Rickman was Secretary

          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Sarah</ref> has probably heard that I saw her
					sister Fanny at Edinburgh, &amp; Elinor at Forres.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Frances Susannah Castle
						(b. 1801) was working as a governess in the family of the geologist, educationist and, from the 1830s, factory
						inspector and reformer Leonard Horner (1785&#8211;1864; <title>DNB</title>). Eleanor Castle (b. 1797) was with either
						Helen Cumming Gordon (d. 1830), the widow of Sir Alexander Penrose Cumming Gordon 1st Baronet (d. 1806), or her
						daughter-in-law, Eliza Maria Gordon Cumming (d. 1842). Southey saw Frances in Edinburgh on 17 August, and met
						Eleanor at the Cumming Gordon&#8217;s estate near Forres on 2 September; see <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in
							1819</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (London, 1929), pp. 4, 104&#8211;105. </note> Many civilities were offered me
					by the friends of the latter, &#8211; if I could have accepted them, &#8211; those of the former had no opportunity of doing
					so, &#8211; &amp; thus I had more opportunity of talking with the person whom I wished to see. They were both looking
					very well, &amp; seemed thoroughly pleased, as far as I could judge, with their situations.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My journey is very pleasant, &#8211; in spite of an unpleasant circumstance, of which I give no
					intimation in my letters home. I am travelling with a wound in my head. Skiddaw thought proper to explode as a
					volcano the third night after I left Edinburgh. I have shown it to two surgeons &#8211; at Aberdeen &amp; Inverness.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">George Kerr (1771&#8211;1826) at Aberdeen; and William Kennedy (c. 1761&#8211;1823), Fellow

        <p rend="indent1"> I have seen a great deal, &amp; have yet much more to see. We have been in sight of the Ord of
					Caithness. Never was any country in a more rapid state of improvement &amp; <del>xxx xx xx</del> never was so much
					done &lt;to improve a country&gt; in so short a space of time by Government conjointly with the people. Besides the
