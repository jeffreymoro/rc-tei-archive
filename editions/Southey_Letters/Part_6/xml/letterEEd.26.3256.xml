        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably Hamond&#8217;s letter of 27 February 1819; a copy is in Dr
                  Williams&#8217;s Library.</note> my dear Sir, affects me greatly. It <del>xxx</del> represents a state of mind into which I also should
               have fallen had it not been for that support, which you are not disposed to think necessary for the soul of man. I too identified my
               own hopes with hopes for mankind, &amp; at the price of any self-sacrifice would have promoted the good of my fellow creatures. I too
               have been disappointed, &#8211; in being undeceived; but having learnt to temper hope with patience, &amp; when I lift up my spirit to its
               Creator &amp; Redeemer &#8211; to say, not with the lips alone but with the heart, thy will be done,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Lord&#8217;s Prayer, <title>Matthew</title> 6: 10.</note>
          <del>x xx</del> I feel that whatever afflictions I have endured have been
               dispensed to me in mercy, &amp; am <del>thank</del> deeply &amp; devoutly thankful for what I am &amp; what I am to be when I shall
               burst my shell. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> O Sir! religion is the one thing needful, &#8211; without it no one can be truly happy &lt;(do you not <hi rend="ital">feel</hi>
               this?)&gt; with it no one can be entirely miserable. Without it, this <del>whole frame of things</del> &lt;world&gt; would be a mystery too
               dreadful to be borne. <del>Xxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx</del> our best affections &amp; our noblest desires a mere juggle &amp; a curse, &#8211; &amp;
               it were better indeed to be nothing than the things we are. I am no bigot, &#8211; I believe that men will be judged by their actions &amp;
               intentions, not their creeds. I am a Christian, &amp; so will Turk, Jew &amp; Gentile be in Heaven, if they have lived well according
               to the light which was vouchsafed them. I do not fear that there will be a great gulph between you &amp; me in the world which we must
               both enter, but if I could persuade you to look on towards that world with the eyes of faith, a change would be operated in all your
               views &amp; feelings, &amp; hope &amp; joy &amp; love would be with you to your last breath, &#8211; <del>x</del> universal love, &#8211; love for
               mankind, &amp; for the Universal Father into whose hands you are about to render up your spirit. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> That the natural world by its perfect order displays evident marks of design, I think you would readily admit; &#8211; for it
               is so palpable that it can only be disputed from perverseness or affectation. Is it not reasonable to <del>bel</del> suppose that the
               moral order of things should in like manner be coherent &amp; harmonious? &#8211; It is so if there be a state of retribution after death. If
               that be granted every thing becomes intelligible, just, beautiful &amp; good. <del>Xxx xxxx happxxxxx xxxxx</del> Would you not from
               the sense of fitness &amp; of justice wish that it should be so? And is there not enough of Wisdom &amp; of Power apparent in the
               creation to authorize us in inferring, that whatever upon the grand scale would be best, therefore must be? Pursue this feeling, &#8211;
               &amp; it will lead you to the Cross of Christ. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I never <del>xxxx</del> fear to avow my belief that warnings from the other world are sometimes communicated to us in
               this, &amp; that absurd as the stories of apparitions generally are, they are not always false, &#8211; but that the spirits of the dead have
               sometimes been permitted &lt;to&gt; appear. I believe this because I cannot refuse my assent to the evidence which exists of such things,
               &amp; to the universal consent of all men, who have not <hi rend="ital">learnt</hi> to think otherwise. Perhaps you will not despise
               this <del>opinion</del> as a mere superstition when I say that Kant, the profoundest thinker of modern ages, came by the severest
               reasoning to the same conclusion.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Immanuel Kant (1724&#8211;1804), <title>Tr&#228;ume eines Geistersehers,
                     Erl&#228;utert Durch Tr&#228;ume der Metaphysik</title> (1766). Southey may have been reading Kant at this time as he debated Kant&#8217;s ideas
                  on progress in society extensively in <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>, 2
                  vols (London, 1829), II, pp. 408&#8211;426.</note> But if these things are, there is a State after death; &#8211; &amp; if there be a State
               after death, it is reasonable to presume that such things should be. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will receive this as it is meant. It is hastily &amp; earnestly written, &#8211; in perfect sincerity, &#8211; in the fullness
               of my heart. Would to God that it might find the way to yours! In case of your recovery, it would reconcile you to life &amp; open to
               you sources of happiness to which you are a stranger. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But whether your lot be for life or death &#8211; dear Sir &#8211; </p>
