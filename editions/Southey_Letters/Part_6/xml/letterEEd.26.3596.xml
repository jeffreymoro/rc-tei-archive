                  of Worcester, 1817&#8211;1825, Bishop of St David&#8217;s 1825&#8211;1840.</note> has communicated to me the copy of part of a letter from Miss
                  Briggs<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Briggs (1751&#8211;1822), whose family were devout Methodists and close friends of
                  John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>).</note> to John Wesley, the original of which, he informs me, was given by M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wesley<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Wesley (1709/10&#8211;1781). She was a widow at the time of her
                  marriage to John Wesley in 1751. The relationship was troubled and on 23 January 1771 Mary left her husband for the final time. She
                  took with her &#8216;part of his Journals, and many other papers, which were never restored&#8217;, Southey, <title>The Life of Wesley; and The
                     Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), II, p. 302.</note> to your Mother,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> &amp; is probably at this time in your possession. He tells me that I am at liberty to make what
               use I please of it: &#8211; &amp; if it prove to be authentic, affecting Wesley&#8217;s character as it does, it becomes my duty, tho <del>xx</del>
               a most unwelcome one, to make it public Having written his life as fully as the materials before me enabled me to do, &amp; as
               faithfully as possible, I cannot, consistently with integrity, suppress a fact of this nature.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Permit me then to ask you, Sir, whether such a letter is in your possession, &amp; whether it came to you in the way
               stated, which would leave no doubt of its geniuneness The copy which has been sent to me is a fragment, beginning with an imperfect
               sentence, thus, &#8220;believe him insincere &#8211; &amp; ending also imperfectly, thus, &#8211; &#8220;&amp; be still kindly affected to her &amp;c.&#8221; &#8211; It
               appears from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wesley&#8217;s published correspondence that he had a correspondent of that name, at the time when he
               separated from his wife. &#8211; May I request, if you possess the letter &amp; it be perfect, that you will favour me with the beginning
               &amp; the end of it, &#8211; so as to supply what is wanting in this copy.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Wilson&#8217;s reply made it
                  clear that his mother had been given a copy of the letter, not the original. Southey, unconvinced by the reliability of such a copy
                  and concerned that it had been part of Mary Wesley&#8217;s campaign to ruin her husband&#8217;s reputation, decided against publishing it; see
                  Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 7 February 1821, Letter 3628.</note>
