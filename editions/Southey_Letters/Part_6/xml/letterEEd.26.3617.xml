               within tolerable bounds has frequently occurred to me; it is that printers &amp;
               booksellers should be licensed, &amp; lose their license upon conviction for libel.
               They are the only body of tradesmen who have a class of avowed rascals belonging to

               that is not sufficient to bring home to him the fact of the publication. Now surely
               when a man thus publicly avows his act &amp; deed, it would be very reasonable that
               he should brought to trial for it, &amp; convicted, unless he could prove upon trial
