							action to try and stop the publication of <title>Wat Tyler</title> (1817). He had delivered a legal opinion on
							John Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex will, which gave Southey some hope of inheriting property
							at Fitzhead after the death of his third cousin, and John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey Somerville, 15th
							Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>). Essentially, Shadwell told Southey he had no claim on the
