          <salute rend="indent0"> Dear Sir,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> A lucky misapprehension respecting new and old Methodists has
               procured me some very interesting information from your correspondent Mr. Keene,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The correspondent was possibly Martin Keene
                  (dates unknown), a Dublin bookseller and prominent Irish Methodist. He was the son
                  of Arthur Keene (d. 1818), one of the founders of Irish Methodism. Southey&#8217;s
                  letter to Messrs Longman &amp; Co., 19 February 1819 (Letter 3249), had requested
                  some of the publications of the New Connexion, which had separated from Methodism
                  in 1797, and of Irish Methodism. This enquiry inadvertently provided Southey with
                  information about the nature of the division in Irish Methodism in 1818, in which
                  a group called the Primitive Wesleyans decided to remain within the Church of
                  Ireland &#8211; to a non-Methodist they were easily confused with the Primitive
                  Methodists in England, who had separated from the main body of Methodists in
                  1807&#8211;1811, but who had no intention of reuniting with the Church of
                  England.</note> upon a subject of which I had no knowledge before, and which is of
               much importance to my work.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
                     <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>
                  (1820).</note> I enclose a letter which you will have the goodness to get franked
               to him.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The enclosed letter has not been
                  traced so it is not possible to be sure what sort of information Southey
                  requested.</note> In it I have explained to him what further documents I require
               from Ireland.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Life of Wesley;
                     and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820), II, pp.
                  256&#8211;292 dealt with &#8216;Methodism in Ireland&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I hoped to have been in London at this time; but there has been a
               succession of illness in my family, and the &#8220;History of Brazil&#8221; has grown under my
               hands far beyond all calculation, owing to the richness of my unprinted documents,
               and to the materials which have reached me while this volume has been in the press.
               However, we are printing the last chapter, &#8211; a long and very important one, &#8211;
               containing a full view of the present state of Brazil.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London,
                  1810&#8211;1819), III, pp. 696&#8211;879.</note> It would have been worth 100<hi rend="ital">l</hi>. if I had transferred it to the &#8220;Quarterly Review.&#8221; But it is in its
               proper place, &#8211; the fit conclusion of a work upon which my reputation hereafter may
               safely rest.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8220;Nichols&#8217;s Anecdotes&#8221; are such a huge store of materials, applicable
               to many works which I have in hand and in mind, that I must keep them.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had originally promised to return the copy
                  of John Nichols (1745&#8211;1826; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Literary Anecdotes of the
