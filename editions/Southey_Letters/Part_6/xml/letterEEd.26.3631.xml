        <p rend="indent1"> It gave me very great pleasure to receive a letter from you, &#8211; to
               hear than you are placed in the upper fourth,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Hill had just joined Westminster School, where Southey was a pupil
                  1788&#8211;1792. Hill had been born in 1809, which meant he would usually have been
                  placed in the third form.</note> (which, judging from your age, is higher than I
               had expected) &#8211; that you are in the room with the head of the house, (which is a
               great advantage in point of comfort,) &amp; that you have so kind a friend in my good
               friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Knox,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John
                  William Knox (1784&#8211;1862), clergyman, scholar and usher at Westminster School
                  1806&#8211;1821.</note> who could not oblige me more than by his kindness to you. Three
               &amp; thirty years have passed since I was in that form where you are now, &amp; I
               perceive by your letter that the school (like every thing else) has undergone some
               changes during that time. Three &amp; thirty years hence, Edward, when thro the mercy
               of God I shall be in a better world, you I hope may look back upon Westminster with
               as much satisfaction as I do now, for the advantages which I have derived from being
               there.</p>

               the Caledonian Canal by which frigates can pass thro the Island from sea to sea (the
               greatest work of inland navigation in the world) the Pontcy-syllti Aquaduct which
               carries a canal over the river Dee, at the height of 100 feet above the bed of the
               river, &amp; the hanging-bridge over the arm of the sea which separates Anglesea from
                  Wales.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Telford oversaw the construction
                  of the Caledonian Canal (1803&#8211;1822), the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct that carries the
