                  and Portugal 1598&#8211;1621). This manuscript had been brought to Southey&#8217;s attention by James Gooden and Constable had agreed to

                  Westminster 1819&#8211;1820, MP for Dungarvan 1822&#8211;1834, narrowly defeated John Cam Hobhouse (1786&#8211;1869; DNB), MP for Westminster
                  1820&#8211;1833, MP for Nottingham 1834&#8211;1847, MP for Harwich 1848&#8211;1851, who had much radical support. John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham
                  (1792&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>), Whig MP for Durham 1812&#8211;1828, had supported Lamb.</note> If the mob had applied a few rotten eggs

                  been badly injured by a paving slab thrown by a hostile crowd.</note> it would very considerably have accelerated the process. &#8211; It
               is odd that no person asked Hobhouse upon the hustings whether he was the author of that letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref>.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Canning had overreacted to the circulation
                  of an anonymous pamphlet that attacked his speech in the House of Commons on 11 March 1818 on the Indemnity Act (1818). The
                  pamphlet, <title>A Letter to the Right Hon. George Canning</title>, was withdrawn the day after it was published, but it was
                  circulated under blank covers by the radical bookseller and printer James Ridgway (1745&#8211;1838). Canning&#8217;s response was to write, via
                  Ridgway, on 10 April 1818, effectively challenging the anonymous author to a duel. This letter became public on 12 April. Many
                  thought the pamphlet to have been the work of John Cam Hobhouse, but no reply was received and a duel was avoided.</note> Twas a comical election, &#8211; &amp; I am well pleased at the result. </p>
