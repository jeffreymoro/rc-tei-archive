        <p rend="indent1"> I have just got thro Stradas Decades,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Famiano Strada (1572&#8211;1649), <title>De Bello Belgico Decades
                     Duae 1555&#8211;1590</title> (1651).</note> &amp; learnt a great deal from them.
               There are few books which a military man might study with more advantage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The foundation of two evils was laid in these Dutch wars, &#8211; French
               preponderance, &amp; English republicanism.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Dutch struggle for independence from Spain that lasted from 1566 to 1648.
                  Southey suggests that this war weakened Spain and led to the rise of France to the
                  position of most powerful European state, and that the successful establishment of
                  the Dutch Republic, with its predominantly Calvinist religious make up, encouraged
                  English republicanism and nonconformity. </note> Puritanism also owes in great
               measure its growth to them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Prince of Parma<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma (1545&#8211;1592), Spanish Governor in the
                  Netherlands 1578&#8211;1592.</note> (a man of consummate military genius) was the first
               General who perceived the advantage of religious discipline in an army. I think
                  Gustavus<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Gustav II (1594&#8211;1632; King of
                  Sweden 1611&#8211;1632).</note> imitated him in this point, &amp; Cromwell<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Oliver Cromwell (1599&#8211;1658; Lord Protector
                  1653&#8211;1658; <title>DNB</title>).</note> Gustavus.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The poverty of the Spanish Government when most flourishing has
               surprized me. They might again &amp; again have recovered the whole of the Low
               Countries if they had employed a little larger force, or kept the force which they
               did employ in good order &amp; good humour by paying them regularly</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are several cases parallel to what happened to us at Bergen op
                  Zoom,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The unsuccessful British assault
                  on the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom on 8 March 1814.</note> where in spite of the
               fortifications the town was surprized, &amp; the <del>t</del> assailants after having
               overcome all the military difficulties were driven out by a window &amp; street
               resistance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am now going to look thro Aitzema,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieuwe van Aitzema (1600&#8211;1669), <title>Sakem van Staet en
                     Oorlogh in ende Omtrent de Vereenigde Nederlanden</title> (1655&#8211;1671). Southey
                  possessed a later edition and continuation of 1669&#8211;1699, no. 214 in the sale
                  catalogue of his library.</note> &#8211; a Dutch historian whose work includes the
               history of Europe &amp; of all other parts of the world with which the powers of
               Europe had any intercourse at that time, from 1620 to the first years of William
                  3.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">William III (1650&#8211;1702; King of
                  Great Britain 1689&#8211;1702; <title>DNB</title>).</note> It consists of eleven folios,
               each containing as much as three of Rushworths volumes;<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">John Rushworth (1612&#8211;1690; <title>DNB</title>),

                  (1659&#8211;1721).</note> abounding like his in state papers, but connecting them by a
               full &amp; regular narrative, &#8211; &amp; in point of merit about half way between
               Rushworth &amp; Thuanus,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Jacques Auguste
                  de Thou (1553&#8211;1617), <title>Historia sui Temporis</title> (1620).</note> as much
               above the former as below the latter &#8211; Here I shall find a great deal concerning
               Cromwells times.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We are living in perpetual storms. I think we have not two days
               together of <hi rend="ital">calm</hi> weather since August. The thermometer is hardly
