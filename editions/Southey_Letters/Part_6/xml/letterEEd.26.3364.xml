        <p rend="indent1"> I return a copy of the Address, amended according to your Lordships suggestions.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Following the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre of 16 August 1819, in which local magistrates ordered the dispersal of a public meeting in
                  Manchester, resulting in at least eleven deaths, Whigs in Cumberland started to organise a County Meeting, held on 13 October 1819,
                  to protest at the magistrates&#8217; actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. The conservative response drawn up by Southey &#8211; an
                  Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the press &#8211; was included with this letter. It was not
                  proceeded with, and the government&#8217;s supporters in Cumberland produced instead a more moderate document.</note> And as it is not
               necessary that the signatures should be in the handwriting of those who desire to have their names affixed, I will send off copies

                  George Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon (1720&#8211;1752). He owned the Waterend estate on the west side of Derwentwater and was married to
                  Frances Ingram-Shepherd (1761&#8211;1841), sister of Isabella Anne Ingram-Shepherd (1760&#8211;1834), second wife of the Marquess of Hertford,

        <p rend="indent1"> From the course which Carliles trial is taking, it seems plain that he will shock the jury, &amp; be found guilty.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The trial of the radical publisher and writer Richard Carlile (1790&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>) for
                  blasphemy and seditious libel had commenced on 12 October 1819. His rambling 30-hour speech in his own defence did not augur well
                  for his prospects. He was found guilty on 16 October and sentenced to three years imprisonment in Dorchester jail. </note> I have
               long wished that transportation were made the punishment for such offences, &amp; for seditious libels &amp; seditious practises. It
               would remove the offenders out of the way of pity, &amp; of mischief; whereas in prison they contrive to excite both. <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HuntLeigh">Leigh Hunt</ref> were as

                  criticising the flogging of some militiamen at Ely; and Hunt confined in Horsemonger Lane jail (1813&#8211;1815) for libelling the Prince
                  Regent. Both continued to conduct their newspapers from prison.</note>

                  than the judge, mainly responsible for determining whether a publication was libellous.</note> would strike at the root of the evil.
               And it is as easy to take whole measures as half ones; they will not excite more opposition from the enemies of Government, &amp; they
               will give confidence to its friends.</p>
