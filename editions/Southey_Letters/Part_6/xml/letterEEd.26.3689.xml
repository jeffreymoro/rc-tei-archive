               Portugal was so much concerned in that Treaty that I should think this MS. must be

               upon ticklish questions, wishing, no doubt, that he were quietly at home with his
               plants. I look upon the Kings return<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">John VI (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826) had, under pressure from the
                  liberal revolution of 1820, returned to Portugal from Brazil on 3 July
                  1821.</note> as a measure of personal safety, that he may be within reach of our
               protection, &amp; perhaps of Austrian assistance. The same troops which have quieted
                  Naples<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">The liberal revolution of 1820
                  in Naples had been crushed by Austrian troops in March 1821.</note> may easily be
               transported to Lisbon; &#8211; &amp; at all events his life will be safe at Lisbon. The
               proceedings of the Cortes are like those in Spain<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Following army revolts in Spain, the liberal Constitution of
                  1812 had been restored and a newly elected Cortes met for the first time on 9 July

               &amp; mischievous; good intentions being frustrated by the ignorance &amp;
               inexperience of those who put themselves forward, &amp; the task of putting such a
               government to rights requiring abler statesmen than could possibly grow up under it.

               There is another episode in American history which I think of composing for the QR.
               ere long, &#8211; the last insurrection of the Indians under one of the Inca family, during
               the American war. The only account which has ever been published is in the Hist: of B
               Ayres by Funes.<note n="22" place="foot" resp="editors">Gregorio Funes,
