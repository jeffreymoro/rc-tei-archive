                  Autumn<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bernard Barton&#8217;s <title>A Day in
                     Autumn; a Poem</title> (London, 1820) carried an epigraph from Southey: &#8216;It was
                  a day that sent into the heart/ A summer feeling&#8217;, from <title>Madoc</title>
                  (1805), Part One, Book 13, lines 67&#8211;68; and an extended Dedication to &#8216;Robert
                  Southey, Esq.&#8217;, pp. v&#8211;vii.</note> to the true cause, &#8211; the delay to which such
               communications are liable in waiting for an opportunity of conveyance. It was not
               till this morning that I received it in a parcel, dated on the sixth of this month.
               The waggon travels slowly, &amp; more time is lost in carriers warehouses, where a
               parcel has to change conveyances twice or thrice on the road, than is required for
               the journey. &#8211; I now thank you again for the dedication &amp; the poem. It is a very
               pleasing production, in a fine strain of genuine feeling.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In reply to your question concerning the life of George Fox,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">George Fox (1624&#8211;1691; <title>DNB</title>),
                  founder of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Southey did not write this
                  book.</note> the plan of the work resembles that of the Life of Wesley<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise
                     and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> as nearly as possible. Very
               little progress has been made in the composition, but a good deal in collecting
               materials &amp; digesting the order of their arrangement. The first chapters will
               contain a summary history of the religious, or irreligious difficulties in England,
               &amp; their consequences, from the rise of the Lollards<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A late fourteenth-century reform movement in the Church of
                  England that may have survived until the Reformation.</note> to the time when
               George Fox went forth. This will be such an historical sketch as that view of our
               Ecclesiastical History in the Life of Wesley, which is the most elaborate portion of
               the work.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 9, <title>The Life of
                     Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London, 1820),
                  I, pp. 305&#8211;336.</note> The last chapter will probably contain a view of <del>the
                  state</del> of the Society at this time &amp; the modification &amp; improvements
               which it has gradually &amp; almost insensibly received. This part whenever it is
               written, &amp; all those parts wherein I may be in danger of forming erroneous
               inference from an imperfect knowledge of the subject, I shall take care to
                  <del>xxxxxx</del> show to some members of the society before it is printed. The
               general spirit &amp; tendency of the book will, I doubt not, be thought favourable
                  <hi rend="ital">by</hi> the Quakers <del>xxxxx</del> as well as <hi rend="ital">to</hi> them, &amp; the more so by the judicious, because communication comes
               with <del>xxx</del> ten fold weight from one who does not dissemble his own
               differences of opinion upon <del>xx</del> certain main points. &#8211; Perhaps in the
               course of the work I may avail myself of your friendly offer: <del>xx</del> ask you
               some questions as they occur, &amp; transmit certain parts for your inspection. </p>
