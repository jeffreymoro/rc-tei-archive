        <p rend="indent1"> I do not think the progress of Revolution in Brazil will be so rapid
               as to destroy the credit of Government, or materially to affect its finances for some
               time. Even from Para the surplus of the Treasury will be remitted to the Rio, till
               the people of the former place chuse to make themselves the capital of a separate
                  republic.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Porto in
                  August 1820 led to the election of a Cortes in December 1820 and demands that the
                  monarchy return from Brazil, where it had fled in 1807&#8211;1808, following the French
                  invasion. Events in Portugal produced a number of sympathetic military revolts in
                  Brazil; one in the Province of Para was reported in <title>The Times</title>, 13
                  March 1821. These developments eventually led to the separation of Portugal and
                  Brazil in September 1822; but Brazil did not become a Republic until 1889, nor did
                  it disintegrate.</note>
          <del>The</del> I hope &amp; trust that your brother<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Henry May (1785&#8211;1849), May&#8217;s younger brother and
                  business partner in Brazil.</note> will recover what he has already hazarded,
               &amp; surely he will not be so desperately imprudent as to incur any farther risque
               of the same kind. Meantime I look with much anxiety to the news from that country,
               far less for the kind of interest which I naturally now take in its fortunes, than in
               your account: tho, as I said before, there will be time for your brother to save what
               he has embarked, before the total wreck.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As many of poor dear <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash&#8217;s</ref> drawings
               relating to my family as I could describe &amp; his representatives could ascertain
               have been sent for me to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Harry&#8217;s</ref>;
               &amp; among them I doubt not, are the three drawings of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">your
                  God daughter</ref>, of which one was designed for you, one for
               himself, &amp; one for me. Make your choice of these. Of the two which he took away
               in nearly a finished state, I know not which was to be preferred, &#8211; that in the lilac
               dress had most of the features, that in the redder one more of the character; &#8211; he
               expected to make the third of which the dress was not coloured when he went away,
               better than either.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The location of the
                  &#8216;lilac&#8217; portrait of Edith May Southey is unknown; the &#8216;redder&#8217; one is probably the
                  pencil and watercolour sketch now in the collections of the Wordsworth Trust,
                  Grasmere; and the &#8216;uncoloured&#8217; one is in Keswick Museum and Art Gallery.</note> &#8211;
               I write now merely to say this, &amp; to inclose proof of a more rapid progress in my
                  autobiography.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The autobiographical
                  letters Southey was writing for May. This letter possibly included part of the
                  autobiographical letter Southey had begun on 7 April 1821, see Letter 3665.</note>
