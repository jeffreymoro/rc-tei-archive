							Newman: a New-England Tale (Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey</title> (London,

					Governor of N England at that time, &amp; believed to have been privy to Goffe &amp; Whalleys<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">William Goffe (c. 1605&#8211;c. 1679) and Edward Whalley (c. 1607&#8211;c. 1675) were two
						regicides who fled to New England in 1660 and lived there in concealment.</note> place of concealment, &amp;
					instrumental in saving them. There is a most extraordinary book called a History of the Three Judges, by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ezra Stiles, one of the last Presidents of Yale College.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Ezra Stiles (1727&#8211;1795), <title>History of the Three Judges of King Charles I</title> (1794), no. 2552 in the
						sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Stiles was President of Yale University 1778&#8211;1795.</note> Nothing more
					gossipping ever appeared in the Gentlemans Magazine; &amp; nothing more thoroughly rancorous could have been
					written by Hugh Peters<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Hugh Peter (1598&#8211;1660; <title>DNB</title>),
						independent preacher who was executed after the Restoration.</note> himself. And yet Ezra Stiles was
						<del>xxxxxxx</del> a kind simple&#8211;hearted creature, so that the milk of his nature, &amp; the vengefulness of his
					prejudices make the strangest compound in the world. The book is valuable as a curiosity, &amp; it has given me
					many useful hints. Leverett is certainly not a name that I should have chosen for the reason which you point out. &#8211;
					Randolph also is an historical character in <del>xx</del> very ill odour with the New Englanders.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Randolph (1632&#8211;1703), central figure in securing the revocation of the Charter
						of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1684 and Secretary of the unpopular Dominion of New England

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot call to mind my authority for the word <hi rend="ital">accoil</hi>, tho I certainly used
					it in Roderick<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814), Book
						17, line 163. Southey used it again in &#8216;Oliver Newman&#8217;, Book 5, line 913.</note> as an authorized word, &#8211; that is
					to say it occurred to me as such &amp; I had no suspicion that it might be otherwise. Spenser I know uses the
						verb,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Edmund Spenser (c. 1552&#8211;1599; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Faerie Queene</title>

					properties of the plant were known in Europe soon after the discovery of the country where it grows.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have had a very pleasing letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#CombeEdward">Combe</ref>, who seems to have fallen into a peaceful &amp; happy way of life, which might be thought natural too
					for a younger brother, if it were not unusual in these times.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Combe
						had attended Lincoln&#8217;s Inn in 1795 and was ordained in 1804. He was the younger brother of Richard Thomas Combe
						(c. 1770&#8211;1849), who had inherited their family&#8217;s country house, Earnshill in Somerset.</note> Ever since he left
					the Temple he has lived in his brothers house, &amp; there he is likely to continue the main value of one of the
					livings which have just been given him being that it renders his residence there legal. The preferment which you
					saw noticed in the newspapers is from 3 to 400 a year, &amp; he had two small perpetual curacies before, one of
					which was given him by Hanning.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Combe had been appointed Perpetual
						Curate of Barrington in 1810 and Drayton in 1816. In 1821 he was appointed Rector of Donyatt and Earnshill (where
						he lived) by his brother, Richard Thomas Combe. The post at Barrington had been given to Combe by the lay patron,
						William Hanning (c. 1768&#8211;1834) of Dillington House, Ilminster.</note> He is not married, &amp; speaks of himself
					as leading a life of tranquil enjoyment in the house where he was born, &#8211; free from fat &amp; the gout, &amp; not
					more altered than must be expected from the wear &amp; tear of time. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your mention of Blake<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Francis Blake, 3rd Baronet (c.
						1774&#8211;1860), MP for Berwick-Upon-Tweed 1820&#8211;1826, and 1827&#8211;1834; an old Westminster schoolfellow of Southey&#8217;s and
						Wynn&#8217;s. His brother, Robert Dudley Blake (d. 1850), had also been at Westminster with Southey and Wynn, and later
						had a distinguished army career, rising to the rank of Lieutenant-General.</note> reminds me of his brother, with
					whom I had that kind of familiarity which juxtaposition sometimes brings about, when he used to come out of the
					Shell to sit in the fifth, where my station was at that time. I should like to know what is become of him, &#8211; &amp;
					to meet him again. </p>

						The coruscating and hilarious &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, which attacked Southey and others, had been suppressed (and was not
						published until 1833), but Southey undoubtedly knew of its existence.</note> nor the Edinburgh nor the Eclectic
						Reviews.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821) was reviewed in the

						his vein is exhausted &#8211; and that the worthy inditer of Epics is falling gently into dotage &#8211; at least in his
						poetical capacity&#8217; (422). The <title>Eclectic Review</title>, 17 (May 1822), 418&#8211;427, reviewed the poem with
						Byron&#8217;s <title>Cain, a Mystery</title> (1822) and objected to Southey&#8217;s &#8216;profanity&#8217; in his treatment of heaven and
