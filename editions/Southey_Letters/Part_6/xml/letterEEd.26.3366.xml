						Highness</ref><note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Following the ‘Peterloo’ Massacre of 16 August 1819, in
						which local magistrates ordered the dispersal of a public meeting in Manchester, resulting in at least eleven
						deaths, Whigs in Cumberland started to organise a County Meeting, held on 13 October 1819, to protest at the
						magistrates’ actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. The conservative response drawn up by Southey – an
						Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the press – follows. It was not
						proceeded with, and the government’s supporters in Cumberland produced instead a more moderate
					document.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> We the undersigned Nobility, Magistrates, Gentry, Clergy &amp; Freeholders of the County of
					Cumberland, feel it our duty at this time to approach the Throne with a declaration of our loyal attachment to the
					established Institutions of these Kingdoms in opposition to the principles &amp; practices by which their security
					is endangered, &amp; the peace of society disturbed. </p><p rend="indent1"> It is the direct &amp; undisguised object of those demagogues by whom the multitude are misled,
					to bring about a revolution by force. For this purpose men are openly trained to arms &amp; assembled in bodies
					which bid defiance to the civil power: assassination has been recommended &amp; in more than one instance
					attempted; &amp; lists are avowedly kept in which the loyal members of the community are marked for proscription.
					The rights of property are threatened; &amp; the deluded populace are taught to believe that the administration of
					public affairs ought to be taken from persons who are qualified by their education &amp; station in life, &amp;
					whose stake in the country is a pledge for their good intentions &amp; transferred to the ignorant &amp; needy, who
					are necessarily incompetent, &amp; who have nothing to lose. The liberty of the Press is daringly abused to the
					most flagitious purposes; it is employed with unremitting activity to efface from the minds of the people all
					respect for the laws, all sentiments of loyalty &amp; religion, &amp; all the old honourable feelings by which
					Englishmen heretofore have been distinguished. And unhappily this has been so far succesful, that men are now no
					longer disqualified for popular favour by notorious infamy; it matters not how profligate they may be in the
					relations of private life, how base in their dealings, how bankrupt in character &amp; in fortune, nor how openly
					they may live in habitual violation of the laws both of God &amp; men.</p><p rend="indent1"> Regarding these things with just apprehension we must express our sorrow that any persons of rank
					&amp; respectability should be induced to take measures which obviously tend to encourage wicked &amp; desperate
					men in their rebellious purposes. For however much we regret the lives which were lost at Manchester, we cannot but
					see that greater &amp; far more extensive evil must arise, if multitudes are allowed to assemble under such
					circumstances, in contempt of the constituted authorities. And we perceive in the attempts which are made to
					misrepresent the transactions of that day, a manifest design <del>of</del> diverting public indignation from the
					real authors of the mischief, the effect of which would be so to pervert the laws as to make them protect those
					whom they ought to punish &amp; intimidate those whom they ought to protect.</p><p rend="indent1"> As Englishmen therefore who rightly appreciate the blessings which we enjoy &amp; desire that the
					free &amp; happy constitution which we have inherited from our fathers may be transmitted to our children, we feel
					it our duty thus to address <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">your Royal Highness</ref>. And
					should your Royal Highness be advised to recommend to Parliament the adoption of restrictive measures to check the
					diffusion of licentious principles &amp; curb the audacious spirit of blasphemy &amp; treason, we beg leave to
					assure <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">your Royal Highness</ref> that much as we deplore the
					necessity of such measures, we will cheerfully submit to them with a full sense of that necessity, as the natural
					consequence of excesses which have at all times produced similar results, &amp; as the indispensable &amp; only
					means of saving the country from the worst of all evils.</p><p rend="center"> ———</p><p rend="indent0"> [Unidentified hand ends; Southey’s hand begins]</p><p rend="indent0"> My dear Senhouse</p><p rend="indent1"> I send you the copy of an Address which I drew up at <ref type="m" target="people.html#CalvertWilliam">Calverts</ref> desire, &amp; <del>Xx</del> sent to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref>.
