						There was no one piece of legislation that created this situation, though the Church strongly disapproved of the
						slave trade. Southey also refers to the dynastic conflict for the English throne 1455&#8211;1487, between the Houses of
						York and Lancaster. Here he is writing about the institution of villeinage (a villein was a farmer legally tied to
						a particular place or lord of the manor). The system died out in the sixteenth century, a process confirmed by the
						decision to end any remaining villeinage on crown lands in 1574.</note> It is a subject upon which one of my
