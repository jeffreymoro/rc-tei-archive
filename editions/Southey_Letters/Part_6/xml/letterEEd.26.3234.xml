                  the historical sections 1810&#8211;1813. Bedford was investing the money for Southey in
                  government stocks. However, Southey was never paid for his final contribution to
                     <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1811</title> (1813), nor did he receive
                  any profits from his investment.</note> &#8211; After this text I have to submit to your

               &#8211; &amp; the five per cents at 107 &#8211; it be not better to give 214 for 10&#163; a year, than
               &#8211; 234 for only 9&#163;. It is true there is the chance of the five per cents being paid

               without the chance of ever recovering a sixpence. &#8211; However here is something to
