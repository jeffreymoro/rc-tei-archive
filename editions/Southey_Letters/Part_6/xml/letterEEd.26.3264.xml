        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the bills. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I want you to say something to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> for me. He knows that
               Fosbrookes British Monachism is one of the books on my list for him.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Thomas
                  Fosbrooke (1770&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), <title>British Monachism; or, Manners and Customs of the Monks and Nuns of
                     England</title> (1817), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), 59&#8211;102. It dealt extensively with the need for
                  communities to provide support for single women (90&#8211;102).</note> It always was my intention to take up the subject of Protestant
               Nunneries, under that text. But before I could carry this intention into effect, application has been made to me so to do, on behalf of
               the Establishment at Bailbrook House. The application comes from the Bishop of Meath,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas
                  Lewis O&#8217;Beirne (1747&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop of Meath 1798&#8211;1823. The son of a County Longford farmer, he had been educated
                  for the Catholic priesthood, but converted to Protestantism and became a Church of Ireland clergyman. Southey had met him in the
                  Lake District in 1811.</note> &amp; Lady Isabella King,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Isabella Lettice King
                  (1772&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>) founded the Ladies&#8217; Association at Bailbrook House, near Bath, in June 1816. It provided a home for
                  orphaned gentlewomen with no income and was duly praised by Southey in his article in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July
                  1819), 96&#8211;101.</note> who is at the head of this establishment, has sent me all the necessary papers. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> probably knows that it was formed under the sanction of the Queen, who <hi rend="ital">saw</hi> it during the last year of her life, &amp; then fully perceived the important <del>xxxx</del> benefits to which
               it might lead.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Queen Charlotte (1744&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>) had been a financial supporter of
                  the Ladies&#8217; Association and visited Bailbrook House in 1817.</note> Tell him then that I shall attack this subject without delay. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> So you really supposed that I, living in the North of England, &#8211; &amp; moreover knowing Spenser almost by heart,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">In Edmund Spenser (c. 1552&#8211;1599; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Shepheardes Calendar</title>
                  (1579), &#8216;Cuddy&#8217; is the name of one of the shepherds.</note> &#8211; did not know that Cuddy was the abbreviation of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>! And that if asses are called Cuddy-Asses in Durham that this should be
               more fatal to the name, than <del>th</del> precisely the same thing is to the name of Edward &#8211; Richard &amp; John &#8211; the first in
               Somersetshire &#8211; the second in Norfolk &#8211; the third all over England.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Neddy&#8217;, a shortened form of

                  were referred to as &#8216;jacks&#8217; (a form of &#8216;John&#8217;) throughout England.</note> You &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">his other Peter</ref> have a right to call <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">your godson Charles</ref> &#8211; having given him that name, &#8211; but Cuthbert will be his home

        <p rend="indent1"> Delightful weather we have, &amp; have had. &#8211; I have a proposal to make to you, &#8211; that you &amp; I learn to ride the
               German Horse,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The &#8216;Pedestrian Carriage, or Walking Accelerator&#8217;, also known as the &#8216;German
                  Horse&#8217;, after its inventor, Karl Drais (1785&#8211;1851). It was a precursor of the bicycle, but without pedals, so that the rider sat on
                  the saddle and pushed the frame along with his feet.</note> &amp; <del>ride</del> travel down upon it in company to <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>. Think of the glory of being the first Englishmen who performd a serious journey in that
               way. Whenever we enter a town we will tell the people, &#8216;tis for a wager,&#8217; &amp; that will clear the way for us; &#8211; &amp; we shall raise
