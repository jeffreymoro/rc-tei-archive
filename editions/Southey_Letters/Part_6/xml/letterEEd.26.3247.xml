        <p rend="indent1"> Sir Robert Wilson &amp; the Q. R. are both in the wrong.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">General Sir Robert
                  Wilson (1777&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Letter from Sir Robert Wilson to his Constituents in Refutation of a Charge for
                     dispatching a false Report of a Victory to the Commander in Chief of the British Army in the Peninsula in the Year 1809</title>
                  (1818) was reviewed in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July 1818), 478&#8211;492 (published 2 February 1819) by William Carr
                  Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford (1768&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>), with information from the Duke of Wellington. Wilson&#8217;s pamphlet
                  was itself a response to the review of his <title>A Sketch of the Military and Political Power of Russia, in the Year 1817</title>
                  (1817) by Reginald Heber in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (April 1818), 131&#8211;177.</note> Sir Robert made a romancing dispatch
               to varnish an affair of which the less he had said the better; &#8211; &amp; the Q. R. depreciates the effect of his movement upon Ciudad
               Rodrigo, at the time of Sir J. Moores flight; &#8211; a movement which compleatly imposed upon the French &amp; prevented us from flying in
               our panic from Lisbon, &#8211; when some of the stores were actually packed for removal.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Wilson had
                  organised and commanded the Loyal Lusitanian Legion of Portuguese troops in 1808&#8211;1809. In January 1809, while British troops under
                  Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>) were retreating to Corunna, Wilson refused to withdraw from the Spanish town of
                  Ciudad Rodrigo. Southey believed Wilson&#8217;s actions prevented the French advancing on Lisbon, <title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for
                     1809</title>, 2.1 (1811), 498&#8211;500.</note> At that time a certain Major Roach<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Keating Roche (d. 1829), Irish soldier who went on to command a division of Spanish troops in British
                  pay, with the rank of Lieutenant-General.</note> (he is a General now) ran from C Rodrigo, &amp; came to <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> at Badajoz. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> told
               him he had just received intelligence that Wilson had thrown himself into that place with the Lusitanian Legion then said Roach, he
               will never get away alive. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref> looked at him &amp; replied &#8211; perhaps Sir
               that was not the first thing he thought of. Wilson was a disagreable boy (I was in the same remove with him at Westminster &#8211;) &#8211; &amp;
               he is an unprincipled man &#8211; but he did signal service by that movement; &#8211; I perceived it at the time, &amp; the opinion which I &lt;had&gt;
               formed was confirmed by <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere</ref>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">See

        <p rend="indent1"> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Anselm, William Rufus&#8217;s refractory A Bishop, used waxen tablets.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">St Anselm (c. 1033&#8211;1109; <title>DNB</title>), Archbishop of Canterbury 1093&#8211;1109 under William II (c. 1056&#8211;1100; King
                  of England 1087&#8211;1100; <title>DNB</title>). Anselm wrote his <title>Proslogion</title> (1077&#8211;1078) on wax tablets after a divine
                  vision, only to find the tablets broken the next day, according to Eadmer (c. 1060&#8211;1126; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Vita
                     Anselm</title> (c. 1124). Southey read of this incident in <title>Acta Sanctorum</title>, 53 vols (Antwerp and Brussels,

               collected &amp; the writing being with difficulty recovered, he had it transcribed upon parchment. &#8211; This was in Normandy. Wax would
               not be liable to this accident in a warmer climate. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Spaniards have begun to publish an official history of the war. I have a French translation of the first
                  volume:<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">

                     &#201;claircissemens</title> (Paris, 1818), p. 265.</note> &#8211; the writers refer in one place to the Ed: Register, &amp; speak of it as
               the work of one remarkable for the justice of his views &amp; the independance of his notions, (the sort of praise that a man may be
               proud of receiving) &#8211; the French translator has altered <hi rend="ital">Register</hi> to <hi rend="ital">Review</hi>, &#8211; a natural
               mistake, <del>xxxx xx</del> (he had <del>xxxxx</del> heard much of the one, &amp; nothing of the other,) &#8211; but rather a comical
                  one.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">This mistake was comical as Southey&#8217;s writings in the <title>Edinburgh Annual Register,
                     for 1808</title> (1810) were very pro-Spanish, while the <title>Edinburgh Review</title> (1802&#8211;1929) was doubtful about British
