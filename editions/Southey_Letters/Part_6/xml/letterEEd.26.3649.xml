        <p rend="indent1"> Here is a large packet for you, &amp; a little trouble, &#8211; but little however &amp; that little of great service. It is
               that you will call at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 10 in the Strand (near Northumberland House &amp; on the same side of the way) &amp; there
               pay 18&#163;, &#8211; a legacy of poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilsons</ref>, to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Christian her foster-brother.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Christian (1743/4&#8211;1829) was born at Keswick but
                  moved to London, where he ran a linen draper&#8217;s shop. His son was Henry Curwen Christian (1780&#8211;1846), who was in business with his
                  father.</note> If the old Gentleman should be there, you may witness the receipt, &amp; send it back to me; &#8211; if he is not pay the
               money to his son, or any person who will receive it, &amp; leave the receipt &amp; letter.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You see I am in good time, with an Ode<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Ode for St George&#8217;s Day&#8217;,
                  unpublished until <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), III, pp. 258&#8211;262, and written for George IV&#8217;s official
                  birthday on 23 April 1821.</note> which is not good. But it will do. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Shield</ref>
               wrote to me last week, explaining the oporose<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;burdensome&#8217;.</note> nature of his task, &#8211; which
               he says will occupy a laborious transcriber the greater part of a week! I set too therefore without delay. The first half is tolerable,
               &amp; if it were worth while two more stanzas of that strain might be added. The rest is bad enough.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> On farther thought the easier &amp; shorter method seems to be that I should send M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Christians
               letter unsealed, that you may inclose the 18&#163;, &amp; leave it at his shop, without farther trouble.</p>
        <p rend="center"> -----</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I leave the Ode open, not because it is worth looking at, but because you probably will like to look at it. Do not keep
               it more than a day, because in replying to <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Shields</ref> letter, I promised him
                  <del>that</del> he should have it in a week, &amp; that term will be up on Tuesday.</p>
