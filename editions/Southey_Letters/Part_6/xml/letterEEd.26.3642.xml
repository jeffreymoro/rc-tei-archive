               should like to go to Algoa Bay<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Now Port
                  Elizabeth, in South Africa. A party of about 4,500 British settlers had arrived in
                  April 1820, with government sponsorship.</note> if any thing could be got for him,
               I told him I did not know that any thing was to be had except a grant of land, in
               which, probably, interest might be of some use as far as regarded situation; &#8211; &amp;
               perhaps in the first instance employment to take charge of some settlers, if more
               were sent out, which would enable him to look out for himself, &#8211; this being what he
               proposed, to go &amp; make preparations, while <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheySarah">Sarah</ref> could live upon her own
               means, &amp; upon Miss Wilbrahams payments.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Tom Southey&#8217;s lodger, Mary Laetitia Wilbraham (b. 1799), daughter of Randle
                  Wilbraham (1773&#8211;1861) of Rode Hall in Cheshire. She later married Joseph-Harrison
                  Tryer (b. 1797) of Whitley House, Northumberland.</note> We talked about it,
               somewhat vaguely, but on my part so as to encourage him in the only sensible plan he
               can adopt, &amp; the only way which is open to him for securing an independence for
               himself &amp; his children; &amp; he desired me to make inquiry whether there was any
               appointment which could be obtained for him there, or what he might expect. &#8211; I will
               set <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> to feel the way, thro <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref>, &amp; when we know what is

               course you will. It is very well that he ventures to look at his situation fairly,
               &amp; that this thought should have occurred to his own mind, as it has long since
               done to yours &amp; mine.</p>

                  married, she probably passed as his wife. She presumably stopped using his name
                  because their relationship had ended.</note> I know not by what process, nor for
               what good cause, &amp; resuming the name of her father<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Holmes, later Hunter (1751&#8211;1827), of Beoley Hall,
