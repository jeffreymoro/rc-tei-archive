                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler&#8217;s</ref> death, an event which you will probably have learnt before this
               reaches you. <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">My Uncle</ref> is thus relieved from a considerable charge;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Tyler had been a drain on the finances of her half-brother Herbert Hill for many years.</note>
               &amp; from the apprehension which he must have felt of her surviving him. She was in the 82 year of her age. She will be interred
               (tomorrow I suppose) in the burial place of the Hills, where her mother &amp; two of the Tylers are laid, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref> with five of my brothers &amp; sisters. &#8211; <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Long Ashton, Somerset (now a suburb of Bristol), the ancestral home of the Hills and burial place of: Southey&#8217;s
                  maternal grandmother Margaret Hill, n&#233;e Bradford (1710&#8211;1782); William Tyler (1742&#8211;1789) and Edward Tyler (1744&#8211;1786), two of her
                  sons by her first marriage to William Tyler (1709&#8211;1747); Southey&#8217;s father; and five of Southey&#8217;s siblings who had died in infancy,

        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Her death was, even for herself, to be desired as well as expected. My affection for her had been long &amp; justly
               cancelled; I feel no grief therefore, but such an event of necessity presses for a while <del>upon</del> like a weight upon the mind.
               Had it not been for the whim which took her to Lisbon in the year of my birth, you &amp; I should never have known each other, <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncle</ref> would never have seen Portugal,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Herbert Hill had accompanied his half-sister to Portugal in 1774 and had presumably there made the connections that led to him
                  being appointed Chaplain to the British Factory in Oporto in 1777 and to his subsequent career in Portugal for the next thirty
                  years. Hill&#8217;s residence in Portugal led to Southey visiting him in 1795&#8211;1796 and meeting John May.</note> &amp; in how different a
               course would his life, &amp; mine in consequence have run! &#8211; I have known many strange characters in my time, but never so
               extraordinary a one as hers, <del>&amp; hers</del> &lt;which&gt; of course I know intimately. I shall come to it in due course, &#8211; &amp;
               sooner than you may expect from the long intervals between my letters.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Yesterday&#8217;s post brought me also an intimation from my musical colleague <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Shield</ref> that &#8220;<ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">our most gracious &amp; royal Master</ref> intends to command the performance of an Ode at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> James,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">St James&#8217;s Palace, London, the official base of the monarch and the court.</note> on the day fixed for
               the celebration of his birth day.&#8221;<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was required, as Poet Laureate, to commemorate the
                  official birthday of the monarch with an ode, which would be set to music by the Master of the King&#8217;s Musick and performed at court.
                  This custom had been suspended since 1810 due to the illness of George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820;
                     <title>DNB</title>), but Southey had been informed that it had been reinstated by his successor in 1820. It had been decided that
                  George IV would celebrate his official birthday on St George&#8217;s Day, 23 April, apart from years when that fell on a Sunday, when the
                  celebrations would be deferred until Monday 24 April. Southey had therefore written a Birthday Ode for 1820 (the unpublished &#8216;Ten
                  fateful years have passed away&#8217;) and was about to embark upon a second one (&#8216;Ode for St George&#8217;s Day&#8217;, unpublished until
                     <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), III, pp. 258&#8211;262). Neither ode was performed at court and the
                  tradition lapsed.</note> &#8211; Of course therefore my immediate business is to get into harness &amp; work in the mill. Two or three
               precious days will be spent in producing what will be good for nothing; for as for making any thing good of a Birth Day Ode I might as
               well attempt to manufacture silk purses from sows ears. Like Warton, I shall give the poem an historical character, &#8211; but I shall not
               do this so well as Warton; who has done it very well.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Warton (1728&#8211;1790;
                     <title>DNB</title>), one of Southey&#8217;s predecessors as Poet Laureate 1785&#8211;1790. Southey admired Warton&#8217;s efforts to take the
                  annual odes he was required to write for the New Year and the monarch&#8217;s birthday seriously. Here Southey may be thinking of &#8216;Ode on

               of old age before I got breeched in the narrative. But with all my undertaking I proceed faster in proportion as I advance in them.
               Just now I am in the humour for going on, &amp; you will hear from me again sooner than you expect, &#8211; for I shall begin the next letter

               Brazil. Surely he has had time &amp; warning to provide against the storm. &#8211; Wretched as the government was both in Portugal &amp;

               have been raised from the dead, he would have had courage &amp; capacity to have modelled both countries according to the circumstances

               have waited your reply with heroic self-denial.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> We are all tolerably well. I am busy upon the private Memoir which I mentioned in a former letter,<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been paid for writing a &#8216;private Memoir&#8217; of David Pike Watts (1754&#8211;1816), a fabulously rich
                  wine merchant and philanthropist, who had been an important supporter of Andrew Bell&#8217;s educational schemes and owned the Storrs Hall
                  estate on Windermere. He was also the uncle of the painter John Constable (1776&#8211;1837; <title>DNB</title>). The work had been
                  commissioned by Watts&#8217;s daughter and heiress, Mary Watts-Russell (1792&#8211;1840), who had married in 1811 another heir to a business
                  fortune, Jesse Watts-Russell (1786&#8211;1875), MP for Gatton 1820&#8211;1826. Southey had mentioned it to John May on 15 November 1820, Letter
                  3556.</note> &amp; which I hope to finish in the course of a month. The printer proceeds very slowly with the Peninsular War.<note n="17" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832). The printer was Thomas
