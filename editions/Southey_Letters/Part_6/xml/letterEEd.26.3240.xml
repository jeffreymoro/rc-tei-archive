        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I lose no time in replying to your extraordinary letter.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Hamond had written to
                  Southey on 3 February 1819 asking if he would act as his literary executor. </note> &#8211; If as you say, the language of your papers
               would require to be recast, &#8211; it is altogether impossible for me to afford time for such an undertaking. But the style of your letter
               leads me to distrust your opinion upon this point, &#8211; &amp; if the papers are written <del>in as perspicuous</del> with equal
               perspicuity, any change which they might undergo from another hand would be to their injury. It appears therefore to me that they would
               only require selection &amp; arrangement. <del>It would</del>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Now Sir, it so happens, that I have works in preparation of great magnitude &amp; (unless I deceive myself) of
               proportionate importance.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">At this time, primarily Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title>
                  (1810&#8211;1819).</note> And there must be many persons capable of preparing your manuscripts for the press, who have time to spare &amp;
               would be happy in obtaining such an employment. There may possibly also be another reason why another person may better be applied to
               on this occasion. The difference between your opinions &amp; mine might be so great, that I could &lt;not&gt; with satisfaction or propriety,
               become the means of introducing yours to the public. This would be the case if your reasonings tended to confound the distinctions
               between right &amp; wrong, &#8211; or to <del>lessen our hopes of a future state</del> shake the foundations of religious belief. And yet I
               think that if there had been a great gulph between us, you would hardly have thought of making me your editor. Indeed if there had not
               been something in your letter which seems to make it probable that I should feel a lively interest in the transcript of your thoughts
               &amp; feelings, &#8211; my answer would have been brief &amp; incisive. <del>Dxxxxxxxx I cannot xxxxxx it</del>, &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <del>Supposing then that there xxxxxx xxx xxxx difference of opinion</del>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should like to see a specimen of the papers, &#8211; such as might <del>xx</del> enable me to form a judgement of them: &#8211;
                  <del>perhaps I might</del> more than this I cannot say, at present. &#8211; I cannot but admire the temper of your letter. You are looking
               wisely &amp; calmly toward the grave, &#8211; <del>xx</del> allow me to add a fervent <del>xx</del> hope that you may &lt;also&gt; be looking with
               confidence &amp; joy beyond it. </p>
