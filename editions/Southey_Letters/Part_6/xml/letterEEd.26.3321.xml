        <p rend="indent1"> You will wonder perhaps at the direction of the inclosed. It is in reply to a letter about the
					institution at Bailbrook, &#8211; which I have promised to bring before the public in the QR. with a very sincere desire
					of assisting so useful a scheme.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Isabella Lettice King (1772&#8211;1845;
							<title>DNB</title>) founded the Ladies&#8217; Association at Bailbrook House, near Bath, in June 1816. It provided a
						home for orphaned gentlewomen with no income and was duly praised by Southey in his review of Thomas Fosbrooke
						(1770&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), <title>British Monachism; or, Manners and Customs of the Monks and Nuns of
							England</title> (1817), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), 59&#8211;102 (96&#8211;101).</note> &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have given the newspapers a wholesome lesson, tho the gentleman whose name is so carefully
					kept out of them escaped more cheaply than he deserved, &#8211; for as for the defence, &#8211; as the <del>men</del> man said
					about Gullivers Travels, I do not believe above half of it.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">On 15 June 1819
						Wynn had brought to the House of Commons&#8217; attention the reports in <title>The Times</title> for 9 June 1819 of a
						debate in the Commons, which (incorrectly) suggested that Canning had been attacked for &#8216;habitually turning into
						ridicule the sufferings of his fellow creatures&#8217;. The shorthand writer who submitted the report was summoned to
						the House to explain himself and was committed to the custody of the serjeant-at-arms until he was released the
						following day with a reprimand. The name of the reporter was not mentioned in <title>The Times</title>, 15 June
						1819 (probably Southey&#8217;s source of information), but he was John Payne Collier (1789&#8211;1883; <title>DNB</title>).
						His defence was that he had not heard the debate properly and had been given inaccurate information by &#8216;a
						stranger&#8217;. Jonathan Swift&#8217;s (1667&#8211;1745; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Gulliver&#8217;s Travels</title> (1726) was entirely
						fictional.</note> But unless some such checks are given, &amp; the newspaper&#8211;writers made to stand in some fear of
					Parliament, Parliament will very soon stand in fear of them. And so far am I from joining in the praise so
					liberally bestowed upon those gentlemen <del>xxx</del> in general, that I verily believe them to be among the very
					worst members of the community.</p>
