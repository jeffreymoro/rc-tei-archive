        <p rend="indent1"> I am very glad that you have succeeded in obtaining the
                  Professorship.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Wilson had been
                  appointed as Professor of Moral Philosophy and Political Economy at the University
                  of Edinburgh on 19 July 1820, in a bitter and politicised contest against the more
                  suitably qualified Whig candidate, the philosopher Sir William Hamilton
                  (1788&#8211;1856; <title>DNB</title>).</note> You had my best wishes, &amp; wherever an
               opportunity occurred of offering it, my best word;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had written in support of Wilson; see Southey to John
                  Wilson, 21 April 1820, Letter 3469.</note> but these I am well aware could be of
               little avail from a man who mixes very little with the world, &amp; when he goes to
               London, at intervals of two or three years, confines himself as much as possible to
               the circle of his private friends.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My reading has never been directed to metaphysical subjects,
               concerning such subjects therefore, &amp; the authors who have written upon them I
               know nothing more than what one cannot help learning from common books &amp; common
               conversation. With regard to moralists the best beyond all doubt will be found among
               those divines, speaking of whom the late King said &#8216;there were Giants upon the earth
               in those days.&#8221;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A paraphrase of
                     <title>Genesis</title> 4: 4 attributed to George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great
                  Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>); see Joseph Taylor (1761/2&#8211;1844),

                     Majesty George the Third</title> (London, 1820), p. 87: &#8216;His Majesty was
                  accustomed after hearing a sermon, to walk and discourse with the preacher. On
                  such an occasion speaking to a fashionable preacher, he asked him whether he had
                  read Bishops, Andrews, Sanderson, Sherlock, &amp;c. The pigmy divine replied, &#8220;No,
                  please your Majesty, my reading is all modern. The writers, of whom your Majesty
                  speaks, are now obsolete; though I doubt not they might have been very well for
                  those days.&#8221; &#8211; The King, turning upon his heel, rejoined with pointed emphasis,
                  &#8220;There were giants on earth in <hi rend="ital">those</hi> days.&#8221;&#8217; </note> Ethics
               have never been treated with more force &amp; ability than in the English pulpit.
