        <p rend="indent1"> I have deferred writing from day to day, in expectation of seeing your re&#8211;election announced; but
					the first tidings of it, is by your frank this day received.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn was (as
						usual) returned unopposed for Montgomeryshire on 17 March 1820 in the general election.</note> &#8211; If your
					brother-in&#8211;laws disease was what I supposed mine to be, death would necessarily have been instantaneous.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Cunliffe (d. 1820), the youngest brother of Wynn&#8217;s wife, had died suddenly on
						22 March 1820, while a student at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1799&#8211;1800 Southey had feared he was suffering from
						heart disease.</note> Adh&#230;sions, I believe, always produce a lingering disease, &amp; kill the sufferer
					piecemeal.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My departure has been delayed by various causes, among which a certain degree of indolence, &amp;
					a certain propensity to be doing <hi rend="ital">something else</hi> (as Peter says)<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Gibson Lockhart, <title>Peter&#8217;s Letters to his Kinsfolk</title>, 3 vols (Edinburgh, 1819), I,
						p. 35, no. 2223 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> have had their share. It is necessary to
					reprint the first vol. of my Brazil<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of the first volume
						only of the <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819) was published in 1822.</note> to make up 170 sets, which
					would otherwise be lost. I have been correcting it, from materials which have come either to hand or to light,
					since its publication; &amp; am still at this work. Cogent reasons render it necessary that I should prepare some
					thing for the QR.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of <title>The Works of the Reverend

					depart. And I have wasted much time upon this unlucky Carmen Funebre,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), on the death of George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain

					which remains unfinished, tho in a fair way of being soon compleated. But whether I shall publish it is rather a
					matter of doubt; upon which I care little or nothing myself, &amp; am therefore in a good state for following
					advice. The objections <del>t</del> are that it will be a day after the fair, &#8211; &amp; possibly, (which is
						<del>xxxxx</del> of more weight) that the subject is too solemn to be treated of in a strain of fiction, however
					solemn the strain. When I suspect that such an objection is likely to be made, that very suspicion seems to prove
					that there would be grounds for it. With regard to the <del>measure</del> &lt;metre&gt;, I have certainly, in my own
					judgement, succeeded; &amp; produced a measure of great variety &amp; power, &amp; beauty.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My present purpose is to begin my journey on Monday 17 April, &amp; if I effect this I shall have
					a chance of seeing you if it be only for a day; but even one whole day at Llangedwin would be worth all the
					fragments which there is a chance of getting in the broken &amp; bustling society of London. Let us see &#8211; the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to Liverpool, 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to Chester &amp; as much farther as the opportunity of
					stages may permit. On the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> I could reach you, &amp; this I should like particularly to do,
					for the sake of seeing the children,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The Wynns had a growing family of five

							Tyler</title> (1817). He had delivered a legal opinion on John Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex
						will, which gave Southey some hope of inheriting property at Fitzhead after the death of his third cousin, and
						John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>).</note>

							pass on his estates to his heirs, primarily his half-brother, Mark Somerville, 16th Lord Somerville (1784&#8211;1842),
