            met Southey in Exeter in 1799 and painted him twice. Keenan had been appointed ‘Portrait Painter to Queen Charlotte’ in 1809. </note> was
          for a great many years a subscriber to the Artists Benevolent Fund,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Artists’ Benevolent Fund had
            been founded in 1810. It consisted of two schemes. The Artists’ Annuity Fund was supported by donations from its members, to be used for
            their own relief in sickness or old age; the second scheme was funded by donations from benefactors, and used to support the widows and
            orphans of those who had contributed to the Annuity Fund.</note> (I know not whether I give it <del>xx</del> its right name), but among
          other &amp; heavier faults towards his family, neglected latterly to make his regular payments before he died. He has left a widow &amp; one

            in 1799. Frances Keenan was an artist, too, as was her daughter, Frances Louisa Keenan (1801–1884), wife of Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins
            (1807–1894; <title>DNB</title>). Both were visiting Southey at this time.</note> The Life Assurance Offices, I believe, on such an
          occasion, act liberally, &amp; return the sum which had been paid in, to the persons whose interest has been thus sacrificed by neglect or
          inability. May I intreat you to inquire if any thing can be recovered in this instance? The widow is a person for whom I have the highest
