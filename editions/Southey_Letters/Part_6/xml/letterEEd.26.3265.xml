        <p rend="indent1"> Lying-in in out-of-the-way places is at this time so common in this country, that I think we have a chance of hearing
               from you, almost as soon as of seeing <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Mr Edmondson</ref>: &amp; therefore I write to say
               that <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is crippled with a swoln leg; <del>xxx</del> it is pretty much at ease
               in bed or on the sofa, but she cannot walk except by dragging the foot, &amp; that with much pain. About a week after the delivery she
               had great pain in the left leg, &#8211; the effect of exertion during a ten hours severe labour, this went off in three or four day, the
               affection then began in the other leg, &amp; has now taken this oedematous form.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The leg had
                  swollen through an accumulation of water.</note> Two days ago <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> sent
                  <del>xx</del> a linement of camphor, turpentine &amp; I know not what, &#8211; since that time we have not seen him, &amp; the swelling
               has increased &amp; become more decidedly oedematous. Her general health is good, nor is there any thing to complain of in any other
               respect. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I may also report to you, as perhaps you may not have met with a similar instance, the case of young <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Irontripes</ref>. He began by regular motions every 24 hours, but chusing when he about
               10 days old to stop for 36 it was then thought proper to give him some castor oil &#8211; which remained in him 12 hours more &#8211; &amp; then
               produced two motions, &#8211; but without any appearance of induration<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Hardening.</note> in the feces.
               He then stopt for 48 hours more. I was very unwilling to physic him, seeing him to all appearance perfectly well, comfortable, &amp;
               thriving. And luckily I bethought me that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Underwoods book was in the house.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Michael Underwood (1737&#8211;1820), <title>On the Diseases of Children</title> (1805), no. 2928 in the sale catalogue of
                  Southey&#8217;s library.</note> There I found, what medical books <del>xxx</del> very seldom can give, facts &amp; opinions which set me
               quite at ease, &#8211; &amp; upon his directions a dry clister was applied which produced immediately a perfectly <del>soft</del> healthy
               stool. And in this way he goes on, &#8211; only that we do not wait beyond from 24 to 30 hours. Meantime he eats, takes the breast like a
               sucking lion, &amp; sleeps, &#8211; &amp; seems to have the limbs &amp; fibre of a young Sampson.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Samson, a famously strong figure in <title>Judges</title> 13&#8211;16.</note> The suppository which we apply is a roll of blotting paper
               dipt in honey &amp; soap. He does not object to the operation, &amp; performs without delay or difficulty, &#8211; but I shall be glad when
               he grows less lazy in his negociations. <del>&amp; in</del>
