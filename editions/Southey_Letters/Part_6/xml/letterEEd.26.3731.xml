               thanks to the exertions of the female favourite,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham
                  (1769&#8211;1861; <title>DNB</title>), George IV&#8217;s mistress from 1819. Her demands that the government employ her friends and relatives
                  was causing some strain between George IV and his Cabinet.</note> that it is scarcely possible a compleat change can be avoided.
               &#8220;For my own part, he adds, I doubt extremely, whether if one had the power of picking an Administration from all parties, one could
               form any of sufficient strength in the H. Commons, to resist the greatest danger of the present time, &#8211; I mean the disposition of that

                     1819</title>, ed. Charles Harold Herford (1929). Nash had accompanied Southey on his continental tour of May&#8211;August 1817, but
                  Southey&#8217;s journal of this trip was never published.</note> It calls up pleasant recollections, &#8211; &#8211; &amp; the death of my poor little

                  miles from Penshurst) during his prolonged stay in the south-east of England. His youthful visit is unrecorded, but might have
