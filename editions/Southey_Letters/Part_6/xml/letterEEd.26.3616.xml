                  1784–1822), merchant and banker, and MP for Wootton Bassett 1812–1813, to whom she
                  was not married, though she probably passed as his wife; John Attersoll had

               poeta favouri, &amp; by her persuasions the Chevalier has traduced Roderick in
               French. – This is not all, – there is a part of the business which is so truly
               booksellerish in general &amp; French in particular that it would be a sin to
               withhold it from you – &amp; you shall it in the very words of my correspondent <ref type="m" target="people.html#AttersollAnn">S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               sanction such an impertinence. But the fact is this. The printer &amp; publisher M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Le Bel<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Jacques-Auguste Lebel (1781–1825), printer and publisher, based at

               are men of much greater importance here than they are in England) insisted upon
               having the life. He said the French know nothing of M. Southey &amp; in order to make
               the work sell it must be managed to interest them for the Author. To get rid of his
               importunities we said we were not acquainted with the life of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               Southey. Would you believe it? this was verbatim his answer. “N’importe! Ecrivez
               toujours, broder! broder un peu, que ce soit vrai ou non ce n’y fait <del>xxxx</del>
               rien: qui prendra la peine de s’en informer?”<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">‘It doesn’t matter! write always, embellish! embellish a little whether it is

               I at last yielded: &amp; sent to London to procure <hi rend="ital">all the

               Richard Brinsley Sheridan, we drew up the memoir.”</p><p rend="indent1"> Grosvenor, whoever writes my life when the subject has an end as well
               as a beginning, &amp; does not insert this biographical anecdote in it, may certainly
               expect that I will pull his ears in a true dream &amp; call him beast &amp; jack
               ass.</p><p rend="indent1"> The Notice sur M. Southey which has <del>thx</del> been thus
               compounded has <del>xxxx</del> &lt;scarcely&gt; one single point accurately stated, – as
               you may suppose, &amp; not a few which are ridiculously false. N’importe as M. Le Bel
               says. I have laughed heartily at the whole transaction, &amp; bear the translation
               with a magnanimity which would excite the astonishment &amp; envy of <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> if he were here
               to witness it. I have even gone beyond the Quaker principle of bearing injuries
               meekly. I have written to thank the inflictor. Happily it is in prose &amp; the
               Chevalier has intended to be faithful, &amp; has I believe actually abstained from
               any interpolations. But, – did you ever hear me mention a fact worthy of notice which
               I observed myself, – that wherever a breed of peacocks is spoiled by mixture with a
               white one, birds that escape the degeneracy in every other part of their plumage show
               it in the <hi rend="ital">eye</hi> of the feather, – the fact is very curious, where
               the perfection of natures work is required, there it fails. <del>Xxxx</del> This
               affords an excellent illustration for the version now before me, – every where the
               eye of the feather is defective. It would be impossible more fully to exemplify how
               compleatly a man may understand the general meaning of a passage, &amp; totally miss
               its peculiar force &amp; character.</p><p rend="indent1"> The name of M. Bedford appears in the <hi rend="ital">Notice</hi>,
