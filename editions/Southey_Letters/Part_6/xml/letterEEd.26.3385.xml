						protest at the local authorities&#8217; actions and send an Address to the Prince Regent. Southey drew up a conservative
						response &#8211; an Address to the Prince Regent denouncing the radicals and calling for curbs on the press. He sent a
						copy to Peachy on 15 October 1819, Letter 3365.</note> at the end of the Rejected Addresses.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Horace Smith (1779&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>) and James Smith (1775&#8211;1839;

						of unsuccessful submissions for the &#163;50 prize awarded for the best address to be recited on the opening night of
						the new Drury Lane Theatre. The book was actually a skilful pastiche of the styles of leading writers, including
						Southey.</note> One of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wallace&#8217;s<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Wallace

						inherited Carleton Hall, near Penrith.</note> composing was substituted in its place, as being thought more in

						The new Address was notably circumspect in its reference to events at &#8216;Peterloo&#8217;.</note> If I could have obtained
					a copy in time I should certainly have sent it to you, but as that was not the case, I knew you would not think it
					fitting that a Loyal Declaration from the County of Cumberland should go without your name to it, &amp; therefore I
					desired it might be set down, &#8211; a liberty which of course I should not have taken on any other occasion. &#8211;
					Altogether it is an odd story. While M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wallace occasioned the first Address to be laid aside

						21 October 1819 to protest against the authorities&#8217; actions at the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; meeting. Brougham was present, and
						read out and denounced the rival pro-government Loyal Address for Cumberland which Southey had written (though
						Brougham was unaware of its author). Brougham remarked that the Address &#8216;is very long indeed, and extremely dull&#8217;,

						fellow governors of St Bees School, near Whitehaven. The House of Commons Select Committee on the Education of the
						Poor, chaired by Brougham, had taken evidence which had raised some embarrassing issues about how the School was
						run, including the fact that valuable mining rights belonging to St Bees had been leased to the Lowther family in
						1742 for 867 years and at a rent of only &#163;3 10 shillings per annum, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 21&#8211;23

						his mother Mary Cannon (1678&#8211;1738). On his death, John Cannon Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which
						named Somerville as his primary heir, and, if he produced no heirs, Southey&#8217;s father and two uncles as residuary
						legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three Southey brothers only Southey&#8217;s father
