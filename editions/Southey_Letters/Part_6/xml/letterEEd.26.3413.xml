               search the register at Wellington<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  parish register at Wellington, Somerset, the home of Southey&#8217;s ancestors in the
                  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</note> as soon as the frost breaks, &amp; if
               her authority may be trusted, I am beyond all question heir at law to Cannon
                  Southey.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey Somerville, 15th
                  Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>), agricultural reformer and third
                  cousin of Southey, had died on 5 October 1819. This produced a further round of
                  legal tangles over the Fitzhead estate in Somerset that Somerville had inherited
                  from his great-uncle John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). On his death, John Cannon
                  Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville his primary
                  heir and, should he die without heirs, Southey&#8217;s father and two uncles as the
                  residuary legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three
                  Southey brothers only Southey&#8217;s father married, leading the poet (encouraged by
                  his Aunt Mary) to believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that
                  he and his brothers were now the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate. Southey
                  was the heir at law of John Cannon Southey, i.e. he was entitled to inherit his
                  real property if he was intestate. However, this did not help Southey&#8217;s claim on
                  the Fitzhead property. </note> &#8220;I know (these are her words) that my great

                  property, a situation that was recorded in the court rolls of the local manor. The

                  the Manor for his only son, Richard (1779&#8211;1858). He had also, under the copyhold

                  Fitzhead estate. The Beadons went on to consolidate their holdings in the area,
                  when in 1824 Richard Beadon (the Bishop&#8217;s son) bought the Somerville (formerly
                  Cannon Southey) lands in Milverton and Wivelscombe, including Preston farm. These
                  were the fourth item in Mary Southey&#8217;s list of properties, and the most valuable.
