        <p rend="indent1"> Tho I am more than usually busy at this time (otherwise your former
               letter would not have lain unnoticed so long) &#8211; I feel myself bound to assure you,
               without delay, that the paragraph which you have transmitted to me from I know not
               what Magazine, has surprized me quite as much as it can have done you. There is not
               the slightest foundation for it, nor can I guess how such a notion should have
                  arisen.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>London Magazine</title>,
                  3 (January 1821), 68: &#8216;We understand that Mr. Southey is making preparations for a
                  History of the Quakers, but that those pacific folks are not, at present, very
                  forward in yielding to the wishes which the learned historian has expressed, of
                  seeing the various documents in England belonging to the sect.&#8217;</note> So far is
               it from being true, that offers of assistance in the way of documents have been made
               me by several of the Society,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Society

               afford. M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Fry offered me access to some manuscript collections

                     <title>DNB</title>). She had visited Southey in 1820 and when she failed in
                  dissuading him from writing a life of George Fox, she offered him access to
                  sources for the book; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 27 October 1820,
                  Letter 3544.</note> &#8211; &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilkinsonThomas">Thomas Wilkinson</ref> (of whom you cannot think with more respect than I do)

        <p rend="indent1"> I can only account for the paragraph by supposing the Editor,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Scott (1784&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>),

                  (1639&#8211;1714; <title>DNB</title>). It is not clear from whom Southey had acquired

                  various gratification&#8217; (p. vi)) and had an epigraph from the latter&#8217;s
                     <title>Madoc</title> (1805).</note> How came the prejudice against verse to
               arise among the Quakers, when so may of the primitive Quakers wrote verses
               themselves? miserably bad ones they were, but still they were intended for
               poetry.</p>

                  volume published in 1820, was praised as welcome evidence that Quakers were
                  turning to the composition of verse; see <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 34
                  (November 1820), 348&#8211;357.</note> &amp; one motive may be a wish to make amends to
               the Quakers for some gratuitous impertinence which he formerly offered them, when the
               E. R. was not so decidedly the instrument of a party as it is now.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The offensive article was possibly the notice of

                  swipes, described George Fox as &#8216;exceedingly insane&#8217; (101).</note> It is long been
               the system of that party to flatter the dissenters, of every denomination. But
               whatever his motives may be, I shall be glad if he is of service to you, &amp; if he
               promotes the very useful object at which you are aiming, &amp; in which you will
               certainly succeed.</p>

                  nothing alarming in its size, being but a short poem, printed in quarto because no
                  other page would hold the lines. To explain what you might else be puzzled how to
                  understand, I will <del>xx</del> inform you that it is written in English
                  hexameters an experiment which will probably occasion some variety of opinions
                  &amp; very probably some ridicule. But I have the best &amp; highest authorities
                  for saying that it has succeeded. Nor shall I, on such a question, affect to
                  undervalue my own opinion, which on a point of metre, I take to be as good as that
                  of a Judge upon a point of Law.</p>
