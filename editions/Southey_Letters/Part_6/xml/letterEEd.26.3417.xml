        <p rend="indent1"> I have seen that precious production of <ref type="m" target="people.html#HoneWilliam">Hones</ref>.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">William Hone, <title>The Political House that Jack
							Built</title> (1819), a political satire, with illustrations by George Cruikshank (1792&#8211;1878;
						<title>DNB</title>).</note> It is exactly one of those things which ought to be brought before a jury, the
					alternative being <del>x</del> a conviction (which is the least likely) or a <hi rend="ital">reductio ad
						absurdum</hi> of your existing laws &amp; mode of trial, which would be not less serviceable in the present state
					of things, &amp; which I was disposed to wish for in the case of Carlile.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Carlile (1770&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>), radical publisher and newspaper editor, was jailed for three
						years in October 1819 for blasphemy and seditious libel.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your session was useful as having called forth a good display of force on the side of Order.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The House of Commons had passed the &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; in December 1819 to curb radical
						agitation. They included a new Criminal Libel Act.</note> Much more useful it might have been had the Ministers
					known how to use their own power. <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> tells me he did all
					he could to persuade them to send <ref type="m" target="people.html#Burdett">Burdett</ref> to the tower for his
					speech at the meeting about Hobhouse.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cam Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton
						(1786&#8211;1869; <title>DNB</title>), radical and friend of Byron. He was radical and then Whig MP for Westminster
						1820&#8211;1833, Nottingham 1834&#8211;1847, Harwich 1848&#8211;1851. Hobhouse had been arrested on 14 December 1819 and imprisoned
						in Newgate for his pamphlet <title>A Trifling Mistake in Lord Erskine&#8217;s Preface</title> (1819), which was deemed a
						breach of privilege by the House of Commons. He was not released until 28 February 1820. Burdett had condemned
						Hobhouse&#8217;s imprisonment in a speech at the Crown and Anchor Tavern on 16 December 1819; he &#8216;denied the power of
						the House of Commons to erect itself into a tribunal for adjudging cases of libel, and to exercise at the same
						time the functions of accuser, judge, and jury&#8217;, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 17 December 1819.</note> They
					could never have made a more wholesome exertion of authority. I hear that Hobhouse dislikes his lodgings as much as
					one could wish him to do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I expect to leave home about the end of February. At present I am finishing a review of <ref type="m" target="people.html#CoxeWilliam">Coxes</ref> Memoirs of Marlborough, &#8211; that is to say composing from it a
					life which would make a little volume.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of William Coxe,

						(1818&#8211;1819) appeared in <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 23 (May 1820), 1&#8211;73. He did not turn this review into a

					paper written a year ago, which has been returned to me with a desire that I would put in more of the same texture.
					So I shall fit it to the times.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have just finished the introduction to such a book as is wanted, &#8211; a full <del>state of
						the</del> statement of the existing diseases of society, with a view of the consequences &amp;c.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of
							Society</title> (1829).</note> You know how much this has been in my thoughts, &amp; I think I have chosen a good
					form for rendering it more effectual &amp; more attractive than if it appeared as a direct political essay. The
					plan was suggested by Boethius,<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s model was Anicius Manlius
						Severinus Boethius (c. 480&#8211;525), <title>De Consolatione Philosophiae</title>, a dialogue between the author and
						the character of Lady Philosophy, consisting of both prose and verse.</note> &#8211; which however nobody would
					discover, &amp; the form is dialogue between the writer &amp; Sir Thomas More.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Thomas More (1478&#8211;1535; <title>DNB</title>), Lord Chancellor 1529&#8211;1532 and opponent of the
						Reformation.</note> The introduction ushers in his Ghost as a visitor, &amp; if the rest should be as successfully
					done I shall be well satisfied. He lived in the age of the restoration of letters; &#8211; of the discovery of printing,
					&#8211; &amp; of the Reformation, &#8211; other great changes too had just taken place. In tracing the consequences of these
					things as far as they have hitherto gone, &amp; drawing the parallel between that age &amp; this, a great many home
					truths may be brought into full view. I take for my motto, three words from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Bernard, &#8211; <hi rend="ital">Respice, aspice, prospice</hi>!<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Look to the past, the
						present, the future&#8217;. Attributed to St Bernard of Clairvaux (1090&#8211;1153), these words did appear on the title page
						[unpaginated] of vol. 1 of <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>, 2 vols
						(London, 1829).</note> &amp; upon the text I hope to preach a stirring sermon. &#8211; It will be a series of dialogues
					which I shall endeavour to relieve with a few local descriptions, &#8211; &amp; make as attractive in one way or another
					as I can.</p>

						reformer and third cousin of Southey, had died on 5 October 1819. This produced a further round of legal tangles

						John Cannon Southey (d. 1768).</note> Lord S. dies without issue, &#8211; &amp; I am <del>right</del> heir &lt;at law&gt; to
