                  lost his Fellowship at Oriel College, Oxford, on 30 May 1820, the end of his
                  probationary year, on the grounds of intemperance. John Taylor Coleridge had then
                  forwarded Keble’s letter to Southey, who had to break the news to Hartley’s mother

               marriage, that it covers the disgrace of this sort of expulsion, – it will do this,
