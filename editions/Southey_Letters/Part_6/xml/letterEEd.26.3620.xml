        <p rend="indent1"> I hope you have not delayed sending the Preface for the <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Patres Nostri</ref>, in expectation of
               my answer &lt;with&gt; an amended dedication, for this may be returned with the proof
                  sheet.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of
                     Judgement</title> (London, 1821), &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, pp. [v]&#8211;viii and &#8216;Preface&#8217;, pp.
                  xvii&#8211;xxii. The &#8216;Dedication&#8217; was controversial, not only praising Britain&#8217;s victory
                  in the war against France, but stating: &#8216;The same perfect integrity has been
                  manifested in the whole administration of public affairs&#8217; (vi); not a view the
                  Whig opposition endorsed. However, the earlier draft of the &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, in
                  Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733, shows Southey had intended to go much
                  further and urge that &#8216;adequate remedy should be applied to that intolerable
                  licentiousness of the press &#8230; either by the vigorous application of existing laws
                  or by the enactment of such new ones as the suspension of the abuse may render
                  necessary&#8217;.</note> My present intention is to retain the first &amp; last
               sentences &amp; nothing more. A mere dedication <hi rend="ital">sans phrase</hi>
               would look as if I were afraid of giving <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> that praise
                  <del>th</del> which he deserves, but he certainly is a splendid patron of art, he
               has done for science every thing that has been asked of him, &amp; has shown the same
               disposition towards literature. I have lived long enough to know that praise is the
               best kind of excitement. &#8211; In the other part of the Ded: I suspected an informality,
               but was willing to give it a chance, knowing <del>that then it would be</del> upon
               that point you &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> would decide without fear of error. I shall send a copy for him to
               your care, unless in the mean time you give me a direction to him. &#8211; Did you read the
               Preface? The metre I think is clearly explained to the unlearned &amp; the question
               of its adaptability stated with the utmost fairness. The part about D Juan will make
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">a certain bookseller</ref>
               feel &#8220;unpleasant as a gentleman&#8221;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">While the
                  &#8216;Preface&#8217; to <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London 1821) did not name Byron
                  or his poem, it described the &#8216;publication of a lascivious book&#8217;, which Southey
                  believed <title>Don Juan</title> to be, as &#8216;one of the worst offences which can be
                  committed against the well-being of society&#8217; (p. xviii). It also named and shamed
                  the &#8216;Satanic school&#8217;, of which Byron was, by implication, a leading light (pp.
                  xx&#8211;xxi). Murray was Byron&#8217;s publisher, as well as Southey&#8217;s.</note> &#8211; but I cannot

                  Southey, the difficulties of making a shirt for a centaur, a subject provoked by
                  their reading of Publius Ovidius Naso (43 BC&#8211;AD 17/18),
                     <title>Metamorphoses</title>, Book 9, lines 95&#8211;135, in which the centaur Nessus
                  was killed by the hero Hercules, but a shirt daubed with Nessus&#8217;s blood in turn
                  killed Hercules; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 23 January 1821, Letter

        <p rend="indent1"> The eighth proof of the H of the War is before me. The unhandsome

                  1855), a friend of Bedford&#8217;s, but Murray had insisted on using his regular
