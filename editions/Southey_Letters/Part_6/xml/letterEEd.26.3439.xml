					in the inclosed <del>xxxxxxx</del>, &amp; ask <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> to
					direct it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I can speak now with more certainty about my movements. They must be delayed till the end of
					March instead of the beginning; &amp; if <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynn</ref> be at that
					time (as seems most likely) in Wales, I shall a few days longer on the road. &#8211; He will have given you that <hi rend="ital">elagdrifying</hi> shock which I meant to have administered <del>xxx you</del> myself, in full
					expectation that it would have affected you as much as ever shock of the kind <del>from</del> did Cowling,
						<del>from</del> when the <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">Mag: Rot:</ref> used to charge a large
					phial for his benefit.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">An obscure reference relating to Southey&#8217;s early
						acquaintance with the Bedford family. Possibly a reference to administering electric shocks from a Leyden jar &#8211; a fluid filled phial that was charged by rubbing.</note> I have written about half the poem, &amp; shall probably compleat it
					in the course of a fortnight.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821);
						written in hexameters.</note> The title I suppose must be Carmen Funebre &#8211; A Vision of Death; &#8211; <del>xx</del> a
					Vision of Judgement would be more appropriate, &#8211; but there is no hurry for determining this, as I do not mean to
					have it announced till it is fairly in the press. I know you will think the Devil is in me about the metre, till
					you see it &#8211; but if I know anything about metre, it is a full, stately, solemn measure, suited to the subject,
					&amp; perfectly adapted to our language.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This is one cause of my delay. Now hear what is the other. The first vol. of Brazil is about to
					be reprinted &#8211; to make up the sets which would otherwise be broken, &#8211; about 170 in number.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The second edition of the first volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). It was
						not published until 1822.</note> I take this opportunity of correcting that volume, &amp; inserting matter from
					documents which have come, some to hand &amp; others to light, since it was published. And tho a good deal had
					previously been done, this calls upon me for about a fortnights labour.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> During the whole winter I have been &lt;free&gt; from that infirmity which I began to think had
					taken its place for life.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was suffering from a rectal prolapse; see
						Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 3 October 1819, Letter 3356.</note> This has been Natures own doing; &amp; has
					occurred at a season when I take little or no exercise. Exercise itself may perhaps bring it on again &#8211; or it may
					return when the summer relaxes me, &#8211; for return in all likelihood it will. However the respite is positive good
					while it lasts, &#8211; &amp; there is hope in it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> must have this Carmen &#8211; It will
					barely pay its expences, for the nine days wonder which it will excite, will have no perceptible effect upon the
						sale.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was quite correct. Only 500 copies of <title>A Vision of
							Judgement</title> (1821) were published and there was no second edition.</note> The merit of the composition is
					of more consequence. It will not be found wanting in poetical thoughts or expression; &#8211; nor in eulogy of the proper
					kind, &#8211; both of the living &amp; the dead, &#8211; that which is strictly just.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You never saw a livelier, lovelier, sweeter creature than <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">your godson</ref>. He visits me in this <del>xxxxx</del> room twice a
