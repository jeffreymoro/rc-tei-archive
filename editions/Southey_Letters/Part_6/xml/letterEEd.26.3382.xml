        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the half-bills.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The relationship between myself &amp; Lord Somerville<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey Somerville,
                  15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>), agricultural reformer and third cousin of Southey, had died on 5 October 1819.
                  This produced a further round of legal tangles over the Fitzhead estate in Somerset, which Somerville had inherited. </note> was so
               remote, that I really do not know in what degree of cousinship we stood to each other. But his mother<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Cannon Lethbridge (d. 1765); her mother was Mary Southey (1704&#8211;1789).</note> was of Southey extraction,
               &amp; on that side I was his nearest kinsman. A certain Cannon Southey<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cannon Southey (d.
                  1768); he was Mary Southey&#8217;s older brother and thus the great-uncle of Lord Somerville. John Cannon Southey&#8217;s and Mary Southey&#8217;s
                  mother, Mary Cannon (1678&#8211;1738), was co-heiress of the Fitzhead property.</note> of Fitzhead in Somersetshire bequeathed his estates
               to him in his childhood, as his nearest relation, &amp; <del>xxxx xxxxxx the xxx</del> entailed a part of them in case of his dying
               without issue, upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref> &amp; his two brothers,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Thomas Southey</ref>.</note> &amp; their issue male. The whole estates are about a thousand a year, &#8211; whether the part which is
               entailed be worth contending for is very doubtful. Lord Somerville sold the whole, &#8211; <del>to thex</del> with this part he could not
               possibly convey a good title, unless he had &lt;had&gt; a son of age to join with him in cutting off the entail. My action would be against
               the present tenant, &#8211; his against Lord Ss representatives.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Lord Somerville had died unmarried.
                  His title was inherited by Mark Somerville, 16th Lord Somerville (1784&#8211;1842), a half-brother who was unconnected to the
                  Southeys.</note> I know just enough of the business not to be disappointed if I am advised to let it rest: It was a most miserable
               will, &#8211; never out of Chancery while my two Uncles were living. Lord Erskine had it brought before him, &amp; exclaimed at the name, for
               he remembered it <del>xx</del> when he was young at the bar.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine
                  (1750&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>). As Lord Chancellor 1806&#8211;1807 he had delivered a judgment in the Court of Chancery, on 27 March
                  1807, in the case of Southey <title>v</title>. Lord Somerville, one of many legal actions arising from the fantastically complex and
                  ill-advised will of John Cannon Southey.</note> I have desired <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Osiris</ref>
               to consult with <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref>. &amp; as Turner may advise so I shall do.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the year 1790 or 91 when <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyRobertSnr">my father</ref> was a ruined man, a person
               called upon him, &amp; offered to treat with him for the purchase of his remainder. My father was too angry at the proposal to enquire
               who sent him. He always believed that his children had their chance in the lottery of life, &amp; I believe common opinion in
               Somersetshire has always magnified that chance much beyond its real value; if it be now of any value.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> To myself it is of very little consequence. My habits of labour are so fixed, that whether I wrote for a subsistence or
               not I should be just as deeply engaged in the press, &amp; the only difference would be that I should give up reviewing, &#8211; &amp; become
               perfectly indifferent to the sale of my books as a matter of profit. &#8211; I am older in constitution that in years, &#8211; &amp; older in heart
               than in constitution. And I believe that if it were not for my children I should not bestow even the thought that a mere enquiry
               occasions concerning any worldly inheritance. Six feet by three in the N.W side of <ref type="m" target="places.html#CrosthwaiteChurch">Crosthwaite Churchyard</ref> will be a sufficient estate for me.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">This became the location of
                  Southey&#8217;s grave.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Do not however imagine that I am out of spirits. I <del>xxx</del> &lt;may&gt; live to do good service, &amp; ten years more
               of health &amp; tranquillity would enable me, I dare aver to you, to do more as an historian than has ever been done by any man before
                  me.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Probably a reference to Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the Peninsula War</title> (1823&#8211;1832)
                  and his unfinished &#8216;History of Portugal&#8217;.</note> For I have great plans &amp; great preparations.</p>
