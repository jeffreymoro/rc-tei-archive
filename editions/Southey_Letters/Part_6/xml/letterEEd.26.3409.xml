        <p rend="indent1"> You no doubt can tell me what I have no means of ascertaining here, &#8211; whether &#8220;the noble &amp;
						<hi rend="ital">elect</hi> Lady Huntingdon &#8211; was sister to the Earl of Ferrers who was hanged. She was daughter of
					Washington Earl of Ferrers &amp; born in 1707.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Selina Hastings, Countess of
						Huntingdon (1707&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>), played a prominent role in the evangelical revival and founded her own
						denomination, the &#8216;Countess of Huntingdon&#8217;s Connexion&#8217;. She was the daughter of Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl
						Ferrers (1677&#8211;1729). Laurence Ferrers, 4th Earl Ferrers (1720&#8211;1760; <title>DNB</title>) was hanged for murdering
						his steward; he was the first cousin, rather than the brother, of Selina Hastings.</note> &#8211; A taint of insanity in
					the blood may I think fairly be presumed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am as yet no nearer the mark concerning my chance of a Chancery suit. But this seems clear,
					that if I am heir at law, my claim will be to the whole property, &#8211; if it was not in Lord Somervilles power to cut
					off that claim. It appears by the will that he was christened John Southey, which latter name he always thought
					proper to drop, tho he derived from it his best expectations at the time of his birth.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">John Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex will gave Southey some hope of inheriting
						property at Fitzhead in Somerset, following the death of Southey&#8217;s third cousin, and John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir,
						John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>). Southey was able to establish that
						he was John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir at law, i.e. he was entitled to receive his real property if he was intestate.
						However, this did not help his case.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In reference to the opposition to the scheme of Banishment or Transportation, which is made on
					behalf of the booksellers, an observation of some consequence might be made relative to that trade.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Criminal Libel Act (1819) made banishment the punishment for a second offence and
						anyone breaching that sentence was to be transported for 14 years. The original version of the Bill had made
						transportation for seven years the punishment for a second offence and death the punishment of last resort. A
						petition against the Bill&#8217;s provisions by a group of London booksellers and printers was presented to the House of
						Commons on 15 December 1819.</note> There are rogues in all trades, but I do not know any other trade in which a
					certain number of <del>persons</del> its members are rogues &amp; blackguards by profession, continually on the
					watch to cheat the honourable booksellers by all the tricks of piracy, to deceive the ignorant public by sending
					out books under false names (<ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</ref>, Miss Edgeworths &amp; D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moores have all been used thus)<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Maria Edgeworth
						(1768&#8211;1849; <title>DNB</title>), Irish novelist; Dr John Moore (1729&#8211;1802; <title>DNB</title>), Scottish physician
						and writer.</note> &#8211; &amp; as at this time, living by the sale of obscenity, blasphemy, &amp; treason. Now it is
					not more reasonable for <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> to object to an ignominious punishment being enacted against such
					fellows as these, as it would be for the Lord Chancellor &amp; the Chief Justice to complain of the laws which set
					a knavish attorney in the pillory. As for the danger which they conceive to themselves, no bookseller ought to
					publish any thing of which he doubts whether it be libellous or not, &#8211; for if there be a doubt, it is plain that
					the thing ought not to be published. There is no chance, or possibility I might say, of the law affecting them in
					any other way, than by making them cautious.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The signal for a general insurrection was to be <del>communicated</del> understood by the
					Radicals at Carlisle, if the Manchester Mail did not arrive as usual on a certain day.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Rumours of insurrection were widespread at this time. The <title>Westmorland Gazette</title>, 11
						December 1819, reported of Carlisle: &#8216;It is probable, and indeed a well-known fact, that a considerable number of
						pikes have been introduced into this neighbourhood, from Lancashire, and have been distributed among such deluded
						men as are willing to use them, when occasion offers. A great many young trees have been lately cut down and
						carried away from several neighbouring plantations, for what purpose we leave the reader to guess. Nocturnal
						drilling is also going on with increased activity.&#8217;</note> This was borrowed from the Irish in their
						rebellion.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The Irish rebellion of 1798; the planned signal for the start of
						the revolt was the interception of all the mail coaches from Dublin.</note> The Magistrates were informed of this
					&amp; prepared accordingly, &#8211; fellows enough were on the look out for the mail to evince the truth of the
					information which had been given. &#8211; In such a case as this, a stronger Government would have stopt the mail</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Were you not amused at <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Broughams</ref>
					complaining of misrepresentation? -<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">This comment is rather obscure; it might
						refer to Brougham&#8217;s complaints in the House of Commons on 16 December 1819 about the hostility in the press
						towards those (like him) who believed that Britain was overpopulated and that this was a cause of distress.</note>
					It reminds me of the Devil in an old Dialogue of mine between that Personage &amp; S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Anthony,
					complaining <del>of having been</del> how grievously he was calumniated &amp; how ill he was used by a scandalous
