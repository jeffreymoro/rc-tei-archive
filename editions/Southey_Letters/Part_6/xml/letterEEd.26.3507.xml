          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is no better proof that two fellow-travellers are upon a proper
               understanding with each other, than when they travel together for a good length of
               time in silence, each thinking his own thoughts, and neither of them feeling it
               necessary to open his lips for the sake of politeness. So it is with real friends: I
               have not written to congratulate you on your change of state<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Neville White had married Charlotte Sewell (1799&#8211;1873),
                  daughter of Joseph Sewell (1772&#8211;1844), a wealthy Norwich solicitor, on 12 January
                  1820.</note> till now, because I could not do it at leisure, I would not do it
               hastily, and <hi rend="ital">I knew</hi> that <hi rend="ital">you knew</hi> how
               completely every day, hour, and minute of my time must be occupied in London.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had spent the months of May&#8211;June
                  1820 in London.</note> Never, indeed, was I involved in a more incessant
               succession of wearying and worrying engagements from morning till night, day after
               day, without intermission; here, there, and everywhere, with perpetual changes of
               every kind, except the change of tranquillity and rest. During an absence of nearly
               eleven weeks, I seldom slept more than three nights successively in the same bed. At
               length, God be thanked, I am once more seated by my own fireside &#8211; perhaps it is the
               only fire in <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> at this time;
               but like a cat and a cricket, my habits or my nature have taught me to love a warm
               hearth: so I sit with the windows open, and enjoy at the same time the breath of the
               mountains and the heat of a sea-coal fire.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> And now, my dear Neville, I heartily wish you all that serious,
               sacred, and enduring happiness in marriage which you have proposed to yourself, and
               which, as far as depends upon yourself, you have every human probability of finding,
               and I make no doubt as far as depends upon your consort also. Such drawbacks as are
               inseparable from our present imperfect state, and such griefs as this poor flesh is
               heir to, you must sometimes expect, and will know how to bear. But the highest
               temporal blessings as certainly attend upon a well-regulated and virtuous course of
               conduct now, as they did during the Mosaic dispensation;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In Christian theology a way of referring to the period between
                  the revelation of the Ten Commandments to the Old Testament prophet Moses and the
                  institution of Christianity, when mankind necessarily did not have the opportunity
                  to accept the truth of Christianity but was still required to obey God&#8217;s laws,
                  even without the hope of reward in a future life.</note> for what other blessings
               are comparable to tranquillity of mind, resignation under the afflictive
               dispensations of Providence, faith, hope, and that peace which passeth all
                  understanding?<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Philippians</title> 4: 7.</note> However bitter upon the palate the
               good man&#8217;s cup may be, this is the savour which it leaves: whatever his future may
               be, his happiness depends upon himself, and must be his own work. In this sense, I am
               sure you will be a happy man; may you be a fortunate one also.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had the comfort of finding all my family well, the children
               thoroughly recovered from the measles, though some of them somewhat thinner, and <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">the mother</ref> a good
               deal so, from the anxiety and the fatigue which she had undergone during their
               illness. You hardly yet know how great a blessing it is for a family to have got
               through that disease; one of the passes perilous upon the pilgrimage of life. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref> had
               not forgotten me; five minutes seemed to bring me to his recollection; he is just
               beginning to walk alone, &#8211; a fine, stout, good-humoured creature, with curling hair,
               and eyes full of intelligence. How difficult it is not to build one&#8217;s hopes upon a
               child like this.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am returned to a world of business; enough to intimidate any one of
               less habitual industry, less resolution, or less hopefulness of spirit. My time will
               be sadly interrupted by visitors who, with more or less claims, find their way to me
               during the season from all parts. However, little by little, I shall get on with many
               things; of which the first in point of time will be the long-intended Book of the
                  Church.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Book of
                     the Church</title> (1824).</note> I told you, if I recollect rightly, what the
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#HowleyWilliam">Bishop of
               London</ref> had said to me concerning the Life of Wesley.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and
                     Progress of Methodism</title> (1820). Howley told Southey that &#8216;between the two
                  dangers of seducing people to Methodism by setting its good points in too alluring
                  a light, &amp; of wounding religion by treating its extravagancies &amp; follies
                  with too much levity, I had steered clear with great discretion&#8217;, Southey to Edith
                  Southey [19 May 1820], Letter 3484.</note> You will be glad to hear that <ref type="m" target="people.html#LiverpoolLord">Lord Liverpool</ref> expressed to me
               the same opinion, when I met him at <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Mr. Canning&#8217;s</ref>, and said that it was a book which could not fail of doing a
               great deal of good.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had met Lord
                  Liverpool on 4 June 1820.</note> Had that book been written by a clergyman, it
               would have made his fortune beyond all doubt. But it will do its work better as
               having come from one who could have had no view to preferment, nor any undue bias
               upon his mind. If I live, I shall yet do good service both to the Church and
               State.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My visit to Oxford brought with it feelings of the most opposite
                  kind.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had visited Oxford to
                  receive an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law from the University on 14 June 1820.
                  The degree had been conferred in the Sheldonian Theatre by the University&#8217;s
                  Vice-Chancellor Frodsham Hodson (1770&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>), Principal of
                  Brasenose College 1809&#8211;1822, Vice-Chancellor 1818&#8211;1820, Regius Professor of
                  Divinity 1820&#8211;1822. Southey had been entertained afterwards at Brasenose and then
                  dined at Balliol, where he had been an undergraduate.</note> After the exhibition
               in the theatre, and the collation in Brazenose Hall given by the Vice-Chancellor, I
               went alone into Christ Church walks, where I had not been for six-and-twenty years.
               Of the friends with whom I used to walk there, many (and among them some of the
               dearest) were in their graves. I was then inexperienced, headstrong, and as full of
               errors as of youth and hope and ardour. Through the mercy of God, I have retained the
               whole better part of my nature, and as for the lapse of years, that can never be a
               mournful consideration to one who hopes to be ready for a better world, whenever his
               hour may come. God bless you!</p>
