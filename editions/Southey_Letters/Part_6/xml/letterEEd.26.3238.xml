                     Poem</title> (1818). </note> &#8211; You may rest assured that you have ascribed the condemnation in the Monthly Magazine to the true
                  cause.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Monthly Magazine</title>, 46 (January 1819), 532.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are abundant evidences of power in this volume. Its merits are of the most striking kind, &#8211; &amp; its defects are
               not less striking, both in plan &amp; execution. The stories had better each have been separate, than linked together <del>xx</del>
               without any natural, or necessary connection.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Elliott&#8217;s poem comprised four books linked not by
                  their subject matter but by their relationship to the overarching theme of &#8216;the scenery of night&#8217;, <title>Night, A Descriptive
                     Poem</title> (London, 1818), &#8216;Preface&#8217;, p. [3].</note> The first <del>is</del> consists of such grossly improbable circumstances,
               that it is altogether as incredible as if it were a supernatural tale.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The first book of
                     <title>Night</title>, &#8216;The Lovers&#8217;, tells a gruesome tale of murder, execution and suicide.</note> It is also a hateful story, &#8211;
               presenting nothing but what is painful.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey might have objected to passages such as this
                  description of the murder of Elizabeth (one of the &#8216;Lovers&#8217; of the title): &#8216;She fainted. From her neck the snowy lawn/ Fell to the
                  ground; her virgin breast was bare;/ And on that loveliest breast, with deadliest might,/ His dagger&#8217;s point impressing, thro&#8217; the
                  bone/ He pierc&#8217;d the lungs&#8217;, <title>Night, A Descriptive Poem</title> (London, 1818), p. 23; or this description of the treatment
                  meted out to Elizabeth&#8217;s lover, who is wrongly accused of her murder: &#8216;They rear&#8217;d his gibbet where Eliza died,/ And many a midnight
                  tempest swung his bones.&#8211;/ Doth the Owl like the taste of Felon&#8217;s flesh?/ Why let him feed! he cannot tear the soul&#8217;, <title>Night,
                     A Descriptive Poem</title> (London, 1818), pp. 29&#8211;30.</note> In the second the machinery is preposterously disproportionate to
               the occasion.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The second book of <title>Night</title> was entitled &#8216;Wharncliffe&#8217;. Its
                  supernatural machinery included the fiend Anathema.</note> And in all the poems<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The remaining
                  two books of <title>Night</title> were &#8216;The Canadiad&#8217; and &#8216;Napoleon&#8217;.</note> there is too much ornament, too much effort, too much
               labour. You think you can never embroider your drapery too much, &#8211; &amp; that the more gold &amp; jewels you can fasten on it, the
               richer the effect must be. The consequence is that there is a total want of what painters call breadth &amp; keeping. &amp; therefore
               the effect is lost. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will say that this opinion proceeds from the erroneous system which I have pursued in my own <del>pxxx</del>
               writings, &amp; which has prevented my poems from obtaining the same popularity as those of <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Walter Scott</ref>. &#8211; But look at those poets whose rank is
               established beyond all controversy. Look at the Homeric poems, &#8211; at Virgil, &#8211; Dante, Ariosto, Milton.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is recommending as models the following: Homer&#8217;s <title>The Iliad</title> and <title>The Odyssey</title>;
                  Virgil (70&#8211;19 BC), <title>Aeneid</title>; Dante Alighieri (c. 1265&#8211;1321), <title>Divine Comedy</title> (1308&#8211;1321); Ludovico Ariosto
                  (1474&#8211;1533), <title>Orlando Furioso</title> (1532); and John Milton (1608&#8211;1674; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Paradise Lost</title>
                  (1667).</note> &#8211; Do not ask yourself what are the causes of the failure or success of your contemporaries, &#8211; their failure or
               success is not determined yet, &#8211; a generation, &#8211; an age, &#8211; a century will not suffice to determine it. But see what it is by which
               those poets have rendered themselves immortal, who<del>se</del> after the lapse of centuries are living &amp; acting upon &lt;us&gt; still. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I should not speak to you thus plainly of your fault, &#8211; the sin by which the Angels fell<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Ambition; as in <title>Henry VIII</title>, Act 3, scene 2, line 14.</note> &#8211; if it were not for the great powers
               which are thus <del>squandered</del> injured by misdirection. And it <del>was</del> &lt;is&gt; for the sake of bearing testimony to those
               powers, &amp; thereby endeavouring to lessen the effect which <del>the</del> &lt;a&gt; rascally criticism <del>which you have undergone</del>
               may have produced <del>you</del> upon your feelings that I am now writing. That criticism may give you pain <del>if it produces
                  any</del> &lt;because it may&gt; effect <del>upon</del> the minds of persons not very capable of forming an opinion for themselves, &amp;
               who may either be glad to be encouraged in despising your production; or grieved at seeing it condemned. But in any other point of view
               it is unworthy of a moments thought. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You may do great things if you will cease to attempt so much; &#8211; if you will learn to proportion your figures to your
