						associate of George Canning. The tone of Mulock&#8217;s lectures is encapsulated by Thomas Moore, who was in Paris at
						the time they were given. On discovering that he &#8216;was to be one of the victims of &#8230; [Mulock&#8217;s] tomahawk&#8217;, Moore
						put off his proposed attendance at them until a later day; <title>The Journal of Thomas Moore</title>, eds Wilfred
						Sellars Dowden, Barbara Bartholomew, and Joy L. Linsley, 2 vols (East Brunswick, N.J., 1983), I, p. 367. Moore had
						earlier described Mulock as &#8216;a pedantic young Irishman, and a mighty genius in his own estimation&#8217; (I, p. 63).
						Mulock found ungodliness in everywhere and in everyone. On his return to England in 1821 he became a dissenting
						preacher in Staffordshire and, in later life, was confined as a lunatic on several occasions.</note> &amp; who
					falls foul of me <del>because he</del> not so much because I am a bad poet (which he holds me to be), but because I
