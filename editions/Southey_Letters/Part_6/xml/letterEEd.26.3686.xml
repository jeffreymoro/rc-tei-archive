               surrounded with Memoirs of that age. Among other books I have been reading the
               &#917;&#953;&#954;&#969;&#957; &#914;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#953;&#954;&#947; <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Royal Portrait&#8217;; i.e. <title>Eikon

                     Sufferings </title>(1649), a spiritual autobiography, attributed to Charles I
                  (1600&#8211;1649; King of Great Britain 1625&#8211;1649; <title>DNB</title>). A copy was no.
                  987 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> which never fell in my way
               before. The evidence concerning its authenticity is more curiously balanced, than in
               any other case, &#8211; except perhaps that of the two Alexander Cunninghams:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander Cunningham (1655&#8211;1737;
                     <title>DNB</title>) was a Scottish diplomat and spy, whose <title>The History
                     of Great Britain from the Revolution in 1688 to the Accession of George
                     I</title> (1787) was an important source for its time. The book&#8217;s editor,
                  William Thomson (1746&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>), argued that its author was
                  actually Alexander Cunningham (c. 1655&#8211;1730; <title>DNB</title>), Professor of
                  Civil Law at the University of Edinburgh 1698&#8211;1710 and classical scholar.</note>
               but the internal evidence is strongly in its favour, &amp; I very much doubt whether
               any man could have written it <del>as a</del> in a fictitious character, the
               character is so perfectly observed. If it be genuine, &#8211; (which I believe it to be as
               much as one can believe the authenticity of any thing which has been boldly impugned)
               it is one of the most interesting books connected with English history.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been reading also Hobbes&#8217;s Behemoth.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Hobbes (1588&#8211;1679; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Behemoth:
                     the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars in England, and of the Counsels and
                     Artifices by which they were Carried on from the Year 1640 to 1660</title>
                  (1681). Southey compared it unfavourably to Hobbes&#8217;s <title>Leviathan</title>
                  (1651), no. 1423 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> It is worth
               reading, but has less of his characteristic strength &amp; felicity of thought &amp;
               expression than the Leviathan. There is one great point on which he dwells with
               unanswerable wisdom, &#8211; the necessity that <del>the direction of</del> public opinion
               should be directed by Government by means of education &amp; public instruction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The course of the Revolution in Portugal &amp; Brazil<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Porto on 24 August 1820 had
                  established a junta to run the country; it declared its intention of organising
                  elections to a Cortes, which were held in December 1820, and demanded John VI
                  (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826) return from Brazil, where the Portuguese
                  court had fled in 1807&#8211;1808. The King reached Portugal on 3 July 1821. It was
                  feared in Brazil that his return would signal an attempt to put Brazil firmly
                  under Portuguese control and this led directly to the separation of the two
                  countries in 1822. But Brazil did not disintegrate.</note> will be to separate the
               two countries, &amp; then, I fear, to break up Brazil into as many separate states as
               there are great Captaincies, these again to be subdivided, among as many Chieftains
               as can raise ruffians enough to be called an army. There is <del>some</del> however
               some check to this in the fear of the Negroes which may reasonably exist in great
               part of the country. This mischief has been brought about by Portugueze journals
               printed in London since the year 1808, &#8211; &amp; directed always to this end.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Especially <title>Correio
                     Braziliense</title> (1808&#8211;1822), a liberal Portuguese journal published in
                  London, no. 3203 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library; and <title>O
                     Portuguez</title> (1814&#8211;1822), which was more radical.</note>
