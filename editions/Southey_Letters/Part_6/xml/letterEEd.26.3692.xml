        <p rend="indent1"> If my presentation list for the Vision<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of
							Judgement</title> (1821).</note> had not been of a most formidable length, I should have put <ref type="m" target="people.html#CunninghamAllan">Cunninghams</ref> name upon it &#8211; it was at my pens point, but I took the
					prudential side, &amp; when I do that, which is not very often, it is generally repented of, as is in the present
					case &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I always spell Judgement with an <hi rend="ital">e</hi>, as I do acknowl<hi rend="ital">edg</hi>ement &#8211; <hi rend="ital">dgm</hi> being unpronounceable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I read all my proof sheets <del>xxxxx</del> twice aloud, &#8211; once on the day when they arrive &amp;
					a second time on the morrow, &#8211; except the proofs for the QR.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Quarterly Review</title>.</note> which require more breath than I can afford. I weight every section upon
					the ear, &amp; take especial care as far as possible to avoid all ambiguity of language, which our pronouns
					sometimes render very difficult. The passage to which you allude I cannot of course refer to, but I dare say the
					Prince means Ferdinand, because it is not likely that I should distinguish Godoy by that appellation in a sentence
					or paragraph which related to both.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A passage in Southey&#8217;s <title>History of
							the Peninsular War</title> (1823&#8211;1832), concerning Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808, 1813&#8211;1833),
						Prince of Asturias, as heir to the throne 1789&#8211;1808; and Manuel Godoy y Alvarez de Faria, Prince of the Peace
						(1767&#8211;1851), Prime Minister of Spain 1792&#8211;1798.</note> The 26 sheet is now before me, &amp; I sent off a supply of
					MSS last night. &#8211; I am very glad you like it as far as it goes. The migration of the Braganza family, the situation
					of Lisbon under Junots tyranny, &amp; the account of the Sebastianistas in the same chapter, are subjects which it
					would require some skill in bad writing to have spoilt in the telling.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The
						flight of the Portuguese court from Lisbon to Brazil following the French invasion in November 1807; Jean-Andoche
						Junot (1771&#8211;1813), who commanded the French Army in Portugal 1807&#8211;1808; and Sebastianism, a millennial movement in
						Portugal that looked to the return of Sebastian I (1554&#8211;1578; King of Portugal 1557&#8211;1578). These events were dealt
						with in Chapter 2, <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp.
					85&#8211;148.</note>

						(July 1821), 279&#8211;347.</note> concerning which you may do some service if you will tell <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> that I had better keep it till the whole is before me, because I
					perceive a certain Thomas Cromwell has just published a book about his ancestor, which should be sent me without
					delay, that I may notice it, if it be of no other use.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Cromwell

        <p rend="indent1"> Aguirre will make an interesting little volume, the 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> which I shall have

							Highness the Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, and His Majesty the King of

						34 volumes in duodecimo format.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It did not occur to me in my last to ask if you had paid <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Sharon Turner</ref> the expences incurred in consequence of Lord Somervilles

					me his own time &amp; services. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">The Dogstar</ref> has also
					some demands upon you for <del>xxx</del> sundries expended on my account. &#8211; inter alia, a very magnificent <hi rend="ital">montero</hi>,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">A Spanish hunter&#8217;s cap, round in shape, with ear flaps.</note> which I am now sporting.</p>
