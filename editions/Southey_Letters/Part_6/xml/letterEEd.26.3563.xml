        <p rend="indent1"> We have two things to calculate upon with perfect certainty, &#8211; the
               utmost imbecillity in Government, &amp; the utmost audacity in its assailants.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to the controversy around
                  Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), estranged wife of George
                  IV. He had pressurised his Cabinet into preparing a Bill of Pains and Penalties to
                  dissolve their marriage and deprive her of the title of Queen. She had rejected
                  the compromise terms offered by the Cabinet and had arrived in England on 5 June
                  1820. The House of Lords had begun to debate the Bill on 17 August, and what was
                  effectively a trial of Caroline for adultery had continued until 10 November, when
                  the Bill passed by only nine votes. Given the narrowness of the majority, there
                  was no hope the Bill could pass the House of Commons and the Prime Minister, the
                  Earl of Liverpool, had immediately announced its withdrawal. Radicals celebrated
                  throughout the United Kingdom.</note> That audacity however may occasion its own
               defeat, as our troops have ere this run their heads against a stone wall. Is it
               possible that ministers could suppose the business of this cursed woman would rest
               where they have left it? If they did, they must by this time I think be undeceived,
               &amp; clearly perceive that the Anarchists are determined to strike while the iron is
               hot, &amp; bring on a crisis with her help, &amp; under cover of her cause. &#8211; You
               will have warm work in Pandemonium when it meets.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The capital of Hell in John Milton (1608&#8211;1674;
                     <title>DNB</title>), <title>Paradise Lost</title> (1667) and Southey&#8217;s term for
                  the House of Commons. Following the withdrawal of the Bill of Pains and Penalties,
                  the government had immediately suspended parliament until 23 January 1821.</note>
               But the chapter of accidents must contain <del>xx</del> some good chances as well as
               evil ones. The mob as they are won with a feather are lost with a straw,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">As in the proverb &#8216;A friend won with a feather can
                  be lost with a straw&#8217;.</note> &#8211; the wind of popular opinion may veer who knows not
               why nor how, &amp; in six months, or even six weeks, the Q. &amp; her Aldermen may be
               of as little importance as M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Clarke &amp; Col: Wardle<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Anne Clarke (1776&#8211;1852;
                     <title>DNB</title>) caused a huge political scandal in 1809. She was the
                  mistress of Prince Frederick, Duke of York (1763&#8211;1827; <title>DNB</title>),
                  Commander-in-Chief 1795&#8211;1809, 1811&#8211;1827, and had been taking bribes in return for
                  promising to advance the careers of army officers. Whether the Duke knew about
                  this situation or if it had influenced his decisions was much debated and caused
                  his temporary resignation as Commander-in-Chief. Gwyllym Wardle (c. 1761&#8211;1833), MP
                  for Okehampton 1807&#8211;1812, was foremost in raising the matter in the House of
                  Commons.</note> &#8211;</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My windows were not assailed on the night of the illumination.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">To celebrate the defeat of the Bill of Pains
                  and Penalties, Queen Caroline&#8217;s supporters put candles in the windows of their
                  houses in many towns, including Keswick. The Keswick &#8216;illumination&#8217; was on 15
                  November 1820.</note> Perhaps they escaped by the aid of five or six houses in
               town, which belonged to persons of some authority among the weavers &amp; other
               handicrafts. These persons had declared that they would not light their houses, &amp;
               would defend them if they were attacked. We want a code of Mob Laws to be the Magna
               Charta of Order.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Magna Carta (1215), the
