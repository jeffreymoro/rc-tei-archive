        <p rend="indent1"> I inclose to you my letter of thanks to the Secretary of the
                  Cymmrodorion.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn had a central role
                  in re-founding the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion in 1820 as a society of
                  London-based Welshmen interested in the history of Wales. Southey had been elected
                  a member of the Society. The Secretary was James Evans (dates unknown).</note>
               This is an honour for which I have to thank you. Had it come a little sooner
                  <del>xx</del> it should have appeared in the title page to the Vision,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title>
                  (1821).</note> &#8211; which I hope by this time will have been duly delivered at your
               door.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am by no means agreeably employed at this time, in preparing an ode
               the performance of which <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">his M.</ref> means to
               command on the Birth Day.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been
                  informed that, as Poet Laureate, he would have to write an annual Birthday Ode, as
                  well as a New Year&#8217;s Ode. George IV chose to celebrate his &#8216;official&#8217; birthday on
                  St George&#8217;s Day (23 April), unless it fell on a Sunday, in which case it would be
                  celebrated on 24 April. Southey composed the &#8216;Ode for St George&#8217;s Day&#8217;,
                  unpublished until <title>Poetical Works</title>, 10 vols (London, 1837&#8211;1838), III,
                  pp. 258&#8211;262; it was not performed in 1821.</note> &#8211; I shall keep out of the
               newspapers if possible, &amp; do the best I can by following on Wartons<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Warton (1728&#8211;1790; <title>DNB</title>),
                  Poet Laureate 1785&#8211;1790.</note> path, tho certainly non passibus aquis<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;though not with equal steps&#8217;.</note> for he did

               &#8211; excellently well. However history &amp; antiquity &amp; romance will always supply
               materials for a respectable composition; &#8211; &amp; for the New Year, public events
               &amp; political aspects will afford matter of a different kind.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Tomorrow will finish my task. It is not a pleasant thing to feel that
               thirty years ago I could have written it in fewer minutes than it will now take
               hours.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I wish the Russian Ambassador had complained of <ref type="m" target="people.html#FoxHenryRichard">Ld Hollands</ref> speech, &amp; compelled Ministers to prosecute the
               newspapers for publishing it.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">In a debate
                  in the House of Lords on 19 February 1821, Lord Holland had referred to Alexander
                  I (1777&#8211;1825; Tsar of Russia 1801&#8211;1825) as &#8216;a prince who ascended a throne still
                  reeking with the blood of his father&#8217;. Whether Alexander I was complicit in the
                  assassination of his father, Paul I (1754&#8211;1801; Tsar of Russia 1796&#8211;1801), has
                  been much debated; there is a great deal of circumstantial evidence that he at
                  least knew of the conspiracy, and it was far from unusual for a member of the
                  Romanov dynasty to gain the throne by murdering his predecessor. Prince
                  Christopher Henry von Lieven (1774&#8211;1839) was Russian Ambassador to the United
                  Kingdom 1812&#8211;1834.</note> I believe no check would be so effectual as that of
               prosecuting the libels which are spoken in the house merely for the effect
                  <del>which</del> they will produce when printed</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This is the right time for following up the Catholic claims. If the
               people of England <del>do not object to</del> &lt;have espoused the cause of&gt; Queen
               Caroline, they <del>ought</del> &lt;may be expected&gt; to embrace the Whore of Babylon
               with open arms.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Under extreme pressure
                  from George IV, the Cabinet had reluctantly agreed to introduce a Bill of Pains
                  and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King&#8217;s wife, Caroline of
                  Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>), of the title of Queen and to dissolve
                  her marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820,
                  the government majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill
                  could pass the House of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore
                  announced the Bill would be withdrawn. The Whore of Babylon is mentioned in
                     <title>Revelation</title> 17&#8211;18, and was identified by Protestant theologians
                  with the Catholic Church.</note>
