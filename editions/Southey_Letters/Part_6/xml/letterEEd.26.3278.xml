        <p rend="indent1"> We are going on very badly, one complaint is no sooner removed than
               something worse appears in its place. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> has an abscess forming in the softest part of the thigh,
               close to the anus. I dread the probability of a fistula in consequence, tho <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> assures me there is no danger. But I know that
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> tho an excellent
               practitioner in diseases which occur every day, is not, &amp; cannot be a good
               surgeon. The tumour is scarcely painful, but it increases a dreadful plague of
               h&#230;morrhoids, which there is &lt;no&gt; means of subduing, or even of relieving, &#8211; five
               leeches were applied this morning, &amp; these cursed tubes fill again almost as fast
               as they are emptied: &amp; this allows her no ease in any position. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Of course I am not now writing to ask advice which can be of no use
               at such a distance, &#8211; &amp; in a case which belongs <del>mor</del> to surgery. But
                  <del>xxx</del> her inveterate costiveness must have had some share in producing
               the one malady &amp; perhaps both, &#8211; &amp; in order to relieve this in future by the
               surest &amp; easiest way, I wish you would send me down one of those machines whereby
               she may <del>xxxx</del> operate upon herself, &amp; thus never be deterred from
               obtaining a remedy in time.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">A machine to
                  give patients mild electric shocks.</note> Whatever it costs, <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> will pay you. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God knows how long this illness may continue, or how it may end. The
               only real evil of living in the country is the impossibility of getting the best aid
               in such cases. &#8211; The swelling is now as large as a hens egg, &amp; has no appearance
               of ripening for puncture. It came on rapidly, beginning on Saturday morning, &#8211; but
               now appears to undergo no change. I suppose the leeches, which have been applied to
               the h&#230;morrhoids may have retarded it. </p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">The
               child</ref> is doing well. But unwilling as <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is to hear of weaning it, I
               am sure she must not continue in her <del>debitxxx</del> debilitated state to suckle
               it. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am a good deal disordered by the uneasiness which this occasions. </p>
