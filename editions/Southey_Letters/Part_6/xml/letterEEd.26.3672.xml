        <p rend="indent1"> It is certainly very remarkable that the passage in Peter Martyr
               should have been overlooked.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Peter Martyr
                  d&#8217;Anghiera (1457&#8211;1526), <title>Opus Epistolarum</title> (Amsterdam, 1670), p. 34,
                  no. 1902 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library; a passage which suggests
                  syphilis was known in Europe before the discovery of America in 1492.</note> I
               suppose that persons who were writing upon the subject looked into his Decades,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey also possessed Peter Martyr
                  d&#8217;Anghiera&#8217;s <title>De Rebus Oceanicus et Novo Orbe &#8230; De Babylonicae Legatione &#8230;
                     et &#8230; De Rebus Aethiopicis</title> (1574), an edition of this author&#8217;s
                  &#8216;Decades&#8217;, no. 1811 in the sale catalogue of his library.</note> as relating
               wholly to American affairs, &amp; neglected to search his Epistles, which were indeed
               exceedingly rare till the Elzevirs reprinted them from a copy in the Lamoignon
                  library,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The library of Guillaume de
                  Lamoignon (1617&#8211;1677), French jurist.</note> of which it is said in the Preface
                  <hi rend="ital">quod vix ac ne vix quidem aliunde comparari posset</hi>.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The passage translates as &#8216;it could
                  scarcely, and not even scarcely, be obtained from any other place.&#8217;. Its source is
                  Peter Martyr d&#8217;Anghiera, <title>Opus Epistolarum</title> (Amsterdam, 1670),
                  &#8216;Preface&#8217; [unpaginated]. Southey&#8217;s edition was published by the Dutch booksellers,
                  printers and publishers, Louis Elzevir (1604&#8211;1670) and Daniel Elzevir (1626&#8211;1680).
                  The original edition had been printed at Alcala de Henares, near Madrid, in
                  1530.</note> The original edition is a black letter book printed at Alcala. Men
               investigating the history of the disease were more likely to have recourse to
               histories &amp; memoirs of the wars in Italy, than to a work which relates to the
               affairs in Spain. But tho it may thus be explained why medical authors should not
               have looked for it where it was to be found, it is certainly most remarkable that
               historians, whose business it was to have read these Epistles (important as they are
               in the history of that most important age) should not have noticed a passage so
               decisive upon a very curious &amp; disputed question. Yet I think they must have
               overlooked it, &#8211; for certainly <del>xx</del> it puts an end to all doubt. &#8211; The truth
               is that most historians have contented themselves with <hi rend="ital">referring</hi>
               to many of their authorities, instead of <hi rend="ital">reading </hi>them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I well know how little credit is due to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">Edward S.</ref> It is scarcely
               possible that he should not have known the state of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">his Aunts</ref> affairs &amp;

               limited by the impossibility of contracting more. You had not told me the nature of
               her disease. &#8211; Requiescat in pace. The inscription in its shorter form is just what
               it should be. &#8211; Your mind is relieved from what must have been its most painful

               entailed upon every one. &#8211; With regard to the Quarantine laws, I believe they are
               ridiculously inefficient, &amp; stand greatly in need of revisal, but our wiseacres
               were disposed to listen to a preposterous theory that the plague is not infectious! I
               dined once in company with the great champion of this most absurd &amp; most perilous
               notion, &#8211; a certain D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Adams,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Adams (1756&#8211;1818; <title>DNB</title>), who lived at
                  Madeira 1796&#8211;1805 and was a crucial figure in the promotion of vaccination. In his
                     <title>Inquiry into the Laws of Different Epidemic Diseases</title> (London,
                  1809), pp. 40&#8211;59, he had asserted that plague arose from poor sanitation in
                  towns.</note> who once resided at Madeira; we talked upon the subject, &amp; never
               did I meet with any man who so obstinately bade defiance to logic &amp; common sense
               in his reasonings.</p>

                  school&#8217; of poetry without naming any one poet. This was a response to the first
                  two cantos of Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819), which had been published by
                  Murray. The coruscating and hilarious &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, which attacked Southey and
