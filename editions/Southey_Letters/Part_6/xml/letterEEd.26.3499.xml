        <p rend="indent1"> Bertha, Kate &amp; Bel, you have been very good girls, &amp; have written [MS obscured] I was much pleased. This is the
               last letter which I can write in return; &amp; as I happen to have a quiet hour to myself, here at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Streatham">Streatham</ref>, on Monday noon, I will employ that hour in relating to you the whole history &amp;
               manner of my being Ell-ell-deed at Oxford by the Vice Chancellor.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been awarded an
                  honorary Doctorate of Civil Law at the University of Oxford on 14 June 1820. The Vice-Chancellor at the ceremony was Frodsham Hodson
                  (1770&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>), Principal of Brasenose College 1809&#8211;1822, Vice-Chancellor 1818&#8211;1820, Regius Professor of Divinity
                  1820&#8211;1822.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You must know then that because I had written a great many good books, &amp; more especially the Life of Wesley,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note>
               it was made known to me by the Vice Chancellor, thro <ref type="m" target="people.html#HeberRichard">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
               Heber</ref>, that the University of Oxford, were desirous of showing me the only mark of honour in their power to bestow, which was
               that of making me an L. L. D. that is to say, a Doctor of Laws.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Now you are to know that some persons are ell-ell-deed every year at Oxford at the great annual meeting which is called
               the Commemoration. There are two reasons for this: first that the University may do itself honour, by bringing persons of distinction
               to receive the degree publicly as a mark of honour; &amp; secondly that certain persons in inferior offices may share in the fees paid
               by those upon whom the ceremony of ell-ell-deeing is performed. For the first of these reasons the Emperor Alexander was made a Doctor
               of Laws at Oxford, &amp; the King of Prussia, &amp; old Blucher, &amp; Platoff.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Alexander I
                  (1777&#8211;1825; Emperor of Russia 1801&#8211;1825); Frederick William III (1770&#8211;1840; King of Prussia 1797&#8211;1840); Gebhard Leberecht von
                  Blucher (1742&#8211;1819), Prussian General; and Count Matvei Ivanovich Platov (1751&#8211;1818), Russian General, all received the degree of
                  Doctor of Civil Law at Oxford on 15 June 1814.</note> And for the second, the same degree is conferred upon noblemen, &amp; persons
               of fortune &amp; consideration who are anyways connected with the University or City or County of Oxford.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The ceremony of ell-ell-deeing is performed in a large circular building called the Theatre,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The Sheldonian Theatre (built 1664&#8211;1668), the main centre for ceremonies at the University of Oxford.</note> of which
               I will sh[MS obscured] &amp; this theatre is filled with people. The undergraduates (that is the young men who are called
                  Cathedrals<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Cathedrals&#8217; was the name given in Keswick and its environs to young men from the
                  University of Cambridge who visited the Lakes in study parties. It arose, initially, from a &#8216;comical confusion&#8217; between &#8216;Collegian&#8217;
                  and &#8216;College&#8217;, and, later, between &#8216;College&#8217; and &#8216;Cathedral&#8217;; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, 19&#8211;20 August 1821, Letter
                  3715.</note> at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>) [MS obscured]ely fill the gallery. Under the gallery there
               are seats which are filled with Ladies from all the country round in full dress, separated from the Gentlemen. Between these &lt;two
               divisions of the ladies&gt; are seats for the Heads of Houses &amp; the Doctors of Law, Physic &amp; Divinity. In the middle of these
               seats is the Vice Chancellor, opposite the entrance which is under the orchestra. On the right &amp; left are two kind of pulpits from
               which the prize essays &amp; poems are recited. The area, or middle of the theatre is filled with Batchelors &amp; Masters of Arts,
               &amp; with as many strangers as can obtain admission. Before the steps which lead up to the seats of the Doctors, &amp; directly in
               front of the Vice Chancellor a wooden bar is let down covered with red cloth, &amp; on each side of this the Beadles stand in their
               robes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> When the Theatre is full the Vice Chancellor &amp; the Heads of Houses &amp; the Doctors enter; those persons who are
               to be ell-ell-deed remain without in the Divinity schools<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">A medieval building next door to the
                  Sheldonian Theatre.</note> in their robes; till the Convocation<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Theoretically the governing
                  body of the University of Oxford, consisting of all people with a Master of Arts degree from the University.</note> have signified
               their consent to the ell-ell-deeing, &amp; then they are led into the theatre, one after another in a line, into the middle of the
               area, the people just making a lane for them. The Professor of Civil Law <ref type="m" target="people.html#PhillimoreJoseph">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Phillimore</ref> went before, &amp; made a long speech in Latin, telling the Vice Chancellor and the dignissimi
               Doctores what excellent persons we were who were now to be ell-ell-deed. Then he took us one by one by the hand, &amp; presented each
               in his turn, pronouncing his name aloud, saying who &amp; what he was, &amp; calling him many laudat[MS obscured] to show what [MS
               obscured] we were, each [MS obscured] The <del>xxx xxx</del> audience then [MS obscured] liked the person, [MS obscured] Vice
               Chancellor stood up, &amp; repeating the f[MS obscured] words in issime ell-ell-deed the person, the beadles lifted up the &lt;bar of
               separation,&gt; and the new-made Doctor went up the steps &amp; took his seat among the dignissimi Doctores.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Oh Bertha Kate &amp; Bel if you had seen me that day! I was like the other issimis, drest in a great robe of the finest
