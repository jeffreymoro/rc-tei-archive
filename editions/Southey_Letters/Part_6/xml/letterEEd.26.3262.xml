                  Ticknor, 11 March 1819, Letter 3263.</note> without directing me to yourself by the same post. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A great event has happened to me within this fortnight, &#8211; the birth of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">a child</ref>, &#8211; after an interval of nearly seven years,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Isabel Southey was born on 2 November 1812 and Charles Cuthbert Southey on 24 February 1819.</note> &#8211; &amp; that
               child a son. This was a chance to which I looked rather with dread than with hope, after <del>the loss</del> having seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">the flower of my earthly hopes &amp; happiness</ref> cut down. But it is well that these things
               our not in our own disposal. And without building upon so frail a tenure as an infants life, or indulging in any vain dreams of what
               may be; I am thankful for him, now that he is come. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You would have heard from me ere long, even if <ref type="m" target="people.html#TicknorGeorge">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  Ticknor</ref> had not given a spur to my tardy intentions. I should soon have written to say that you will shortly receive the
               concluding volume of my History of Brazil, &#8211; for I am now drawing fast toward the close of that long labour.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> This volume has less of the kite &amp; crow warfare
               than its predecessors, &amp; is rich in information of various kinds which <del>never</del> has never till now come before the public
               in any shape. Indeed when I think of the materials from which is has been composed, &amp; how compleatly during great part of my course
               I have been without either chart or pilot to direct me, I look back with wonder upon what I have accomplished. &#8211; I go to London in
               about seven weeks from this time, &amp; as soon as I return the peninsular war will be sent to press. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the course of the summer also I shall have to send you my Life of Wesley, &#8211; of which one volume is printed, &amp;
               the other in the press.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of
                     Methodism</title> (1820).</note> I am taking great pains &amp; great pleasure also in this work, which is indeed a history of the
               Rise &amp; Progress of Methodism, &amp; contains oddities of all kinds, &amp; facts from which a psychologist may learn more than from
               all the metaphysical treatises that ever spoilt white paper. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Our successors (for you &amp; I are now old enough in authorship to use this term) are falling into the same faults as
               the Roman poets after the Augustan age, &amp; the Italians after the golden season of their poetry.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Roman poets following the reign of Augustus (63 BC&#8211;AD 14; Emperor of Rome 27 BC&#8211;AD 14); and Italian poets after the
                  time of Dante Alighieri (c. 1265&#8211;1321).</note> They are overlabouring their productions, &amp; overloading them with ornament, so
               that all parts are equally prominent, every where glare &amp; glitter, &amp; no keeping, &amp; no repose. <ref type="m" target="people.html#MilmanHenryHart">Henry Milman</ref> has spoilt his Samor<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Milman&#8217;s epic
                     <title>Samor, Lord of the Bright City</title> (1818).</note> in this way. It is full of power &amp; of beauty, &#8211; but too full of
               them. There is another striking example in a little volume called Night,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Ebenezer Elliott&#8217;s
                     <title>Night, A Descriptive Poem</title> (1818).</note> where some of the most uncouth stories imaginable are told
                  <del>with</del> in a strain of continued tip-toe effort, &amp; you are vexed to see such uncommon talents so oddly applied, &amp;
               such Herculean <del>xx xxx</del> strength wasted in preposterous exertions. The authors name is <ref type="m" target="people.html#ElliottEbenezer">Elliott</ref>, a self-taught man, in business (the iron-trade I believe) at Rotherham. He sends
               play after play to the London theatres, &amp; has always that sort of refusal, which gives him encouragement to try another.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Elliott later claimed to have had five plays rejected: John Watkins, <title>Life, Poetry, and Letters of
                     Ebenezer Elliott, the Corn-Law Rhymer: With an Abstract of His Politics</title> (London, 1850), p. 232.</note> Sheridan said of
               one of them that it was &#8220;a comical tragedy&#8217;<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751&#8211;1816;
                     <title>DNB</title>), manager and owner of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Elliott had possibly quoted Sheridan&#8217;s observation in a
                  letter to Southey. Elliott may have recalled this idea when in 1844 he described &#8216;Taurassdes&#8217;, one of his rejected plays, as &#8216;a
                  comical joke for a tragedy&#8217;, John Watkins, <title>Life, Poetry, and Letters of Ebenezer Elliott, the Corn-Law Rhymer: With an
                     Abstract of His Politics</title> (London, 1850), p. 233.</note> &#8211; but he did not know any man who could have written such a one.&#8217;
               I have given him good advice, which he takes as it is meant, &#8211; &amp; something may come of him yet.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Ebenezer Elliott, 30 January 1819, Letter 3238.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It was reported that you were about to bring forth a play,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Scott had yielded to
                  the entreaties of his friend, the actor Daniel Terry (1789&#8211;1829; <title>DNB</title>), and written a play, &#8216;The Doom of Devorgil&#8217;, in
                  1818. Though packed with action it required supernatural effects that could not be staged, and it remained unpublished until
                  1830.</note> &amp; I was greatly in hopes it might be true; &#8211; for I am verily persuaded that in this course you <del>might</del>
               &lt;would&gt; run as brilliant a career as you have already done in narrative both in prose &amp; rhyme, &#8211; for as for believing that you have
               a double in the field, &#8211; not I! Those same powers would be equally certain of success in the drama, &amp; were you to give them a
               dramatic direction, &amp; reign for a third seven years upon the stage, you would stand alone in literary history. Indeed already I
               believe that no man ever afforded so much <del>pleasure</del> delight to so great a <del>xxxxxxx</del> number of his contemporaries, in
               this, or in any other country. </p>
