                  Rector of Bootle 1814&#8211;1835, wrote a series of nine letters, which were published

                  December 1818. They defended the conduct of Fleming and his six fellow-Governors
                  of St Bees School, near Whitehaven. The House of Commons Select Committee on the
                  Education of the Poor, chaired by Brougham, had taken evidence which had raised
                  some embarrassing issues about how the School was run, including the fact that
                  valuable mining rights belonging to St Bees had been leased to the Lowther family
                  in 1742 for 867 years and at a rent of only &#163;3 10 shillings per annum,

               is the concluding part, &amp; I rather think that you could not have seen that of the
               preceding week, but after much search I have not been able to discover the paper
               which contains it, &amp; am therefore afraid that it has been lost. But if it should
               turn up, I will not fail to send it you. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Till I could find this gazette I would not acknowledge the receipt of
               the two franks containing the papers respecting Bailbrook.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Bailbrook House, near Bath, home of the Ladies&#8217; Association

                  Peachy had sent information about this requested by Southey; see Southey to

               weighed more than ten pounds. However God be thanked it is living &amp; well. We
               think of naming him Cuthbert, &#8211; which is a good Saxon name, &amp; has never been
               obsolete in these northern counties.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">St
                  Cuthbert (c. 634&#8211;687; <title>DNB</title>), whose cult was centred on Durham

                  England.</note> &#8211; After so long an interval, &#8211; nearly seven years, &#8211; the
               appearance of an infant in the house occasions a great change.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Isabel Southey was born on 2 November 1812.</note> And to

                  Bailbrook House: &#8216;The premises have been offered for sale, an abbess from
                  Yorkshire has inspected them in company with a Catholic priest, and the nuns are
                  ready to remove and set up a Catholic school connected with the nunnery, the work
                  of proselytism will go on in the neighbourhood, (as it does in the vicinity of all
                  Catholic establishments,) and young women will be perverted and inveigled from
                  their parents, to become tenants of the Bedlam which is designed for them.&#8217; The
                  only Catholic convent in Yorkshire at this time was the Convent of the Institute
                  of the Blessed Virgin (or &#8216;Bar Convent&#8217;) in York. However, Bailbrook was not sold
                  at this time.</note> I should like to sketch the history of that Order, if my
                  <del>mater</del> authorities upon these shelves should contain sufficient
               materials (as most probably they will) &#8211; &amp; then contrast the origin, nature,
               &amp; consequence of such a nunnery, with the protestant establishment which is in
               danger of being superseded by it. </p>
