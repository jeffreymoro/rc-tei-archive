        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your letters, &amp; for what may properly be called &#8220; a
               new way of paying old debts,&#8221; &#8211; which leaves me however more &amp; more a
                  debtor.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">In a letter to Southey of 21
                  July 1820 Rickman wrote off any further contribution by Southey to the expenses of
                  their trip to Scotland 17 August&#8211;1 October 1819, asking Southey to look on the
                  money (about &#163;18) he had been required to outlay in fees for his honorary
                  Doctorate of Civil Law at Oxford, awarded 14 June 1820, as payment of the debt.
                  Southey&#8217;s phrase probably refers to Phillip Massinger&#8217;s (1583&#8211;1640;
                     <title>DNB</title>) <title>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</title> (c.

                  (1819). Burges was Vicar of Halvergate 1812&#8211;1853 and Rector of Moulton
                  1813&#8211;1853.</note> Somewhat <hi rend="ital">Burkish</hi> in manner, but it is

        <p rend="indent1"> My spirits are good, &amp; you know what an effect they have upon

                  deprive her of the title of Queen on the grounds of her adultery.</note> will
               appear so convincing, &#8211; the facts against her so damning &amp; damnable, &#8211; that the
               multitude who are really at present deceived into an opinion of her innocence, will
               be satisfied of her guilt, in spite of their own strong prepossessions, &amp; then a
               reaction will take place, violent in proportion to the zeal with which her quarrel
               has been taken up. &#8211; There is at least good reason to hope that some such turn may
               happen. The rascally press will certainly bring about its own cure one way or other;
               &#8211; by becoming too bad to be borne, even by our <hi rend="ital">Job</hi>ish<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The <title>Book of Job</title> related the

        <p rend="indent1"> I am working steadily, &amp; among other things making good
