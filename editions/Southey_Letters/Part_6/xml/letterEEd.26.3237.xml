        <p rend="indent1"> The cause of my wishing to ascertain whether I was disqualified for voting at an election, either by my pension or
                  office,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was not disqualified from voting through holding a public office, or a
                  pension. Only specific categories of office-holders could not vote, most importantly Post Office employees, Stamp officers and
                  customs and revenue officers (until this disqualification was removed in 1868).</note> was simply this. <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref> has placed these counties in a state of permanent warfare, upon a scheme
               originally devised by Lord Stanhope for the benefit of the county of Kent.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">When the poll closed
                  for the 1818 Westmorland Election, confirming that Brougham had not been elected, a meeting of Brougham&#8217;s friends in the yard of
                  Appleby Castle endorsed resolutions forming a &#8216;Grand Association to Secure the Independence of Westmorland and Cumberland&#8217;, i.e. to
                  work to promote future Whig candidates. Southey attributes this idea to the radical, Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope (1753&#8211;1816;
                     <title>DNB</title>), who had helped organise a county association in Kent in 1780 to promote reform and petition
                  parliament.</note> Both parties are buying up freeholds,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">In county elections only those
                  owning land worth 40 shillings per annum could vote. It was normal in hotly contested elections, as at that in Westmorland in 1818,
                  for candidates to attempt to obtain freeholds for known supporters.</note> &#8211; &amp; being asked to give my assistance in this way, I
                  <del>xxxx</del> promised so to do when I might have 100&#163; which I could <del>invest</del> vest in Westmoreland land.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">This was Wordsworth&#8217;s plan to buy the Ivy How estate in Little Langdale and divide the land into parcels
                  of 40 shilling freeholds for pro-Lowther voters.</note> &#8211; &lt;But&gt; The opportunity occurred too soon. And as I could not be ready with
               the money <del>during the xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxxx thinking xxxxxxx letter sent Grosvenor Bedford xxxx xx would xxxxxxx the xxxxxxx I
                  had xxxxxxxxxxx</del> I did not chuse to accept a loan <del>for that time</del> for two valid reasons; &#8211; the one, an apprehension
               that the money, for which I should have stood indebted to one with whom I am intimate enough to allow of such a transaction, might have
               in reality been adv[MS missing] from a different quarter,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth had offered to loan Southey
                  his share of the purchase money for the Ivy How estate, but Southey feared the money really came from the Earl of Lonsdale and this
                  would in effect buy his vote.</note> &amp; therefore in case an election had occurred before it was repaid have exposed me to an
               unpleasant feeling in tendering <del>x</del> my vote: &#8211; the other, a determination never to <del>eng</del> enter into an engagement
               which it may be difficult or <del>perhaps impos</del> inconvenient for me to fulfill, if I can possibly help it. For the greater part
               of my yearly expences must still be supplied by the years labour, &amp; is therefore wholly contingent upon the continuance of health,
               eye sight &amp; the use of my faculties, &#8211; either of which may fail me at any moment. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It appears to me that you <del>rather</del> undervalue your own weight in Parliament, &amp; do not perhaps see the
               state of the board so well as a looker on. The great pieces are cleared off, &amp; you may come in like a Castle toward the end of the
               game. It appears to me that the question of the Criminal Law cannot long be evaded; &#8211; that Ministers will not take it into their own
               hands as they ought to do, because they never have courage enough or foresight enough to anticipate the public feeling &amp; thereby to
               direct it: but that they would be glad to see it in your hands, rather than in those of a thick-&amp;-thin oppositionist, to whom it
               would give <del>xx</del> popularity at their expence; &amp; by whom it certainly &lt;will&gt; be taken up, if no better person steps forward.
               &#8211; Among the things to be desired, one I think is &#8211; that transportation should always be for life, &amp; the gradation of punishment be
               measured by the term for which the convict was to be employed in public works. &#8211; I wish too, seeing the constant increase of crimes,
               that from among the numbers &lt;of soldiers&gt; &amp;c whom we have discharged, a strong patrole had been formed, who might have retained as
               much of their discipline as would have been convenient, &amp; been subjected to the civil power. They would have been better employed
               in preventing robberies &amp; murders, &#8211; than in committing them. &#8211; which in too many instances will be the alternative. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I know not what has possessed <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> to postpone, or set aside my paper upon the Copy&#8211;right question;<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 19 (July 1818) was published on 2 February 1819. Southey&#8217;s &#8216;Inquiry
                  into the Copyright Act&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 21 (January 1819), 196&#8211;213, was delayed.</note> &#8211; the bill of fare
               indicates three or four subjects which had certainly no very imperative claims for preference, &amp; one would have supposed <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> might have had some regard to his own interest<del>s</del> in the <del>x</del>
               question. &#8211; There is nothing of mine in the number, &amp; will be very little hereafter, if I can by any means avoid it. </p>
        <p rend="center"> &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I need not say how much it gratified me to see the manner in which you were spoken of by <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref> the other day.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">When the House of Commons
                  assembled on 14 January 1819 for the first time since the General Election of 1818, its first duty was to re-elect The Speaker,
                  Charles Manners-Sutton (1780&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), who had defeated Wynn for the post in 1817. Canning paid a generous tribute
                  to Wynn, stating The Speaker had been &#8216;elected to the chair of this House, after a contest with a gentleman, to be put in
                  competition with whom is no disparagement, but a high credit to any man, be his character what it may.&#8217; It must be doubtful whether
                  this tribute, or Southey drawing attention to it, made Wynn feel any better about having lost out to Manners-Sutton.</note> And this
               is an indication, at least of more weight &amp; character than you give yourself credit for. &#8211; That the Criminal Laws will undergo some
               alteration, &amp; the Prison discipline a thorough reform is I think certain. (It is odd enough that in the Ed. Register I should have

                  Quaker Elizabeth Fry (1780&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>) was coming to increasing prominence in the campaign for prison
