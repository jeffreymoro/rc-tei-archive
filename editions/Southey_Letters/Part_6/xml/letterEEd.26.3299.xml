                  letter is misdated 30 June 1819 by Southey. The content, in particular the references to the age of Cuthbert Southey, Caroline
                  Bowles&#8217;s stay in Bristol, Southey&#8217;s progress with the History of Brazil and his plans to visit London rather than
                  Scotland, make it clear that the letter belongs to c. 21 May 1819; see also Southey to Caroline Bowles, 21 May 1819, Letter

        <p rend="indent1"> You are the only friend I have in the world, who never sends me a line to tell me of his goings on, &#8211; &amp; it so
               happens that I never by any accident happen to hear of you thro a third person. That you are very busy I know, &#8211; &amp; so am I; &#8211; of my
               occupations indeed you will very shortly receive a substantial proof. But before I speak of that let me tell what provocation induces
               me to address you at this time.</p>

               &amp; will &lt;be&gt; for three or four weeks more, resident within a few doors of you. I have given her reason to expect that you will call
               upon her as a friend of mine, &amp; the reason why I have done so is this; &#8211; she is an invalid, &#8211; <del>xxx</del> to what degree I know
               not, but I know the value of your advice, &#8211; &amp; to your attention to a like request of mine <ref type="m" target="people.html#AllstonWashington">Alstone</ref> acknowledges that he is indebted for his life,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1813 Southey had recommended Allston, who was suffering from lead poisoning, to King as a patient. King treated
                  him in late September and October of that year, operating on him for thickening of the colon. Although Allston never fully recovered
                  his health, he credited King with saving his life; see <title>The Correspondence of Washington Allston</title>, ed. Nathalia Wright
                  (Lexington, 1993), p. 64 n. 1. </note> &#8211; America will one day bear witness how well that life was worth saving. And perhaps this may
               be little less so, <del>xxx</del> for <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesCaroline">this Lady</ref> is unquestionably a woman of
               genius. My <del>knowledge of h</del> acquaintance with her as yet has only been thro the medium of pen, ink &amp; paper, so you may
               gratify my curiosity by telling me what kind of personage she appears. &amp; I have only to tell you that her name is <ref type="m" target="people.html#BowlesCaroline">Miss Bowles</ref>, &amp; that she is at present at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 19 in the Mall on a
               visit to some relations.</p>

        <p rend="indent1"> One great work is drawing fast toward its completion. The last chapter of my History of Brazil<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), III, pp. 696&#8211;879.</note> is far advanced in
               the press, &amp; in the course of a month you will receive the concluding volume, &#8211; a work of prodigious labour it has been, this
               volume especially, being drawn in great part from manuscript materials. As soon as the last sheet is printed I set off for London where
               I shall remain from four to six weeks.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">This visit was put off in favour of Southey&#8217;s tour of
