					Sir</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> That I intended to thank you for the books you sent me from London in 1819, &#8211; the unfinished
					letter which I have now fished up from the bottom of my desk will show: &#8211; And it is better to say <hi rend="ital">peccavi</hi>
          <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;I have sinned&#8217;.</note> than to apologize for the old &amp;
					besetting sin of procrastination. That I had received them, you would probably infer from the mention of Fisher
					Ames in the Q. Review.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Ticknor had sent Southey a copy of Fisher Ames
						(1758&#8211;1808), <title>Works of Fisher Ames</title> (Boston, 1809), no. 43 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s
						library. Ames was a lawyer and an arch-conservative Federalist Representative from Massachusetts. Southey quoted
						approvingly from Ames&#8217;s book (pp. 78, 392) in his article, &#8216;New Churches&#8217;, <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 46
						(July 1820), 549&#8211;591 (574 and 578), especially referring to Ames&#8217;s views on the dangers of freedom of the
						press.</note> &#8211; This omission has been attended with frequent self-reproaches, &#8211; for I am sure you will not
					suppose that you were forgotten; but I looked forward to an honourable amends in sending you the manuscript of my
					New England poem, as soon as it should be compleated.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s unfinished
						epic set in New England. A fragment was published posthumously in <title>Oliver Newman: a New-England Tale
							(Unfinished): with Other Poetical Remains by the Late Robert Southey</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1&#8211;90.</note>
					When that will be I dare not promise; but the desire of sending you that first fair copy, part of which was put
					into your hands when you were here, is not one of the least inducements for taking it up speedily as a serious
					&amp; regular occupation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I found your parcel last night, on my return home after a fortnights absence. Its contents will
					be of the greatest use to me. I have already looked thro Callender &amp; the Archaiology,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">John Callender (1706&#8211;1748), <title>An Historical Discourse on the Civil and Religious Affairs of
							the Colony of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations in New-England in America</title> (1739), no. 523 in the
						sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library; <title>Archaeologia Americana: Transactions and Publications of the American
							Antiquarian Society</title>, 1 (1820), no. 63 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &amp; find in
					the former applicable information not in my other authorities, &#8211; &amp; in the latter many curious facts. Our old
					divine D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hammond<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">John Fell (1625&#8211;1686;
							<title>DNB</title>), <title>The Life of the Most Learned, Reverend and Pious Dr. H. Hammond</title>, 2nd edn
						(London, 1662), pp. 11&#8211;12 : &#8216;His Method was (which likewise he recommended to his friends) after every Sermon to
						resolve upon the ensuing Subject; that being done, to pursue the course of study which he was then in hand with,
						reserving the Close of the Week for the provision for the next Lords-day. Whereby not onely a constant progress
						was made in Science, but materials unawares were gain&#8217;d unto the immediate future Work: for, he said, be the
						Subjects treated of never so distant, somewhat will infallibly fall in conducible unto the present purpose.&#8217; This
						work was a biography of Henry Hammond (1605&#8211;1660; <title>DNB</title>), Anglican theologian.</note> used to say
					that whatever his course of study might be in the first part of the week, something always occurred in it which was
					convertible to use in his next sermon. My experience is of the same kind, &#8211; &amp; you will perceive that these
					books will assist me in many ways.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> At present I send you the Vision of Judgement. Erase the word <hi rend="ital">ac</hi> p. xx
					between <hi rend="ital">ver&#233; </hi>&amp; <hi rend="ital">epicum</hi> in the note, &amp; add the letter <hi rend="ital">a</hi> to the last word in the first page of the poem.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A
							Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), p. xx; Canto 1, line 9.</note> I take advantage of this means of

					receive at the same time a reprint of some official Odes,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">A combined second

							1810</title>, 3.2 (1812), i&#8211;l.</note> The same post which carries this letter to London, will convey my
					directions to <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longman</ref> for sending these books to Finsbury
