        <p rend="indent1"> You have probably heard from <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">Henry</ref> of my procrastinated
               purposes of moving, &amp; the long series of anxieties which have embittered, &amp; in part occasioned the delay. Those anxieties are
               materially relieved, but by no means removed. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref> is about once more; &#8211; the
               danger of an abscess is over, &#8211; but she has still a <del>pain</del> troublesome affection <del>of</del> in one breast, &amp; it is very
               evident that there is something wrong in the general system, which I hope air, gentle exercise, &amp; cooling fruits, when we can get
               them, will correct. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">The Child</ref> has recovered from a severe illness,
               &amp; seems to be doing well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Loath as I am to leave this place in summer, a summer journey has many advantages over a winter one. Short nights for
               travelling, &#8211; no inconvenience from cold in the mail coach, &#8211; fewer acquaintance in town, &amp; therefore more leisure for my work
               &amp; my friends. I hope to see you in the course of June. Having brought down the Hist. of Brazil to the time of the Emigration,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The flight of the Portuguese court to Brazil in 1807&#8211;1808, an event covered in the <title>History

               it then was, was not only a fitting, but a necessary conclusion to the work, &#8211; but it has been a huge addition to my labour, &#8211; for it
               will extend to full 150 pages.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was being a little over-optimistic &#8211; the final chapter

                  not finished until &#8216;<hi rend="ital">June 23d</hi>, 1819&#8217; (p. 879).</note> About two thirds are done, &amp; so far much to my
               satisfaction, for I have <del>brought together</del> &lt;collected&gt; from various sources a clear &amp; comprehensive general view, &#8211;
               province by province as far as I have yet proceeded. The volume however will be so large (above 800 pages<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Notes and index ensured that the final volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title> ran to 950 pages.</note>) that
               I believe I must defer the Biblioteca Brazilica which it was my intention to have added, &#8211; &amp; leave it for a separate publication, &#8211;
               rather than incur a longer delay, &amp; curtail it for the sake of room.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s idea of
                  publishing a bibliography of books on Brazil did not materialise.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> One consequence of this delay will be that I shall see Richmond in full beauty, &#8211; which even to one from the Land of
               Lakes, is a sight worth seeing, &amp; worth going to see, &#8211; for in its kind it is perfect, &amp; there is nothing like it elsewhere. I
