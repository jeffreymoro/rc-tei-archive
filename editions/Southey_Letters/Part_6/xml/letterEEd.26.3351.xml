        <p rend="indent1"> Here I am again, having been as far North as Fleet Mound<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Fleet Mound was a massive causeway, commissioned in 1803, designed by Telford, and built between 1814&#8211;1816, to
						carry the road over Loch Fleet. It comprised an earthwork, and a bridge with self-regulating sluice gates that
						allowed the waters from the river to flow out, but prevented seawater from coming in.</note> which is within sight

						President of the Medical Society of the North and one of the founders of the Royal Northern Infirmary,
						Inverness.</note> has put us in the right method of treating my head. He said that if I had been stationary he
					should <del>perhaps</del> have applied the lunar caustic<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Fused silver
						nitrate, shaped into sticks. It was used as a cauterising agent.</note> to the wound &#8211; but this required
						<del>more</del> skill in its management, &amp; could not be entrusted to ignorant hands. So he substituted a
					mercurial ointment to act as an escharrotic.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">A corrosive salve that causes
