						passage translates as: &#8216;You write to me, of your own free will [literally &#8216;with a free foot&#8217;], that you have
						fallen headlong into the disease peculiar to our time, which is called by the Spanish appellation &#8216;bubas&#8217;, by the
						Italians &#8216;the French disease&#8217;, and which some of the doctors call &#8216;Elephantia&#8217;, and others call by another name.
						But in a lugubrious statement you bewail the calamity and your tribulations; you cry out that your knuckles&#8217;
						impediment, your joints&#8217; dullness and the pains of all your commissures are intense; with an eloquence that
						excites pity you tell of the ulcer and the additional foulness of your mouth; you complain, lament and deplore
						it.&#8217;</note> &#8211; Here then is direct proof that the disease was considered as the peculiar scourge of the age, before
					Columbus sailed upon his first voyage.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Christopher Columbus (1450/1&#8211;1506),
						Italian explorer who was commissioned by the Spanish Crown to sail west across the Atlantic in 1492 and who

						America by Columbus. Southey had previously collected information on the disease for his brother, whose university dissertation agreed with the theory that syphilis had an American origin; see Robert Southey to Henry Herbert Southey, 24 March 1806, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey.

        <p rend="indent1"> I cannot believe that the Catholic Bill will pass the H of Lords.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">The Roman Catholic Disability Removal Bill was indeed defeated in the House of Lords on 17 April
						1821.</note> If it should, petitions ought to be addressed to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref>, <del>to xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx</del> by the two Universities,
					&amp; by every Dean &amp; Chapter. If it passes Church property will not be worth ten years [MS obscured]. The
					danger is from the Dissenters, &#8211; they will enter the breach, &#8211; the Agriculturists will join with them in a cry
					against Tythes, &amp; the first unprincipled Minister will gladly appoint a Committee who may authorize him to do
					as Pitt (the worst of all Ministers) did with the Land Tax.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">William Pitt
						(1759&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1783&#8211;1801, 1804&#8211;1806, created the Land Tax Redemption Office in
						1798, allowing landowners to make their property exempt from future land tax payments if they paid a lump sum,
						equal to 15 years&#8217; tax. He also favoured the removal of all civil disabilities from Roman Catholics and resigned
						in 1801 when George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) would not agree to the
						measure.</note> This Catholic question is a legacy which he left us.</p>
