        <p rend="indent1"> At last I have received the books,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Landor had sent Southey a present of sixty books from Italy;
                  see Southey to Herbert Hill, 8 December 1821, Letter 3755.</note> a rich cargo, in
               which I shall find much to amuse &amp; not a little to profit by. As yet I have only
               had time to catalogue them, &amp; look into them as this was done. In so doing I saw
               that you had given a Jesuit the lie for what he said of the cause of the Irish
                  rebellion.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">An unidentified reference to
                  the Irish rebellion of 1641. The rising began on 23 October 1641; it was an
                  attempt by a group of Catholic landowners to seize control of the administration
                  of Ireland.</note> A lying Jesuit he is, &#8211; but in this instance the falsehood is
               merely chronological. The Long Parliament past a decree forbidding all persons to bow
               at the name of Jesus;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">It is Southey whose
                  chronology is muddled here. The House of Commons of the Long Parliament, elected
                  in 1640, had issued a Declaration on 8 September 1641 against what it regarded as
                  &#8216;Innovations&#8217; in the form of worship in the Church of England, including &#8216;all
                  corporal bowing at the name of Jesus, or towards the east-end of the Church,
                  Chapel, or Chancel, or towards the Communion-table&#8217;. The House of Lords refused to
                  agree to this Declaration, but the Commons ordered its publication anyway.</note>
               &#8211; Sir Edward Deering made a very eloquent speech upon the occasion, which I shall
               send you ere long in the little sketch of our Church history <del>with</del> which I
               am preparing.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Edward Dering
                  (1598&#8211;1644; <title>DNB</title>), antiquary and politician. He was a
                  Parliamentarian, who switched to the Royalist side after his <title>A Collection
                     of Speeches Made by Sir E. Dering on Matters of Religion</title> (1642) was
                  ordered by parliament to be burnt, and he was briefly imprisoned on 4 February
                  1642. Southey quoted at length from Dering&#8217;s speech against the banning of bowing
                  at the name of Jesus in <title>The Book of the Church</title>, 2 vols (London,
                  1824), II, pp. 372&#8211;374. </note> This decree was subsequent to the Irish Massacre.
               The fact which the Jesuit might have dwelt upon with advantage is, that the
               intolerance of the Parliament, seeking to enforce the penalty of death against
               recusant Priests, when Charles, like his father, was inclined to toleration, gave a
               pretext for the rebellion, &amp; furnished those who instigated it with means for
               alarming &amp; enraging the populace.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  Act Against Jesuits and Seminarists (1585) made it illegal for Catholic priests to
                  operate in England, and they could be sentenced to death for high treason if
                  discovered. However, only seven Catholic priests were executed in the reign of
                  James I (1566&#8211;1625; King of Great Britain 1603&#8211;1625; <title>DNB</title>). Only two
                  were executed in the reign of his son, Charles I (1600&#8211;1649; King of Great Britain
                  1625&#8211;1649; <title>DNB</title>), before the election of the Long Parliament in
                  1640, but about twenty Catholic priests were executed under Parliamentary rule in
                  1641&#8211;1647.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> I shall send your letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref>, who will I am
               sure be much gratified at seeing what you say of him.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">In a letter of 12 March 1821 Landor had informed Southey that
                  he had written a Latin essay on poetry, which included a tribute to Wordsworth&#8217;s
                  influence on him; see John Forster, <title>Walter Savage Landor. A

               a House of Lords.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">In his letter of 12
                  March 1821 Landor had informed Southey that he had written &#8216;three orations&#8217;
                  against foreign intervention in Italy to suppress liberal constitutionalism,
                  including &#8216;the inexpediency, not to say impossibility, of forming a house of
                  lords&#8217;; see John Forster, <title>Walter Savage Landor. A Biography</title>, 2 vols
                  (London, 1869), I, p. 473. The constitution enacted in Naples in 1820 was based on
                  the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and did not provide for a House of Lords, unlike
                  the constitution adopted, under British influence, in the Sicilian part of the
                  kingdom in 1812 and abolished by the monarchy in 1814.</note> Perhaps the most
               difficult of all things is to establish a free Government among a people altogether
               unused to freedom; &amp; if they are (as in France &amp; Italy) a corrupt people, the
               difficulty becomes still greater. Where you have a representative government, two
               Houses have at least the <del>appearance</del> advantage of interposing delay in time
               of popular excitement, they afford something more than an appeal from Philip drunk to
               Philip sober.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">An appeal to somebody in

               The House of Lords since its cowardly conduct in the Queens business<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">On 10 November 1820, the House of Lords had
                  passed the Third Reading of the Bill of Pains and Penalties, which would have
                  deprived Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>) of the title of
                  Queen and dissolved her marriage to the King, by only nine votes. As a result it
                  had become clear that the Bill could not pass the House of Commons and it was
                  withdrawn by the government.</note> (which indicated the same want of fibre that

               For the sure consequences of that Emancipation would be a religious war in Ireland

        <p rend="indent1"> Of Italian nobility I would take your opinion without hesitation,
               knowing nothing of them myself. But in Spain &amp; Portugal I would have had a House
               of Peers, were it only in respect to great names &amp; those heroic remembrances
               which are the strength &amp; glory of a nation.<note n="19" place="foot" resp="editors">An army revolt in Spain in January 1820 led to the
                  re-establishment of the liberal Constitution of 1812 in March 1820. It did not
                  contain a House of Lords. An army revolt in Portugal in August 1820 led to the
                  election of a Cortes in December 1820 and demands that the monarchy return from
                  Brazil, where it had fled in 1807&#8211;1808 following the French invasion. John VI
                  (1767&#8211;1826; King of Portugal 1816&#8211;1826) arrived back in Lisbon on 3 July 1821 and
                  eventually agreed to a new liberal Constitution in October 1822. This Constitution
                  resembled the Spanish Constitution of 1812, including the absence of a House of
                  Lords.</note> The nobles were for the most part deplorably degenerate; &#8211; but as a
               bad spirit had degraded; a better one would improve the next generation; &amp; I
               would demolish nothing but what is injurious. &#8211; My fear is that they will demolish
               every thing, &amp; this fear I have felt from the beginning. Deeply therefore as I
               detested the old misrule, I did not rejoice in the Spanish &amp; Portugueze
               revolutions. In Portugal I wished for a great minister, &#8211; such as Pombal<note n="20" place="foot" resp="editors">Sebasti&#227;o Jos&#233; de Carvalho e Melo, Marquess of
                  Pombal (1699&#8211;1782), Prime Minister of Portugal 1750&#8211;1777.</note> would have been
               in these times; &#8211; in Spain, for a court revolution which should have sent Ferdinand
               to a monastery, &amp; established a vigorous ministry under his brothers name, by
               whom the reforms which the country needed might have been steadily but gradually
                  effected.<note n="21" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had hoped that
                  Ferdinand VII (1784&#8211;1833; King of Spain 1808 and 1813&#8211;1833), whom he detested,
                  would be declared unfit to rule and replaced by a regime led by his younger
                  brother and heir, Charles, Count of Molina (1788&#8211;1855). As Charles was even more
                  reactionary than Ferdinand, it was a forlorn hope that such an arrangement would
                  provide a peaceful path to reform.</note> I entirely agree with you that old
               monarchical states cannot be made republican, &#8211; nor new colonial ones be made

        <p rend="indent1"> Sir C. Wolseley has not published your letter, &#8211; in which he has done

                  (1769&#8211;1846; <title>DNB</title>), radical politician. Wolseley had published a
                  letter in <title>The Times</title>, 11 October 1820, noting his acquaintance with
                  Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>) when she lived at Como in
                  1817 and stating he could obtain information &#8216;that no Englishman but myself and a

                  Southey saw the letter and transcribed it for Landor; see Southey to Landor, 29
                  October 1820, Letter 3547. Landor responded by sending a letter to <title>The
                     Times</title>. He also asked Southey to get the same letter into the

                  &#8216;whatever I may have heard relating to the Queen, I know nothing positive, and
                  never made a single inquiry that either could inculpate or acquit her in the cause

                  passage in this letter suggests Landor may have also written directly to
                  Wolseley.</note> Since the disappearance of the Queens-fever, this country has
