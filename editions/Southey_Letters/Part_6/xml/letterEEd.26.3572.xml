          <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">My mother</ref> was born in 1752. She was a
					remarkably beautiful infant, till when she was between one &amp; two years old an abominable nursemaid<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> carried her to Newgate of all places in the world, &amp; there
					she took the smallpox in its most malignant form. She escaped (&amp; it seemed almost miraculous, so dreadfully
					severe was the disease) with life &amp; with eyesight, &#8211; but her eyebrows were almost destroyed, &amp; the whole
					face seamed with scars. While she was very young she had a stroke of paralysis which <del>deprived her of the use
						of one leg</del> deadened one side from the hip joint downward, &amp; this continued for about twelvemonths. Some
					person advised that she should be set in the sun, &amp; one day when she had been carried out as usual into her
					little armd chair &amp; placed in the fore court, to see her brothers at play, to the astonishment of the family
					she rose from her seat &amp; walked into the house. The recovery was compleat. The fact is worthy of notice,
					because <del>it may be xxxx by</del> some persons <del>who</del> may derive hope from it in similar cases, &amp;
					because it is by no means improbable that the sunshine &lt;really&gt; effected the cure. The <del>theory</del>
					&lt;manner&gt; by which I should explain this would lead to a <del>speculation</del> &lt;theory&gt; somewhat akin
					to that of Bp Berkeley <del>xx</del> upon the virtues of Tar water.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">George
						Berkeley (1685&#8211;1753; <title>DNB</title>), Anglo-Irish philosopher, Bishop of Cloyne 1734&#8211;1753 and author of
							<title>Siris, a Chain of Philosophical Reflections and Inquiries, Concerning the Virtues of Tar-Water</title>
						(1744).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There are two portraits of <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my Mother</ref>,
					one in <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">my brother Toms</ref> possession, &amp; one which is now
					hanging opposite to me. They were both taken by the same artist<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert
						Hancock (1730&#8211;1817).</note> in 1798, but neither of them would convey to a stranger the just idea of her
					countenance. Mine, which is a profile is very much the best, &#8211; it represents her as she then was with features
					care-worn &amp; fallen away, &amp; with a melancholy air which was not natural to her, for never was any human
					being blest with a sweeter temper, or a happier disposition. She had an excellent understanding, &amp; a
						<del>quickness</del> &lt;readiness&gt; of apprehension which I have never known surpassed. In this quickness of
					capacity, in the kindness of her nature, &amp; in that kind of moral magnetism which wins the affections of all
					within its reach, the best way by which I can make you comprehend her character is by comparing her to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GonneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Gonne</ref>, who in these respects often reminds me
					of her. To strangers she must probably have appeared much disfigured by the small pox; I of course could not be
					sensible of this, her complexion was remarkably <del>xxxx</del> &lt;good&gt;, &amp; nothing could be more
					expressive than her fine clear hazel eyes.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Female education was not much regarded in her childhood. The Ladies who kept boarding schools in
					those days did not consider it necessary to possess any other knowledge themselves than that of ornamental needle
					work. Two sisters<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> who <del>kept</del> &lt;had been
					mistresses&gt; of the most fashionable school in Herefordshire used to say when they spake of a former pupil, &#8220;<hi rend="ital">Her</hi> went to school to <hi rend="ital">we</hi>,&#8221; &#8211; &amp; the <del>person</del> mistress of

						(1755&#8211;1831; <title>DNB</title>); she had three daughters: Sarah Martha (&#8216;Sally&#8217;; 1775&#8211;1803), Maria (1779&#8211;1798) and
						Cecilia (1794&#8211;1868). The youngest was sent to the school at Belvedere House, Bath, run by Siddons&#8217;s friends the
						dramatists and novelists Sophia (c. 1750&#8211;1824; <title>DNB</title>) and Harriet Lee (1757/8&#8211;1851;

						mother</ref> I believe never went to any but a dancing school, &amp; her state was the more gracious. But her half
					sister <ref type="m" target="people.html#TylerElizabeth">Miss Tyler</ref> was placed at one in the neighbourhood,
						<del>kept by</del> &lt;under&gt; a M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Serjeant<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified beyond the information given here.</note> whom I mention because her history <del>thxxx</del> is
					characteristic of those times. Her husband<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified beyond the
						information given here.</note> carried on the agreable business of a butcher in Bristol, while she managed a
					school about a mile out of the town. His business would not necessarily have disqualified her for this occupation,
					(tho it would be no recommendation), <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteHenryKirke">Kirke Whites</ref> mother a
					truly admirable woman,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary White, n&#233;e Neville (1755&#8211;1833), ran a Ladies&#8217;

					respect just under the same circumstances. But M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Serjeant <del>had</del> might with more
					propriety have been a blacksmiths wife, as in that case Vulcan<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Roman god of
						metalworking; his wife, Venus, had an affair with Mars, the god of war. Vulcan thus became the archetype of
						husbands whose wives were unfaithful.</note> would have served for a type of her husband, in his fate, but not in
					the complacency with which he submitted to it. She was a handsome woman, &amp; her children were like the Harleian
						Miscellany,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">The comparison is with the <title>Harleian Miscellany</title>
						(1744&#8211;1746), a collection of diversely authored material from the library of Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and
						Mortimer (1661&#8211;1724; <title>DNB</title>), edited by Samuel Johnson (1709&#8211;1784; <title>DNB</title>) and William
							Oldys (1696&#8211;1761; <title>DNB</title>). The term was also applied to the offspring of Harley&#8217;s wife, Jane Elizabeth Harley, Countess of Oxford and Mortimer (1774&#8211;1824), whose many lovers included Byron.</note> &#8211; by different authors, &#8211; this was notorious, &amp; yet her school
					flourished notwithstanding, &amp; she retired from it with a competent fortune. <del>Wh</del> This &amp; what I
					have before said of Emanuel Collins,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Emanuel Collins (fl. 1732&#8211;1762),

						Southey to John May, 16 August&#8211;18 November 1820, Letter 3526.</note> &lt;may serve to&gt; show a great improvement

        <p rend="indent1"> Two things concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mothers</ref>
