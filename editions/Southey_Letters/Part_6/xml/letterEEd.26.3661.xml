        <p rend="indent1"> I am greatly obliged to you for presenting my Vision of
                  Judgement<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of
                     Judgement</title> (1821). Written in Southey&#8217;s capacity as Poet Laureate, it
                  was dedicated to George IV.</note> to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref>, &amp; for
               communicating to me the very gratifying manner in which his Majesty has been pleased
               to mention it. In writing upon public occasions it has been &amp; will be my earnest
               desire to produce something which may inculcate &amp; enforce right opinions, with
               the hope that it may prove of some immediate utility, &amp; be not unworthy of being
               read hereafter. <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">His
                  Majestys</ref> approbation is the best proof which could be obtained
               that this desire will not be disappointed.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The opinions which have as yet reached me concerning the metre of the
                  poem,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of
                     Judgement</title> (1821) was written in hexameters.</note> are exactly what
               private trials had taught me to expect. Women are at first perplexed at the
               appearance of the verse; but upon reading it aloud, they presently perceive the
               rhythm, &amp; then they like it. My friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Charles Wynn</ref> avowing that his prejudice
               against it is inveterate, acknowledges that he dislikes it less than he
                  expected.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Charles Watkin
                  Williams Wynn, 23 March 1821, Letter 3657.</note> Young poets<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">For example, John Heraud and Ebenezer Elliott; see

                  25 March 1821, Letter 3658.</note> admire it with enthusiasm, &amp; endeavor to
               persuade me that it is a finer measure than blank verse. Their elders, whom I call my
                  peers,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Grosvenor Charles
                  Bedford, 21 December 1820, Letter 3587, for his account of the approval of
                  hexameters by Wordsworth; and Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 3 April 1821,
                  Letter 3662 for Landor&#8217;s views.</note> appreciate fairly its merits &amp; defects,
               &amp; giving a decided verdict in its favour, pronounce it a legitimate &amp;
               powerful metre, &amp; think that our literature is enriched by its introduction.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Twenty years ago I planned a poem upon the Deluge, with the intention
               of writing it in this measure, meaning to show in what manner the wickedness of
               mankind was produced in the Old World by the two opposite extremes of political evil,
               &#8211; such a tyranny on the one hand as Buonaparte<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French 184&#8211;1814, 1815).</note>
               afterwards went far towards establishing, &amp; such a spirit of Jacobinism &lt;on the
               other,&gt; as is at this day at work, here at home, as well as over the whole
                  continent.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had a long history
                  of metrical experimentation and in 1799 had the idea for a long poem in hexameters
                  about the biblical flood. It had the working titles the &#8216;Deluge&#8217; and &#8216;Noah&#8217;. For
                  the ideas he sketched out, see <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood
                  Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1850), IV, pp. 2&#8211;3. Southey&#8217;s thoughts, dated 29
                  June 1801, included: &#8216;The universal iniquity will be difficultly made conceivable.
                  There must be an universal monarchy to account for it, and focus it./ How to
                  heighten the crimes? to bring about the crisis of guilt? all must be bad, even
                  those who see the evil must seek to remedy it by evil means; some United Irish
                  violence.&#8217; The poem was not brought to fruition. </note> The design has long been
               laid aside, but the course of events has tended to show that it was not ill conceived
               in this respect.</p>
