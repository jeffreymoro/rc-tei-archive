                  Cabinet into preparing a Bill of Pains and Penalties to dissolve their marriage and deprive her of the title of Queen. She had
                  rejected compromise terms offered by the Cabinet and had arrived in England on 5 June 1820. The House of Lords had begun to debate
                  the Bill on 17 August, and what was effectively a trial of Caroline for adultery continued until 10 November, when the Bill passed
                  by only nine votes and the Cabinet immediately dropped it on the grounds that it could not pass the House of Commons.</note> &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#GonneMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Gonne</ref> however has heard the contents of the bag.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The evidence that had been collected of Queen Caroline&#8217;s adultery was presented to the House of Lords on

                  to proceed with the Bill of Pains and Penalties.</note> I suppose you will have to illuminate again.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">To celebrate the Queen&#8217;s victory on 10 November 1820, many radicals put lighted candles in their windows to signal

                     821: In this year a sickness wore down all England; it was, as it were, a paralysis, in which the nerves of men, women and
                     infants were struck by a continual and excessive chill, and their veins rose up more hard, with no remedy of cloths being
                     efficacious; and in particular men&#8217;s arms and hands became useless and totally withered. Going before this sickness, as if a most
                     sure harbinger of it, an intolerable pain would seize upon a limb that was sick in this way.&#8217; <title>Acta Sanctorum</title>, 53
