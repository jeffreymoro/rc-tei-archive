        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter brings to mind how it happened that the last which I received from you remained unanswered. &#8211; I began a
               reply <del>as soon as</del> immediately, but having expressed &lt;a hope&gt; that business might probably soon lead me into the West Country,
               &amp; intimated a little too confidently the likelihood of my succeeding to some good family estates there in consequence of Lord
               Somervilles death, &#8211; the letter was laid aside, till I could be more certain.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey
                  Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>), agricultural reformer and third cousin of Southey, had died on 5
                  October 1819. Somerville&#8217;s mother was Elizabeth Cannon Lethbridge (d. 1765), the daughter of Mary Southey (1704&#8211;1789) and niece of
                  John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). The latter had inherited the Fitzhead estate in Somerset from his mother, Mary Cannon (1678&#8211;1738). On
                  his death, John Cannon Southey had left a complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville his primary heir, and Southey&#8217;s father
                  and two uncles the residuary legatees, their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three Southey brothers only
                  Southey&#8217;s father married, leading the poet to believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that he and his brothers
                  were now the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate.</note> Shortly afterwards I went to London<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey visited London in May&#8211;June 1820.</note> &amp; the result of my legal enquiries there was, that owing to the
               clumsy manner in which a will was drawn up, estates to the value of a thousand a year in Somersetshire which according to the clear
               instruction of the testator ought now to have devolved upon me, <del>xxxxx</del> &lt;had been&gt; adjudged<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">There were a number of legal disputes over the Fitzhead estate; Southey is here probably referring to the case
                  between Lord Somerville and seven others, heard in the Court of King&#8217;s Bench on 27 January 1795.</note> to Lord Somerville to be at
               his full disposal, &amp; were by him either sold, or bequeathed to his half brothers:<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Somerville&#8217;s half-brothers were: Mark, 16th Lord Somerville (1784&#8211;1842); Kenelm, 17th Lord Somerville (1787&#8211;1864); and William
                  (1789&#8211;1857). They had no blood ties to the Southeys.</note> &#8211; so that the whole is gone to a different family. You know me well
               enough to believe that this never deprived me of an hours sleep nor a moments peace of mind. The only ill effect was that I fancied
               your letter had been answered, &amp; wondered I did not hear from you again, &#8211; which wonder, nothing but never-ending business has
               prevented me from expressing to you long ere this.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> God knows how truly it would have rejoiced me to have seen you at Oxford.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been awarded an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law at the University of Oxford on 14 June 1820.</note> My heart was never
               heavier than during the only whole day which I past in that city. There was not a single contemporary whom I knew: &#8211; the only person

                  had become increasingly reclusive. As an obituary explained, &#8216;he for many years secluded himself from general society, and appeared
