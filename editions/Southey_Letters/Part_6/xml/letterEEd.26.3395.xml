        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for the bills. &#8211; I must trespass on you farther, &amp; request that you will seal up
					ten pounds, &amp; leave it with <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref> directed for <ref type="m" target="people.html#LambCharles">Charles Lamb Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
          </ref> &#8211; from R.S. &#8211; It is for poor
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#MorganJohnJames">John Morgan</ref>, whom you may remember drawing, some twenty
					years, as an imp volant in embroidered pantaloons, in a certain tail piece, still carefully preserved, &amp;
					designed to represent <ref type="m" target="people.html#BiggsNathaniel">Biggs</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#CottleJoseph">Cottle</ref> on S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Augustines Back. This poor fellow whom I
						<del>remember</del> &lt;knew&gt; at school, &amp; whose mother<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> has <del>ask</del> sometimes asked me to her table when I should otherwise have gone without
					a dinner, was left with a fair fortune &#8211; from 10 to 15000&#163;. &amp; without any vice, or extravagance of his own, he
					has lost the whole of <del>this</del> &lt;it&gt; by the knavery of his wifes relations. A stroke of the palsy has utterly
					disabled him from doing any thing to maintain himself; &#8211; &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MorganMary">his
						wife</ref> &#8211; a good natured kind-hearted woman, whom I knew in her bloom, beauty &amp; prosperity, has accepted a
					situation as mistress of a charity school with a miserable salary of 40&#163; a year, &amp; this is all they have. In
					this pitiable case <ref type="m" target="people.html#LambCharles">Lamb</ref> &amp; I have promised him ten pounds a
					year each, as long as he lives, I have got five pounds a year for him from an excellent fellow<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly John Kenyon, who had been staying with Southey and was known for his
						generosity.</note> whom you do not know, &amp; who chuses on this occasion to be called A.B. &#8211; &amp; I have
					written to his Bristol friends, who are able to do more for him than we are, &amp; on whom he has stronger
					&lt;personal&gt; claims:<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">See Southey to Joseph Cottle, 26 November
						1819, Letter 3394.</note> So that I hope we shall secure for him the decencies of life. &#8211; You will understand that
					this is an <hi rend="ital">explanation</hi> to you not an <hi rend="ital">application</hi>. In a case of this kind
					contributions become a matter of feeling &amp; duty among those who know the party, but strangers are not to be
					looked to.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The death of the King,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of
						Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) died on 29 January 1820. Southey feared the succession of the Prince
						Regent would require him, as Poet Laureate, to produce an annual Birthday Ode as well as a New Year&#8217;s Ode.</note>
					whenever it happens, will annoy me more than any other of his subjects, inasmuch as it will impose upon me the task
					of a Birthday Ode. Should it happen just now, it will be very unlucky &#8211; when as you see I have just finished my
					imposition, &#8211; &amp; when I have really <del>t</del> no time to spare without a great sacrifice both of convenience
					&amp; money. &lt;For&gt; However much these paltry task-verses go against my stomach, I am, as you well know, never
					disposed to be silent, upon proper occasions, &#8211; &amp; the Kings death is certainly one of those occasions, on which
					I ought to produce something better than stuff for the fiddlers.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The annual
						New Year&#8217;s Ode that Southey was required to write as Poet Laureate, verses of which were set to music to be
						performed at court &#8211; though no such performance had taken place since 1810.</note> It will be expected, &#8211; &amp;
					what is of more consequence, it will be wished, by those whose wishes I should be sorry to disappoint. Since your
					letter arrived last night I have formed a plan.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of
							Judgement</title> (1821).</note> &#8211; Of the sort of mould in which it is to be cast I shall say nothing till I can
					send you a specimen. And I will begin at once &#8211; in the hope that I may not be hurried, but have time to proceed
					leisurely &amp; be ready before hand. Meantime let <ref type="m" target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Shields</ref>
					befiddle what he likes of the inclosed, if the alarm should pass over. And say something civil to him on my part. &#8211;
					Of course I shall make a point of calling on him when I come to town.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You are quite right not to buy the Squib you speak of, &#8211; there would be fewer such things if men
					considered the mischief they did by buying them. I suppose it is by <ref type="m" target="people.html#HoneWilliam">Hone</ref> himself, &#8211; a fellow whose acquittal I consider as one of the most disgraceful things that ever
					occurred in this country.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Hone was acquitted at three successive trials,
						18&#8211;20 December 1817, of blasphemous and seditious libel. The &#8216;squib&#8217; referred to here was Hone&#8217;s famous <title>The
							Political House that Jack Built</title> (1819).</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> A youth<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">George Tarbutt Vardon (b. 1803). In August 1817
						Southey had returned to Britain from his continental tour with Vardon, before the latter enrolled at Sandhust.
						Vardon emigrated to Canada in 1832 and held various posts in the Indian Department until forced to resign in
						1851.</note> for whom I am interested wants to purchase a commission in the army; &#8211; &amp; in these times it
					requires interest to effect this. <ref type="m" target="people.html#VardonMrs">His mother</ref> applies to me,
					&amp; asks if I can procure a letter for him to Sir H. Torrens.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Major-General Sir Henry Torrens (1779&#8211;1828; <title>DNB</title>), Military Secretary to the Commander-in-Chief
						1809&#8211;1820, and thus ultimately responsible for all personnel matters in the Army.</note> Can <ref type="m" target="people.html#HerriesJohnCharles">Herries</ref> assist me here? It is for George Vardon, a quondam pupil of
						Knox&#8217;s<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">John William Knox (1784&#8211;1862), clergyman, scholar and usher at
						Westminster School.</note> at Westminster, &amp; <del>since that time</del> he has been at Sandhurst, &#8211; on the
					score of breeding therefore nothing is wanting, &amp; nothing on the score of personal qualification, for he is a
					fine, manly, spirited youth. &#8211; George Maule married his Aunt.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">George Maule
						(1776&#8211;1851), Solicitor to the Treasury and friend of Southey&#8217;s at Oxford, married Mrs Vardon&#8217;s sister, Caroline
						Forsyth Tarbutt (dates unknown), in 1810.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Opps seem to be behaving with even more than their wonted villainy, for by God their conduct
					deserves no farther <del>danger</del> qualification.<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">The Whig opposition
