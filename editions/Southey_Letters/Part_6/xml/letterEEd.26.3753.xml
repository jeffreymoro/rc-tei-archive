                  materials on the Peninsular War of 1808&#8211;1813.</note> &amp; it will go for London
               by tomorrows coach. When it can be spared I shall be most glad to be favoured with it
               again. It will be of the greatest use to me when I reach the time where it

               the first volume to you, &amp; to Sir Augustus Frazer<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Augustus Simon Frazer (1776&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>), a
                  career soldier, had seen service in the Peninsular campaign of 1812&#8211;1813 as a
                  highly effective senior commander of horse artillery. He was Moor&#8217;s
                  brother-in-law, and it was Frazer&#8217;s papers that Moor had lent to Southey.</note>
               early in the ensuing spring. About sixty sheets are printed. This volume contains so
               much which is preliminary to the war, &amp; so much which is not military, that it
               will only come down to the end of Sir John Moores campaign.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The British commander, Sir John Moore (1761&#8211;1809; DNB). After a
                  highly controversial campaign, he was killed in battle at Corunna on 16 January
                  1809. Southey&#8217;s account concluded with the embarkation of the British forces after
                  Moore&#8217;s death; see the <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols
                  (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, p. 806.</note> No other two years, upon the same scale of
               narration, will occupy so much room as this one.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It would indeed have given me great pleasure to have seen you at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, &amp; to have shown you a
               country which even after Switzerland may certainly be seen with pleasure. On my

                  Southey&#8217;s return from his continental tour in May&#8211;August 1817.</note> I felt the
               poverty of our vales more than the inferiority of our mountains. But there is a charm
               of proportion here; &#8211; there is a sense of safety which in all the finest parts of
               Switzerland is wanting; we have no icey winds, &#8211; &amp; no goitres &#8211; which make ones
               heart ache in the Valais &amp; the Maurienne.</p>

               guests, &#8211; who are certainly beholden to him for their elevation, &#8211; whatever may have
               been the cause of their fall.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The exiled
                  Queen of Haiti, Marie-Louise Christophe (1778&#8211;1851), and her daughters,

                  the Clarksons at Playford Hall. Her husband, the ex-slave and revolutionary leader
                  Henri Christophe (1767&#8211;1820; King of Haiti, 1811&#8211;1820), had committed suicide the
                  previous year, faced with the collapse of his regime. Clarkson had carried out an
                  extensive correspondence with Christophe and acted as his adviser on European
                  affairs. He was instrumental in bringing Christophe&#8217;s family to Britain after the
                  King&#8217;s death and helped arrange their financial affairs. They moved to Italy in
                  1824; neither daughter married.</note> If I were T. Clarkson<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Clarkson (1796&#8211;1837), son of Catherine and
