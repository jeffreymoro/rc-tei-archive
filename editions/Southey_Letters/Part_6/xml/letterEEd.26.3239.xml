        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your little volume.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Cottle, <title>Messiah: in Twenty-Four Books. Part the
                     Second</title> (1819).</note> It always gives me great pleasure to hear from
               you, &#8211; &amp; that pleasure would have had no drawback upon this occasion, if the
               letter had contained a better account of your eyesight. I agree in the main with the
               opinions which you have expressed in the preface, except as to the censure which you
               have pronounced upon the Alexandrine.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Cottle, <title>Messiah: in Twenty-Four Books. Part the Second</title>
                  (London, 1819). The preface justified the experimental metre of Cottle&#8217;s poem.
                  This was ridiculed in the <title>Monthly Review</title>, 92 (August 1820),
                  406&#8211;409. The review concluded that &#8216;Mr. Cottle must undeceive himself &#8230; He has not
                  a ray, nor a shadow, of the genius of a poet&#8217; (409).</note>
          <del>But I cannot say that</del> My own practise is to say as little as possible by
               way of preface, &amp; when I make any innovations upon established usages of poetry,
               &amp; introduce any experiments in versification, to leave the reader to find them
               out for himself, &amp; discover if he can upon what principle I have proceeded.
               Kehama I believe passed thro the reviews without the slightest remark upon the
               novelties of this kind which it contained: whereas if I had called attention to them,
               they would <del>of xx</del> have been abused as a matter of course.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Curse of Kehama</title> (1810). Southey
                  was being slightly disingenuous, because contemporary critics had pointed out its
                  irregular metrics. See, for example, the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, 17
                  (February 1811), 429&#8211;465, which critiqued the use of irregular metre and singled
                  out passages that were &#8216;extremely offensive to &#8230; [the reviewer&#8217;s] ears&#8217;,
                  &#8216;detestable in rhythm, style and conception&#8217;, full of &#8216;harsh and noisy bombast&#8217;
                  and characterised by &#8216;pure childishness and sing-song&#8217; (451&#8211;453), though it did
                  find sections of which it approved.</note> It is best to keep ones own counsel in
               such cases. By &amp; bye critics will take merit to themselves for analysing the
               metre, &amp; pointing out its beauties. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It will not be very long before I shall hope to send you the
               concluding volume of my Brazilian history &#8211; of which 63 sheets are printed; &amp; I
               &amp; the printer (your old acquaintance <ref type="m" target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</ref>) are steadily proceeding towards the
               end of our respective labours.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The third
                  and final volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> The
               volume is exceedingly curious, being for the greater part, drawn from unpublished
               documents. It contains the history of the expulsion of the Jesuits, &amp; the
               consequent <del>overthrow</del> &lt;destruction&gt; of their meritorious labours.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The expulsion of the Jesuits from Brazil in
