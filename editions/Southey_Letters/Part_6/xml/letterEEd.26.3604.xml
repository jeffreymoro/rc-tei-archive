                  Letter 3603.</note> I have some objections, which appear to me of considerable weight, against this Constitutional Association.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Constitutional Association was formed in 1821 to produce anti-radical propaganda and support
                  the prosecution of radical publications.</note> In the first place it is reversing the order of things. Government is endangered by
               a devilish Press, &amp; instead of fairly attacking an evil which it must controul, or be destroyed by it, it wishes to keep aloof,
               &amp; leave individuals to associate for its defence. That is, we are to protect Gov. instead of being protected by it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Secondly &#8211; political associations in turbulent times are very dangerous things. Clubs may be met by clubs,
               Anti&#8211;Jacobine by Jacobine, &#8211; till we come to Club law.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Were it the system of the country, I should not object to a police as severe as that of Alfred,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Alfred the Great (849&#8211;899; King of Wessex 871&#8211;899; <title>DNB</title>). During his reign, groups of ten households
                  were formed into &#8216;tythings&#8217; to protect their property and deliver criminals to justice. In effect, members were responsible for one
                  anothers&#8217; actions and the community could be fined for individuals&#8217; wrongdoing.</note> &#8211; which would leave no man loose upon
               society. &#8211; But I do not like to embody myself as a political <hi rend="ital">Familiar</hi>. God knows from no fear of popular odium, &#8211;
               nor with any wish to shrink from responsibility, or notice, if that were possible. That I have shown, &amp; by Gods blessing will show.
               But I do not like this mode of acting, because Government can &amp; ought to do all that is meant to be done by this Association.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Tell me what you think of this subject.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have had a severe shock in the death of my poor little friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref>, who left us only in November, having passed four months with us. Of the last five years we have been companions at home
               &amp; abroad more than one, &#8211; &amp; a more thoroughly amiable man I never knew. &#8211; How many pleasant recollections are turned to eysel
