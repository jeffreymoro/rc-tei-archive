        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is a long while since I have seen you, &#8211; &amp; you once expressed
               an unwillingness to write to me, lest some Curle or <ref type="m" target="people.html#PhillipsRichard">Sir Richard</ref>, or some (more
               innocent) <ref type="m" target="people.html#NicholsJohn">John Nichols</ref> in after
               times should get hold of such letters as I might have neglected to destroy.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Edmund Curle (d. 1747; <title>DNB</title>),
                  bookseller and controversial publisher. He had attracted notoriety for publishing
                  private letters by Alexander Pope (1688&#8211;1744; <title>DNB</title>), though it is
                  now acknowledged that he was tricked by the latter into so doing. John Nichols was
                  an inveterate collector, editor and publisher of literary manuscripts. They, along
                  with Richard Phillips, are, for Southey and Elmsley, examples of members of the
                  literary trade who catered to the public appetite for knowledge of authors and in
                  so doing profited from the writings of others.</note> Perhaps I understood this
               more seriously than it was meant. &#8211; Be that as it may, I wish you would let me know
               what books of mine you have not received from <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmans</ref>, &#8211; if there be any besides the
               third vol: of Brazil, &amp; the Life of Wesley,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The third volume of the <title>History of Brazil</title>
                  (1810&#8211;1819) and <title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of
                     Methodism</title> (1820).</note> &#8211; that I may direct them to be sent to you. It
               is not in my nature to be unmindful of old acts of kindness, or ungrateful for them;
               &#8211; &amp; I hope yet to add many volumes to your shelves, which may not be unworthy of
               a place there, but which at any rate may serve sometimes to recall me to your
               remembrance.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I heard of you at the Ambrosian Library,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Biblioteca Ambrosiana, a library in Milan (opened 1609),
                  containing a huge number of medieval manuscripts. Southey had visited on 14 June
                  1817. Elmsley was a frequent visitor to Italy, especially to work on classical
                  manuscripts.</note> &amp; from some Englishmen with whom I fell in in Switzerland,
               &#8211; Oakley I think was the name of one, Hendrick of another, a third was a younger man
               whose name I did not learn, but who wore notable mustachos, &amp; was in Hendricks
                  company.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified beyond the
                  information given here. Southey met these travellers on 5 July 1817 near Berne,
                  Switzerland.</note> It would have been a great pleasure to me to have met you,
               &amp; I did count upon the possibility, because you were then upon your way from
               Italy. &#8211; Last year I was in Scotland, for the only time since our journey to
                  Edinburgh.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had visited Scotland
                  from 17 August to 1 October 1819; see <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in
                     1819</title> (1929), ed. Charles Harold Herford. He had previously visited
                  Edinburgh with Elmsley in October 1805; see Southey to Charles Watkin Williams
                  Wynn, 20 October 1805, <title>The Collected Letters of Robert Southey. Part
                     Three</title>, Letter 1113.</note> During the short time that I was in that
               city (only three days) I called upon Laing,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The bookseller William Laing (1764&#8211;1832), father of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LaingDavid">David Laing</ref>.</note> whom I found as
               evergreen as a Scotch fir, &#8211; apparently not an hour older than he had been fourteen
               years before. <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Scott</ref> was
               not in town. I was with <ref type="m" target="people.html#RickmanJohn">Rickman</ref>, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#TelfordThomas">Telford
                  the Engineer</ref>, with whom I went to look at the Highland Roads &amp; the
               Caledonian Canal; &#8211; a six weeks tour. Of course I saw nothing of <ref type="m" target="people.html#JeffreyFrancis">Gog</ref> in Edinburgh.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <del>Fourt</del> Fifteen years have gone by since you were at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdithMay">the little child</ref> who

               I have had six children born, &amp; have buried two of them, &#8211; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHerbert">one</ref> upon whom I had
               bestowed five years of tuition, &amp; who was in all respects the most promising
               creature that ever my eyes beheld.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">The six
                  children were: Herbert, <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEmma">Emma</ref>,

                  1809, and Herbert in 1816.</note> This was a tremendous stroke, which cut me to
               the core; &amp; if it had not been for the firm belief that Death would restore all
               that it had taken, I am sure that I should have sunk under it. &#8211; But I have lived
               long enough to know that we outlive our griefs. &#8211; I have now <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">another son</ref>,
               born after an interval of seven years, &amp; consequently (our time of life
               considered) after all expectation of another had ceased. He is at present 20 months
               old, &amp; I would tell you how fine a creature he is, if the thought did not come
               across me that I had once written to you in terms of exultation concerning <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaretEdithdau">my first
               child</ref>; &#8211; &amp; that the letter could scarcely have
               reached you before she was stricken with her mortal disease.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Few men however have cause to be more grateful for their lot. Rich
               indeed I shall never be. Since you were here I have twice been disinherited of an
               ample property,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey and his brothers
                  had inherited nothing from their wealthy paternal uncles <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyJohn">John</ref> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyThomasUncle">Thomas Southey</ref> on their
                  deaths.</note> &amp; one chance more has been frustrated by Lord Somervilles
               having willed away the Southey estates to which I was heir at law, &amp; which were
               intended to descend to me if he died without issue.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819;
                     <title>DNB</title>), agricultural reformer and third cousin of Southey, had
                  died on 5 October 1819. This produced a further round of legal tangles over the
                  Fitzhead estate in Somerset that Somerville had inherited from his great uncle
                  John Cannon Southey (d. 1768). On his death, John Cannon Southey had left a
                  complex, ill-advised will which named Somerville his primary heir, and should he
                  die without heirs, Southey&#8217;s father and two uncles as the residuary legatees,
                  their rights passing, in turn, to their children. Of the three Southey brothers
                  only Southey&#8217;s father married, leading the poet (encouraged by his Aunt Mary) to
                  believe (after the death of his father and paternal uncles) that he and his
                  brothers were the rightful heirs to the Fitzhead estate. After taking legal
                  advice, though, Southey decided not to pursue the matter.</note> But as in the two
               first cases the caprice of a testator deprived me of what the law would have awarded;
               so in this the law interfered to cut me off from what a testator designed to give. It
               is well that I had never reckoned upon such chances. My castles in the air have been
               of a different kind. &#8211; I have rubbed on up the hill, &amp; made my way in spite of
               many impediments &amp; encumbrances. My means have kept pace with a growing
               expenditure. It is true that this depends upon the continuance of health &amp;
               faculties, &amp; that the stroke which disables me will also cut off my &lt;main&gt;
               resources. But I live in hope. What with my books, copyrights &amp; papers, &amp; a
               life insurance for 4000&#163; (which is now worth 5) if I died tomorrow, there would be
               ten thousand pounds for my family. And if it please God that I live ten years &amp;
               continue to do well, I have plans &amp; engagements which will enable me to lay by
               not less than 5000&#163;.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I would not have gone into this strain if I had not thought

               summer when you have no better movement in contemplation, &amp; occupy your old
               quarters. The quarters you would find much improved, &amp; myself, I think;
               externally the worse for wear, but I trust somewhat the better within. I am not a
               young man of my years, &#8211; &amp; one unequivocal proof of the effect of years is, that
               I neither write verses <del>now with</del> willingly, nor with ease. If my own

                  Hippocrene was created from his hoof-print, and all who drank of it received
