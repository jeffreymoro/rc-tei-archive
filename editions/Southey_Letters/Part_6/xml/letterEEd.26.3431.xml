        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have a letter from poor <ref type="m" target="people.html#HamondElton">Elton Hamond</ref> begun
					on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of May last, &amp; finished on the day before he effected his long meditated
						purpose.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Hamond committed suicide on 1 January 1820. The letter Southey
						mentions had been started by Hamond on 15 May 1819 and contained two postscripts dated 28 and 31 December 1819.
						The MS is in Dr Williams&#8217;s Library. </note> He refers me to you, in case I should think proper to consult his
					younger sister<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Harriott Hamond (b. 1788), who had shared a house with her
						brother.</note> before I read her letters. I hope you anticipate what I shall do upon this subject, &#8211; which will
					be to open the box &amp; seal up those letters in your presence, &amp; deposit them in your hands to be returned to
					her. Some parts of his letter seem clearly to indicate an insane as well as a wounded mind.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> He says &#8220;in all pecuniary matters confer with Mr J. Kirkman Miller,&#8221;<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Kirkman Miller (1785&#8211;1855), Vicar of Walkeringham 1819&#8211;1855; he was Hamond&#8217;s cousin.</note>
					whose address he gives me. There is no occasion to confer with any person upon that topic. If there be any thing
					worthy of publication, the bookseller will gladly undertake the charge, &amp; I shall have only to ascertain to
					which of his relatives the eventual profits may with most propriety be assigned.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As I have not received any communication from the family, I begin to apprehend that none will be
					made. May I therefore request that you will direct the papers to be sent to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">my brothers</ref> in <ref type="m" target="places.html#QueenAnneSt">Queen
						Anne Street &#8211; N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 15</ref>. I ask you to take this trouble, as supposing that you may be known
					at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Maskells,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified; presumably the person who
						had custody of Elton Hamond&#8217;s papers.</note> &amp; therefore, that no objection will be made to delivering
					them.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This evening I have received a letter from M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. A. Cowan,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified. Letters sent to him by Hamond in 1817&#8211;1819 are now in Dr Williams&#8217;s
						Library. </note> offering me some letters of <ref type="m" target="people.html#HamondElton">Elton Hamond&#8217;s</ref>,
					according to his desire. Perhaps this is the person who published an odd book called Anthropaideia, about eighteen
					years ago,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Andrew Cowan (dates unknown), <title>Anthropaideia: or, a
							Tractate on General Education</title> (1803). Cowan was an American physician, who studied at Columbia College,
						New York, and the University of Edinburgh. He should not be confused with the Andrew Cowan lost in South Africa in
						1808; see note 8, below.</note> &amp; who was intimate with Bristed.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John
						Bristed (1778&#8211;1855), born in England and educated at Winchester School, he later emigrated to America, became a
						minister in the Episcopalian church and prolific author. He married Magdalen (1788&#8211;1832), the eldest daughter of
						John Jacob Astor (1763&#8211;1848), in c. 1820. Bristed and Andrew Cowan were fellow students at the University of
						Edinburgh. They made an eventful journey together in 1801, Bristed passing as an American, to avoid any
						anti-English sentiment, and clad in a cat-skin cap and green spectacles. His disguise did not have the desired
						effect, and during their visit to Dundee they were detained as spies and had to obtain testimonies from fellow
						students in order to secure their release; see John Bristed, <title>&#913;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;; or A Pedestrian Tour Through
							Part of the Highlands of Scotland, in 1801</title>, 2 vols (London, 1803). In addition, Bristed used the
						&#8216;Preface&#8217; to <title>A Pedestrian Tour</title> to provide a detailed account of the virtues and faults (many
						typographical) of Cowan&#8217;s <title>Anthropaideia</title> (I, pp. xv&#8211;lxxv). </note> But I am not sure of this,
					because I remember that a D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cowan perished in an attempt to travel from the Cape to the
					Portugueze settlements in Sofala,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Andrew Cowan (1778&#8211;1808?),
						Assistant-Surgeon to the 83rd Regiment. In 1808 he led an ambitious expedition to cross the African subcontinent
						from the Cape in the south-west to Sofala in Mozambique in the north-east, and thus explore areas unknown to
						European settlers. This left Cape Town on 29 September 1808. It reached the Klaarwater mission station, but did
						not make its next intended calling point, and on 24 August 1809 Cowan was declared dead. Later travellers claimed
						to find evidence of the murder of Cowan and his men, but when and by whom was a matter of increasing dispute.
						Southey&#8217;s recollection of Cowan was possibly gleaned from John Barrow&#8217;s (1764&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>) review of
						John Campbell (1766&#8211;1840; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Travels in South Africa, Undertaken at the Request of the
							Missionary Society</title> (1815), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 13 (July 1815), 309&#8211;340 (esp.
						326&#8211;327).</note> &amp; Bristed&#8217;s friend was a likely man to have engaged in such an enterprize.</p>
