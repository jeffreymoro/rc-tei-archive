					Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I give you joy of your escape from late hours in the H. C. &amp; a summer in London,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Parliament had risen for the summer recess on 13 July 1819.</note> &#8211; I congratulate
					you upon exchanging gas lights for the moon &amp; stars, &amp; the pavement of Whitehall for your noble terraces, &#8211;
					which I never can think of without pleasure, because they are beautiful in themselves, &amp; carry one back to old
					times: &#8211; any thing which does this, does one good. Were I to build a mansion with the means of <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref> or Lord Grosvenor,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (1767&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>), fabulously wealthy landowner.</note> I
					would certainly make hanging gardens if the ground permitted it. They have a character of grandeur &amp; of
					permanence, &#8211; without which nothing can be truly grand. And they are fine even in decay.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I will come to you for a day or two on my way to town, about the beginning of December. This will
					be a flying visit, &#8211; but one of these summers &#8211; or autumns, &#8211; I should like dearly to finish the projected circuit
					with you, which <ref type="m" target="people.html#CorryIsaac">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Curry</ref> cut short in the
					year 1801 when he sent for the most unfit man in the world to be his Secretary, &#8211; having nothing whatever for him
					to do. And many years must not be suffered to go by, &#8211; <del>the</del> &lt;my&gt; next birthday will be the forty fifth, &#8211;
					&amp; every year will take something from the inclination to move, &amp; perhaps also from the power of enjoyment. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You give me the first intimation of <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byrons</ref>
					attack. &#8211; He is welcome to all the gratification &amp; all the credit which he may derive from it.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The first two cantos of Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819&#8211;1824) were published
						anonymously on 15 July 1819. The &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, which attacked Southey and others, was suppressed. It soon became
						very well known, though it was not published until 1833.</note> There is an old remedy for the bite of a scorpion,
					&#8211; that of setting your foot upon the venomous reptile, &amp; binding it upon the wound.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Common-Place Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1850), II, p. 599,

							Tour Made at the Expense of the Society of Dilettanti</title>, 2 vols (London, 1817), II, p. 147, no. 643 in the
						sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> &#8211; But I am not ambitious of distinguishing myself in this way. When I
					replied to <ref type="m" target="people.html#SmithWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Smith</ref>,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Letter to William Smith, Esq., M. P.</title> (1817).</note> the slander
					derived an importance from the <del>place</del> &lt;assembly&gt; in which it was uttered, &amp; I paid that respect to
					the place which I never should have done to the person. <del>And then</del> My letter to <ref type="m" target="people.html#BroughamHenryPeter">Brougham</ref>
          <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s riposte to
						Brougham&#8217;s reported attack on him from the hustings at Appleby on 30 June 1818 was not finished; part of it was
						published as a &#8216;Postscript&#8217; to the second edition of <title>Carmen Triumphale</title> (London, 1821), pp.
						45&#8211;53.</note> as far as it went, was written, with, at least as much vigour, as any thing that I ever produced in
					prose, &#8211; &amp; <del>had it been filled up &amp; finished I believe it would have been</del> I was prepared to fill
					it up, &amp; finish it in the same strain. But I was easily persuaded to lay it aside, &amp; return to my own quiet
					researches among the Jesuits &amp; the wilds of South America.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
							<title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> &#8211; Any body may attack me with impunity. I am better employed
					than in resenting offences which do me no hurt.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I was not disappointed with Crabbes Tales.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">George Crabbe
						(1754&#8211;1832; <title>DNB</title>), <title>Tales of the Hall</title> (1819), no. 755 in the sale catalogue of
						Southey&#8217;s library.</note> He is a decided mannerist, &#8211; but so are all original writers &#8211; in all ages. Nor is it
					possible for a poet to avoid it if he writes much in the same key, &amp; upon the same class of subjects. &#8211; Crabbes
					poems will have a great &amp; lasting value as pictures of domestic life, &#8211; elucidating the moral history of these
					times, &#8211; times which must hold a most conspicuous place in history. He knows his own powers, &amp; never aims above
					his reach. In this age when the public are greedy for novelties, &amp; abundantly supplied with them, an author may
					easily commit the error of giving them too much of the same kind of thing. But this will not be thought a fault
					hereafter, where the kind is good, <del>x</del> or the thing good of its kind.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If I have been at all successful in endeavouring to avoid the appearance of mannerism it is
					because I have been aware of the danger, &#8211; &amp; when the character of the poem would permit, have for that reason,
					cast it in a different metre from its predecessors. I speak of my long poems &#8211; the <hi rend="ital">minora</hi>
          <note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;smaller&#8217;, as in Southey&#8217;s collected <title>Minor Poems</title> (1815).</note>
					you know are to be regarded as flocce&#8211;nocce-nihili pili.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">A nonsense word,
						meaning &#8216;unimportant&#8217;.</note> And for this reason, if I should ever begin another poem of any length (which is
					very unlikely) I believe I should write it in hexameters, &#8211; which I am perfectly certain <del>xxx</del> I could
					write with success.<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821)
						was written in hexameters.</note> But if I live to finish Oliver Newman,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s unfinished epic, set in New England. The completed sections were published after Southey&#8217;s death in
							<title>Oliver Newman: A New-England Tale (Unfinished): With Other Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp.
						1&#8211;90. The poem used the irregular, unrhymed metre employed in <title>Thalaba the Destroyer</title> (1801).</note>
