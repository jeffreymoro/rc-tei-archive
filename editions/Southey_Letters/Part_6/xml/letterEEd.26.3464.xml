        <p rend="indent1"> I leave home on Monday next, bound for Llangedwin,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Home of Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, in North
                  Wales.</note> where if I am lucky enough to hit the coaches &amp; find room, I may
               arrive on Tuesday night. My intention is to reach Ludlow on the Saturday, or at
               latest on the Monday &amp; to stay there two clear days. This will depend upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">Wynns</ref> movements for
               London. But I shall be in town either on Wednesday the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> or
               Friday the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. And I will let you know on which day to expect
               me, as soon as that point can be settled.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My Vision of Judgement is not finished.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821). Southey had
                  written less than half of the finished version.</note> I have made a fair
               transcript of it as far as it is written, (260 lines) &amp; may probably add
               something to it before my departure. But I think it will not do for publication at
               this time; because <del>th</del> such <del>are</del> an event as the Kings
                  death,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of
                  Great Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) had died on 29 January 1820.</note>
               while it is recent, is too affecting &amp; too solemn a reality (in the present case)
               to be made the subject of a fiction. This you will say I ought to have considered
               before I began to write. Very true, &#8211; but then I should not have written upon the
               subject. For certain as it was that every body would be putting their wits in
               requisition, I should not have chosen to send any thing into the world upon
                  <del>this</del> such an occasion unless it were altogether different from all
               other compositions that were to be expected.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If however my labour should be lost for the present (&amp; if the
               objection to its publication strikes any person to whom I shall show it, as it does
               myself I shall certainly lay it aside), <del>x</del> it will not be thrown away. The
               metrical experiment which I have long been desirous of making, has here been fairly
               made, &amp; with compleat success. I have proved that hexameters may as well be
               written in English as in German; that they are in no respect dissuited to the genius
               of our language; &amp; that the measure is full, stately &amp; sonorous, capable of
               great variety, great sweetness &amp; great strength. I shall certainly finish the
               poem, that it may be ready for publication after such lapse of time as may remove the
               objection to its appearance. <del>xxxxx x</del>

               you will attribute the perversity to me, or my fortunes, but a perversity in one or
               the other, or both, there is. Twenty years ago when I would gladly have written poems
               as fast as the printer could carry them thro the Press, &#8211; <del>xx</del> I must have
               starved if I had done so, &#8211; &amp; during seven long years I wrote reviews at seven
               pounds per sheet royal, because Thalaba &amp; Madoc were lying in the publishers
                  warehouse.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">While <title>Thalaba the

               inclination for it is gone; &amp; if it were not with a view to profit, I do not
               believe that I should ever finish either of the poems which I have begun,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Oliver Newman&#8217;, Southey&#8217;s epic, set in New
                  England was never finished. The completed sections were published after Southey&#8217;s
                  death in <title>Oliver Newman: A New-England Tale (Unfinished): With Other
                     Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1&#8211;90. However, he did complete

               should never have courage to <del>x</del> undertake another. That motive however is
               likely to operate with increasing force as long as I live, &amp; as I am likely
               according to all probability to die in the harness, I have only to hope that my
               strength may not fail me till the last.</p>
