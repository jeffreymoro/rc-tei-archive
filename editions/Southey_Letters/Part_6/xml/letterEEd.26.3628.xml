					you may be pleased to compose for the occasion.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The volume was a specially
						bound copy of <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), to be presented to George IV.</note> I would write to
					him myself, &#8211; but it is better that the matter should seem to be your doing than mine. There are plenty of persons
					who would be glad to present it, &#8211; but your thought had occurred to me also.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Why the printing is delayed I cannot conceive. It is more than three weeks since I corrected the
					last part of the poem, &amp; they have not yet sent me proofs of the notes &amp; preface. In the latter I have made
					friendly mention of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Taylor</ref>, in
					reference to his hexameters.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">In the &#8216;Preface&#8217; to his poem, Southey had cited
						Taylor&#8217;s metrical experiments of the 1790s as proof of &#8216;the practicability of the hexameter&#8217;, <title>A Vision of
							Judgement</title> (London, 1821), p. xxvii. The experiments were Taylor&#8217;s translations from Friedrich Gottlieb
						Klopstock (1724&#8211;1803), <title>Der Messias</title> (1748&#8211;1773), published in the <title>Monthly Magazine</title>, 2

						(January 1801), 501&#8211;505; and Taylor&#8217;s own composition &#8216;The Show, an English Eclogue&#8217; in Robert Southey (ed.),
							<title>The Annual Anthology</title>, 2 vols (Bristol, 1799&#8211;1800), II, pp. 200&#8211;210.</note> I shall be abused on
					all sides, which will be very entertaining.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> There is an amusing account of my Life of Wesley<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>The Life of Wesley; and The Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> in the last Evangelical
					Magazine, it treats me with sovereign contempt for my ignorance of theology &amp; ecclesiastical history, &amp;
					very kindly consigns me to damnation at the end.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Evangelical Magazine
							and Missionary Chronicle</title>, 29 (February 1821), 65&#8211;68. It attacked Southey&#8217;s ignorance (67) and concluded:
						&#8216;Mr. Southey &#8230; writes like &#8220;a man of the world,&#8221; to please the world: and he will have his reward &#8211; &#8220;the world
						will love its own.&#8221; But the great question is &#8211; Will God be pleased? Will the writer receive the plaudit of the
						great Judge at the last day? Will he say to the author of this work &#8211; &#8220;Well done! good and faithful servant?&#8221; The
						conscience of the writer and the judgment of the reader will answer the question&#8217; (68). </note> This is the best
					six penny worth that I have had for some time. &#8211; The Wesleyan Green-bag has perplexed me, &amp; made me (which is
					not unusual) quite undecided what to believe.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been sent
						potentially damaging information about an inappropriate relationship between John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791;
							<title>DNB</title>), the founder of Methodism, and a younger female follower, Elizabeth Briggs (1751&#8211;1822); see
						Southey to James Everett, 7 February 1821, Letter 3626. Two green bags, one for the House of Lords and one for the
						House of Commons, had contained the evidence (much of it highly salacious) in support of the Bill of Pains and
						Penalties to deprive Caroline of Brunswick (1768&#8211;1821; <title>DNB</title>) of her title of Queen and dissolve her
						marriage to George IV.</note> Had the evidence been compleat, I must certainly have published the fact, giving the
					letter at length &amp; the proofs, &#8211; &amp; it would have gone off like a powder-barrel in the midst of the
					Methodists. But upon any thing short of what would be legal evidence I cannot but hesitate in fixing upon such a
					man as Wesley a spot that must blacken his reputation. Now it seems the original letter is not in <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonGloster">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilsons</ref> possession,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been informed that the letter containing evidence of John Wesley&#8217;s impropriety was in
						the possession of Glocester Wilson, and had written to him for more information; see Southey to [Glocester Wilson],
						29 December 1820. However, the letter Wilson possessed was only a copy. He had received this from his mother and
						she had, in turn, been given it some years before by Wesley&#8217;s estranged wife, Mary (1709/10&#8211;1781). </note> what
						M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wesley gave his mother was a copy only: had it been the original it might have been
					possible to identify the handwriting. As it is, I am inclined to suspect that it was a scheme of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wesleys to blast her husbands character, for she told M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilson that she considered
					her life to be in her danger from him, &amp; a woman who could say that would not scruple at producing a
					supposititious letter.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Vazeille was a widow at the time of her marriage
						to John Wesley in 1751. Their relationship was troubled, and on 23 January 1771 Mary left her husband for the
						final time. </note> So I shall let the matter rest, till a new edition of the life be wanted: by that time it is
					possible that some new light may appear upon the subject, &#8211; &amp; (what is more likely) the story will find its way
					into the world thro some other channel, &amp; I shall only have to repeat it, &amp; express the grounds of my
					hesitating to accredit it.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey never made public use of this information
						about Wesley.</note>
