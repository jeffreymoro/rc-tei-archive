        <p rend="indent1"> All is going on well. &#8211; If you have any surplus money of mine after your large purchase in the stocks, let me have it.
               For the last three months I have been working hard &amp; earning nothing; &amp; it will be at least a month more before the Brazil is
                  finished.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), III, p.
                  879, bore the final date &#8216;<hi rend="ital">Keswick, June 23d</hi>, 1819.&#8217;</note> But then I shall &lt;have&gt; accomplished my Opus
                  Majus,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Major work&#8217;.</note> &#8211; on which I might be contented to rest for reputation, tho every
               thing else which I have done should perish. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This has been a trying week to me. Both <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Mother</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Child</ref> were in considerable peril, &#8211; &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#EdmondsonDr">Edmondson</ref> absolutely despaired of saving the child, &#8211; but the <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Mother</ref> heard him say so, &amp; that occasioned an extraordinary effort on her part, which
               was the human means of saving one life, &amp; perhaps both. &#8211; </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I intend to call him <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>. If any one asks why, it
               is reason enough that I like genuine English names, &amp; such as are peculiar without being fantastic. &#8211; But you may, for your own
               satisfaction, find the secret feeling that leads me to chuse it, in a legend which <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> has versified, &#8211; as an inscription for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Herberts Island.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth&#8217;s &#8216;Inscription: For the Spot where the Hermitage Stood on St. Herbert&#8217;s Island, Derwent-Water&#8217; (1800). The
                  poem recounts how St Herbert (d. 687; <title>DNB</title>) lived in seclusion, but prayed that he and his friend, St Cuthbert (c.
                  634&#8211;687; <title>DNB</title>), should die at the same time &#8211; a prayer that was granted. The name &#8216;Cuthbert&#8217; indissolubly linked the
                  new child to his dead older brother, Herbert, as did his other name, &#8216;Charles&#8217;, the name of both his godparents, Bedford and Wynn,
                  who had also been Herbert&#8217;s godparents.</note> So, if you do not like the name (which yet, for its own sake, deserves to be liked) &#8211;
               do not object to it. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have seen <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonJohn">Wilsons</ref> German-account of me in the newspapers.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title>, 4 (January 1819), 396&#8211;404, &#8216;Letters from the Lakes.
                  (Translated from the German of Philip Kempferhausen &#8211; written in the Summer of 1818.)&#8217;, Letter II (400&#8211;404) described the author
                  meeting Southey at Greta Hall. The author was actually John Wilson.</note> Can we wonder at the thunders &amp; exaggerations with
               which the biography is filled! Much personal opportunity of <del>see</del> knowing me he has not had, &#8211; for I could not tolerate his
               manner of life enough to accept the advances which he made towards an intimacy. But he must heard enough of me from those who know
                  <del>my</del> me &amp; my habits well. And yet in all that he says about my allotment of time there is no other foundation of truth
               than that when I could not afford to write poetry at any other time, I wrote it before breakfast, and counted it as so much gained from
                  sleep.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title>, 4 (January 1819), 403: &#8216;His whole time
                  was subdivided, he said, into distinct duties and tasks &#8211; and when the work of one was performed, he felt himself always ready for
                  the new labour and delight of the next.&#8217;</note> You will easily suppose that neither flattery nor obloquy have much effect upon one
               who has been so much accustomed to both. I am only sorry that he has spoken in such absurd terms of my library: which is only
               extraordinarily good in relation to the circumstances of its possessor.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Blackwood&#8217;s
                     Edinburgh Magazine</title>, 4 (January 1819), 402: &#8216;I saw one of the noblest private libraries in England &#8211; certainly the richest
                  of any in Spanish and Portuguese literature.&#8217;</note> &#8211; The letter is Germanish enough in all conscience; &#8211; but he forgets his
               assumed character when he represents me as making puns to a foreigner, &#8211; which would be throwing pearls before swine.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title>, 4 (January 1819), 401, in which Southey is represented as
                  beginning his conversation with the supposedly German author with &#8216;two of those little witticisms called puns&#8217;.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You mistake my case &amp; therefore reason wrongly about my palliative experiment of the milk. I never had heart-burn
               but twice in my life. What I seek to mitigate is the pain occasioned in the throat by the discharge of the acrid matter from the
               stomach. &amp; my intention is to assist the vomiting by draughts of warm milk &amp; water, instead of warm water only, &#8211; merely to
               sheath the acid on its passage. But I hope the necessity will not recur soon. I shall be drawn out of doors when <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyTom">Tom</ref> makes his removal in March, &#8211; &amp; my journey to London towards the end of April will
               shake me into order again. </p>
