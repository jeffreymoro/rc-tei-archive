        <p rend="indent1"> I was truly glad to hear from you, &amp; should have been still more
               so if your letter had given a more favourable account of <ref type="m" target="people.html#PeachyMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Peachy</ref>. But
               I hope that if the air of Bath disagrees with her, &#8211; or its gayeties are too much for
               her strength, that <del>xx</del> Clifton will set her up again. I have an old
                  affection<del>ate</del> for Durdham Down,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was familiar with Bath, Clifton and Durdham Down from his youth,
                  which had been largely spent in the area.</note> &#8211; &amp; &#8211; if it were possible to
               forget lost friends in the scenes of youth &amp; boyhood, &#8211; I could almost fancy that
               I <del>ne</del> could never breeze its atmosphere without feeling something of the
               exhilaration which it always used to impart. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I think I shall not see you at Clifton, &#8211; &amp; indeed because of
               such recollections, I should rather see you any where else. Bristol is the last place
               I ever wish to revisit, &#8211; there is something singularly painful in revisiting ones
               birth place, &#8211; the <del>sc</del> place too in which some of the busiest years of life
               have been past, &amp; seeing none but strange faces in the streets. But you will
               probably have left Clifton before I can begin my travels, &#8211; for I have work which
               must be done before I take my furlough, &amp; that work seems to grow under my hand.
               It will not be possible for me to move before the very end of April. But wherever you
               are I shall find you, &#8211; &amp; perhaps hit you some where on your way to the North,
               when I also shall have set my face in that direction. </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is somewhat remarkable that I intended to have applied to you for
               information upon the very subject which the Bishop of Meath<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Lewis O&#8217;Beirne (1747&#8211;1823; <title>DNB</title>), Bishop
                  of Meath 1798&#8211;1823. The son of a County Longford farmer, he had been educated for
                  the Catholic priesthood, but converted to Protestantism and became a Church of
                  Ireland clergyman. Southey had met him in the Lake District in 1811. </note> has
               mentioned. Some time ago I obtained some account of Lady Isabella Kings

                     Robert Southey. Part One</title>, Letter 263. Southey had asked him for
                  information about Lady Isabella Lettice King (1772&#8211;1845; <title>DNB</title>) and
                  her foundation, the Ladies&#8217; Association of Bath (1816), which was based at
                  Bailbrook House, near Bath; see Southey to John Rickman, 12 October 1817,

               before the public at that time, if I could have hoped to draw attention towards

                  Rickman had worked on the idea of establishing a &#8216;female College&#8217;, in which poor
                  single women would live and work together. Modelled on the beguinages, lay
                  communities of Catholic women found in the Low Countries, it was first proposed by
                  Rickman in a letter to Southey of 4 January 1800, Orlo Williams, <title>Lamb&#8217;s

               ordinary summer. The mountain summits were entirely clear of snow till the last week
               in January, none that had fallen before that time ever remaining twelve hours. The
               valley has been covered but once, &amp; then scarcely inch deep, &amp; only for half
               a day. But we have had heavy gales; which have broken down a tree in front of the
               house, &#8211; &amp; given a most perilous shake to the kitchen chimney, a very lofty one,
               which if it falls, comes upon our bed room. According to the laws of projectiles I
               have satisfied myself &lt;&#8211; <hi rend="ital">si fractus illabatur</hi>,<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">An adaptation of Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65&#8211;8
