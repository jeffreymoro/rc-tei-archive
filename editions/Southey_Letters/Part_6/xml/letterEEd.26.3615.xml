                  stating: &#8216;The same perfect integrity has been manifested in the whole administration of public affairs&#8217; (vi); not a view the Whig
                  opposition endorsed. However, the earlier draft of the &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, in Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733, shows Southey had
                  intended to go much further and urge that &#8216;adequate remedy should be applied to that intolerable licentiousness of the press &#8230;
                  either by the vigorous application of existing laws or by the enactment of such new ones as the suspension of the abuse may render
