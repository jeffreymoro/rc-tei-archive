                  journalist, was fatally wounded in a duel on 16 February 1821 and died eleven days
                  later. His opponent was Jonathan Henry Christie (1792&#8211;1876), the London
                  representative of <title>Blackwood&#8217;s Edinburgh Magazine</title> (1817&#8211;1980), with
                  which Scott was engaged in a bitter quarrel. In particular, Scott objected to
                     <title>Blackwood&#8217;s</title> personal attacks on authors, and responded by making
                  personal attacks on those associated with <title>Blackwood&#8217;s</title>.</note> tho

                  <del>very</del> foolishly, or worse than foolishly.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">The seconds were the journalist Peter George Patmore
                  (1786&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>) for Scott, and James Traill (1794&#8211;1873), a lawyer,
                  for Christie. When Scott and Christie met at Chalk Farm on 16 February 1821,
                  Christie fired wide and Scott missed. However, unaccountably, the seconds prepared
                  another round, in which Scott was mortally wounded.</note> There was something
               about Scott that I did not like, &#8211; he was <del>howev</del> a very able man, &amp; in
               the <del>straight</del> way of becoming a very mischievous one. The itch of
               personality led him into this scrape. He might have said all that he did about
               Blackwoods Magazine both safely &amp; properly, if he had abstained from using names
               no man then could have called him to account without avowing himself to be the
                  Editor.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">The editor of
                     <title>Blackwood&#8217;s</title> was William Blackwood (1776&#8211;1834;

                  Wilson and John Gibson Lockhart &#8211; the latter&#8217;s articles in particular, using the
                  name &#8216;Z&#8217;, had particularly incensed Scott. Scott had mistakenly named Lockhart as
                  the editor of <title>Blackwood&#8217;s</title> and personally insulted him in his
                  article, &#8216;The Mohocks&#8217;, <title>London Magazine</title>, 3 (January 1821), 76&#8211;77,
                  leading to a challenge to a duel from Lockhart. This duel did not happen, but
                  Scott challenged Christie instead.</note>
