					am very far from expecting, I may be tempted to add a third volume upon the progress of Methodism from Wesleys
					death till the present time.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey did not write this book on the
						development of Methodism following the death of its founder, John Wesley (1703&#8211;1791; <title>DNB</title>).</note>
					Soon after his death a schism took place among his followers in England, because the minority insisted upon having
					the sacrament administered by their own unordained preachers, &amp; admitting the people to a full share in their
						Chapel-Government.<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s chronology is a little confused here. The
						first schism in Methodism following Wesley&#8217;s death was when the New Connexion left in 1797 over issues of church
						government. But this was after the final split between the Anglican Church and Methodism over the Plan of
						Pacification (1795), which confirmed that the Methodist Conference could appoint Ministers who would be able to
						administer the sacraments.</note> Church Government I will not call it. <del>Xx</del> It was not long before the
					whole body in England chose to take the first step. But recently a second schism has occurred in Ireland upon the
					opposite ground, the old Methodists insist upon adhering to the Church of England in pursuance of Wesley&#8217;s design,
