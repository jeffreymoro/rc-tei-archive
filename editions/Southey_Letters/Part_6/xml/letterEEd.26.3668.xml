               Strand for the Report of the Committee appointed at a Meeting of Journeymen (chiefly
               Printers) to take into Consideration a system of social Arrangement. It has reached
               me to day, &amp; my first impression is that they are taking up just so much of Owens
               scheme as is practicable, <del>meaning to form</del> not a Community of Goods, but an
               association in which each works for himself, &amp; the object of associating is to
               increase comforts &amp; diminish expence.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Report of the Committee appointed at a Meeting of Journeymen,
                     Chiefly Printers, to Take into Consideration Certain Propositions, Submitted to
                     them by Mr George Mudie, Having for their Object a System of Social
                     Arrangement, Calculated to Effect Essential Improvements in the Condition of
                     the Working Classes, and of Society at Large</title> (1821). The Report was
                  based on plans put forward by the journalist George Mudie (b. 1788) to form a
                  community exemplifying the principles of Robert Owen (1771&#8211;1858;
                     <title>DNB</title>), manager and owner of the mills and model community at New
                  Lanark in Scotland 1799&#8211;1825. Such a community was briefly formed in East London
                  1821&#8211;1822.</note> The Community of Goods which they propose being, they say, in
               the nature of Regimental or Naval Messes. &#8211; If their scheme be feasible, I know of
               nothing from which such great &amp; certain good effects might be looked for.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> One more <hi rend="ital">if</hi>. If the scheme deserves
               encouragement, a more popular thing could not be done by men in power, than by
               assisting to set it forward, by taking a few shares. The capital they want to begin
               with is &#163;12,000. &#8216;to erect the first dwelling for 250 families.&#8221; &#8211; But I hope you
               will find time to look at their Report.</p>

                     correct, then syphilis could not have an American origin.</note> &#8211; four years
