        <p rend="indent1"> There are two classes of persons whose opinions upon the merits of a metre, &amp; of a poem are
					worthy of regard, &#8211; men who have studied the art, &amp; women who judge naturally from the impression which is made
					upon them. I am therefore very much gratified by your approval of the hexameters,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> &amp; by M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
						Elliotts,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Frances (Fanny) Gartside (dates unknown), who had married Elliott
						in 1806.</note> whose verdict on such a question, would outweigh the decisions of a whole host of professional
					critics.</p>

						Spirits&#8217;.</note> is already so long as to occupy a disproportionate share of the poem, &#8211; otherwise there are many,
					very many names which ought to have been included. But I must confess that I had forgotten Watt, which I ought not
					to have done, especially as I was introduced to him some four &amp; twenty years ago, &amp; had also some slight
					acquaintance with both his sons, &#8211; Gregory, who has been dead many years, &amp; James the elder, who challenged
					Robespierre, &amp; actually went out with him, but the duel was prevented by Danton.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">James Watt (1736&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>), engineer and scientist, and his sons Gregory Watt
						(1777&#8211;1804) and James Watt (1769&#8211;1848; <title>DNB</title>). The latter had, in his youth, been a radical and in
						1792 travelled to France, where he presented an address from the Manchester Constitutional Society to the Club des
						Jacobins. Southey later told the story of the duel in a rather different form in his letter to Archibald Alison
						(17 April 1833). In this later version, it was the two French revolutionaries, Georges Danton (1759&#8211;1794) and
						Maximilien Fran&#231;ois Marie Isidore de Robespierre (1758&#8211;1794), who quarrelled and James Watt who prevented their
						duel. In this later letter, Southey stated that he heard of these events from the younger James Watt
						himself.</note> Pitt<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Pitt (1759&#8211;1806; <title>DNB</title>), Prime
