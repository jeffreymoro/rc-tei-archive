        <p rend="indent1"> Mackenzie with his usual obligingness has sent me the details which I requested.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Colin Alexander Mackenzie (1778?&#8211;1851), a wealthy Scot who was employed on a number of delicate diplomatic missions and may well
                  have been a government spy. In 1815 he was appointed one of the Commissioners of Liquidation, Arbitration and Deposit, who
                  adjudicated on claims by British citizens for loss of property against the French government. Southey dined with him in Paris on 17
                  May and 19 May 1817, and Mackenzie offered to provide some details of his wartime activities. Southey&#8217;s <title>History of the
                     Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols (London, 1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 657&#8211;659, dealt with Mackenzie&#8217;s role in the evacuation of the Spanish
                  Division of the North from northern Europe in August 1808.</note> They are very creditable to his zeal &amp; activity, &amp; with
               what I previously knew of the matter will make one of the most interesting pages in my history. He shall ask you, he says, to let him
               peruse the first vol: immediately, because he expects in a few weeks to see General Foy,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Maximilien Sebastien Foy (1775&#8211;1825), French commander in the Peninsular War 1808&#8211;1814 and author of <title>Histoire de la Guerre
                     de la P&#233;ninsule sous Napoleon</title> (1827).</note> who has the same task in hand. &#8211; Let him see the sheets if he wishes it, he
               may like to say to Gen Foy that he has seen them, &#8211; &amp; if he looks over them the mere act of turning over the leaves will show him
               the scale &amp; character of the work. &#8211; I send my note unsealed that you may see what I have said to him upon this subject.</p>
