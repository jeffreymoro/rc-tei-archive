        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter followed me to Cambridge, where I received it this morning at breakfast, and a great comfort it was. For
               although all the intelligence which came from home had been good, still I looked uneasily for what the next post might bring. Had it
               not been for this sort of anxiety, which you know nothing at all about, I dare say I should have written some queer letters to you and
               your sisters. But I am not so comical a papa anywhere else as at home.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You, and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Bell</ref>, and <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyBertha">Bertha</ref> are all very good girls, and have written me very nice letters, which had pleased me
               very much. One or two of my friends who know you all three, have seen your letters, and said what good girls you were, and how nicely
               you wrote. Nevertheless it will still be proper for me not to forget that receipt which we used to talk about for the pickle. You and
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyIsabel">Isabel</ref>, I dare say, remember it. Very soon I shall begin buying the other
               things which I am to bring home, such as the books, and the prayer books, and the pretty things for <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">Cuthbert</ref>. You may depend upon my returning the last week in June, if it please God
               that I continue well.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Among the comical things which I had to tell you all, was how I went to St. Paul&#8217;s Church, when a sermon was preached
               for the benefit of the Children of the Clergy, on which occasion there is the grandest church music ever performed in these
                  kingdoms:<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The annual Festival of the Sons of the Clergy, held in May at St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral,
                  London, and famed for the quality of its music. It raised money for impoverished clergy and the widows and orphans of clergymen. In
                  1820 the Festival was on 18 May, <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 19 May 1820. There was a huge attendance by dignitaries of the
                  City of London, judges and senior clergy. The sermon was by James Stevens (1777&#8211;1870), Lecturer at St Margaret&#8217;s, Westminster
                  1808&#8211;1820, Rector of St James Garlickhythe 1814&#8211;1820, Dean of Rochester 1820&#8211;1870.</note> and there was a fat lady before me very
               finely dressed in a velvet pelisse; but she sat so that I could see her stumpy grey bristles under a brown wig, and could not help
               seeing a dirty under petticoat through her pocket-hole. Remember therefore when you are an old maid, or an old wife, that you have your
               wig made long enough to cover your poll, and that you never wear dirty petticoats, either upper or under.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Yesterday I came here to dinner, and dined with <ref type="m" target="people.html#WhiteNeville">Mr. White</ref>. To-day
               I have been twice to church, first to hear Dr. Clarke, the traveller,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Daniel Clarke
                  (1769&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>), traveller and antiquarian. He presented a number of Greek statues to the University of Cambridge
                  and was Professor of Mineralogy at the University 1808&#8211;1822. He was also a clergyman and Vicar of Harlton 1805&#8211;1822 and Rector of
                  Yeldham 1809&#8211;1822.</note> preach; secondly, to hear Mr. Benson,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Christopher Benson
                  (1788&#8211;1868; <title>DNB</title>), a native of Cockermouth, B.A. Trinity College, Cambridge 1809. He became a Fellow of Magdalene
                  College, Cambridge in 1820, the first Hulsean Lecturer 1820&#8211;1822 and later Canon of Worcester Cathedral 1825&#8211;1868. He was a noted
                  preacher (though an evangelical, which would not have been to Southey&#8217;s taste). His sermon at St Mary&#8217;s, the University church, was
                  one of his Hulsean lectures on the &#8216;evidences of Christianity&#8217;. It concluded with a section on the need for education and was
                  followed by a collection for the National School for Boys.</note> a brother of that lady with whom I travelled in the coach from

               going to dine with <ref type="m" target="people.html#TownshendChauncyHare">Mr. Townsend</ref>, and there I shall meet Mr. Francis,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Clement Robert Francis (1792&#8211;1829), clergyman, Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, and nephew of
                  Southey&#8217;s friend, James Burney.</note> and <ref type="m" target="people.html#NoelLeland">Mr. Noel</ref>, and the Mr Kennaway.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Either John Kennaway (1797&#8211;1873) of Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A. 1821), who later succeeded to

        <p rend="indent1"> My Kate, do you know that I am taking it into serious deliberation whether I shall or shall not be made a Doctor; and
               as it is said the woman who deliberates is lost,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Joseph Addison (1672&#8211;1719; <title>DNB</title>),

               to be Doctored. I have been asked on the part of the Vice-Chancellor at Oxford<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been
                  offered an honorary Doctorate of Civil Law at the University of Oxford by the University&#8217;s Vice-Chancellor, Frodsham Hodson
                  (1770&#8211;1822; <title>DNB</title>), Principal of Brasenose College 1809&#8211;1822, Vice-Chancellor 1818&#8211;1820, Regius Professor of Divinity
                  1820&#8211;1822. Southey accepted, one of sixteen men to do so, and the degree was conferred at a ceremony on 14 June 1820.</note> if it

Wellington and Scott were not.</note> and the <ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Duke of Wellington</ref> at the same time, and, perhaps, upon <ref type="m" target="people.html#ScottWalter">Sir Walter Scott</ref>, this sort of company certainly tempts me. I shall not make up my mind
               without consulting one or two friends; some expense in money, and about three days of precious time being to be weighed against what is
               of no other use or value than as a mark of very high respect on the part of the University.</p>
