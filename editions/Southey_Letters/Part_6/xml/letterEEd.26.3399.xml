						letter requesting his help in securing for them a chaplain, rather than directly approaching the church
						authorities. Discovering that responsibility for such appointments lay with the Bishop of London, Southey had
						endeavoured to help and an appointment to this post had been made: Charles Sandby (c. 1761&#8211;1832), B.A. Christ
						Church, Oxford 1783. He was Vicar of Swell, Gloucestershire 1795&#8211;1832 and Rector of Honeychurch, Devon 1816&#8211;1832.
						In the event he did not take up the chaplaincy in Pernambuco, which was unfilled until 1822.</note> best advisor.
					I fear this omission of the Merchants will render it necessary for him to notify his appointment, &amp; await
						<del>xxx</del> a reply, which will instruct him how to draw on them for his expences.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The conduct of the Opposition is as bad as their worst enemies could desire. Government in their
					measures &lt;seem&gt; to have aimed at conciliating them, &amp; therefore to have proposed less than was required.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The Cabinet had published its proposals on 29 November 1819 for what became
						known as the &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; to suppress radical agitation, including a new Criminal Libel Bill. The Whigs opposed
						these measures.</note> The Bill to restrain the abuse of the Press is miserably inefficacious: &#8211; it does indeed
					little more than diminish the rate of sedition &amp; blasphemy by raising the price of these commodities. A
					reaction however appears to be taking place, owing in great measure to the exposure of the calumnies against the
					Manchester magistrates,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The local magistrates at Manchester had ordered the
						dispersal of a huge radical meeting at St Peter&#8217;s Field on 16 August 1819. At least eleven people were killed in
						the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; Massacre.</note> &amp; a little perhaps to the alliance of Hunt with Carlile,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry &#8216;Orator&#8217; Hunt (1773&#8211;1835; <title>DNB</title>) was due to be one of the main
						speakers in Manchester on 16 August 1819, as was Richard Carlile (1790&#8211;1843; <title>DNB</title>), radical
						journalist, who was by this time editing <title>The Republican</title> from prison, where he was serving a
						three-year term for blasphemy and sedition.</note> &amp; the arrival of <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbett</ref> with Paines Relics, just when that wretch&#8217;s infamy was fresh
					before the public.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Paine (1737&#8211;1809; <title>DNB</title>), the author
						of <title>The Rights of Man</title> (1791&#8211;1792) had died in America, where Cobbett had fled in 1817 to avoid
						arrest when habeas corpus was suspended. Cobbett arrived back at Liverpool in November 1819 with Paine&#8217;s bones,
						intending to give them a public funeral and to raise a monument in Paine&#8217;s honour. Paine&#8217;s name was &#8216;before the
						public&#8217;, as one of the counts on which Carlile was convicted in October 1819 was that of selling Paine&#8217;s
							<title>The Age of Reason</title> (1794&#8211;1807), a deist tract that attacked the Church of England.</note> There
					will I fear be some desperate attempt in the disturbed districts, before the search for arms can be effected.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">One of the &#8216;Six Acts&#8217; was the Seizure of Arms Act (1819), which allowed
						magistrates to search private property for weapons, seize them and arrest their owners.</note>

        <p rend="indent1"> The fact which you were kind enough to communicate respecting Limehouse Church is striking, &amp;
					confirms the opinion which I had formed concerning the utility of ornamenting our Churches.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Possibly a reference to St Anne&#8217;s Church, Limehouse, designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor (1661&#8211;1736;
							<title>DNB</title>) and consecrated in 1730.</note> Even the Scotch are beginning to feel this. Jack<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Jean Calvin (1509&#8211;1564), French theologian, much disliked by Southey, whose view on
						issues such as predestination was the official doctrine of the Church of Scotland. Southey noted a new style of
