        <p rend="indent1"> I have returned <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> the draft which
					he has sent me for my paper in the last number.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Thomas
						Fosbrooke (1770&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), <title>British Monachism; or, Manners and Customs of the Monks and Nuns
							of England</title> (1817), <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), 59&#8211;102, published 11 December
						1819.</note> I think it must have been sent me in mistake &amp; have told him so. But if it should prove
					otherwise, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> should not chuse to send me &#163;100 for
					the articles I will forthwith pack up all the books of his in my possession, &amp; break off the connection with
					the Review, whatever may be the present inconvenience to myself. &#8211; It is even now sufficiently inconvenient, for I
					calculated upon this money for my Christmas bills. &#8211; But I will say no more upon this till I hear again from <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>, or from <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> &amp; see how the matter stands.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I have been obliged to complain to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> of the mutilations which he has made in this paper. Pray recover the MSS if you can, &#8211; or what
					would be better, the set of proof sheets. &#8211; He has played <del>with</del> the Devil with me, &#8211; as you will see by
					comparing the account of Dominic the Cuirassier with the original.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s

							<title>Quarterly Review</title>, 22 (July 1819), 79&#8211;82.</note> It is very provoking to have an historical paper
					of that kind, which perhaps no person in England but myself could have written, treated like a school boys theme.
					Vexed however as I am, I have too much liking for <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref>
					to be angry with him, &amp; have written to him in a manner which will prove this.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Greek papers in this &amp; the preceding number of the QR. must certainly be <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrereJohnHookham">Frere&#8217;s</ref>, &amp; admirable papers they are, in every point.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The reviews of Henry David Hill (1791&#8211;1858), <title>Essays on the Institutions,
