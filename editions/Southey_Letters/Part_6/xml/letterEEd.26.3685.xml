					25 Aug 1812, upon which I received the dividends in Nov. 1815. &amp; 325 purchased 27 Apr. 1819, on which none have
					been received. You cannot receive them without a power of Attorney, I believe. Buy in at present 225. I have a good
					intention &amp; good prospect of adding enough to this to enable me to remove with convenience if I should find it
					necessary at the expiration of my second term, three years hence; &#8211; &amp; to purchase a place either here or
					elsewhere.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letter is vexatious, it disappoints a hope on which I had counted largely, &#8211; &amp; it tells
					of rascality on one side, &amp; cowardice which does not deserve a better name, on the other, &#8211; evils which I
					perceive very clearly. &amp; against which I have spoken honestly &amp; strongly, &amp; will yet speak if not
					stronger in a manner that will make it more noticed. <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bedford had written to
						Southey on 7 May 1821, conveying the news that he would not be able to visit him in Keswick. Bedford claimed that
						pressure of business at the Treasury prevented him leaving London, especially the problems arising from the
						debates in the House of Commons&#8217; Committee of Supply on the government&#8217;s estimates for future expenditure. The
						Whig opposition was pressurising the government to reduce expenditure further, despite the government&#8217;s claims
						that it had exercised the most rigorous economy possible. Southey strongly disapproved of opposition campaigns to
						reduce government spending and had criticised them on a number of occasions, e.g. <title>Edinburgh Annual
							Register</title>, for 1810, 3.1 (1812), 207&#8211;218.</note>

						1823&#8211;1832), I, pp. 55&#8211;58, contained a vigorous denunciation of the Whigs for seeking peace with France.</note> The
						21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> is now on my table. I hope it will do your heart &lt;good&gt; to see that I have spoken
					of the Whigs in the first chapter, just as an honest historian will do hereafter. I know not whether they mean to
					publish volume by volume, or wait for the whole, &#8211; most probably they will prefer the first method as making
					quicker returns. &amp; a <hi rend="ital">talk</hi> in the world upon each publication.</p>

            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> The worst is that this graciousness makes me
					feel as if I ought to show my sense of it, by writing upon the Coronation.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey wrote a few notes for a Coronation Ode, dated &#8216;Feby 9. 1821&#8217; in his notebook, now at Huntington Library,
						San Marino, HM 2733, f. 126r. However, he did not get beyond this and no ode was written for the coronation on 19
						July 1821.</note> Have you got for me a book about it? Or may I, with a safe conscience leave undone what I have
					no inclination whatever to do? If I write any thing it will probably be a sort of Hymn either in couplets, or in
					lofty blank verse, &#8211; with a prelude perhaps about the Abbey. But the time might be much better bestowed.</p>
