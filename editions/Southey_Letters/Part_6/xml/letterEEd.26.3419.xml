        <p rend="indent1"> I learn from <ref type="m" target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Henry Robinson</ref> that <ref type="m" target="people.html#HamondElton">Elton Hamond</ref> is the person from whom I
               received two very curious letters in the month of February last, &amp; that pursuant
               to the intention which he then expressed, he has placed his papers at my disposal. As
               yet I have receivd no communication from his family upon this melancholy
                  subject.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Elton Hamond had killed
                  himself on 1 January 1820.</note>
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Robinson</ref> tells me I may
               expect it; &amp; when it comes I shall desire the box to be deposited with you; &#8211;
               because I shall not have leisure to inspect the papers before I leave home, &amp; it
               may more conveniently be done where I can have an opportunity of consulting with <ref type="m" target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Robinson</ref>. It is a dismal
               case: &#8211; &amp; judging from the two extraordinary letters in my possession, &amp; from
               what <ref type="m" target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Robinson</ref> informs me
               of, I have little doubt but that it may be rendered a very instructive one, &#8211;
               conformably to his own desires, &amp; consistently with all due respect to the memory
               of the dead &amp; the feelings of the living.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My course of reading, aided too by some observations for which at
               different times I have had sufficient opportunity, <del>have</del> has made me more
               conversant than most men with the morbid anatomy of the human mind. &#8211; From some thing
               which <ref type="m" target="people.html#RobinsonHenryCrabb">Robinson</ref> says it
               appears that my second &amp; last letter to him<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey to Elton Hamond, 2 March 1819, Letter 3256.</note> (to
               which he returned no answer) made a considerable impression upon him, &#8211; tho he acted
               &amp; reasoned upon it insanely. I had no suspicion who my correspondent was, nor of
               his purpose. That he was serious in what he said, I was fully persuaded, &amp;
               therein I was right; but had my nature been a little more suspicious, perhaps I
               should not so entirely have believed that when he spoke of dying within the month, he
               meant to imply that he was in the last stage of some incurable disease. My answers
               were written under that impression. Had I known who &amp; what he was, I would have
               urged him to come down here, &#8211; not with the expectation of reasoning him out of any
               opinions, or into any, but for the chance of so influencing his feelings as to
               dispose <del>them</del> him for such a change.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I had a letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#CrokerJohnWilson">Croker</ref> the other day to say that Lord
