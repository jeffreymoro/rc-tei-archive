        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your letters have troubled me; &#8211; &amp; I should have replied to the
               first of them without delay, if I had not expected to receive the half notes &#8211; which
               I now acknowledge &amp; thank you for.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> If it were at a better season of the year, I should press you to make
               for yourself as long a vacation as you could, &amp; set off forthwith for <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref>, where I would answer for
               putting you in good condition. But in the month of November, when the paths are
               strewn with the fallen leaves, the roads ancle-deep in mire, &amp; the glass
               oscilating between Rain &amp; Much Rain, &amp; only getting up to Change, for the
               sake of verifying its accuracy by falling back again, &#8211; this prescription is not
               applicable. Make up your mind however, &amp; your arrangements, &#8211; to come with the
                  Cuckoo,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">In mid-April 1821, as the
                  cuckoo traditionally arrives in Britain at this time.</note> &#8211; or before him;
               &amp; you will derive immediate benefit from such a resolution. No little part of the
               happiness of this world consists in expectation.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My dear Grosvenor I am noways inclined to condemn you, as you seem to
               imagine, &#8211; nor like the shoemaker whom we went to see in Richters picture, to
               persuade you that the shoe fits, when you feel that it pinches.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry James Richter (1772&#8211;1857;
                  <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Tight Shoe</title>, exhibited at the Society of
                  Painters in Oil and Watercolours exhibition at Spring Garden in 1820, when Southey
                  would have had the opportunity to view it during his stay in London in May&#8211;June
                  1820. The picture is currently in Northampton Museums and Art Gallery.</note> &#8211;
               Only let me say, that I should be as glad as you could be to find myself in
               possession of a good independent fortune: &#8211; &amp; that we poor Lacklands &amp;
               Lackstocks who have to earn our livelihood, must endeavour to make the best of it.
               You are better off at this time than the King or his Prime Minister. &#8211; If I were in
               town I would give you as much of my time as you would accept, &#8211; that is, I would take
               my sneezes at the Exchequer at noon, &amp; dine with you &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#Bedfordfamily">Miss Page</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordHenry">the Master of the
               Rolls</ref>, as often as you would let me make <del>the</del> &lt;a&gt;
               fourth in your party. But as this cannot be, let me, I entreat you, converse as well
               as we can, at a distance, &amp; do not imagine yourself unfit for correspondence, or
               suffer yourself to acquire a distaste for it. I have often, since my return from
               London, been vexed, as well as disappointed, at not hearing from you as usual. Your
               letters made up no small part of my enjoyments. You are my only <hi rend="ital">frequent</hi> &amp; <hi rend="ital">constant</hi> correspondent. &#8211; The only
               person with whom correspondence has become a <hi rend="ital">habit</hi>, &#8211; with whom
               I can be grave or nonsensical, to whom I can say <hi rend="ital">quidlibet de
                  quolibet</hi>,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Subtle and elaborate
                  points, especially on theological or academic subjects.</note> &amp; make my

        <p rend="indent1"> I have many things to tell you of my own occupations,
                  <del>&amp;</del> anticipations &amp; concerns, when you are willing to hear them.
               At present it will suffice to say that we are all tolerably well, &#8211; &amp; especially
