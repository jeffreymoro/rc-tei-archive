						published in <title>Napoleon and Other Poems</title> (London, 1822), pp. 1&#8211;62.</note> in everything, except in its praise of
					Bertrand. A man does not deserve to be praised for <hi rend="ital">constant worth </hi>whose merit consists in fidelity to a
					wicked master.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The French commander Henri Gatien, Comte Bertrand (1773&#8211;1844), whose loyalty
						to Napoleon Bonaparte (1769&#8211;1821; Emperor of the French 1804&#8211;1814, 1815) included accompanying him to exile on Elba in 1814
						and St Helena in 1815, is not praised in the published text, suggesting that Barton acted on Southey&#8217;s criticism.</note> If
					this is to be admitted as virtue, the devil may have his saints and martyrs. No man of <hi rend="ital">worth</hi> could have
					adhered to Buonaparte after the murder of the Duc D&#8217;Enghien,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duc
						d&#8217;Enghien (1772&#8211;1804). A relative of the Bourbons, he took a prominent part in campaigns by French &#233;migr&#233;s against the
						revolutionary government. In March 1804 he was kidnapped from his home in Germany and convicted by a French military tribunal
						of involvement in a recent royalist plot, even though the French government knew he was innocent of the charges. He was shot
						on 21 March 1804.</note> and after his conduct to Portugal and Spain. I say nothing of former atrocities, because, before they
					were confessed by Buonaparte himself, they were denied, and might have been deemed doubtful; but these crimes were public and
					notorious, and not to be extenuated, not to be forgotten, not to be forgiven.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I notice only one line in which the meaning is ambiguously expressed &#8211; &#8220;Thy power man&#8217;s strength alone;&#8221; &#8211; perhaps
					I might not have noticed it if the want of perspicuity did not arise in part from a licence which I detected myself in committing
					this morning &#8211; the use of <hi rend="ital">alone</hi> instead of <hi rend="ital">only</hi>. What you mean to say, is, that <hi rend="ital">man&#8217;s only strength is thy power</hi>; but as the words now stand they may convey an opposite meaning.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Neither Barton&#8217;s original phrase nor Southey&#8217;s emendation is in the published volume.</note>
