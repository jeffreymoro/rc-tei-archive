          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear G.</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Tho I never examined an account in my life (holding it a less evil to be cheated than to cast up
					long sums, &amp; fret myself about L.S.D.) yet I think there is an error in yours, &#8211; for you have not debited me
					for the Westminster subscription,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had agreed to pay &#163;5 towards an
						appeal for the family of William Page (1778&#8211;1819), clergyman and headmaster of Westminster School 1815&#8211;1819, who
						had died on 20 September 1819. His obituary in the <title>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</title>, 89 (October 1819), 374,
						noted he had left a wife, Anne Page, n&#233;e Davis (1780&#8211;1820), and nine children, &#8216;very slenderly provided for&#8217;. This
						was despite Davis holding a number of clerical appointments, including Vicar of Willen, Buckinghamshire 1806&#8211;1819,
						Vicar of Steventon, Berkshire, and Rector of Nunburnholme, Yorkshire 1812&#8211;1817, and Rector of Quainton,
						Buckinghamshire 1817&#8211;1819.</note> which must surely have been paid within the last three months.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank you for your solicitude concerning my readiness to give. But you do not know when I turn
					a deaf ear. The case of poor Pages family is the only one in which I had not a cogent motive, &#8211; then perhaps there
					was no better one than a regard to appearance, &#8211; a tax &lt;to&gt; which I have paid less in the course of my life than
					any other person. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyEdward">My unhappy brother Edward</ref> has at least the
					virtue of being very <del>mod</del> considerate in his demands upon me. They come seldom, &amp; are always
					trifling. At present he is ill, &#8211; perhaps seriously so. All that can be done for him is to take care that he may
					not want for necessaries while in health, nor for comforts (as far as they can be procured) when health fails him.
					I think it very likely that he may be consumptive: the disease is in the family.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In <ref type="m" target="people.html#MorganJohnJames">Morgans</ref> case I acted from the double
					motive of good will towards him &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MorganMary">his wife</ref>, &amp; of
					setting others an example, &#8211; <del>xx</del> which has had its effect. There was an old acquaintance there, &amp; for
					the sake of his mother,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> at whose table I have been a
					frequent guest, I would have done more for him than this, had it been in my power.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> People imagine that I am very rich, that I have great interest with Government, &amp; that my
					patronage in literature is sufficient to make an authors fortune, &amp; to introduce a poet at once into full
					celebrity.</p>
        <p rend="indent1">
          <ref type="m" target="people.html#TurnerSharon">Turner</ref> is about to take an opinion
					concerning my claims both in law &amp; in equity to the Somersetshire estates.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Fitzhead estates in Somerset. The death of Southey&#8217;s third cousin, John Southey Somerville,
						15th Lord Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>), meant he possibly had a claim on these lands.</note> Were I
					to recover them, I should have great satisfaction in resigning my pension <del>xxxxxx</del> &#8211; the Laureateship I
					would keep as a feather, &amp; wear it as Fluellin did his leek.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had
						possessed a government pension of &#163;200 per annum since 1807; he also received &#163;100 per annum as Poet Laureate from
						1813. In <title>Henry V</title>, Act 5, scene 1, Fluellin wears a leek, both as a symbol of his Welsh identity and
						to provoke quarrels (which he wins) with other soldiers.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I thank W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Nicol for his suggestion.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">William Nicol (d. c. 1855), printer and bookseller. It is not clear what advice he had given Southey, but in
							<title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London, 1810&#8211;1819), III, p. ix, Southey had indicated he intended to
						publish in the future &#8216;the History of Portugal, of Portugueze India, and the other conquests, and of Portugueze
						Literature&#8217;.</note> You will see however in the preface to the last volume that I had promised to do what he
					advises</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Last night I finished the life of Wesley.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s
							<title>The Life of Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> But I have outrun the

							<title>DNB</title>), MP for various constituencies 1796&#8211;1820 and head of a highly successful printing business.
						To &#8216;outrun the constable&#8217; was a term for getting into debt.</note> &amp; it may be four or five weeks before he

						New Year&#8217;s Ode. The Prince Regent chose to celebrate his &#8216;official&#8217; birthday on St George&#8217;s Day (23 April), unless
						it fell on a Sunday, as it did in 1820, in which case it would be celebrated on 24 April.</note> learn for me on
					what day, that I may be ready in time. &#8211; I do not know why you are so anxious for rhyme. The rhythm of my
					Congratulatory Odes<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>Congratulatory Odes. Odes to His Royal
							Highness the Prince Regent, His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, and His Majesty the King of

						you<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1820, later published as &#8216;The Warning
						Voice. Ode I&#8217; in <title>The Englishman&#8217;s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National
							Information</title> (London, 1824), pp. 381&#8211;383.</note> was neither amiss in execution, nor inappropriate in
					subject. But you know that from the first I told you I had no talent for lyrical writing. And I tell you now that
					my inclination for writing poetry is gone, gone &#8211; gone, &amp; that the power is going &#8211; going &#8211; going.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> This conspiracy did not surprize me.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">The Cato Street
