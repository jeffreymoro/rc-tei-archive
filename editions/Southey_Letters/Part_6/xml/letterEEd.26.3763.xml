          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am exceedingly glad to hear of your alliance with M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Company.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Negotiations had
                  started in June 1821 to bring the followers of Lord Grenville, including Wynn,
                  over to the government. Wynn was their most prominent spokesman in the House of
                  Commons and it was always intended he would receive a Cabinet post. However, Wynn
                  wished to be Home Secretary or Secretary for Ireland and for there to be a wider
                  reshuffle, including moves to include some Whigs. He did not finally take up the
                  post he had initially been offered, President of the Board of Control, until
                  January 1822. This meant he was ultimately responsible for the East India Company
                  &#8211; &#8216;M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Company&#8217;.</note> It has indeed very long been my wish
               to see you in office because no man is more fit for it, &amp; you have always had few
               principles &amp; fewer feelings in common with opposition. When I heard the
               likelihood of your coming in some months ago I had supposed that you would probably
               be placed at the head of your old department,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Wynn had been Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department
                  1806&#8211;1807.</note> &#8211; in which case your name would soon have been inserted above
               mine in <ref type="m" target="people.html#CobbettWilliam">Cobbetts</ref> proscription
               list. You have a situation subject to none of the same difficulties &amp;
               invidiousness as that; &amp; the voluminous documents with which you must become
               acquainted will not be so appalling or irksome to you as they would be to most
               persons.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> But I am sorry to lose the intended Cromwelliana.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had just published his &#8216;Life of Cromwell&#8217;,
                     <title>Quarterly Review</title>, 25 (July 1821), 279&#8211;347, and was thinking of
                  expanding it into a book. This did not occur.</note> However I shall hope for them
               hereafter &amp; in the most serviceable manner, &#8211; that is, in the way of comment
               before the book goes to press or while it is on its way thro it. In my odds &amp;
               ends of time I am laying in stores with the full purpose of treating the subject at
               length, &amp; doing it all the justice that can be done by unweariable diligence
               &amp; the sincere desire of representing both men &amp; actions in their true
               colours.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I believe I can obtain access to Lady Fanshaws Memoirs.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet (1608&#8211;1666;
                     <title>DNB</title>), was a Royalist minister and poet, and later Ambassador to
                  Portugal 1662&#8211;1666. His wife, Anne Fanshawe, n&#233;e Harrison (1625&#8211;1680;
                     <title>DNB</title>), wrote memoirs of her husband in 1676 for private family
                  circulation. They were not published until 1829.</note> I wish I could to those
                  <hi rend="ital">of</hi> (not <hi rend="ital">by</hi>) the Countess of Pembroke,
               but they are in Lord Thanets possession, &amp; therefore not very likely to be
               accessible to me.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Lady Anne Clifford, 14th
                  Baroness Clifford, Countess Dowager of Dorset, Pembroke and Montgomery (1590&#8211;1676;
                     <title>DNB</title>). She wrote her autobiography, <title>A Summary of the
                     Records and a True Memorial of the Life of Me the Lady Anne Clifford</title>
                  (1653). Her later chronicles, biographies and autobiography were preserved in the
                  manuscript &#8216;The Great Books of the Clifford Family&#8217; (c. 1676). At this time the
                  latter was owned by Lady Anne Clifford&#8217;s descendant, Sackville Tufton, 9th Earl of
                  Thanet (1767&#8211;1825; <title>DNB</title>). A Whig, he had been Brougham&#8217;s main
                  supporter in his election campaigns in Westmorland in 1818 and 1820, hence the
                  probable unavailability of this material to Southey.</note> &#8211; Manchester left

                     MDCXXXIX to the Murther of King Charles I</title> (1682&#8211;1683), no. 1924 in the
                  sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester
                  (1602&#8211;1671; <title>DNB</title>), was a Parliamentary commander and politician. The
                  memoirs Southey refers to are in the British Library, Add. MS 15567, but are not
                  by Manchester.</note> If they have not been printed (&amp; I think they have not,
               or I should have seen some notice of them) &#8211; in whose possession are they likely to
               be? They would be very important.</p>
