        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Thank you for your Pamphlet;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Henry Phillpotts, <title>A Letter to the Freeholders of the County of Durham
                     on the Proceedings of the County Meeting holden on Thursday, 21st October 1819
                     &#8211; and Particularly on the Speech of J. G. Lambton, Esq., M. P.</title> (1819).
                  This pamphlet criticised the County Meeting held in Durham to denounce the
                  government over its handling of the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; meeting in Manchester on 16 August
                  1819, at which at least eleven people were killed.</note> &#8211; it is very able, very
               animated, &amp; thoroughly judicious. I wish such arguments were more frequently
               urged &amp; more generally circulated, but as you have truly observed, the greater
               activity is as usual with the worse cause.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am silent myself during these distempered times, partly because I
               do not like to be distracted from calmer &amp; more congenial pursuits; still more
               because it does not appear to me that I could do any good by advising measures of a
               more decisive character than ministers are likely to adopt. In all likelihood they
               will do enough to avert the immediate danger, supported as they will be by the
                  Grenvilles,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">The small group in the
                  House of Commons and House of Lords that owed allegiance to Lord Grenville; they
                  had split from the Whigs in 1817 but did not join the government until
                  1822.</note> &amp; by the independent members. But this is like giving opiates
                  <del>which xxxyx</del> &lt;which&gt; only suspend the sense of a mortal disease. Of all
               the engines of mischief that were ever employed the English press is at this time the
               worst; &amp; unless some effectual means are taken for curbing it, I believe that a
               bloodier Revolution than has ever yet polluted the earth must inevitably ensue.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You need not be told Sir that there is a want of vigour in the
               existing Administration, &amp; that there is no hope of seeing that <del>want</del>
               defect supplied from any quarter, or by any change. If they would but be persuaded
               that it is not more difficult to carry whole measures than half-ones, all might yet
               be well. My hope is that the <del>xxx</del> magnitude of the evil will compel them to
               look the danger in the face &amp; meet it manfully. And notwithstanding all ominous
               appearances I comfort myself with a persuasion that Providence will not suffer a
               country such as this to be destroyed. Were it not for this ground of hope, I own I
               should despair. But these feelings will not prevent me from exerting myself to the
               utmost whenever it appears to me that it can be done with any prospect of
               utility.</p>
