					Wynn</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> Your confession that you dislike the Vision of Judgement<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> less than you expected, is more gratifying to me than half
					the compliments that I shall receive, for you know I anticipated from the beginning your hearty disapproval. A
					great many of the persons who usually write to me on such occasions are just now waiting to see which way the wind
					of public opinion will set in. But among the poets I may call for a division &amp; count a majority.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am very much amused at your account of <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> &amp; the literatuli, &amp; at their concern for my devoted head. <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> had deserved more than this at my hands;<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is primarily referring to the first two Cantos of Byron&#8217;s <title>Don Juan</title> (1819),
						published by Murray. The coruscating and hilarious &#8216;Dedication&#8217;, which attacked Southey and others, had been
						suppressed (and was not published until 1833), but Southey undoubtedly knew of its existence. His response was
							<title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), &#8216;Preface&#8217;, pp. xvii&#8211;xxii, where he denounced &#8216;the Satanic
						school&#8217; of poetry without naming any one poet.</note> but what I have written proceeded from a sense of duty, not
					from any personal resentment, &#8211; if any personal feeling existed, it was a latent apprehension that some undeserved
					censure might attach to me for the scandalous silence of the QR. concerning Don Juan. As for <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murrays</ref> anticipated contest I have no itch for controversy &amp; will never
					be drawn into one.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Unfortunately for Southey, a &#8216;contest&#8217; with Byron did
						ensue from <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821). Byron attacked Southey in the &#8216;Appendix&#8217; to &#8216;The Two
						Foscari&#8217;, <title>Sardanapalus, A Tragedy. The Two Foscari, A Tragedy. Cain, A Mystery</title> (London, 1821), p.
						328, and Southey responded with his letter to the Editor of the <title>Courier</title> (5 January 1822). The
						letter appeared in the <title>Courier</title> on 11 January 1822. Byron&#8217;s parody, <title>The Vision of
							Judgment</title> (1822), however, provided him with a crushing victory.</note> &lt;Only&gt; If <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Ld B.</ref> provokes it I will read him a lecture somewhat more at length, &amp; such a
					one as will last quite as long as <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">his Lordships</ref> works.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My hope for Europe was that the Spanish Revolution would have reached its stage of blood soon
					enough to deter all other nations from entering upon the same course.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">The
						first of a series of revolutions in Europe in 1820 had broken out in Spain in January&#8211;March 1820, when troops
						being sent to fight the revolutionaries in South America had mutinied.</note> My fears are now like yours, &#8211; &amp;
					perhaps more for Germany (especially the Prussian States) than for France &amp; Brabant; &#8211; for if Germany were
					sound, the spirit might once more be abated by force of arms. Great part of the evil proceeded from the English
					newspapers, from the language held in Parliament, &amp; from the foreign journals printed in England, &#8211; to these
					latter the movements in Portugal &amp; Brazil may directly be ascribed.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is particularly referring to <title>Correio Braziliense</title> (1808&#8211;1822), a Portuguese journal
						published in London, no. 3203 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. A liberal revolution in Portugal in
						August 1820 had led to the election of a Cortes and demands for the monarchy to return from Brazil, where it had
						fled in 1807&#8211;1808.</note> If the Portugueze Embassadors had done their duty they should long ago have called upon
					this Government to send the editors &amp; their journals out of the country by the Alien Act, or at least have
					prosecuted them.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The Aliens Act (1793) required all aliens to register with
						local Justices of the Peace, and ensured they could be detained or deported.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Austrians<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Austria had crushed the revolution in Naples
						in March 1821 and presented itself as the main supporter of the existing order in Europe.</note> say of themselves
						<hi rend="ital">Nous serons les derniers</hi>,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;we will be the
						last&#8217;.</note> &#8211; looking upon the event as inevitable. Shall we escape? I should say certainly <hi rend="ital">not</hi>, if I looked merely at human causes, for here the tendency of every thing is to the utter overthrow of
					our Institutions; &#8211; forgive me if I include <del>ca</del> the Catholic question among the cooperating causes of
						destruction.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was opposed to granting full political rights to
						Catholics, while Wynn was in favour.</note> &#8211; But I have a trust in Providence &amp; in that trust a chearing
					&amp; steady hope, &#8211; which if it rested upon any other foundation would be utterly unreasonable.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My feelings upon this subject were expressed in the last New Years Ode, which <ref type="m" target="people.html#BedfordGrosvenorCharles">Bedford</ref> may perhaps have shown you.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;The Warning Voice. Ode II&#8217;, Southey&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Ode for 1821 as Poet Laureate, was not published
						until it appeared in <title>The Englishman&#8217;s Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National
							Information</title> (London, 1824), pp. 384&#8211;389.</note> If you have not seen it, I will send it you, as it may be
					long before it gets to the Press, &amp; tho I have no talent for lyrical compositions [MS missing] was written
					rapidly &amp; earnestly.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I think you need not be alarmed at Watkins<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Watkin

					disease, which frequently recurs, &amp; which is more alarming than dangerous. I know this by experience.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> I am reading, for the second time, Michaelis&#8217;s Commentaries on the Laws of Moses, in an English
						translation,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Johann David Michaelis (1717&#8211;1791), <title>Mosaisches
							Recht</title> (1770&#8211;1775), translated as <title>Commentaries on the Laws of Moses</title> (London, 1814), p. 157.
						Southey noted Michaelis&#8217;s views in <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of
							Society</title>, 2 vols (London, 1829), I, p. 71. </note> &#8211; certainly one of the most able &amp; important books
					that I have ever perused. He wishes the<del>xx</del> introduction of slavery as a punishment, &#8211; this is very unlike
					his usual sagacity, for he seems to forget the effect which slavery produces upon the Master.</p>
