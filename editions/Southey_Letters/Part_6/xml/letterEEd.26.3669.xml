               &#8211; which I cannot do without elevating the head.</p>

                  no. 1902 in the sale catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library. Christopher Columbus
                  (1450/1&#8211;1506), Italian explorer, was commissioned by the Spanish Crown to sail
                  west across the Atlantic in 1492; he discovered America rather than Asia.</note>
               dated April 1488, four years before Columbus set out on his first voyage, &amp;
               addressed to his friend the Greek Professor at Salamanca,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Arias Barbosa (c. 1465/70&#8211;1540), Portuguese scholar and

               under &#8220;the peculiar disease&#8221; of that time which the Spaniards called the Bubas, &amp;
               the Italians, he says, the French Disease. I transcribed the original passage in a

               Uncle</ref>, the other day,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Robert Southey to Herbert Hill, 8 April 1821, Letter 3666. </note> &#8211; but if
               you wish to have it for your Lectures I will copy for you the whole Epistle. It seems
               very strange that this authority should not have been hit upon by the many writers
               who have discussed the history of this disease, &#8211; &amp; yet I concluded that it must
