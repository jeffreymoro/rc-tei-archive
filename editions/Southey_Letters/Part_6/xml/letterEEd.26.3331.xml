        <p rend="indent1"> I believe I told you that my great labour was compleated.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819).</note> About a fortnight ago the Preface, Contents &amp;c
					were sent off to <ref type="m" target="people.html#PopleWilliam">Pople</ref>, &#8211; one sheet of the notes &amp; tables
					is still to reach me for correction, &amp; then as soon as the folders &amp; stitchers &amp; binders have done
					their part, my third volume will duly be delivered at your door. In the character of its materials this work bears
					some resemblance to Herodotus,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Herodotus (c. 484&#8211;425 BC), whose <title>The
							Histories</title> are often considered to be the first work of history.</note> for the mixture of individual

          <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;Concerning
						customs&#8217;.</note>
          <title />which it contains. And it will be hereafter to the history of that wide portion of the new
					world, what Herodotus is to the history of Europe. &#8211; A weeks dissipation came in my way after this work was off my
					hands, &amp; I was engaged in company every day from Monday to Saturday. I am now getting on with a paper for <ref type="m" target="people.html#GiffordWilliam">Gifford</ref> upon the Monastic Orders, &#8211; to introduce as strong an
					appeal as I can make for the institution which Lady Isabella King is endeavouring to establish: &amp; I shall be
					able to send off the first portion tomorrow.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s review of Thomas
						Fosbrooke (1770&#8211;1842; <title>DNB</title>), <title>British Monachism; or, Manners and Customs of the Monks and Nuns

						need for communities to provide support for single women (90&#8211;102). Lady Isabella Lettice King (1772&#8211;1845;
							<title>DNB</title>) founded the Ladies&#8217; Association at Bailbrook House, near Bath, in June 1816. It provided a
						home for orphaned gentlewomen with no income and was duly praised by Southey in his article (96&#8211;101).</note>
					Moreover I am again going on &lt;with&gt; Wesley,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>The Life of
							Wesley; and the Rise and Progress of Methodism</title> (1820).</note> who has stood still while I gave my whole

					posterity, I must now <del>betake myself</del> resume the less flattering consideration of the <del>xxxx</del>
