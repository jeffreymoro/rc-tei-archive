               been received since November 1815 &#8211; never any upon the other. There was no inconvenience in letting so inconsiderable a sum lie. The
               irons which I have in the fire will, I trust, enable me to increase it, so as to make it worth while regularly to receive the

               of 40&#163; more. &#8211; If you continue to receive your own Dividends the trouble of receiving mine will be little in addition, tho it may have
               some weight as a motive for going to receive both. If you do not, &#8211; why let the matter rest, &amp; I will make arrangements when next I
