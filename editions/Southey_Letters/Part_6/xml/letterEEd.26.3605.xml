          <salute rend="indent0"> My dear Neville,</salute>
        </opener>
        <p rend="indent1"> It appears to me that whatever time you bestow upon the classics is
               little better than time lost.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Neville
                  White had enrolled at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1819 as a part-time Bachelor of
                  Divinity student. The course lasted ten years and required minimal residence in
                  Cambridge. The assessment was also light. He did not need to acquire this degree
                  in order to become a clergyman &#8211; he had passed his examination for the priesthood
                  in October 1820.</note> Classical attainments are not necessary for you, and even
               if you were ten years younger than you are, they would not be within your reach. This
               you yourself feel; you had better therefore make up your mind to be contented without
               them, and desist from a study which is quite impossible for you to pursue with any
               advantage to yourself.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My dear Neville, it is a common infirmity with us to over-value what
               we do not happen to possess. In your education you have learnt much which is not
               acquired in schools and colleges, but which is of great practical utility, &#8211; more
               probably than you would now find it if you had taken a wrangler&#8217;s degree, or ranked
               as a medallist.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">i.e. if White had achieved
                  academic success at Cambridge by being a wrangler (obtaining first class honours
                  in the third year of a degree), or by winning or being ranked in a university
                  competition (for example, the Chancellor&#8217;s Gold Medal). </note> You have mingled
               among men of business. You know their good and their evil, the characters which are
               formed by trade, and the temptations which are incident to it. You have acquired a
               knowledge of the existing constitution of society, and situated as you will be, in or
               near a great city, and in a trading country, this will be of much more use to you
               professionally, than any university accomplishments. Knowing the probable failings of
               your flock, you will know what warnings will be most applicable, and what
               exhortations will be most likely to do them good.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The time which classical studies would take may be much more
               profitably employed upon history and books of travels. The better you are read in
               both, the more you will prize the peculiar blessings which this country enjoys in its
               constitution of Church and State, and more especially in the former branch. I could
               write largely upon this theme. The greater part of the evil in the world, &#8211; that is,
               all the evil in it which is remediable (and which I take to be at least nine-tenths
               of the whole) &#8211; arises either from the want of institutions, as among savages; from
               imperfect ones, as among barbarians; or from bad ones, as in point of government
               among the oriental nations; and in point of religion among them also, and in the
               intolerant Catholic countries. In your own language you will find all you need, &#8211;
               scriptural illustrations, and stores of knowledge of every kind.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What you say concerning my correspondence, and the latitude which you
               allow me is both kind and considerate, as is always to be expected from Neville
               White. I do not, however, so easily forgive myself when a long interval of silence
               has been suffered to elapse. A letter is like a fresh billet of wood upon the fire,
               which, if it be not needed for immediate warmth, is always agreeable for its
               exhilarating effects. I who spend so many hours alone love to pass a portion of them
               in conversing thus with those whom I love.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You will be grieved to hear that I have lost my poor friend <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref>, whom you saw with us in the
               autumn. He left us at the beginning of November, and is now in his grave! This has
               been a severe shock to me. I had a most sincere regard for him, and very many
               pleasant recollections are now so changed by his death, that they will never recur
               without pain. He was so thoroughly amiable, so sensible of any little kindness that
               was shown him, so kind in all his thoughts, words, and deeds; and withal bore his
               cross so patiently and meekly, that every body who knew him respected him and loved
               him. Very few circumstances could have affected me more deeply than his loss.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Remember me most kindly to your excellent mother, and to your
                  sisters.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary White, n&#233;e Neville
                  (1755&#8211;1833), and her two surviving daughters, Frances Moriah White (1791&#8211;1854) and
                  Catherine Bailey White (1795&#8211;1889).</note> You are happy in having had your
               parents spared to you so long.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Neville
                  White&#8217;s father, John White (d. 1822), a Nottingham butcher, was also still
                  alive.</note> The moral influences of a good old age upon the hearts of youth and
               manhood cannot be appreciated too highly. We are all well at present, thank God.</p>
