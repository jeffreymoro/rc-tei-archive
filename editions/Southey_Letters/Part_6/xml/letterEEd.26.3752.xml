					in my concerns. The account is all right – but <del>xx</del> you have either forgotten to charge the Westminster
					stewardship demand, – or my credit on that score is suffering at Willis’s.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had been persuaded by his uncle, Herbert Hill, to share the role of Steward (i.e. bear part of the
						expenses) for the annual meeting of Westminster School ex-pupils in London. This took place at Willis’s Rooms in
						King Street, St James’s.</note> I dare say the former is the case. Thirdly when you settle my account with Joseph
						Locke,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified beyond the information given here. Southey goes on to
						make a double pun: firstly on the philosopher John Locke (1632–1704; <title>DNB</title>), <title>An Essay
							Concerning Human Understanding</title> (1689) and secondly on a ‘corn factor’, both a dealer in corn and someone
						whose boots produce corns.</note> who is the veritable Locke on the human understanding tell him from me that Boot
					&amp; Shoe maker does not sufficiently designate him on his cards, – for he ought to add Corn factor.</p><p rend="indent1"> If you have the Edinb: Ann: Register you may see some home truths stated in the third volume
					concerning the conduct of Government toward the persons in its employ.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Edinburgh Annual Register, for 1810</title>, 3.1 (1812), 211–215, especially Southey’s declaration that
						‘The emoluments of office almost in every department, and especially in all the highest, are notoriously
						inadequate’ (212).</note> Your statement is of a piece with the rest. I shall bear it in mind in my
						Colloquies,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and
							Prospects of Society</title> (1829).</note> – some of which it will not be long before I shall forward to
					you.</p><p rend="indent1"> You may rely upon it (doubt or deny it who will) that <ref type="m" target="people.html#GrenvilleLord">Lord Grenville</ref> has desired situations for <ref type="m" target="people.html#WynnCharlesWW">CWWW</ref>.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Negotiations had started in
						June 1821 to bring the followers of Lord Grenville, including Wynn, over to the government. Wynn was their most
						prominent spokesman in the House of Commons and it was always intended he would receive a Cabinet post. However,
						Wynn wished to be Home Secretary or Secretary for Ireland and for there to be a wider reshuffle, including moves
						to include some Whigs. He did not finally take up the post he had initially been offered, President of the Board
						of Control, until January 1822.</note> Fremantle<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">William Henry Fremantle
						(1766–1850), MP for various seats 1806–1827 and whip of Lord Grenville’s supporters in the House of Commons. He
						finally became a Commissioner at the Board of Control 1822–1826 and then Treasurer of the Household
						1826–1837.</note> Frankland Lewis;<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Frankland Lewis (1780–1855), MP
						for various seats 1812–1834 and 1847–1855. A supporter of Lord Grenville, he was made a member of the Irish
						Revenue Commission on 15 June 1821, the first public sign of a possible juncture between the Grenvillites and the
						government, and held a variety of posts down to 1830.</note> &amp; that the sole difficulty it is to find one high
					enough for his honour. He has not hinted any thing of this to me, – which he would do quite as soon as to <ref type="m" target="people.html#PhillimoreJoseph">Phillimore</ref>. My authority (which it is better not to repeat)
					is <ref type="m" target="people.html#LowtherWilliam">Lord Lonsdale</ref>, – who likewise told me that the Ministry
					are desirous of strengthening themselves by new connections, &amp; had spoken &lt;to&gt; <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref> accordingly; &amp; he desired that the matter might rest
					till his return from Germany:<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">George IV’s visit to Ireland ended on 3
						September 1821, and he had then proceeded to Hanover, of which British sovereigns were also rulers, on 27
						September, not returning until 8 November 1821.</note> desiring however that he might not have <ref type="m" target="people.html#CanningGeorge">Canning</ref><note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Canning had resigned as

					to him, for he thought himself ill used by his resignation when he had asked him to continue in office.</p><p rend="indent1"> I had a letter from <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">W Westall</ref> yesterday.
					He says nothing about the conveyance of the drawing hither.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Richard and
						William Westall wanted to produce illustrations for Southey’s <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title>
						(1814); these could then be inspected and purchased by readers and bound into their copies of the poem. The result
						was a set of engravings based on drawings by Richard Westall (1765–1836; <title>DNB</title>) and entitled
							<title>Illustrations of Roderick, the Last of the Goths. A Poem, by Robert Southey, Esq. from the Drawings of R.
							Westall R.A.</title> (1824).</note> This evening I must write to him. He has set his heart upon this scheme, from
					the pure desire of serving me, &amp; with a feeling that <del>xxxx</del> it is not fitting this sort of respect
					should be paid to other living poets &amp; not to me. The <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmen</ref> set their faces against it, because they thought it would not answer, &amp; therefore declined
					engaging in it; &amp; of course they are unwilling to have their opinion disproved. Just as the Whigs were that
						<ref type="m" target="people.html#WellesleyArthurWellington">Lord Wellington</ref> should defeat the French. I
					care about it only on <ref type="m" target="people.html#WestallWilliam">Westalls</ref> account. (By the bye I do
					not see that you have paid him for the Lake Views<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Either Westall’s

					America?) &amp; if he is bent upon the adventure, &amp; can find no other person to share in it I should have some
					money to dispose of in the spring, either from the Pen. War, or the B. of the Church,<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title> (1823–1832) and <title>The Book of the
							Church</title> (1824).</note> or both &amp; may as well risqué it in that way, as put it in the funds. But this
					must be entirely secret between ourselves, – you are the only person by whom I should chuse it to be known.</p><p rend="indent1"> The girls<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s daughters and probably their cousin,
