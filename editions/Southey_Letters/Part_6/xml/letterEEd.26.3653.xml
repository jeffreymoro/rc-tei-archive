        <p rend="indent0"> My dear Sir, &#8211; There is no doubt of your powers; there can be no doubt of your success to the
					height of your ambition when your judgement is sufficiently matured to choose your subjects well, and to feel that
					the arrangement is not of less consequence than the execution. And this tact you will not be long in acquiring.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> &#8216;The Baron of Kendal&#8217;<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Heraud had sent Southey his
						unpublished &#8216;The Baron of Kendal&#8217;, a historical drama; see Southey to Heraud, 13 March 1821, Letter 3650. In the
						event, his response to Southey&#8217;s critique, especially the unpleasant subject matter, was to decide against
						publication.</note> is the only one of your plays which I have read &#8211; I have not time to read the others (you know
					not how much I am occupied with works of great labour, more, I verily believe, both in number and magnitude, than
					any other man ever ventured to contemplate, much less to engage in at one time) &#8211; nevertheless I would have read
					the whole of the manuscripts could it have been of the slightest service to you. But there was no necessity for
					this. More power cannot be shown than the one displays, and power is all that can be looked for in the productions
					of one so young.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In the subject which you have now chosen, I am glad to hear that you mean to follow the
					historical events. You will thus avoid the main difficulties of constructing a drama. The historical drama is a
					distinct species, and one in which great things may be done. You ask me whether Nero&#8217;s poem is extant &#8211; the whole
					story of his setting fire to Rome has every appearance of mere vulgar calumny, and no such poem ever existed. I
					believe they were not his own verses which he is said to have repeated.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">According to some accounts, Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus (AD 37&#8211;68; Roman Emperor AD 54&#8211;68) sang the
						lost Latin epic &#8216;The Sack of Ilium&#8217; while the city of Rome burned in AD 64; see Gaius Suetoninus Tranquillus (c.
						71&#8211;c. 135), <title>De Vita Caesarum</title>, &#8216;Nero Claudius Caesar&#8217;, Chapter 37; and Cassius Dio (164&#8211;c. 235),
							<title>Historia Romana</title>, 62: 16&#8211;18. Heraud was planning a tragedy on Nero, which he sent to Southey in
						manuscript in 1822; see Southey to John Abraham Heraud, 9 April 1822.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> In &#8216;The Baron of K.&#8217; the story is too shocking &#8211; beware of anything monstrous in your fictions.
					That incredulity and consequent dislike against which Horace warns the poet, is provoked as much by the monstrous
					in morals, as in the creatures of fancy.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65&#8211;8 BC),
							<title>Ars Poetica</title>, lines 179&#8211;188.</note> If the catastrophe of your story (whether narrative or
					dramatic) is to be mournful, let it at least be just, or of that kind in which the reader will acquiesce with
					satisfaction, as being the best termination under the circumstances of the tale. To instance in one of my own
					works, &#8216;Roderick&#8217; is a tragic poem, but the reader can have no wish for a different catastrophe.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>Roderick, the Last of the Goths</title> (1814); the conclusion of which sees
						the Moors&#8217; defeat at the Battle of Covadonga (c. 722), the assumption of the throne by Pelayo (c. 685&#8211;737; King of
						Asturias 718&#8211;737) and Roderick&#8217;s disappearance into obscurity.</note> For all the parties in whom he feels
					interested it is the best that could have been wished them. But choose in preference, if you can, a fortunate
					conclusion, especially in the drama, when success so much depends upon the spectators. It is only the young who can
					endure to enter deeply into fictitious sorrows: as we grow older the heart stands rather in need of balm.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The shocking part of &#8216;The Baron&#8217; is the first crime, which is so monstrous that it would hardly
					be endured even upon the Spanish stage.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It is a great satisfaction to me that you feel the power of the hexameter,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had sent Heraud a copy of his <title>A Vision of Judgement</title>
						(1821).</note> though I think you overrate it, and I perceive that you attribute more to the management of the
					pauses than was ever in the mind of the writer. This is an error of the right kind. I thought a great deal of these
					things at your age; as I advanced in years I learnt to consider the general style, and if that be what it ought,
					particular effect will grow naturally out of it as fruit upon the tree.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> You have hit a blot, in p. 22.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of
							Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 6, lines 12&#8211;13: &#8216;Not without ingenuous shame, and a sense of compunction,/ More
						or less, as each had more or less to atone for.&#8217;</note> The last line is bad, the one before it worthless, and the
					whole passage, to say the least of it, not good. I shall strike out the two concluding lines, and let the rest
					stand. It is not worth the trouble of mending, if I could mend it. And the passage which immediately follows is
					relieved by it, to use a painter&#8217;s term. The first section of the poem is the best, the best lines in point of
					metre those in p. 29.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 1;
						and Canto 7, lines 47&#8211;53.</note> The best conception in the poem, that of Junius in his mask;<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Junius was the unknown author of the anti-government &#8216;Junius&#8217; Letters, published in
						the <title>Public Advertiser</title> 21 January 1769&#8211;21 January 1772. He was described in <title>A Vision of
							Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 5, lines 65&#8211;66: &#8216;Mask&#8217;d had he been in his life, and now a visor of iron/ Rivetted
						round his head, had abolish&#8217;d his features for ever&#8217;.</note> the parts best managed are the ends of the third
					section, where the matter-of-fact is well shaded off into the imaginative, and the conclusion which relates to the
					beginning, so as to produce a feeling of completeness.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">
            <title>A Vision of
							Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 3, lines 50&#8211;61, and Canto 12, lines 26&#8211;36.</note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> The Deluge is a noble subject for which I formed a plan drawn from the state of the present
					world, and to have been executed in hexameters as far back as the year 1799.<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">For Southey&#8217;s planned, but unexecuted, poem on Noah and the Flood, see <title>Common-Place
							Book</title>, ed. John Wood Warter, 4 series (London, 1849&#8211;1850), IV, pp. 2&#8211;3.</note> You will be struck by this
					coincidence. That plan is laid aside for ever, my race as a poet being nearly run. I meant to have adopted Burnet&#8217;s
					&#8216;Theory of the Earth,&#8217;<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Burnet (c. 1635&#8211;1715; <title>DNB</title>).
						Southey had planned to make use of his <title>Telluris Theoria Sacra</title> (1681), which speculated about the
						early history of the earth before and after the Flood; see Southey to William Taylor, 30 May 1799, <title>The
