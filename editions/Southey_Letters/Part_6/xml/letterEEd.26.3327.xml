        <p rend="indent0"> I have just received a note from M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Dart,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified, but possibly connected to the Miss Dart who ran a boarding-house at 1 St James&#8217;s Parade, Bath in the 1790s.</note> in a frank from London, &#8211; &amp; am vexed to perceive that she will leave London on the
						29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &#8211; A letter from hence would not arrive till the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> otherwise I
					would have written to assure her that I have not forgotten my schoolboy days, when I used to visit her on S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> James&#8217;s Parade. &#8211; &amp; I would have inclosed my letter to you, &#8211; as the surest way of finding
					you. &#8211; This being impossible, I will get it franked to your Clifton address, &#8211; your direction will be known there,
					&amp; the frank will retain its virtue wherever it may have to follow you.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Circumstances have made me postpone my journey to London till the fall of the leaf. &#8211; Your
						manuscript<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A manuscript of Bowles&#8217;s blank verse, autobiographical poem &#8216;The
						Birth-Day&#8217;. It was never completed, but was published in 1836.</note> will be sent here to me, &#8211; it may be long on
					the way, &#8211; but as soon as it comes you shall hear from me concerning it. I go into Scotland in the beginning of
					August for four or five weeks.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s tour of Scotland lasted from 17
						August until 1 October 1819. For his record of events, see <title>Journal of a Tour in Scotland in 1819</title>,
						ed. Charles Harold Herford (1929). </note>
        </p>
        <p rend="indent1"> As soon as your last letter from Clifton reached me, I wrote to <ref type="m" target="people.html#KingJohn">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> King</ref>,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">See
						Southey to John King, [c. 21 May] 1819, Letter 3299. </note> &#8211; he has not written to me in reply as I suggested, &#8211;
					but in this he is an habitual &amp; incorrigible offender, &#8211; so I know not whether he has seen you, &#8211; but I shall
					be much surprized if he has not. &#8211; I know both the Bowles&#8217;s of whom you speak. I was at school with Frank
						Bowles,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Francis Cheyne Bowles (1771&#8211;1807). Born at Bradford on Avon,
						Wiltshire, he was educated at home and at schools in Bristol, completing his medical training at St Thomas&#8217;s and
						Guy&#8217;s hospitals, London. Bowles became a surgeon at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in 1806, where he was a renowned
						teacher of anatomy. He is described thus in G. Munro Smith, <title>A History of the Bristol Royal
							Infirmary</title> (Bristol, 1917), p. 242: &#8216;He was always a hard worker, but in the early part of his life he
						combined work with a great deal of gaiety and social pleasure; afterwards he became serious-minded, and gave up
						many amusements, such as the theatre, of which he was very fond &#8230; The &#8220;Frank Bowles&#8221; of 1787, we are told, was a
						very different person from the &#8220;Mr. Bowles&#8221; of ten years later.&#8217; </note> (so he was then called) &#8211; when I was one
					of the youngest boys in the school, he one of the eldest. <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyHenryHerbert">My
						brother</ref> was a pupil of the Clergymans when he kept a school in the Lower Green at Bristol.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">The schoolmaster and clergyman, Edward Bowles (c. 1760&#8211;1808), who was a cousin of
						Caroline Bowles&#8217;s. In the early 1790s he was Precentor and Minor Canon of Bristol Cathedral, and an assistant
						master at Bristol Grammar School; he lived at Lower College Green in the city. He was later Vicar of Marden
						(1793&#8211;1805) and Vicar of Bradford on Avon (1804&#8211;1808).</note> I remember his (the Clergymans) wife<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1786 Edward Bowles married Jane (b. 1756), the only daughter of the clergyman
						Thomas Middleton (d. 1782). </note> before she was married. She was very intimate with <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyMargaret">my mother</ref>. This is going far back, &#8211; but my recollection goes farther.
					&#8211; I remember M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Dart before her marriage, &#8211; aye, more than forty years ago. Make my respects
					to her when you have an opportunity, &amp; say that if her note had found me in London, I would have lost no time
					in calling upon her.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Farewell. I hope your health has been improved at Clifton.</p>
