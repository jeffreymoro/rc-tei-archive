            <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>
                  (London, 1823&#8211;1832): Southey had wished the book to be printed by William Nicol (d. c. 1855), but Murray insisted on using his
                  regular collaborator, Thomas Davison (1766&#8211;1831). William Bulmer (1757&#8211;1830; <title>DNB</title>) was a celebrated printer of
                  high-quality publications. On his retirement in 1819, William Nicol took over his business.</note> He appealed to the Ben

               work &amp; worn-out types, &#8211; he might as well have appealed to it as a specimen of the style of my book, as of what its printing would
               be. I dare say you have hit upon the real cause of his breach of promise. He was short of capital when he entered upon his present
               large way of business, &amp; I happen to know that since that time he has been put to his shifts. &#8211; The present affair has vexed me on

                  good; &amp; the event was deserved by the justice, the generosity, the wisdom &amp; the magnanimity of the counsels that prepard it.

                  &amp; the last triumph of nautical discovery, which had so often been essayed in vain, has been accomplished under the British
                     flag.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">In 1819&#8211;1820, an expedition led by William Parry (1790&#8211;1855; <title>DNB</title>) had
                     been the first to cross the Arctic Circle and winter in the Arctic. It led to hopes that the north-west passage might finally be
                     discovered. Parry documented his exploits in <title>Journal for the Voyage of Discovery of a North-West Passage from the Atlantic

                  insulted &amp; attacked. Some notice of the rise of that licentiousness is taken in the following work. While the enormous evil
                  continues, there can be no tranquillity for the nation, no safety for the state: &amp; of the many miserable consequences which must
                  inevitably result from its continuance a sure one would be the loss of the liberty of the press, that wholesome liberty without
                  which no kingdom can prosper. If under <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">your Majestys</ref> reign this evil
                  should be effectually repressed, either by the prompt &amp; vigorous application of existing laws, or by the enactment of such new
