               First Lord, requesting that you will settle all demands for my Stewardship at the
               Westminster Meeting, &#8211; an office which I should not have accepted had it not been
                  <ref type="m" target="people.html#HillHerbertUncle">my Uncles</ref>
               wish that I should so do.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">An annual
                  meeting in London of ex-pupils of Westminster School; Southey had agreed to share
                  the post of Steward and thus take responsibility for some of the costs.</note> &#8211;
               My next request is that when you may be near King Street, Covent Garden, you will
               call at N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 24 &amp; pay &#163;3.10/ to Joseph Lock the shoemaker,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified beyond the information given
                  here.</note> who was born in the same street with me, &amp; is as perfect in his
               way as poor Hyde,<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Hyde (d. 1820) was

               He is therefore worth your seeing, tell him that you are an intimate friend of mine,
               &amp; set him going, &amp; I think you will pronounce him worthy of being appointed
               Boot &amp; Shoemaker to the Butler.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">&#8216;The
                  Butler&#8217; was a mythical hero of Southey&#8217;s and Bedford&#8217;s devising, about whom they

        <p rend="indent1"> I think you have forgotten to order certain clothes for me from Hydes
               successor, of whom I could not order them myself, because I know not <del>where he
                  xxxx</del> what his name is. Will you therefore, if it has not been already done,
               write a note to him, &amp; desire him to send me a black coat &amp; waistcoat, a pair
               of loose trousers, kerseymeer of any such mixture as may be &#8220;in vogue,&#8221; &#8211; &amp; a
               pair of black loose trowsers, for dress, &#8211; this last article I add <del>now</del> to
               the former order, &#8211; but if you have already given the order it is not worth while to
