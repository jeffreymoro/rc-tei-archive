        <p rend="indent1"> I have a long letter from the Paper-hanger, my poor namesake,<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">John William Southey (dates unknown), a
                  paper hanger and stationer, whose shop in 1794&#8211;1798 was at 35 Bedford Street,
                  Covent Garden. He had gone bankrupt in 1809. It is possible that he was from
                  Somerset and a very distant relative of Southey&#8217;s. Southey had sent him some money
                  in 1817.</note> &#8220;humbly begging my mediation with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Fisher to
               pay him his just demands, or necessity will oblige him to sue for it in the Court of
                  Requests,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Courts of Request were small
                  claims courts, modelled on the City of London&#8217;s Court of Requests, founded in
                  1518. The identity of Mr Fisher is unknown.</note> as he has been advised to do.&#8221;
               There are rogues enough in the world, &amp; this poor man may very possible be one,
               as you seem to think, but certainly he does not write like one. He has filled two
               huge pages with his family history, &#8211; which is rather interesting to me at this time,
               when I have been procuring the registers of my own, as far as they can be traced, &#8211;
               unfortunately they do not extend so far back by one generation as I <del>want</del>
                  require.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey was dealing with the
                  consequences of John Cannon Southey&#8217;s (d. 1768) fantastically complex will, which
                  gave Southey some hope of inheriting property at Fitzhead after the death of his
                  third cousin, and John Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir, John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord
                  Somerville (1765&#8211;1819; <title>DNB</title>). To try and prove that he was John
                  Cannon Southey&#8217;s heir at law, Southey had instituted a search of the parish
                  registers at Wellington in Somerset, the home of his ancestors; see Southey to
                  Henry Herbert Southey, 28 February 1820, Letter 3447.</note> &#8211; He thinks it his
               duty he says humbly to beg my interposal, &amp; goes on with a dismal story of
               distresses which it is quite out of my power to relieve or to mitigate. The Southeys
               it seems were a very numerous race in the days of K William,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">William III (1650&#8211;1702; King of Great Britain 1689&#8211;1702;
                     <title>DNB</title>).</note> &#8211; they have not thriven in the world.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> Good old <ref type="m" target="people.html#WilsonMrs">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Wilson</ref> has been speechless &amp; senseless since Thursday
               morning &#8211; she has sunk under the burden of 78 years, <del>xxxx</del> fairly worn out;
               &#8211; it is therefore surprizing that after the stroke she should so long continue to
               exist. &#8211; It is an aweful thing to have Death in ones house. Sixteen years had made
               her one of the family, &#8211; she had taken a full share in all its joys &amp; its
               sorrows, &amp; tho we have looked on to this it is <del>xxxxxx matter of</del>
               impossible not to feel much now that the hour is come. She has led an innocent,
               happy, humble life: always ready in kind offices, &#8211; never was there a more generous
               spirit, nor a more tender heart. She was never out of sight of these mountains, &#8211;
               scarcely ever out of this immediate circle. &#8211; I shall endeavour to say something
               about this in a different manner when the subject is less painful.</p>
