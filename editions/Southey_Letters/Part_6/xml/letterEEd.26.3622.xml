                  III (1578&#8211;1621; King of Spain and Portugal 1598&#8211;1621). This manuscript had been
                  brought to Southey&#8217;s attention by James Gooden, and Constable had agreed to
                  purchase it and let Southey make use of it for his <title>History of
                     Brazil</title>.</note> The matter is curious, &amp; has never before seen the
               light. I have also for the additional notes, the items of the whole establishment of
               the colonial Government, a very curious document.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">This document was not included among the &#8216;Supplemental Notes&#8217;
