                  Bell&#8217;s educational schemes and owned the Storrs Hall estate on Windermere. He was

                  work had been commissioned by Watts&#8217;s daughter and heiress, Mary Watts-Russell
                  (1792&#8211;1840), who had married, in 1811, another heir to a business fortune, Jesse
                  Watts-Russell (1786&#8211;1875), MP for Gatton 1820&#8211;1826. Southey had mentioned it to
