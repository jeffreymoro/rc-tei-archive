                  of the Crown Bill (1817) had aimed to end the practice whereby all office-holders had to be re-appointed to their posts on the death
                  of the monarch. This often involved considerable expense and inconvenience. The legislation had been introduced by George Ponsonby
                  (1755&#8211;1817; <title>DNB</title>), an Irish Whig MP and Leader of the Opposition 1808&#8211;1817. George III (1738&#8211;1820; King of Great
                  Britain 1760&#8211;1820; <title>DNB</title>) had died on 29 January 1820, thus making the issue urgent for office-holders like Southey.
               </note> &#8211; The Mill, as you suppose, is at work; &#8211; the event did not take me altogether unprepared; &#8211; I had thought of it with reference
               to my task, &amp; was ready with as much of a plan as usually serves me for beginning with.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> A beginning I have now made; &#8211; the matter will bear more resemblance
               to Dante&#8217;s cast of imagination than to &lt;that of&gt; any other writer.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Dante Alighieri (c.
                  1265&#8211;1321), <title>Divine Comedy</title> (1308&#8211;1321).</note> But for the mould in which it is cast, I am half afraid to tell you
               that I am writing in hexameters, &#8211; because you will lift up both hands against such an experiment. But you will instantly perceive that
               it is the form &amp; length &amp; proportion of the metre, which must be taken from the ancients, &amp; not the laws of it. More than
               twenty years ago I tried it, &amp; produced about a hundred lines;<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Coleridge and Southey&#8217;s

                  in <title>Oliver Newman: A New-England Tale (Unfinished): With Other Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp. 113&#8211;116.</note> as
               soon as my ear became accustomed to it I found it not more difficult to compose than blank verse. Without doing any <del>xxxx</del>
               violence to the language by inversions, or requiring from the reader any knowledge of what an hexameter is, to enable him to give it
               its proper accentuation; but leaving that to follow (as in any other kind of verse) from the natural &amp; proper pronunciation of the
               words. I find it a full &amp; sonorous measure, capable of great strength, great sweetness &amp; great variety of movement. This you
               may rely upon, that if the thoughts will support the measure, &#8211; the measure will support the thoughts. &#8211; I hope it will not much exceed
               three hundred lines. &#8211; But even this will delay my movements two or three weeks longer than I had intended.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My anticipations are of the same complection as yours, &#8211; &amp; yet I shall be one of the last to despair. The tendency
               of the age is plainly towards revolution, &#8211; &amp; that not in government alone, &#8211; but in religion &amp; in the institutions of
               property. There are many preservative principles at work, &amp; if the press were curbed, I believe that we should weather the storm.
               We are so duped by words &amp; phrases in this country, that no statesman ventures to speak out upon the evils of the press, whatever
               he may think of them. Nothing however can be more certain than that the Press will subvert every thing, if more efficacious measures

               if the existing laws were found incapable of reaching a publication so thoroughly mischievous as that, they would have been brought to
               the <hi rend="ital">reductio ad absurdum</hi>, &amp; the necessity for a new one would have been demonstrated. &#8211; I have begun a series
               of dialogues upon the prospects of society, &#8211; in which my aim is to collect as much light as I can from the past.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">This plan became <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>
