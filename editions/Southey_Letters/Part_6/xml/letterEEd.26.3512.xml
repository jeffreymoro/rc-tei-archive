               polyandrianism existed in Galloway as late as the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> century,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey
                  mentioned this idea in a note to his <title>Sir Thomas More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title>
                  (London, 1829), II, p. 290. Southey’s source was the <title>Vita</title> of St Aelred (1110–1167; <title>DNB</title>), misattributed
                  to John Capgrave (1393–1464; <title>DNB</title>), and inserted in <title>Acta Sanctorum</title>, 68 vols (Antwerp and Brussels,
                  1643–1940), January, Vol. I, p. 750.</note> – perhaps, if it be so, the last remains of that system which Cæsar found among the
                  Britons.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Julius Caesar (100 BC–44 BC), <title>Commentarii de Bello Gallico</title>, Book 5,
                  lines 8–12, claimed the British tribes he encountered in his invasion of 54 BC practised polyandry. This passage is now usually
                  interpreted as an attempt to discredit the British as barbarians.</note> It is very certain that the Druidical religion existed till
               that time, &amp; much later, in Wales. Davies has proved this beyond all controverting, by passages from the Welsh poets, in his
               Mythology of the Druids, which is much the most curious book that has ever been written upon Welsh affairs.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Edward Davies (1756–1831; <title>DNB</title>), <title>The Mythology and Rites of the British Druids</title> (London,
                  1809), pp. 461–500, no. 797 in the sale catalogue of Southey’s library. Davies did not claim that Druidism survived into the twelfth
                  century, but only into the fifth and sixth centuries, and in Scotland, rather than Wales.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> My intention is to begin the Moral &amp; Literary History of England with the English language,<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">This project did not result in a book; the surviving notes that Southey put together were posthumously published as

               are made at leisure, at loose times, – odds &amp; ends of time: – more matter of amusement &amp; dissipation than of business. I am <hi rend="ital">busy</hi> in finishing the introductory chapter for the Peninsular War.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s

                  (dates unknown), younger daughter and co-heiress of James Pigott (d. 1822) of Fitz-Hall, Iping, Sussex. Fitz-Hall was only five
                  miles from Susannah Rickman’s home at Harting. Emma Pigott married, in 1824, Edward Brice Bunny (d. 1867) of Speen Hill,

                  revolutions in Italy had begun with a mutiny in Naples in July 1820. Austria did intervene to crush the revolution in 1821, but
                  France did not object to this development.</note> – but if Austria should attempt to crush the revolutionary spirit by arms, &amp;
               France interfere, which any French Government whether Bourbon or Buonapartean would eagerly do when fair occasion invited, – then I
               know not what would prevent a general war, except a general explosion on the continent, – &amp; that indeed seems more than likely. The
               only hope then would be that it might be so general as to preclude all possibility of our interference, so they might then cut each
               others throats with fraternal hatred, &amp; perhaps we might grow wise by looking on.</p><p rend="indent1"> As for Messalina,<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821; <title>DNB</title>),

                  and deprive her of the title of Queen. She rejected compromise terms offered by the Cabinet and arrived in England on 5 June 1820.
                  Southey compares her to Messalina (c. AD 17/20–48), the notoriously dissolute third wife of Claudius (10 BC–AD 54; Emperor of Rome
                  AD 43–54).</note> – she acts like a desperate woman, &amp; seems to be ruining herself –</p><closer><salute rend="indent2">God bless you</salute><signed rend="indent3"> RS.</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
