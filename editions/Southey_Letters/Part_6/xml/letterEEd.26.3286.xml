        <p rend="indent1"> I have had a dismal house for the last four or five weeks. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Edith</ref>
               was laid up with what it was supposed would prove an abscess, &#8211; &amp; this prostrated her till the <ref type="m" target="people.html#SoutheyCharlesCuthbert">child</ref> became so much affected with a cough &amp; cold, that she forgot her own
               ailments. We hope the child is better, &#8211; no fever has attended the complaint, &amp; probably a change of weather will prove more
               efficacious than any medicines could do. A bitter East wind has been prevailing for the last five days. <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">Ediths</ref> tumour is still in the same state, large as an egg &amp; hard, but it would give her
               no pain were it <del>xx</del> not in a part which makes sitting <del>xxx</del> more inconvenient than any other posture. I am not the
               better for the uneasiness which all this has given me.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> My third volume<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey&#8217;s <title>History of Brazil</title> (1810&#8211;1819). The
                  third volume grew to 950 pages and cost &#163;3 3 shillings, while the second volume (692 pages) had cost &#163;2 10 shillings and the first
                  volume (622 pages) only &#163;2 2 shillings.</note> will be thicker than I could wish. The <ref type="m" target="people.html#LongmanThomas">Longmen</ref> however will price it accordingly &amp; I will not leave any thing undone which it
               is in my power to do. I have sent off two portions of the concluding chapter, which is a view of the whole country at the time when the
               history ends.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Chapter 44, <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London 1810&#8211;1819), III, pp.

                  Portugal) 1790&#8211;1805. His journal of a visitation of his diocese in 1784 appeared in <title>Jornal de Coimbra</title>, 17 (May 1813),
