						1818&#8211;1823, created 1st Baron Wallace 1828. He had inherited Carleton Hall, near Penrith. When Southey&#8217;s
						conservative Address from Cumberland following the &#8216;Peterloo&#8217; meeting was deemed too combative, Wallace produced a
						more moderately pro-government second Address, which was published in the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, 29
						October 1819 and was notably circumspect in its reference to events at &#8216;Peterloo&#8217;.</note> &#8211; The opportunity is

					latter is upon the authority of young Kotzebue, &amp; he quotes the English at Tauris for it.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Moritz von Kotzebue (1789&#8211;1861), <title>Narrative of a Journey into Persia, in the

						catalogue of Southey&#8217;s library.</note> But it has the suspicious addition that it is deadly to strangers only,
					&amp; does not hurt the natives of the places where it is found. I confess myself very unwilling to believe these
					stories, &#8211; such insects would seem to disturb the order of creation as much as flying dragons, or creatures which
					should possess wings with the propensity &amp; the <del>power</del> &lt;strength&gt; of the Lion or Tyger. The balance
