        <p rend="indent1"> ... ... What you relate of <ref type="m" target="people.html#TaylorWilliam">William Taylor</ref> is quite characteristic of
               the manner in which he abuses his own powers, playing the mere sophist, and
               disregarding the opinions and feelings of others; careless how he offends and hurts
               them, though as incapable as man can be of giving intentional pain, or doing
               intentional wrong. He was not serious, for he knows very well that to call for proof
               of a negative is an absurdity, and that reason <hi rend="ital">and discourse of
                  reason</hi> are very different things. If he misleads some, his example operates
               as a warning upon others. They see how he has squandered his abilities, and that the
               hereditary blindness<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Sarah Taylor, n&#233;e
                  Wright (d. 1811), William Taylor&#8217;s mother, had been blind in later life.</note>
               which he has some cause to apprehend, and of which he lives in fear, is not the
               darkest evil in his prospect. There is no rest but in religious faith, and none know
               this more feelingly than they who are without it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> It would not surprise me if an expert Roman Catholic priest (were he
               to come in his way) should ensnare him in a spider&#8217;s web of sophistry, more skilfully
               constructed than his own, and of a stronger thread. The pleasure of defending
               transubstantiation would go a long way towards making him believe in it.</p>
        <p rend="indent1"> What a state is Ireland in at this time!<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Severe disturbances in the west of rural Ireland had begun in
                  October 1821 and continued for the next two years. The Cabinet called on troops
                  from England and the Empire to try and enforce order, with little immediate
                  success.</note> The horrors of the Irish massacres<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The massacre of Protestant settlers in the Irish Rebellion of
                  1641. Estimates of the numbers killed varied wildly, from 4,000 to 200,000,
                  depending on the point of view of the person making the estimate.</note> may be
               credited in their whole extent, because we see that the same temper is exhibited at
               this time, and the same atrocities perpetrated in retail, opportunity being all that
               is wanted for committing them upon the great scale. The state of things in that
               country is a reproach to human nature, and our Government has much to answer for.
               They must know that such a people ought to be kept under military law till they are
               fit for anything better; that they stand in need of Roman civilisation, and that no
               weaker remedy can possibly suffice. Cromwell&#8217;s government,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Oliver Cromwell (1599&#8211;1658; Lord Protector 1653&#8211;1658;
                     <title>DNB</title>). He had conquered Ireland in 1649&#8211;1650 and Scotland in
                  1650&#8211;1651.</note> if it had lasted twenty years longer, would have civilised that
               island. His tyranny was as useful there and in Scotland as it was injurious in
               England, because they were barbarous countries, and he introduced order and despotic
               justice into both. But in England we had order and justice before his time. The
                  rebellion<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">The civil wars of
                  1642&#8211;1651.</note> dislocated both, and it was not possible for him to repair the
               evil in which he had been so great an agent. ...</p>
