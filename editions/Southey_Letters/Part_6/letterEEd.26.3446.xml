               not worth while to look after them, she being perfectly certain that I am the old

                  John Southey Somerville, 15th Lord Somerville (1765–1819; <title>DNB</title>).
                  Aunt Mary had intended to search the parish registers at Wellington, Somerset, to
                  prove that Southey was John Cannon Southey’s heir at law, i.e. the person entitled
                  to inherit his real property if he died intestate.</note> Upon this I immediately

               from growing fat. The prospects of that family are among my most uncomfortable
