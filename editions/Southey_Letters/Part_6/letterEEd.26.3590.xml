					Princess Elizabeth.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s duty as Poet Laureate was to produce a New
						Year’s Ode for 1821; his poem was later published as ‘The Warning Voice. Ode II’ in <title>The Englishman’s
							Library: Comprising a Series of Historical, Biographical and National Information</title> (London, 1824), pp.
						384–389. Princess Elizabeth of Clarence (1820–1821) was briefly third in line to the throne, after her father,
						William, Duke of Clarence (1765–1837; King of the United Kingdom 1830–1837; <title>DNB</title>). She was born on
						10 December 1820 and died aged 12 weeks. As she was born six weeks prematurely, Southey was perhaps wise to be
						cautious about celebrating her in verse.</note> To which anticipated recommendation I now reply, that I could not
					venture upon so precarious a subject as that of an infants life, lest the infant should die &amp; so the sing-song
					be like a new coloured coat in a sudden <del>court</del> general mourning: – &amp; moreover that if the infant
