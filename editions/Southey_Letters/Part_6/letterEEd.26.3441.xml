               lasted, except by those persons who had no means of increasing their means,
               (annuitants &amp;c.) The weight was not more than was required to keep the wheels of
               a vast machine in motion. We were then in our economical relations – cut off from the
               rest of the world, When peace came the mischief was in taking off too much of the
               weight, &amp; letting in disturbing causes. As far as I understand the reasoning of
               the Agriculturalists at this time, it seems to have been well founded. <hi rend="ital">Their</hi> distress is owing to the effects of the war. That of the
               Manufacturers is not. It would have been brought about by the Steam Engine <del>in

               means of machinery would always have tempted them to overstock the market, &amp; to

                  workforce, whom Southey compares to the brutish Yahoos in Jonathan Swift
