By this nights I shall
               write to <ref type="m" target="people.html#MurrayJohn">Murray</ref> saying that you will deliver the drawings to him, &amp; informing
               him of the price. That they have in them that which is common to poetry &amp; painting, I do not doubt, – &amp; I only wish it were
               possible for you to engrave them yourself. The first edition of the book would then bear a high value hereafter.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey wished to include engravings of drawings by Westall in his proposed ‘Dialogues’, which were to
                  be published by Murray; see Southey to John Murray, 28 October 1820, Letter 3546. This book eventually appeared as <title>Sir Thomas
                     More: or, Colloquies on the Progress and Prospects of Society</title> (1829), and included six engravings of scenes in the Lake
                  District, taken from Westall’s work. </note> – In describing that scene on the side of Walla Crag, I have introduced your name in a
               manner gratifying to my own feelings, &amp; which I hope will not be otherwise to yours.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 1, ‘The Trance’, Southey’s note to lines 2–3, ‘from surrounding things the
                  hues with which day has adorn’d them/ Fade, like the hopes of youth’: ‘This effect of twilight, and in the very scene described, has
                  been lately represented by Mr. William Westall, in one of his Views of the Lakes, with the true feeling and power of genius. The
                  range of mountains which is described in these introductory lines, may also be seen in his View of the Vale of Keswick from the
                  Penrith road’ (p. [49]). Southey had written the Introduction to Westall’s <title>Views of the Lake and of the Vale of
                     Keswick</title> (1820), which contains the two views mentioned here – ‘Keswick Lake from the East Side’ and ‘Keswick Lake from
                  the Penrith Road’.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I am glad to hear you are employed &lt;upon&gt; your views of Winandermere. My topographical knowledge in that quarter is but
               imperfect. But when you want your letter-press, – if you cannot persuade <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> to write it, (who would be in all respects the best person) – I will do for you the best I can.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A series of drawings by Westall, published as <title>Four Views of Windermere</title> (1821). Neither
                  Southey nor Wordsworth wrote an introduction to these views.</note></p><p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#ColeridgeDerwent">Derwent</ref> is at Cambridge, &amp; we are all much obliged to you
               for the offer of an introduction, which will certainly be very creditable to him, &amp; may easily be useful also.</p><p rend="indent1"> Allow me to say one thing before I conclude. When you were last at <ref type="m" target="places.html#Keswick">Keswick</ref> there was an uncomfortable feeling in your mind towards <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref>. I
               hope it has past away. There is not a kinder-hearted creature in the world than he is, – &amp; I <hi rend="ital">know</hi> that he has
               the truest regard for you. &amp; the highest possible respect for your genius. Any offence that he may have given was entirely
               unintentional. Forget it, I intreat you: call upon &lt;him&gt; again, as you were wont to do, – it will rejoice him, &amp; you will not feel
               the worse for having overcome a feeling of resentment. I <del>xxxx</del> need not apologize for saying this, – for indeed I could not
               longer forbear saying it, consistent with my regard both for him &amp; for you.</p><p rend="indent1"> All here desire their kind remembrances. We cannot send them to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Westall,<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Ann (1789–1862), née Sedgwick, who had married Westall on 22 September 1820.</note> because you did not
               give us an opportunity of becoming known to her. But I pray you present our best wishes,</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> &amp; believe me</salute><salute rend="indent2"> yours affectionately</salute><signed rend="indent3">
