							<title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821).</note> In the course of a fortnight you will receive the book. The
					hexameters have nothing uncouth in their appearance, the type being adapted to their <hi rend="ital">longitude</hi>
					rather than to the size of the page; – &amp; for their effect upon the ear, it must be a stubborn prejudice that
					maintains its ground against them. But a good pelting shower of abuse I shall have, sans doubt: – having with some
					ingenuity contrived to give matter, or pretext, of offence to all parties, like a very Ishmaelite.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey compares himself to the biblical Ishmael, <title>Genesis</title> 16:12: ‘ his
						hand <title>will be</title> against every man, and every man’s hand against him’.</note> For I have neither placed
					Pitt nor <ref type="m" target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Fox</ref> among the Worthies of the late reign, &amp;
					you may easily guess how that sin of omission will be resented.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">‘The
						Worthies of the Georgian Age’, <title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (1821), Canto 10, included neither Fox, the
						hero of the Whigs, nor William Pitt (17 59–1806; <title>DNB</title>), Prime Minister 1783–1801, 1804–1806, hero of
						the government’s supporters.</note> Then in the Preface I have a passage by no means weakly worded, which my
					worthy friends <ref type="m" target="people.html#Byron">Lord Byron</ref> &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#MooreThomas">Moore</ref> will take to themselves, as a set <del>part</del> off in part,
					against some obligations due to them.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Vision of Judgement</title>
						(London, 1821), ‘Preface’, pp. xvii–xxii, where Southey denounced ‘the Satanic school’ of poetry without naming
						any one poet. This was, as far as Byron was concerned, Southey’s response to the suppressed ‘Dedication’ to the
						first two cantos of <title>Don Juan</title> (1819), which had lampooned Southey mercilessly.</note> And I have
					written a Dedication to <ref type="m" target="people.html#GeorgePrinceRegent">the King</ref>, with some doubt
					whether it may be proper to print it, in point of form, because it touches upon the state of the Press; &amp; if
					this should be thought to look as if I were appointing myself one of the Kings Counsellors, – I have given a
					discretionary power of throwing it behind the fire.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey here refers to
							<title>A Vision of Judgement</title> (London, 1821), ‘Dedication’, pp. [v]–viii. However, the earlier draft of
						the ‘Dedication’, in Huntington Library, San Marino, HM 2733, shows Southey had intended to be more controversial
						and urge that ‘adequate remedy should be applied to that intolerable licentiousness of the press … either by the
						vigorous application of existing laws or by the enactment of such new ones as the suspension of the abuse may
						render necessary’. Southey had submitted the ‘Dedication’ to Grosvenor Bedford and asked him to consult Herries on
						its propriety, Southey to Grosvenor Bedford, 22 January 1821, Letter 3614.</note> But if there be no informality
					in it, it will set the Whig-&amp;-Jacobite swarm in motion. These villains cannot hate me more than they do, &amp;
					I will lose no opportunity of making them feel me. They shall find me by far the most formidable of their
					antagonists. There is a page about the Opps. (in the Peninsular War) now lying in the proof before me, which you
					would enjoy.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s <title>History of the Peninsular War</title>, 3 vols
						(London, 1823–1832), I, pp. 55–58, contained a vigorous denunciation of the Whigs for seeking peace with
