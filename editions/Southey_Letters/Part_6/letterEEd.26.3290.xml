                  (founded 1786) had offered a prize for an ode praising King Charles XIV John, the former French Marshal, Jean Bernadotte (1763–1844;
                  King of Sweden 1818–1844). Landor had sent his entry, the Latin ode ‘Ad Gustavum Regem Suedorum’ (1819), to Southey, asking him to
                  act as an intermediary. Southey had used Bedford and Herries to convey the poem to Gustaf Algernon Stierneld (1791–1868), Swedish
                  Ambassador to the United Kingdom 1818–1828; see Southey to Grosvenor Charles Bedford, 21 March 1819, Letter 3269. Landor did not
                  win, and his ode was unpublished until it appeared in <title>Poemata et Inscriptiones</title> (London, 1847), pp. 219–220. </note>.

               his Idiot Boy, &amp; of the same pitch; – with fine things in it, &amp; a prologue which you will be much pleased with.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Wordsworth’s <title>Peter Bell, A Tale in Verse</title> (1819), which was dedicated to Southey. The
                  comparison is with ‘The Idiot Boy’, <title>Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems</title> (London, 1798), pp. 149–179. The two
                  poems were connected in another way. The first draft of ‘Peter Bell’ had been composed in 1798, but the poem remained unpublished

               printing the last chapter of Brazil, – containing a view of the state of the country at the time when the history concludes, – that is,
               when the Court removed thither.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey, <title>History of Brazil</title>, 3 vols (London,
                  1810–1819), III, pp. 696–879. The <title>History</title> went up to the removal of the Portuguese court to Brazil in
                  1807–1808.</note> Of the new States which are rising in the world, I think Brazil is likely to be the greatest. It is less likely to
               fall asunder than Yankee-land, &amp; tho the Brazilians are woefully behind the Yankees in every thing else, they have a sense of
               honour, generally prevailing among them, <del>in</del> which the Anglo Americans seem to have renounced. Besides the tendency of Brazil
               at this time is towards improvement in every thing; – the tendency in America is to level down every thing to the dead flat of vulgar
               ignorance: they wish to have no other Master of Arts than he who has the Ready Reckoner at his fingers end.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Here Southey compares the knowledge of someone who has graduated from, for example, Cambridge University, most of
                  whose degree course consisted of the study of mathematics, with that of someone who could make use of a ‘Ready Reckoner’, a table of
                  numbers for simple calculations.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I have seen lately three young American travellers,<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors"><ref type="m" target="people.html#EverettEdward">Edward Everett</ref>, <ref type="m" target="people.html#TicknorGeorge">George Ticknor</ref>,
                  and Joseph Green Cogswell (1786–1871), bibliographer and educationist.</note> all singularly accomplished men, from New England, –
               two of them indeed among the most accomplishd men in fine literature whom it was ever my fortune to meet. But such men who would do
               honour to Old England, (&amp; for that reason regard the mother country with admiration &amp; reverence) are as rare in America, as men
               of old Roman virtue are in the country wherein you are sojourning. Every thing tends to make the Americans merely ephemeral in their
               thoughts &amp; feelings. They have no classical learning, – no ancestry, no antiquities, – Our French neighbours <del>were of</del> are
               fond of comparing us to the Carthaginians, – the parallel would suit the Americans better, – for their commercial, military, &amp;
               naval skill, – their boundless ambition, – their dishonesty, &amp; their <del>total</del> want of <del>every thing that is truly great
                  &amp; glorious</del> literature. New England is infinitely the best part of America, – there the people are becoming more English in
               their feelings, – &amp; it is not a little curious that in that country the first attempts should be made for introducing an
                  <del>Established Ch</del> religious Establishment.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey is referring to Lyman Beecher
                  (1775–1863), <title>An Address of the Charitable Society for the Education of Indigent Pious Young Men for the Ministry of the
                     Gospel</title> (New Haven, Connecticut, 1814). This address was widely reported in Britain; see, for example, the <title>Literary
                     Panorama and National Register</title>, 7 (June 1816), 468–471. Southey had subscribed to this publication since 1809; it was no.
                  1734 in the sale catalogue of his library. Southey later used this information in his article on ‘New Churches’, <title>Quarterly
                     Review</title>, 23 (July 1820), 549–591 (at 550–551).</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I have made some progress in my New England poem, &amp; like what I have done.<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey’s unfinished epic, set in New England. The completed sections were published after Southey’s death in <title>Oliver Newman:
                     A New-England Tale (Unfinished): With Other Poetical Remains</title> (London, 1845), pp. 1–90.</note> The swarm of imitative
               poets in this age is really surprizing, &amp; the success with which they imitate their models would be surprizing also, if it did not
               prove that there can be no great difficulty in producing what may be imitated so well. Morbid feelings, atrocious principles,
               exaggerated characters &amp; incidents of monstrous &amp; disgusting horror, make up the fashionable compound, – the more unEnglish,
               unchristian &amp; immoral the better, provided it be <del>in</del> slavered over with a froth of philosophy. – I have fewer imitators
               than any other poet of any notoriety, – the reason is <del>probably</del> that I am less fashionable, – &amp; perhaps also that I am
               less a mannerist. To make up for this I am favoured with more abuse than all the rest collectively, – <ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> comes in for a pretty large share, &amp; very often we go together. If my
               name be found in such company hereafter, it will be enough.</p><p rend="indent1"> You are mentioned in a newspaper essay this week (the Westmorland Gazette) as the English poet who most resembles

                  Gazette’, <title>Westmorland Gazette</title>, 8 May 1819, had argued that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s (1749–1832) ‘closest English
                  representative is perhaps Walter Savage Landor – a man of transce[n]dent genius’. The author was, of course, the paper’s editor,
