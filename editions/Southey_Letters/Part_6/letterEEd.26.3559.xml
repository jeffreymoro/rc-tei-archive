               to the draft <del>xxxxx</del> by perusing the two letters which are herewith sent, (&amp; which you may destroy when you have done with
               them) better than by any explanation on my part. – A mistake there has evidently been, not in me, but either in <ref type="m" target="people.html#BellAndrew">his</ref> reading, or in M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> WRs<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The
                  letter deals with an embarrassing, and potentially very damaging, situation relating to the refusal by a bank in London to pay a
                  bill of exchange presented on Southey’s behalf because an incorrect (and higher) sum had been entered on the bill. It therefore
                  looked as if Southey had deliberately, and fraudulently, overcharged for his services. The money Southey was owed was payment for
                  writing an ‘account’ of David Pike Watts (1754–1816), a fabulously rich wine merchant and philanthropist, who had been an important
                  supporter of Andrew Bell’s educational schemes and owned the Storrs Hall estate on Windermere. He was also the uncle of the painter
                  John Constable (1776–1837; <title>DNB</title>). The work had been commissioned by Watts’s daughter and heiress, Mary Watts-Russell
                  (1792–1840), who had married, in 1811, another heir to a business fortune, Jesse Watts-Russell (1786–1875), MP for Gatton 1820–1826.

                  was usual practice.</note> knowledge of the matter, &amp; without the slightest fault in him, or in you, or in any one else, having
               been an uncomfortable circumstance, which has given me as you may suppose some vexation. I wish you therefore just to make it known to
                  M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dickie that there has been a mistake, &amp; that the note is withdrawn. Now I am not sure that it becomes me
               to ask leave of the bankers to draw for the 400. On the contrary if I can do without it, it will I think be better to let it stay till
               I shall have finished the Memoir. And having had 50£ from you, I can do without it (if I am not kept long without any payment for the

               determination of mine, – &amp; you will not find to what it alludes. The matter (between ourselves) was this, he asked why I would not
               think of taking orders, &amp; I gave him without delay or hesitation very sufficient reasons why such a step would be a very
               injudicious one – reasons which are not worth repeating <del>here</del>, because you may judge what they would be<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Southey had probably told Bell that while he was a defender of the Church of England he could not
                  subscribe to all its doctrines and so it was impossible for him to be ordained. </note></p><p rend="indent1"> Last night I resumed my hexametrical Carmen Funebre,<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>A Vision of

                  performed at court.</note> If I complete it to my liking (as I expect) I may publish it without farther delay. The profit can be but
               a few pounds, but the poem will do me credit, &amp; so will the experiment in metre, whether it <hi rend="ital">take</hi> for the
               present or not: that it will be followed hereafter I doubt not.</p><p rend="indent1"> King Mob, contrary to his Majestys custom, has borne his faculties meekly in this place, &amp; my windows were not
               assailed on the night of the illumination.<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">Under extreme pressure from George IV, the Cabinet
                  had reluctantly agreed to introduce a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House of Lords to deprive the King’s wife, Caroline of
                  Brunswick (1768–1821; <title>DNB</title>), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the King. On the Third Reading of
                  the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the House
                  of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore had announced the Bill would be withdrawn. As was customary when a
                  national victory was celebrated, many householders put lighted candles in their windows. This occurred at different dates in
                  different towns, mostly between 11 November and 16 November 1820; in Keswick the celebration was on 15 November 1820.</note> I was
               prepared to suffer like a Quaker, &amp; <ref type="m" target="people.html#FrickerEdith">my Governess</ref> was much more <hi rend="ital">game</hi> upon the occasion than I expected. Perhaps we owed our security to the half dozen persons in town, who also
               chose to light no candles to the Devil. They had declared their resolution of making a fight for it, if they were attacked, &amp; they
               happened to be persons of consideration &amp; influence. So all went off peaceably. The <hi rend="ital">tallow-chandler</hi> told our
