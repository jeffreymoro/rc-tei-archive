Marvellous it may well be called. The summits of the
               mountains were free of snow till the last week in January; what had fallen before that time had never remained twelve hours. The valley
               has only been whitened once, and then only inch-deep, and for half a day, and the ground has never been hard frozen. We had a greater
               variety of flowers at Christmas than April in all likelihood will supply. </p><p rend="indent1"> You are going to Switzerland, I hear, and though we shall miss you in the autumn, I am glad that you have determined
               upon an excursion which will give you so much pleasure, and concerning which I shall have so much pleasure in talking with you.
               Whatever route you may take, I hope you will not omit the ride from Meiringhen to Sarnen, the lake and valley of Lungern being
               (Interlaken <hi rend="ital">perhaps</hi> alone excepted) the loveliest scene which I remember in the country. And the little valleys
               which you cross in passing the Brunig are the very perfection of pastoral scenery. But I am particularly desirous that you should see
               the Flying Tree,—the most astonishing thing that I have ever seen, or ever expect to see.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">On his
                  continental tour of 1817, Southey had reached Alpnach in Switzerland on 11 July 1817. There he saw the eight-miles-long ‘Slide of
                  Alpnach’, erected to convey logged spruce trees from the mountainside to the lake below. The trough, a feat of engineering supported
                  on a timber frame over several ravines, was so angled as to transport the tree trunks from forest to shore in no more than six
                  minutes.</note> I have very much repented that we did not remain a day for the purpose of seeing the scaffolding both in the
               mountain where it begins, and at the river where it terminates. It is about two miles from Sarnen, on the way to Alpnach. Let me also
               recommend to you our Unterseen guide, Hans Roth,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Hans Roth (dates unknown) had acted as a guide
                  to Southey, Senhouse and Nash on their walking tour in central Switzerland.</note> for whose good-nature and good qualities <ref type="m" target="people.html#NashEdward">Nash</ref> will vouch, and whose honest countenance will recommend itself. He was ten days
               in our company, and we were so attached to him that we were quite sorry when the time of parting came. </p><p rend="indent1"> I fear you will see our country with altered eyes when you return to it, though I can perfectly understand why it is in
               some respects more suited to a painter’s purposes. But Switzerland excels as much in beauty as in grandeur. I do not envy the magnitude
               of its mountains, for which far too great a price is paid, in the perpetual insecurity which they occasion (to say nothing of the foul
               waters which they produce), but there is a beauty in the softer scenery which may well be envied, and in the Alpine valleys a charm
               altogether peculiar. I am now remembering more particularly those which lie between Martigny and Chamouny. </p><p rend="indent1"><ref type="m" target="people.html#WordsworthWilliam">Wordsworth</ref> may be congratulated upon coming off so well in
               the Magazine.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A portrait of Wordsworth, painted in 1817 by Richard Carruthers (1792–1876), and
                  engraved by Henry Meyer (1782/3–1847; <title>DNB</title>), had appeared in the <title>New Monthly Magazine</title>, 11 (February
                  1819), between pp. iv and 1.</note> The print is not so good as the drawing in my possession, because it does not so well represent
               his capacious forehead; but on the whole it is a respectable likeness, and would be thought excellent by those who are not intimate
               with his face. I have figured twice in the Magazines with much worse fortune: once they made me like a Calvinist preacher, and once
               like a writing-master.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">An engraving of Southey had appeared in the <title>New Monthly
