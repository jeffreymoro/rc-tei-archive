               Andrew Knight<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Andrew Knight
                  (1759–1838; <title>DNB</title>), of Downton Castle, Herefordshire. He was a
                  leading horticulturist and botanist, and President of the London Horticultural
                  Society 1811–1838.</note> is more likely to explain than any other person: – how
               is the common fact to be accounted for, that a peach-stone is frequently found broken
               to pieces in the fruit, the fruit itself having received no injury? S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pierre asks if it is caused by “electricity, vegetable or animal,” – with
               reference I suppose to some of his fanciful theories.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (1737–1814),
                     <title>Harmonies of Nature</title>, 3 vols (London, 1815), II, pp.
                  85–86.</note> The fact is common enough, &amp; I wonder at not having wondered at
               it &amp; asked myself the question before. The possible solution which occurs to me
               is that the kernel may have grown too large for its shell &amp; burst it: – there
               must be some reason why the stone instead of being smooth like that of other fruit is
               fretted with hollow-work; – it would give way, I think, more easily because of that
               formation, to an internal force.</p><p rend="indent1"> My radical neighbours here behaved well in their triumph for the
               Queens escape from justice: they illuminated their own houses but did not molest the
               half-dozen persons in the town who put up no light on the occasion.<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Under extreme pressure from George IV, the Cabinet
                  had reluctantly agreed to introduce a Bill of Pains and Penalties into the House
                  of Lords to deprive the King’s wife, Caroline of Brunswick (1768–1821;
                     <title>DNB</title>), of the title of Queen and to dissolve her marriage to the
                  King. On the Third Reading of the Bill on 10 November 1820, the government
                  majority was only nine votes and it seemed very unlikely the Bill could pass the
                  House of Commons. Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, therefore had announced the
                  Bill would be withdrawn. As was customary when a national victory was celebrated,
                  many householders put lighted candles in their windows. This occurred at different
                  dates in different towns, mostly between 11 November and 16 November 1820; in
                  Keswick the celebrations occurred on 15 November 1820.</note> I was glad when the
               night was over, having hardly expected to escape without a few stones. At all times I
               would face a mob, &amp; should do it by day-light with as much confidence as
                  Wesley<note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors">John Wesley (1703–1791;

                  anecdotes of how ‘Wesley … never, on any occasion, lost his calmness or his
                  self-possession’ (II, p. 31) when faced with an angry mob.</note> himself; – but
               the chance of making any impression upon them would be very much lessened by
               darkness. The eye has as much power as the voice, perhaps more; – &amp; besides you
               see to whom <del>you</del> &lt;to&gt; address yourself. – This mention of Wesley brings to
               my mind a communication which I have recently received concerning him from the Dean
               of Worcester,<note n="8" place="foot" resp="editors">John Banks Jenkinson
                  (1781–1840; <title>DNB</title>), Dean of Worcester, 1817–1825, Bishop of St

               seriously. It is the copy of one of those letters which M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>
               Wesley carried off when she finally separated from him.<note n="9" place="foot" resp="editors">Mary Wesley (1709/10–1781). She was a widow at the time of her
                  marriage to John Wesley in 1751. The relationship was troubled and on 23 January
                  1771 Mary left her husband for the final time. She took with her ‘part of his
                  Journals, and many other papers, which were never restored’, Southey, <title>The
                     Life of Wesley; and The Rise and Progress of Methodism</title>, 2 vols (London,
                  1820), II, p. 302.</note> The Dean vouches for its authenticity, &amp; has given
               me references by which to authenticate it. The letter is from one of his female
                  disciples,<note n="10" place="foot" resp="editors">Elizabeth Briggs

               was a virtuous &lt;young&gt; woman over whose mind he had obtained the most unbounded
               influence, &amp; with whose person he, at the age of sixty five, had taken the most
               unwarrantable liberties, – such as both to shock &amp; alarm her, while she yet
               remonstrates in the strongest language of reverence as well as affection: – I put it
