               accessible, for the greater part. There existed no history of that great region before I undertook the subject; &amp; <del>now there is

               of any other country. I know how remote the subject is, &amp; how little interest it will promise to the great mass of the public. And
               I expect from it neither popularity nor profit in my own time. But it must make its way slowly &amp; surely, &amp; become a standard
