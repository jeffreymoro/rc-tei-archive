               written to you by the same vessel, but want of time prevented him, &amp; he has therefore desired me to communicate to you the
               following fact. “A French brig, called the Aurora, arrived here sometime ago from Cayenne (now in possession of the French)<note n="11" place="foot" resp="editors">Cayenne is the capital of French Guiana; it was occupied by British and Portuguese forces in 1809 and
                  only returned to France in 1817.</note> her<del>x</del> Captain<note n="12" place="foot" resp="editors">Unidentified.</note> has
               been buying slaves here, &amp; sailed this day (Oct 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) with a considerable number of these miserables for
               Cayenne, where it is generally understood he means to land them. Now this is against English, Portugueze &amp; French laws.<note n="13" place="foot" resp="editors">Britain had abolished the slave trade in 1807 and France had done so in 1815. It was not legal (after
                  1815) for Portugal to engage in slave trading north of the Equator.</note> If he gets safe in he will have made an excellent
               speculation. It seems that the French Government (of Cayenne) prohibited the circulation of Portugueze copper money.<note n="14" place="foot" resp="editors">The currency in use in Brazil was the Portuguese real. Copper coins for denominations smaller than one
                  real had circulated since the 1750s. In 1809 all existing copper coins were overstamped and their value doubled.</note> The Captain
               or Supercargo of this brig bought it up very much below its <del>value</del> current value in the Portugueze Dominions, &amp; came here
               with it. He has purchased slaves, &amp; some British manufactures, but principally the former, with the copper, &amp; if he gets these
               people safe into Cayenne he will obtain an enormous price for them. This copper will do us some harm in our trade, as it is
               disadvantageous to receive part of our payments in such money. – I hear there are no British cruisers off Demerara<note n="15" place="foot" resp="editors">A Dutch colony (now Guyana), next to French Guiana; it was captured by Britain in 1803 and formally
                  ceded to Britain in 1815.</note> &amp; that neighbourhood. If so, there will be a good deal of slave smuggling going on between
               Maranham, Para &amp; Cayenne, &amp; probably Surinam.”</p><p rend="indent1"> I have now received from <ref type="m" target="people.html#KosterHenry">Koster</ref> the whole of his abridgement of
               the History of the Abolition into Portugueze, which would make about 200 pages in octavo, – such pages as the original.<note n="16" place="foot" resp="editors">Koster had argued the ‘Impolicy of the Slave Trade’ in his <title>Travels in Brazil</title> (London,
                  1816), pp. 445–456; and Southey had suggested that Koster should translate into Portuguese an abridgement of Clarkson’s
                     <title>History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave–Trade by the British
                     Parliament</title> (1808).</note> I am strongly persuaded that if these were printed it would do much good in many ways among the
               Brazilians. It would convince them of the wickedness of the trade, – it would possess the young with humane &amp; generous feelings,
               &amp; it would dispossess the old of those prejudices against England – especially with regard to her conduct upon this very point,
               which are excited by the Anglo-Portugueze press. Three Portugueze journals are at this time printed in London – (there were four) all
               three inculcate <del>an</del> envy hatred &amp; malice towards England, – two of them are revolutionary, the one with little, – the
               other with no disguise; – the third, tho set up by the late <del>Minister &lt;Portugueze&gt;</del> P. Embassador as an antidote betrays its

                  1803–1814. The third (openly ‘revolutionary’) journal was <title>O Portuguez</title> (1814–1822). The fourth, defunct, journal might
