               <h2><span class="head">About this Edition</span></h2>
               <p>This electronic edition of Mary Robinson’s <em>Nobody</em> (Drury Lane, 1794) is the first to present a widely available and searchable transcript
                  of the play along with a comprehensive introduction, extensive notes by the editor,
                  and contexts of the drama. The open-access format and the accompanying contextual
                  materials make this edition ideal for teaching and research.</p>
               <p>Based on the only surviving manuscript of the play (LA 1046) housed in the Larpent
                  collection at the Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, CA, this edition reproduces
                  the clean copy made by the theater and submitted to the Licensor of Plays. It is an
                  edition that presents few difficulties for transcription. I have made only the following
                  minor alterations: </p>
               <div class="citquote">
                  <dl>
                     <dt></dt>
                     <dd>In the manuscript, the epilogue immediately follows the prologue. I have moved the
                        epilogue to the end of the play in keeping with the order in which it would be performed.</dd>
                     <dt></dt>
                     <dd>I have not reproduced page numbers and have not maintained the line breaks as they
                        appear in the manuscript. Accordingly, I have also removed hyphens when they appear
                        in words across line breaks.</dd>
                     <dt></dt>
                     <dd>In the manuscript, end punctuation is sometimes omitted in sentences that conclude
                        at the right margin of the page. I have inserted appropriate punctuation in brackets
                        to mark these instances, but only when a sentence of this sort is followed by another
                        complete sentence, spoken by the same character.</dd>
                     <dt></dt>
                     <dd>I have deleted repetitions of text when they provide no further information. For instance,
                        in the manuscript, two subsequent pages indicate the beginning of “Act 2.” I have
                        therefore omitted one of these instances.</dd>
                     <dt></dt>
                     <dd>In the manuscript, periods or colons appear at the end of characters’ names, though
                        not always, and this punctuation is sometimes underlined. For consistency, I have
                        inserted a period at the end of all character names but do not underline the period.</dd>
                  </dl>
               </div>
               <p> I have otherwise maintained the characteristic features of the manuscript, including
                  format, spelling, capitalization, punctuation, act and scene headings, and stage directions.
                  My aim has been to present, as closely as possible, the state of the play in 1794,
                  when it was submitted for production.</p>
               <p>The contexts section of this edition—comprised of a collection of newspaper puffs
                  and reviews, visual satire, and poetry and prose extracts—provides a snapshot of the
                  build up and intense reaction to the staging of <em>Nobody</em>. Contemporary texts, images, and commentary uncover the historical and cultural framework
                  within which Robinson produced her drama and, as such, offer insight into how <em>Nobody</em> engages some of the most pressing socio-political issues of the day.</p>

               <h2><span class="head">About The Editor</span></h2>
               <p><span class="hi">Terry F. Robinson</span> is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto. Her current book project
                  examines how eighteenth-century histrionic theory and practice influenced literary,
                  artistic, and cultural innovation in the Romantic period. She is co-editor of the
                  essay collection <em>Transnational England: Home and Abroad, 1780-1860</em> (Cambridge Scholars, 2009), and her articles have appeared in <em>Nineteenth-Century Literature</em>, the <em>European Romantic Review</em>, and <em>Studies in Romanticism</em>, among others. In 2010, she was awarded the Nineteenth-Century Studies Association
                  best essay prize for 
                  “Mary Robinson and the Dramatic Art of the Comeback.”

               <h2><span class="head">About The Design</span></h2>
               <p>This edition was designed and TEI-encoded at the University of Maryland by Michael
                  Quilligan, Site Manager at <em>Romantic Circles</em>. Laura Mandell developed the modified versions of the transforms provided by the
                  TEI that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. TEI renders text archival quality
                  for better preservation and future access. The image associated with this edition
                  includes elements from Thomas Rowlandson's <em>The Gaming Table at Devonshire House</em> (1791).</p>

               <h2><span class="head">Acknowledgments</span></h2>
               <p>I would like to thank the Henry E. Huntington Library, namely Sue Hodson, for granting
                  permission to reproduce <em>Nobody</em> online and Meredith Berbée and Catherine Wehrey for their helpful assistance with
                  the manuscript. I am also indebted to Jeffrey N. Cox, Taryn Hakala, Daniel Robinson,
                  and Dana Van Kooy for reading various portions of this edition and for providing constructive
                  and insightful feedback. Many thanks are due as well to <em>Romantic Circles</em>, particularly to Tilar Mazzeo for her fast and friendly responses and to my blind
                  reader for valuable recommendations concerning formatting and notations. This edition
                  has also benefited from the publication of <em>The Works of Mary Robinson</em> (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2010), particularly with regard to William D. Brewer’s
                  insights into Robinson’s drama.</p>
