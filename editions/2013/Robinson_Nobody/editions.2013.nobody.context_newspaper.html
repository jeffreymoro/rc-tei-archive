               <p class="noCount">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span>’s œconomy, and benevolence towards the unfortunate, disarm even the malice of her
                  enemies! Her very eminent theatrical talents are the least of her claims to admiration,
                  when it is remembered that those talents are always cheerfully exerted to serve the
                  <em>distressed</em>, or amuse the Public.</p>
               <p class="noCount">We are glad to find that the report of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>’s retiring to Italy is doubtful; we have had too many instances of emigration already,
                  and trust she will not quit a country so highly flattered by her distinguished talents.</p>

               <p class="noCount">A Turban, and single White Feather, is the simple head dress worn by our <span class="foreign">Belles</span>. Equality seems the motto of the most dashing Fair, as they still appear as <em>Nobody</em>.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Lord and Lady <span class="smcap">Malden</span> are returned to town from Warley Camp. . . .</p>
               <p class="noCount">Whatever impropriety there might have been in introducing Miss <span class="smcap">Wallis</span> into the Stage-Box after her performance of Imogen, certainly that young actress
                  is to be excused, and it would be cruel should she suffer in the public estimation.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Our Cavalry Associators of the present day, are as much <em>encumbered</em> as the heroes of Antiquity who wore <em>armour</em>. It is not unusual to see them on duty in the Playhouse Lobbies, with helmet, broad-sword,
                  long spurs, whips, umbrellas, cross-belts, and cartouch-box!!</p>
               <p class="noCount">Lady L. is quite astonished that the <em>swinish</em> multitude should dare object to any thing that she may please to countenance. <span class="smcap">Caligula</span> made a Consul of his horse; and our upstart Nobility will soon have the presumption
                  to take front rows in the boxes for their <em>lap-dogs</em>.—Their <em>puppies</em> are already sufficiently troublesome! . . .</p>
               <p class="noCount">The engagement of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Wallis</span> is for three years, at eighteen pounds a week. Her father is alive; and she is not,
                  as reported, a <em>Ward in Chancery</em>.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Miss <span class="smcap">Wallis</span> was invited into Lady <span class="smcap">Loughborough</span>’s box, the first night of her performance; if the audience were displeased, they
                  should attribute the cause to her Ladyship, and not to this favourite actress, whose
                  object it must be to please and conciliate, and not give offence to the audience.
                  . . .</p>
               <p class="noCount">The Lady Gamblers exclaim loudly against the war, but are yet preparing decoys for
                  the country, of whom they expect to have a tolerable plucking. <span class="foreign">Rouge et noir</span> is to take the lead during the winter.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Much idle nonsense has been uttered against Miss <span class="smcap">Wallis</span> appearing in the front Boxes. But we are of opinion, that actors of respectability
                  and eminence have a right to sit where they please in the Theatre. The only objection
                  we have is, that to see them mingle with the Audience after they perform, removes
                  the impression previously made by the delusion of the Scene.</p>

                  employed by the Keeper of the last new Gambling–house set up in St. James’s-street,
                  to kidnap young Men of Fashion, and take them to the Pharo Table, where they are sure,
                  if possessed of thousands, to lose every stiver.</p>

               <p class="noCount">Saturday evening, a Farce called <em>Nobody</em>, was performed for the first time.</p>
               <p class="noCount">On the first intimation of this production, we thought it referred to our old acquaintance
                  at school; the authour [sic] of all unfathered mischiefs; and who, in our opinion,
                  would have furnished laughable materials for a Frace.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. Robinson, the reputed Authour of the present Entertainment, has chosen another
                  species of character, which goes under the denomination of <em>Nobody</em> in High Life.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. Robinson, in a peculiar style of poetry, has seised [sic] the sentimental palm;
                  to the attainment of which, the efforts of Della Crusca have been directed. But <span class="foreign">non omnia possumus omnes</span> [we cannot all do everything]; the long and patient attention necessary to the developement
                  [sic] of tender sentiment, seems to have unfitted her for the arrangement of farcical
                  incidents.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The effect of the Entertainment is a sort of weariness which the French call <span class="foreign">Ennui</span>; and which was so much felt by the audience, that a great part of it strongly opposed
                  its being given out for a second representation.</p>

               <p class="noCount"><em>DRURY LANE THEATRE</em>.</p>
               <p class="noCount">A New Farce, entitled, <span class="smcap">Nobody</span>, written by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, was performed at this Theatre on Saturday night. The scene is taken from high life,
                  and is intended as a laudable exposure of those dames of Fashion, who in departing
                  from the delicacy of their sex, commence Gamesters, involving by such conduct, not
                  only their own characters in ruin, but that of others in this Vortex of fashionable
                  depravity. The story of the piece is simple. Lady <span class="smcap">Languid</span>, the heroine of the scene, is beset by a croud of flutterers, but her admirers diminish
                  in proportion to her ill success at Play. Sir <span class="smcap">Harry Rightly</span>, a respectable citizen, is rewarded by her hand, in consequence of his generosity
                  and constancy: a reformation takes place in the lady, and the parties are happily
                  united.</p>
               <p class="noCount">With such slender Materials, it cannot be expected that this Farce abounds in Incident
                  or Interest. <span class="smcap">Bannister</span> represents one of those nauseous and senseless Fops, that infest every place of public
                  resort, and though the character is well conceived, it is not as well drawn as we
                  could have wished.</p>
               <p class="noCount">There are certain objectionable <em>things</em> in the double entendre, that the good sense of the Lady will induce her to expunge,
                  and we “<em>cry her mercy</em>,” if we should, in defiance of her superior judgment, disagree with her in observing,
                  that it is possible to have too much of a <em>good thing</em>. The House was full of Fashion, and to this we attribute the sentiments of disapprobation
                  manifested at the conclusion, as Gambling is become a vice so general that there were
                  few in the Boxes that were not displeased at the exposure of their dissipation and
                  depravities.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The Prologue was delivered by Mr. Barrymore, and the Epilogue by Mrs. Jordan. They
                  were both well received, and do honour to Mrs. Robinson, from whose pen they come.
                  The Farce was given out for a second representation for this evening.</p>

               <p class="noCount">THEATRE,<br/> <span class="smcap">DRURY-LANE</span>.</p>
               <p class="noCount">A new Afterpiece, whimsically called “<em>Nobody</em>,” was brought out before a numerous assembly on Saturday.—It is the production of
                  Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, whose poetical talents have so justly raised her to literary distinction. The plan
                  of this little Comedy (for its structure is correctly within the rules of regular
                  Drama) is, to exhibit in gay satire the frivolous manners, and degrading dissipation
                  of high life. Though there is no novelty in the idea, there is pleasurable ease in
                  the dialogue, and severe truth in the pictures which she draws. If the characters,
                  though all theatrically familiar to the Audience, had been actively engaged in business,
                  and their conversations had been animated by incident, of which the subject was fruitful,
                  it would have been a most agreeable Afterpiece; but unfortunately they have so little
                  to do, that the heart is fatigued with scenes which lead to no purpose, and which
                  do not connect and carry on an interest. A pair of jack-boots, left by an arch simpleton
                  in the dressing-room of <em>Lady Languid</em> is neatly and dramatically improved into a tale of scandal by her friends; and the
                  wisdom of such friendships is still further exemplified by their refusing to lend
                  her a rouleau, when pigeoned at the Faro-table. If something more of this kind of
                  incident had been sprinkled over the light surface of the fable, it would have been
                  a favourite performance. The writing is easy, and in parts epigrammatic; but we cannot
                  flatter Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> with saying that her muse is likely, in this instance, to shine with the graceful
                  eclat that u[s]ed to accompany her personal appearance on the Boards.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span> performed the part of the arch simpleton, which she did with that force and energy
                  which characterise her humour.—She sang a little Scots madrigal with the most touching
                  melody, and in which she was rapturously encored. Miss <span class="smcap">Pope</span>, who never appears without giving pleasure to every heart, had, in her first scene,
                  a good female caricature of masculine manners to exhibit, which she did with true
                  comedy.—She had afterwards to undergo the trouble of dressing for nothing. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bannister</span> had literally nothing to do worthy of himself. The wit of the part was exhausted
                  in the dress. Mr. <span class="smcap">Barrymore</span> wore, what no gentleman ever appears in, black silk breeches with a frock coat.—We
                  mention it only because we see the gallants at this Theatre too often drest in this
                  shabby style.</p>
               <p class="noCount">-------------------<br/> <em>For the</em> MORNING CHRONICLE,<br/> ----------<br/> <span class="smcap">THEATRE</span>.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcap">MR. EDITOR</span>,</p>
               <p class="noCount">I was one of the many at Drury-lane House, on Saturday evening, to attend the performance
                  of the new Comedy, entitled, <em>Nobody</em>, and saw the first act with pleasure, although mixt with expectation and hopes of
                  something better. The second act unfortunately fell off, rather than rose, in degree
                  of attraction, point, and merit, and ultimately provoked the displeasure of that important
                  <em>Somebody</em>, the Audience, the generality of whom seemed disgusted with the manners, and disappointed
                  by the use and disposal of the characters and their escape of justice. I have often
                  witnessed a more unwarrantable sentence of judgment passed in the Theatre, from caprice,
                  accidental ill-temper, or want of due attention to the grounds and aim of the satire
                  exhibited. In <em>Nobody</em>’s case nobody was to blame; and I may be bold to say this, because the author of
                  the <em>petite Comedie</em> of Saturday has taught me, that, as <em>nobody </em>was meant to be personified, <em>Nobody</em> can claim a right to complain: but, all play upon words apart, I should forget what
                  is due to Mrs. Robinson’s merit as a poet and general writer, if, as one of her literary
                  admirers, I did not step forward, and admit that her object was a fair one, her way
                  of treating it entitled to credit, her colouring correct, and her picture strikingly
                  just; but unfortunately her subject was ill-chosen, her characters were too faint
                  for general intelligibility and relish, and her <em>tout ensemble</em> wanted interest, and consequently was deficient in impression and effect. The truth
                  is, the topics have already been touched on by Mrs. Inchbald, in her Comedy of <em>Next-door Neighbours</em>, and the satire brought to a point by the author of a short piece, called, <em>A Quarter of an Hour before Dinner</em>, frequently performed at Mr. Colman’s Theatre. The dissipation of high life is itself
                  a mere matter of censurable affectation; for I defy a human being possessed of a tolerable
                  understanding, to say conscientiously, that he or she derives any rational gratification
                  from it: hence it is too unsubstantial for satire, and too feeble for ridicule. It
                  will not bear the light, but, upon exposure, appears to be a system of folly so flimsy,
                  so false, and so unnatural, that <em>Nobody</em> will believe any such system every had existence, or that two individuals possessed
                  of a grain of sense could possibly agree to persist in so absurd a system of life.</p>
               <p class="noCount">In the Comedy called <em>Nobody</em>, all the characters promise much in the first act, but, excepting <em>Nelly Primrose</em>, like true West-end-of-the-town folks, they promise much and perform nothing. <em>Sharpley</em> is the dullest nobody that ever belied his name with utterance.<em>Lady Rouleau</em> also comes on with a bustle, and ends with shewing that her dress, forward manners,
                  and forward tongue only serve to prove that she is <em>nobody</em>. In short, the manners of the dissipated Great may be chosen for a <em>tableau</em> by the artist who lives on their favours, but they will never furnish a good subject
                  for a <em>tableau parlant</em>: like the visionary presentment of future Kings to Macbeth, they may be said to “come
                  like shadows, so depart.” <span class="right">W.</span></p>

               <p class="noCount">Report ascribes this production to Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, and indeed the second act bears evidence of its truth, in the delicacy and neatness
                  of the sentiments from the character of a philanthropist.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcap">Nobody</span>, we conceive to be so named, inasmuch as the Author wishes to exhibit fashion without
                  individuality. Whether any <em>faux pas</em> has arisen from the aukward introduction of <em>jackboots</em>, instead of those belonging to any of our female equestrians, we neither know, nor
                  is it material to enquire. Such an incident constitutes the <em>embarras </em>of the present trifle.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span> has always lived in fashionable life; and <em>Nobody</em> need take the trouble to tell her how evanescent are the essences of which it is
                  composed.</p>
               <p class="noCount">This being premised, we must acknowledge that the copies are correctly drawn. The
                  slandering coxcomb, at once a fool and a fortune-hunter, is every day to be seen sauntering
                  up St. James’s-street. You cannot turn the corner of the promenade without receiving
                  a whiff of his unintelligible jargon, addressed to a creature, who associates without
                  hearing, and who is welcomed in his turn with the same polished inattention.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The Faro party might have more to say, and <em>Lady Languid </em>would be the better for some act of virtue, which might make her merit her good fortune.
                  We can suppose her only complexionally vicious, and fashionable complexion will easily
                  change; but in the drama every thing should be clearly made out.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Nelly Primrose</em> and her innocent blunders are pleasing, though not quite broad enough for an after
                  piece, where to laugh, and laugh heartily, is always expected.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The <span class="smcap">Prologue</span> intimated that all assistance had been declined: and the audience were conjured to
                  kindness, lest the contrary should bring the writer to her <em>last night</em>. Certainly the <span class="smcap">many</span> had a struggle against the <span class="smcap">illnature</span> which a <span class="smcap">few</span> were forward in displaying.</p>

               <p class="noCount">After <em>Congreve</em>’s pantomimical Tragedy of the <em>Mourning Bride</em>, in which Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siddons</span> appeared to greater advantage than we can recollect to have seen her, a new Comedy,
                  under the whimsical appellation of <em>Nobody</em>, was presented on Saturday evening.</p>
               <p class="noCount">This piece is the avowed production of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, whom the Prologue stated to have formerly trod the boards of <em>Old Drury</em>, and who is better known to the world at large by the title of <em>The Perdita</em>.</p>
               <p class="noCount">It was rather unfortunate, notwithstanding the strong<em>cast</em> of <em>Nobody</em>, that hardly <em>any body</em> was disposed to give it a parting plaudit. The fact is, that in a very humble attempt
                  to give a large portion of smart dialogue, the necessary requisites of an interesting
                  plot, novelty of character, and probability of situation, have been totally placed
                  on the dramatic shelf.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span> is brought forward as an aukward country servant, merely to misunderstand the manners
                  and expressions of a fine Lady; and, to use the language of <span class="smcap">Bayes</span>, all the wit of the piece lies in the <em>boots</em> of the Butler, which she introduces by mistake into her Mistress’s dressing room.
                  This, and a trifling attempt at the drawling <em>non chalance</em> of a Modern Beau, and the forward excentricity of a Female Martinet, completely anticipated
                  by Reynolds’s <em>Lady Sarah Savage</em>, make up the sum total of <em>Nobody</em>’s merits.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The dialogue is replete with puns of the coarsest kind; some of them too forced and
                  far fetched even for Farce. The tedious scene of cross purposes and cross readings
                  in the first act, is wholly taken from <em>Barnaby Brit[tle]</em>, and the <em>Deaf Lover</em>; but unfortunately the situations only have been borrowed.—The wit and humor are
                  left untouched. Though the sense of the House was completely against a repetition
                  of such nonsense, it was given out with much flippancy by <span class="smcap">Barrymore</span>. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the interval between Saturday and Monday has
                  been employed in a judicious compressment by the Manager. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Goodall</span> should be instructed not to call for her carriage so often, and it would be as well
                  not to let the Lady’s Maid so grossly disturb the propriety and etiquette of a drawing
                  room, as to break in abruptly, in order to tell the company she was quitting her place
                  because the Butler had called her an ORIGINAL.</p>
               <p class="noCount">We had almost forgot to add, that Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span> sung a Scotch ballad, unaccompanied, in a very charming stile, which gained a deserved
                  encore.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The Prologue and Epilogue turned on the title of the Comedy. In the latter, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span> proved much at fault; and of course the little effect intended, was entirely destroyed.</p>

                  plot, novelty of character, and probability of situation, have been totally placed
                  on the dramatic shelf.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Mrs. Jordan is brought forward as an aukward country servant, merely to misunderstand
                  the manners and expressions of a fine Lady; and, to use the language of Bayes, all
                  the wit of the piece lies in the <em>boots</em> of the Butler, which she introduces by mistake into her Mistress’s dressing-room.
                  This, and a trifling attempt at the drawling <em>nonchalance</em> of a Modern Beau, and the forward eccentricity of a Female Martinet, completely anticipated
                  by Reynolds’s <em>Lady Sarah Savage</em>, make up the sum total of <em>Nobody</em>’s merits.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The dialogue is replete with puns of the coarsest kind; some of them too forced and
                  far fetched even for Farce. The tedious scene of cross purposes and cross readings
                  in the first act, is wholly taken from Barnaby Brittle and the Deaf Lover; but unfortunately
                  the situations only have been borrowed—the wit and humor are left untouched. </p>
               <p class="noCount">The opposition which it experienced throughout was considerable, and a part of the
                  audience carried their disapprobation to the length of not suffering the performers
                  to go through the whole of the piece, which terminating thus abruptly, Mrs. Jordan
                  came forward, and delivered the Epilogue in a tremulous and agitated tone of voice,
                  evidently much embarrassed. The Prologue was spoken by Barrymore.</p>
               <p class="noCount">When announced for a second representation, the <em>noes</em> appeared to have the majority. It cannot be said, however, that <em>No-Body</em> supported it, for the plaudits, although in the minority, were very numerous.</p>

                     <em>The True Briton</em>.</em></p>
               <p class="noCount"><span class="smcap">After</span> the representation of the <em>Mourning Bride</em> on Saturday, in which Mrs. <span class="smcap">Siddons</span> supported the character of <em>Zara</em> with true force of expression, dignity, and feeling, maugre a very severe cold; and,
                  in which <span class="smcap">Kemble</span> gave <em>Osmyn</em> with as much ability as the character will admit; a new farce was brought forward,
                  under the title of <span class="smcap">Nobody</span>.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The object of this piece was to place in proper ridicule the follies and vices of
                  fashionable life; and the piece, though evidently intended as a mere dramatic sketch,
                  was really a pleasant portrait of the manners of the higher ranks. There was also
                  another purpose in this drama, of more value in point of morals: for it was also intended
                  to show how easily a reputation may be lost by the use to which mere <em>appearances</em> may be converted by the aid of <em>malice</em>.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The story is simply as follows:—<em>Lady Languid</em>, a widow with a considerable fortune, is seduced into the gay world, and precipitated
                  into most of its follies, and particularly into the vice of gaming, by which she is
                  nearly ruined. She is beset with fortune-hunters of <em>Ton</em>, who, without delicacy, leave her the moment her fortune is supposed to be lost.</p>
               <p class="noCount"><em>Sir Henry Rightly</em>, a wealthy and amiable city merchant, is in love with her; and though his worth makes
                  little impression upon her amidst the seduction of fashion, he determines to make
                  a final effort to save her from ruin, to reform her morals, and to make her the partner
                  of his life. For this laudable purpose he accompanies her to a fashionable rout, and
                  at length succeeds in reclaiming her, after she has proved the insincerity of all
                  her gay connexions.</p>
               <p class="noCount">There is much pleasantry arising from the awkward mistakes of a <em>Somersetshire wench</em>, who attends <em>Lady Languid</em> in her dressing-room, and who commits numerous blunders in attempting to obey the
                  orders of her mistress. One of her mistakes, when her mistress calls for her <em>boots</em>, (an article of attire with modern fine Ladies) is, to bring in a dirty pair of <em>jack-boots</em> belonging to the Butler; and, upon the circumstance of finding these boots in the
                  dressing-room of <em>Lady Languid</em>, does malevolence ground its attempts to destroy her reputation.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The first Act of this Piece was very favourably received; but an Air, by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span>, somewhat too long, being <em>encored</em>, the Audience were thrown into ill-humour, and the performers disconcerted. The piece
                  then met with some opposition, but however was heard amidst applause and murmurs to
                  the end, when it was announced for Monday evening, without any decisive objection
                  or concurrence.</p>
               <p class="noCount">If the Performers have spirits enough to do justice to their characters on the repetition,
                  we have no doubt of seeing the Piece received as a lively and whimsical sketch of
                  passing manners.</p>
               <p class="noCount">This Piece is attributed to Mrs. <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, to whom the literary world is indebted for so many beautiful effusions of poetry.
                  The Prologue and Epilogue, which seemed to be spirited compositions, were both written
                  by the fair Author; but the agitated state of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span>, on account of the opposition, obliged her, as we understand, to omit many lines.
                  It is even said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jordan</span> was apprized of the intended presence of a party to damn the Piece, early on Saturday
                  morning, and the apprehension of such an event was a constant bar to her exertions
                  throughout the representation.</p>

                  the audience still expressed so much dissatisfaction as to induce the author to withdraw

               <p class="noCount"><em>Drury-Lane</em>.</p>
               <p class="noCount">The Farce of <em>Nobody</em> was performed for the third time on Saturday evening. Some alterations had taken
                  place:—a new character is introduced, a Captain in the Navy, whose sword being left
                  upon Lady <em>Languid</em>’s Sofa, gives ground for scandal against her in place of <em>the Boots</em>, and she marries the Officer, instead of <em>Rightly</em>, the Moralist.</p>
               <p class="noCount">Considerable disapprobation was expressed through the whole of the last act; and towards
                  the conclusion, a disposition to riot began to manifest itself. That there were persons
                  in the House who came predetermined to condemn, was very obvious; and a Gentleman
                  in the upper Boxes, pointing to one of these Ruffians in the front of the Gallery,
                  he, actuated doubtless by that spirit of <em>Equality</em> which certain persons do sedulously inculcate, leapt from the Gallery into the Boxes,
                  whither he was followed by several more. As it is the system of some Magistrates that
                  the Mob shall be uncontrouled—in deference, we presume, to that comfortable system,
                  not a Peace-officer was to be found; and had not a body of Gentlemen taken these Rioters
                  into custody, very serious consequences might have ensued.</p>
               <p class="noCount">If such proceedings are to be tolerated, we must not be surprised that not only fashion
                  but even decency should be banished from our Theatres; for who will go thither to
                  be liable to insult and outrage of the grossest kind? A few such nights as Saturday
                  would, we presume, render this a <em>National Theatre</em> upon the true French principles of <em>Equality</em>; for we should see but one kind of Spectators in every part of the House.</p>
