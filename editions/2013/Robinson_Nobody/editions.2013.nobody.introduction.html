                              born in 1757, based on the fact that Robinson’s own, pre-edited memoirs state that
                              she was fifteen when she married Thomas Robinson and that a Morning Herald newspaper

                     who have become fascinated, as her contemporaries once were, with her dazzling personality,
                     social prowess, thespian skill, and literary artistry.

                              of the play’s songs appeared in the bookshops; see Robinson, Songs, Chorusses. The

                              Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, California. The Sicilian Lover, while completed
                              in the autumn of 1795 and intended for stage representation, was never performed.
                              According to Robinson’s daughter, Maria Elizabeth, its presentation at Drury Lane

                     legacy, they have received less critical attention than her poems, essays, and novels,
                     due in part to academic prejudices and to access issues: Romantic-period plays have
                     traditionally received the short end of the canonical stick, so to speak, and, as
                     a result, Robinson’s contributions to the genre have only ever existed, until just
                     recently, in manuscript or rare book form.

                     </div> Even in the face of these setbacks, Robinson’s dramas are worth investigating because
                     they provide a key to understanding Romantic-period society, the late eighteenth-century
                     stage, contemporary satire, the birth of celebrity culture, and Robinson’s engagement
                     with the theater during and after her acting career, when she took on her new role
                     as a woman of letters.

                     </div> Mary initially enjoyed a comfortable childhood as the daughter of Hester and Nicholas
                     Darby, a well-to-do American-born merchant. Her early life began to be clouded with
                     difficulties when her father abandoned his wife and their children after his plan
                     to establish a fishery on the coast of Labrador failed. Fortunately, Mary had already
                     gained an early education at a Bristol school run, in part, by the social reformer
                     and author Hannah More, and despite her father’s subsequent desertion, the loss of
                     their family home, and the auctioning off of the family’s more valuable possessions,
                     she was able to continue her education at London schools in Chelsea and Battersea
                     and to complete her studies at Oxford House, Marylebone. While attending the latter
                     institution, her future fate began to crystallize when her dancing master introduced
                     her to the Covent Garden Theatre actor Thomas Hull. Not long afterwards, she was called
                     upon to meet the manager of London’s Drury Lane Theatre, David Garrick.</p>

                     Garrick immediately adopted her as his protégée, instructing her in acting and dancing
                     and tutoring her in the part of Cordelia opposite his Lear. Her 1773 stage debut in
                     that role was cancelled, however, due to her marriage in April 1773 to Thomas Robinson,
                     a man who proved feckless and unfaithful. She serendipitously gained another chance
                     to ascend the stage when the actor William Brereton introduced her to Richard Brinsley
                     Sheridan, the new part-owner and manager of the Drury Lane Theatre. Sheridan was impressed
                     with Robinson’s budding talent and called Garrick out of retirement to tutor her.
                     The old Roscius worked tirelessly with his former pupil, preparing her for her debut
                     as Juliet in his own reworking of Shakespeare’s <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, and, as a result, the production, which opened on 10 December 1776, was an instant
                     hit. Robinson “was received with uncommon and universal applause” from the beginning

                  <p>Robinson’s most prominent role during her stage career was as Perdita in <em>Florizel and Perdita</em>, Garrick’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s <em>The Winter’s Tale</em>. On 3 December 1779, during a royal command performance of the play, her charming
                     stage persona captivated the seventeen-year-old Prince of Wales (the future King George
                     IV), and a scandalous romance between the newly styled “Florizel” and “Perdita” began
                     shortly thereafter. Their affaire de coeur—a crossed-class liaison between the heir
                     apparent and a merchant’s daughter-cum-actress—became the subject of heated gossip
                     and formally launched Robinson’s career as a courtesan, fashionable trendsetter, and
                     high-society sybarite. After her relationship with the Prince ended and she retired

                  <p>In the summer of 1783, Robinson’s center-stage lifestyle took a sharp turn when, while
                     traveling to Dover to meet Tarleton, she contracted acute rheumatic fever, possibly
                     from a badly handled miscarriage. She never fully recovered, suffering from severe
                     arthritis throughout the rest of her life, a condition that eventually resulted in
                     her inability to walk. Because her rheumatism prevented her from conducting her life
                     as she previously did, she became ever more devoted to one of her true loves—writing.
                     Robinson had already published two volumes of poetry in 1775 and 1777, the latter
                     under the patronage of the Duchess of Devonshire, and had seen her comic opera, <em>The Lucky Escape</em>, produced on the Drury Lane stage in 1778. Now, during her illness, she embarked
                     on a literary career with renewed determination. In 1788, she commenced a “poetical

In 1791, the first volume of her newest verse collection, <em>Poems</em>, was published (the second volume would be released in 1793), and the following year
                     saw the release of her first novel, <em>Vancenza, or, The Dangers of Credulity</em>. During her life, she published many additional volumes of poetry, including her
                     important <em>Sappho and Phaon</em> (1796) and <em>Lyrical Tales</em> (1800), a stylistic homage to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s and William Wordsworth’s <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798); social-political critiques, including <em>Impartial Reflections of the Present Situation of the Queen of France</em> (1791) and <em>A Letter to the Women of England, on the Injustice of Mental Subordination</em> (1799); along with a number of novels, including <em>The Widow, or a Picture of Modern Times</em> (1794), <em>Angelina; A Novel</em> (1796), <em>Hubert de Sevrac, A Romance, of the Eighteenth Century</em> (1796), <em>Walsingham; or, The Pupil of Nature: A Domestic Story</em> (1797), <em>The False Friend: A Domestic Story</em> (1799), and <em>The Natural Daughter.

                  <p>One of Robinson’s most remarkable productions was her two-act farce <em>Nobody</em> (Drury Lane, 1794), though now, even among scholars of the Romantic period, it is
                     a play almost completely unknown. A biting satire on female gamblers, <em>Nobody</em> documents the financial ruin and rescue of the recently widowed aristocrat, Lady Languid,
                     who, having become caught up in a world of fashionable dissipation, squanders her
                     fortune while playing faro, vingt-et-un, and rouge et noir, among other high-stakes
                     games. At the outset of the comedy, Lady Languid laments her newfound addiction, crying
                     “Play, destructive Play! Perpetual Losses, &amp; no rest have destroy’d me!”

                     name of pleasure and “taste,” proclaiming the virtues of her aristocratic associates:
                     “they are so pleasant! They know so well how to live! . . . to see the fritting, frowning
                     beauteous Circle! – bending over pyramids of Rouleaus [rolls of coins] – To behold

                     than important somebodies, unfeeling fools and social <em>nobodies</em>, who will claim an affiliation with Lady Languid just so long as she has money to
                     spend. Lady Languid soon arrives only to be met with a barrage of accusations about
                     her sexual conduct, to lose her entire fortune at a game of Faro, and to be deserted
                     by all of her associates except for Sir Henry Rightly who, having been a winner in
                     the game, returns all of her money to her, but not without enjoining her to keep her
                     promise to help the unfortunate. In this case, the hapless being turns out to be himself:
                     while she is overwhelmed with his generosity, he declares his love for her, saying
                     “believe me Lady Languid, ’till you are mine, no Man exists more wretched than myself!”

                     one paper expressing near regret for noting the comedy’s flaws and stating, “we cannot
                     flatter Mrs. ROBINSON with saying that her muse is likely, in this instance, to shine

                     and that at its conclusion, Jordan had become so “agitated” by the mixed and often
                     hostile reaction of the crowd that she was unable to speak the Epilogue clearly, omitting
                     lines and, according to <em>The Times</em>, botching it altogether: “Mrs. JORDAN proved much at fault; . . . the little effect

                  <p>By 1794, gambling had become a veritable institution in aristocratic society, but
                     as early as 1783, <em>The Morning Herald</em> observed that “The influence of gaming is so prevalent in polite circles, that in
                     the house of a lady of the first quality, after the money is gone, they actually play
                     for articles of dress, diamond pins, aigrettes, &amp;c. &amp;c. Their husbands may justly
                     fear, lest their <em>honor</em> go with the <em>odd trick!</em>”.

                     yet their activities were considered threatening to themselves and to those connected
                     with them. In the creation of her play, Robinson exploited this perspective while,
                     perhaps, underestimating the power of the nobility. By attacking one of their favorite
                     pastimes, she was, in essence, attacking the patrician way of life. Robinson was certainly
                     aware of this, and, indeed, <em>Nobody</em> can be read as an indictment of aristocratic extravagance and “double-dealing” in
                     general,

                              over the high “cost” of her relationship with the Prince. In a letter composed the
                              month prior to the debut of Nobody, she writes that while she had “sacrificed reputation
                              . . . and the conscious delight of correct conduct,” the Prince was obliged only to
                              pay her an annuity of £500, a meager amount, Robinson complained, in comparison with
                              his other lavish expenditures. See Mary Robinson to John Taylor, 5 October 1794. Rpt.

                     to overrule her play seems to have surprised her. In short, if one can rely upon contemporary
                     reports, <em>Nobody</em> was doomed to failure from the beginning, for the people Robinson needed to please
                     in order to ensure the play’s success—the modish elite—were the very ones whom she
                     offended. Some of the day’s most notorious gamesters were, in fact, her own patrons
                     and associates: Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, who in the early 1790s owed
                     at least “£61,917 . . . Roughly £3,720,000 today, or $6 million” in gambling debts

                     in <em>The Morning Post</em>. Indeed, it might be said that the newspaper engendered the nettled reaction to Robinson’s
                     play well before its debut. In the weeks prior to the first staging of <em>Nobody</em>, 
                     “The Fashionable World”
                      section of <em>The Morning Post</em>—in addition to puffing Mary Robinson and Dorothy Jordan—reported repeatedly on the
                     sartorial follies and monetary fecklessness of the elite classes. It contains, for
                     instance, colorful quips reprimanding fashionable interests: “Certain titled Ladies
                     say, that the short waist, and flowing drapery is Grecian: we wish they had a taste
                     for elegant literature, for which the <em>Grecian</em> women were also celebrated.”

                  <p>That <em>Morning Post</em> commentaries such as these were meant to set the stage for the debut of <em>Nobody</em>, there can be no doubt. First, the popular London daily was known for its clever

                     </div> and, second, not only do the commentaries' subject matter echo that of Robinson’s
                     play, but a few of them also refer directly to it. On <a class="link_ref" href="./context_newspaper.html#Oct6">6 October 1794</a>, for example, <em>The Morning Post</em> features the following account: “A Turban, and single White Feather, is the simple
                     head dress worn by our <span class="foreign">Belles</span>. Equality seems the motto of the most dashing Fair, as they still appear as <em>Nobody</em>.” In addition to making a suggestion about the insubstantiality of high-end fashion
                     and of those who indulge in it, the report contains the title of the play and discusses
                     the very hat that Lady Languid wears in the second act. It is possible, given these
                     connections, that Robinson herself had a hand in peppering <em>The Morning Post</em> with these entries, if not the reviews of the performances themselves. This possibility
                     increases when we consider the fact that their appearance in October-December of 1794
                     was accompanied by two poems composed by “Bridget,” one of Robinson’s pseudonyms,
                     and addressed “Primrose-hill”—Primrose being the name of Lady Languid’s waiting maid

                     nobility. This incident serves as a springboard for the rest of the poem, which spotlights

                     of <em>Nobody</em>. While the modish set in the comedy refuse to “sink into the Apathy of Sentiment”
                     (2.2), Sir Henry Rightly does, and he is ridiculed for it by a character who disdainfully
                     tells him, “You’re . . . All Sentiment and feeling” (2.3). The poem, then, foreshadows <em>Nobody</em>, for just as the titled women who voice their disapproval of Wallis become the object
                     of ridicule, so, too, do the aristocrats in the play—who object to Rightly—become

               <p> In <em>Nobody</em>, Lady Languid similarly points out this particular social and intellectual divide
                  between herself and Sir Henry Rightly. Just as Lady Tippy tells of a plebian with
                  “Gothic maxims,” so Lady Languid speaks of how Rightly was “Educated in Gothic Simplicity”
                  (2.2) and because of this, objects to her shaking a “Dice:Box.” Taken as a whole,
                  these two <em>Morning Post</em> poems showcase the discourse of indulgent and self-centered female aristocrats. The
                  final verdict is clear: according to the poem of 18 October, “Fashion is a jade capricious,
                  / Her vot’ries giddy, vain, and vicious.” Here, in the second poem, the women’s class-based
                  concerns are ultimately written written off as “noisy.”</p>
               <div class="wrapper">
                  <p><em>The Morning Post</em> commentaries and the late 1794 “Bridget” poems shed light on the dynamic and interconnected
                     nature of theatrical, socio-political, and economic concerns in the Romantic period.
                     They also suggest the possibility that Robinson wrote for <em>The Morning Post</em> prior to 1795 as a means to advertise, set the tone for, and defend her drama.

                              to defend Nobody after its poor reception: "Mrs. Robinson was a good deal connected
                              with newspapers; and as her lameness confined her to the chair when at home, she was
                              constantly writing, and tolerably free in her remarks. This always operates mischievously
                              upon the mind of an actor, who is quite sure that the writer turned dramatist will
                              visit failure upon any thing rather than his piece" (272).</span></div>
                     </div> Further, they provide a clue as to why the “Lady Gamblers” may have felt compelled
                     to sabotage <em>Nobody</em> both during and <em>before</em> its debut. Robinson’s comedy, we find, was not meant simply to generate laughs but
                     to transform public opinion.</p>

                  <p>Two weeks before the curtain rose on <em>Nobody</em>, <em>The Morning Post</em> optimistically proposed that dramatic comedy could prove “beneficial to Society” when
                     “the preposterous manners of <em>high life</em>”<em>and </em>“<em>Fashionable Folly</em>” are “checked by the pen of fair and unoffending satire.”

                     to achieve. In the weeks following its condemnation, <em>The Morning Post</em> contained the following entry: “If certain persons, in <em>high life</em>, are allowed to <span class="smcap">damn</span> every piece that aims to correct their follies, the Stage will cease to be the mirror

                     a change in social behavior, perhaps graphic artistry can: “Why don’t the Caricaturists
                     make a subject from a <em>Faro</em> Table, where an assemblage of <em>Furies</em> nightly afford ample scope for the pencil? Such an instance of just ridicule would

                     Robinson’s play serves as a marker of the age’s shifting moral compass and a harbinger
                     of the increasing anti-gaming sentiment to come. In May 1796, for instance, less than
                     two years following the production of Robinson’s play, the Chief Justice, Lord Kenyon,
                     indignantly proclaimed from the King’s Bench, <span class="quote">‘it is extremely to be lamented, that this vice [gambling] has descended to the very

                     footmen divulged her illegal gambling activities, the authorities intervened, and
                     Lady Buckinghamshire and her fellow players were fined. Though Kenyon did not preside
                     over the Buckinghamshire prosecution, the incident prompted a barrage of visual satire,
                     which included images by James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank. In May 1796, for instance,
                     H. Humphrey published Gillray’s <em><a class="link_ref" href="./images.html#exaltation">Exaltation of Faro’s Daughters</a></em>, which features the pilloried Lady Buckinghamshire and Lady Archer exhibiting bemused
                     resignation as the public throws mud and refuse at them. The same month also saw Cruikshank’s <em><a class="link_ref" href="./images.html#daughters">Faro’s Daughters, or the Kenyonian blowup to Gamblers</a></em>, which depicts Charles James Fox in the stocks, supporting on his shoulders one of
                     four female gamblers in the pillories, and Lord Kenyon fanning the flames of a fire
                     that burns dice, cards, and a Faro table. In February 1797, Gillray produced <em><a class="link_ref" href="./images.html#loss">Loss of the Faro Bank; or, the Rook’s Pigeon’d</a></em>, showing Lord Buckinghamshire, Lady Buckinghamshire, Mrs. Concannon, Charles James
                     Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Colonel Hanger, and Lady Archer interrupted at Faro
                     by the disconcerting news that the Faro bank has been robbed. The month following,
                     he released <em><a class="link_ref" href="./images.html#discipline">Discipline à la Kenyon</a></em>, depicting Lord Kenyon whipping the bare back of Lady Buckinghamshire who is tied
                     to a cart, while two of her fellow female gamesters observe the action from the pillory.
                     Gillian Russell saliently observes that in such images “the female aristocrat . .
                     . [is] reduced to the social level of a common whore” and that in the 1790s, in general,
                     gambling amongst the “men and women of the Whig elite” was increasingly “condemned
                     as a sign of the moral degeneracy and irresponsibility of the fashionable classes.”

                     of the drama, breaks away from the pack and takes her own chances. By acting out a
                     new role through the procurement of a respectable husband and the sentimental exhibition
                     (some might say guise) of charity, she adapts to the changing times by performing
                     a new version of female power and privilege. True to form, the ever-fashionable Robinson
                     had predicted, in the decline of gambling, the emergence of the next cutting-edge
                     trend for high-class British women: domestic virtue.</p>
