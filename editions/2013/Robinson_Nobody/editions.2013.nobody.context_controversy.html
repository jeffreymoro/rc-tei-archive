            <p class="noCount"><em>from</em> <br/> Robinson, Mary, [and Maria Elizabeth Robinson]. <em>Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, Written by Herself with Some Posthumous Pieces</em>. Vol. 2. London: Wilks and Taylor, 1801. 140-42.</p>
            <p class="noCount">p. 140: In the year 1793, a little farce, entitled <em>Nobody</em>, was written by Mrs. Robinson. This piece, designed as a satire on <em>female gamesters</em>, was received at the theatre, the characters distributed, and preparations made for
               its exhibition. At this period one of the principal performers gave up her part, alleging
               that the piece was intended as a ridicule on her particular friend. Another actress
               also, though in “herself an host,” was intimidated by a letter, informing her that
               “Nobody should be damned!” The author received likewise, on the same day, a scurrilous,
               indecent, and <em>ill-disguised</em> scrawl, signifying to her that the farce [to p. 141] was already condemned. On the
               drawing up of the curtain, several persons in the galleries, whose <em>liveries</em> betrayed their <em>employers</em>, were sent to <em>do up</em> Nobody. Even women of distinguished rank hissed through their fans. Notwithstanding
               these manœuvres and exertions, the more rational part of the audience seemed inclined
               to hear before they passed judgment, and, with a firmness that never fails to awe,
               demanded that the piece should proceed. The first act was accordingly suffered without
               interruption: a song in the second being unfortunately encored, the malcontents once
               more ventured to raise their voices, and the malignity that had been forcibly suppressed
               burst forth with redoubled violence. For three nights, the theatre presented a scene
               of confusion, when the [to p. 142] authoress, after experiencing the gratification
               of a zealous and sturdy defence, thought proper wholly to withdraw the cause of contention.</p>
