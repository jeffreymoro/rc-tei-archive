         <p>O, <emph>Fashion!</emph> delegate of taste and wit,		</p>
         <p>Oft do I see thee triumph in the pit;</p>
         <p>When Hobart’s critic fan attention draws,</p>
         <p>The airy signal of ill-judged applause!			280</p>
         <p>When pale-faced misses sigh from side-box rows,</p>
         <p>And <emph>painted</emph> matrons nod to <emph>painted</emph> beaux:</p>
         <p>Where the lank lord, incircled in the throng,</p>
         <p>Shews his white teeth, and hums a fav’rite song;</p>
         <p>Who, spite of season, crowds it to the play,			285</p>
         <p>Wrapp’d in six waistcoats—<emph>in the month of May</emph>;</p>
         <p>Who, just at noon, has strength to rise from bed,</p>
         <p>With empty pocket—and <emph>more empty head</emph>;</p>
         <p>Who, scarce recover’d from the courtly dance,</p>
         <p>Sees with disgust the vulgar day advance:			290</p>
         <p>Anticipates the wax-illumin’d night,</p>
         <p>Cassino’s charms, and Faro’s proud delight!</p>
         <p>Who hates the broad intolerable sun,</p>
         <p>That points his door to every gaping <emph>dun</emph>;</p>
         <p>Who saunters all the morn, and reads the news,		295</p>
         <p>’Midst clouds of odours and <emph>Olympian dews</emph>;</p>
         <p>Till three o’clock proclaims the time to meet</p>
         <p>On the throng’d pavement of St. James’s street;</p>
         <p>Where various shops on various follies thrive,</p>
         <p>‘Beaux, banish beaux—and coaches, coaches drive:’	300</p>
         <p>While to Hyde Park this titled tribe are flocking,</p>
         <p>To <emph>walk </emph>in boots—or <emph>ride</emph> in silken stocking.</p>
         <p>. . .</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Robinson, Mary. “The Gamester.” </hi>

            <hi>[Page #s?]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>AH! <emph>what is </emph>he, whose haggard eye</p>
         <p>Scarce dares to meet the morning ray?</p>
         <p>Who, trembling, would, but cannot fly</p>
         <p>From Man, and from the busy day.</p>
         <p>Mark how his lip is fever’d o’er,			5</p>
         <p>Behold his cheek, how deathly it appears!</p>
         <p>See! how his blood-shot eye-balls pour</p>
         <p>A burning torrent of unpitied tears!</p>
         <p>Now watch the varying gesture, wild,</p>
         <p>See how his tortur’d bosom heaves!		10</p>
         <p>Behold, Misfortune’s wayward child,</p>
         <p>For whom no kindred Nature grieves!</p>
         <p>Despis’d, suspected, ruin’d, lost!</p>
         <p>His fortune, health, and reputation flown;</p>
         <p>On mis’ry’s stormy ocean tost,			15	</p>
         <p>Condemn’d to curse his fate, and curse <emph>alone</emph>!</p>
         <p>Once, were his prospects bright and gay,</p>
         <p>And Independence blest his hours:</p>
         <p>
            <emph>His</emph> was the smooth and sunny way,</p>
         <p>Where tip-toe Pleasure scatter’d flow’rs.		20</p>
         <p>Love bound his brow with thornless sweets,</p>
         <p>And smiling Friendship fill’d his cup of joy;</p>
         <p>
            <emph>Now</emph>, not a Friend the victim meets,</p>
         <p>For, like a Wolf, he wanders to destroy.</p>
         <p>All day, upon a couch of thorn,			25</p>
         <p>His weary, fev’rish limbs recline;</p>
         <p>All night, distracted and forlorn,</p>
         <p>He hovers round the fateful shrine!</p>
         <p>Eager to seize, with grasping hands,</p>
         <p>The slender pittance of the easy Fool;		30</p>
         <p>He links himself with caitiff bands,</p>
         <p>And learns the lesson of the Gamester’s school!</p>
         <p>One-hour, elate with ill-got gold,</p>
         <p>And dazzled by the shining ore,			</p>
         <p>In plenitude of joys, behold				35</p>
         <p>The Prodigal display his store!</p>
         <p>The next, in poverty and fear,</p>
         <p>He hides him, trembling at approaching fate,</p>
         <p>While greedy Creditors appear,</p>
         <p>And with remorseless rage lurk round his gate.	40</p>
         <p>Then comes the horror-breeding hour!</p>
         <p>While recreant Suicide attends;</p>
         <p>Or Madness, with impetuous pow’r,</p>
         <p>The scene of desolation ends!</p>
         <p>Upon his grave no parent mourns,			45</p>
         <p>No widow’d Love laments with graceful woe;</p>
         <p>No dawn of joy for <emph>him</emph> returns—</p>
         <p>For Heav’n denies that peace, his frenzy lost below!</p>
