               <p rend="noCount">A New Farce, entitled, <hi rendition="#smcap">Nobody</hi>, written by Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, was performed at this Theatre on Saturday night. The scene is taken from high life, and is intended as a laudable exposure of those dames of Fashion, who in departing from the delicacy of their sex, commence Gamesters, involving by such conduct, not only their own characters in ruin, but that of others in this Vortex of fashionable depravity. The story of the piece is simple. Lady <hi rendition="#smcap">Languid</hi>, the heroine of the scene, is beset by a croud of flutterers, but her admirers diminish in proportion to her ill success at Play. Sir <hi rendition="#smcap">Harry Rightly</hi>, a respectable citizen, is rewarded by her hand, in consequence of his generosity and constancy: a reformation takes place in the lady, and the parties are happily united.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">With such slender Materials, it cannot be expected that this Farce abounds in Incident or Interest. <hi rendition="#smcap">Bannister</hi> represents one of those nauseous and senseless Fops, that infest every place of public resort, and though the character is well conceived, it is not as well drawn as we could have wished.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">There are certain objectionable <emph>things</emph> in the double entendre, that the good sense of the Lady will induce her to expunge, and we “<emph>cry her mercy</emph>,” if we should, in defiance of her superior judgment, disagree with her in observing, that it is possible to have too much of a <emph>good thing</emph>. The House was full of Fashion, and to this we attribute the sentiments of disapprobation manifested at the conclusion, as Gambling is become a vice so general that there were few in the Boxes that were not displeased at the exposure of their dissipation and depravities.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The Prologue was delivered by Mr. Barrymore, and the Epilogue by Mrs. Jordan. They were both well received, and do honour to Mrs. Robinson, from whose pen they come. The Farce was given out for a second representation for this evening.</p>

            <p rend="noCount">A new Afterpiece, whimsically called “<title level="m">Nobody</title>,” was brought out before a numerous assembly on Saturday.—It is the production of Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, whose poetical talents have so justly raised her to literary distinction. The plan of this little Comedy (for its structure is correctly within the rules of regular Drama) is, to exhibit in gay satire the frivolous manners, and degrading dissipation of high life. Though there is no novelty in the idea, there is pleasurable ease in the dialogue, and severe truth in the pictures which she draws. If the characters, though all theatrically familiar to the Audience, had been actively engaged in business, and their conversations had been animated by incident, of which the subject was fruitful, it would have been a most agreeable Afterpiece; but unfortunately they have so little to do, that the heart is fatigued with scenes which lead to no purpose, and which do not connect and carry on an interest. A pair of jack-boots, left by an arch simpleton in the dressing-room of <emph>Lady Languid</emph> is neatly and dramatically improved into a tale of scandal by her friends; and the wisdom of such friendships is still further exemplified by their refusing to lend her a rouleau, when pigeoned at the Faro-table. If something more of this kind of incident had been sprinkled over the light surface of the fable, it would have been a favourite performance. The writing is easy, and in parts epigrammatic; but we cannot flatter Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi> with saying that her muse is likely, in this instance, to shine with the graceful eclat that u[s]ed to accompany her personal appearance on the Boards.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi> performed the part of the arch simpleton, which she did with that force and energy which characterise her humour.—She sang a little Scots madrigal with the most touching melody, and in which she was rapturously encored. Miss <hi rendition="#smcap">Pope</hi>, who never appears without giving pleasure to every heart, had, in her first scene, a good female caricature of masculine manners to exhibit, which she did with true comedy.—She had afterwards to undergo the trouble of dressing for nothing. Mr. <hi rendition="#smcap">Bannister</hi> had literally nothing to do worthy of himself. The wit of the part was exhausted in the dress. Mr. <hi rendition="#smcap">Barrymore</hi> wore, what no gentleman ever appears in, black silk breeches with a frock coat.—We mention it only because we see the gallants at this Theatre too often drest in this shabby style.</p>

            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent"><hi rendition="#smcap">    MR. EDITOR</hi>,</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">I was one of the many at Drury-lane House, on Saturday evening, to attend the performance of the new Comedy, entitled, <title level="m">Nobody</title>, and saw the first act with pleasure, although mixt with expectation and hopes of something better. The second act unfortunately fell off, rather than rose, in degree of attraction, point, and merit, and ultimately provoked the displeasure of that important <emph>Somebody</emph>, the Audience, the generality of whom seemed disgusted with the manners, and disappointed by the use and disposal of the characters and their escape of justice. I have often witnessed a more unwarrantable sentence of judgment passed in the Theatre, from caprice, accidental ill-temper, or want of due attention to the grounds and aim of the satire exhibited. In <title level="m">Nobody</title>’s case nobody was to blame; and I may be bold to say this, because the author of the <emph>petite Comedie</emph> of Saturday has taught me, that, as <emph>nobody </emph>was meant to be personified, <title level="m">Nobody</title> can claim a right to complain: but, all play upon words apart, I should forget what is due to Mrs. Robinson’s merit as a poet and general writer, if, as one of her literary admirers, I did not step forward, and admit that her object was a fair one, her way of treating it entitled to credit, her colouring correct, and her picture strikingly just; but unfortunately her subject was ill-chosen, her characters were too faint for general intelligibility and relish, and her <emph>tout ensemble</emph> wanted interest, and consequently was deficient in impression and effect. The truth is, the topics have already been touched on by Mrs. Inchbald, in her Comedy of <emph>Next-door Neighbours</emph>, and the satire brought to a point by the author of a short piece, called, <emph>A Quarter of an Hour before Dinner</emph>, frequently performed at Mr. Colman’s Theatre. The dissipation of high life is itself a mere matter of censurable affectation; for I defy a human being possessed of a tolerable understanding, to say conscientiously, that he or she derives any rational gratification from it: hence it is too unsubstantial for satire, and too feeble for ridicule. It will not bear the light, but, upon exposure, appears to be a system of folly so flimsy, so false, and so unnatural, that <title level="m">Nobody</title> will believe any such system every had existence, or that two individuals possessed of a grain of sense could possibly agree to persist in so absurd a system of life.</p>
            <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">In the Comedy called <title level="m">Nobody</title>, all the characters promise much in the first act, but, excepting <emph>Nelly Primrose</emph>, like true West-end-of-the-town folks, they promise much and perform nothing. <emph>Sharpley</emph> is the dullest nobody that ever belied his name with utterance.<emph> Lady Rouleau</emph> also comes on with a bustle, and ends with shewing that her dress, forward manners, and forward tongue only serve to prove that she is <emph>nobody</emph>. In short, the manners of the dissipated Great may be chosen for a <emph>tableau</emph> by the artist who lives on their favours, but they will never furnish a good subject for a <emph>tableau parlant</emph>: like the visionary presentment of future Kings to Macbeth, they may be said to “come like shadows, so depart.” 		<hi rendition="#right">W.</hi></p></div>

               <p rend="noCount">Report ascribes this production to Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, and indeed the second act bears evidence of its truth, in the delicacy and neatness of the sentiments from the character of a philanthropist.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent"><hi rendition="#smcap">Nobody</hi>, we conceive to be so named, inasmuch as the Author wishes to exhibit fashion without individuality. Whether any <emph>faux pas</emph> has arisen from the aukward introduction of <emph>jackboots</emph>, instead of those belonging to any of our female equestrians, we neither know, nor is it material to enquire. Such an incident constitutes the <emph>embarras </emph>of the present trifle.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi> has always lived in fashionable life; and <title level="m">Nobody</title> need take the trouble to tell her how evanescent are the essences of which it is composed.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">This being premised, we must acknowledge that the copies are correctly drawn. The slandering coxcomb, at once a fool and a fortune-hunter, is every day to be seen sauntering up St. James’s-street. You cannot turn the corner of the promenade without receiving a whiff of his unintelligible jargon, addressed to a creature, who associates without hearing, and who is welcomed in his turn with the same polished inattention.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The Faro party might have more to say, and <emph>Lady Languid </emph>would be the better for some act of virtue, which might make her merit her good fortune.

It is to be hoped, therefore, that the interval between Saturday and Monday has been employed in a judicious compressment by the Manager. Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Goodall</hi> should be instructed not to call for her carriage so often, and it would be as well not to let the Lady’s Maid so grossly disturb the propriety and etiquette of a drawing room, as to break in abruptly, in order to tell the company she was quitting her place because the Butler had called her an ORIGINAL.</p>

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The object of this piece was to place in proper ridicule the follies and vices of fashionable life; and the piece, though evidently intended as a mere dramatic sketch, was really a pleasant portrait of the manners of the higher ranks. There was also another purpose in this drama, of more value in point of morals: for it was also intended to show how easily a reputation may be lost by the use to which mere <emph>appearances</emph> may be converted by the aid of <emph>malice</emph>.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The story is simply as follows:—<emph>Lady Languid</emph>, a widow with a considerable fortune, is seduced into the gay world, and precipitated into most of its follies, and particularly into the vice of gaming, by which she is nearly ruined.

For this laudable purpose he accompanies her to a fashionable rout, and at length succeeds in reclaiming her, after she has proved the insincerity of all her gay connexions.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">There is much pleasantry arising from the awkward mistakes of a <emph>Somersetshire wench</emph>, who attends <emph>Lady Languid</emph> in her dressing-room, and who commits numerous blunders in attempting to obey the orders of her mistress.

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The first Act of this Piece was very favourably received; but an Air, by Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi>, somewhat too long, being <emph>encored</emph>, the Audience were thrown into ill-humour, and the performers disconcerted.

               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">If the Performers have spirits enough to do justice to their characters on the repetition, we have no doubt of seeing the Piece received as a lively and whimsical sketch of passing manners.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">This Piece is attributed to Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, to whom the literary world is indebted for so many beautiful effusions of poetry. The Prologue and Epilogue, which seemed to be spirited compositions, were both written by the fair Author; but the agitated state of Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi>, on account of the opposition, obliged her, as we understand, to omit many lines. It is even said Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi> was apprized of the intended presence of a party to damn the Piece, early on Saturday morning, and the apprehension of such an event was a constant bar to her exertions throughout the representation.</p>

As it is the system of some Magistrates that the Mob shall be uncontrouled—in deference, we presume, to that comfortable system, not a Peace-officer was to be found; and had not a body of Gentlemen taken these Rioters into custody, very serious consequences might have ensued.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">If such proceedings are to be tolerated, we must not be surprised that not only fashion but even decency should be banished from our Theatres; for who will go thither to be liable to insult and outrage of the grossest kind?
