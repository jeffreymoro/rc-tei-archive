                                    conduct book that contains the following precept: “<emph>Every
                                        Woman that would preserve her Honour, ought to refrain from
                                        Gaming as a terrible thing; for Play is very bewitching, and
                                        often drives a Woman to venture all she has</emph>” (75).
                                    Brewer suggests, alternatively, that “budding beauties” alludes
                                    to Simon Berington’s fictional travel narrative <title level="m"

                                        Lucca</title> (London: T. Cooper, 1737), which contains an
                                    account of Gaudentio’s love for a young African girl: “My choice
                                    was soon determin’d: the first Time I saw the incomparable
                                        <emph>Isiphena</emph>, the Regent’s Daughter, tho’ she was

                                    in her”; see Brewer (8: 276n). In both instances, the men speak
                                    of young women—an eighteen-year-old (Molière) and a ten-year-old
                                    (Berington); clearly, as Brewer points out, the widow Lady
                                    Languid’s beauty is not in a similarly “budding” state.</note>

                                    Hemisphere, and, in the Catholic religion, the nativity of St.

                                    Maidens, in particular, often engaged in superstitious practices

                                    interprets the pronoun “a” as “it,” which comically attributes

                                    <emph>Seven Senses</emph>: The Apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus
                                    identifies seven senses: “The Lord created man; and they
                                    received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the
                                    sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh
                                    speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof” (King James
                                    Version 17:5). Brewer cites the following explanation:
                                    “According to ancient teaching, the soul of man or his ‘inward
                                    holy body’ was compounded of the seven properties which were
                                    under the influence of seven planets. Fire, animated; earth gave
                                    the sense of feeling; water, speech; air, taste; mist gave
                                    sight; flowers, hearing; and the south wind, smelling. Hence the
                                    seven senses were—animation, feeling, speech, taste, sight,
                                    hearing, smelling” (W. Chambers and R. Chambers, <title

                                    <emph>amusements in Camp</emph>: Military camps during the
                                    eighteenth century were occupied by both men and women. As
                                    Gillian Russell observes, wives accompanied their soldiering
                                    husbands, and women, in general, from daughters to cooks,
                                    nurses, laundresses, seamstresses, and prostitutes, participated
                                    in camp life. Due to the casual intermixture of men and women,
                                    camps became equated with “sexual license. . . . Sex, it seems
                                    was everywhere. ‘Half the girls in the country will get husbands
                                    by Coxheath-camp,’ declared the <title level="j">Morning

                                    Robinson captures the atmosphere of a military camp in what
                                    Daniel Robinson calls a “satirical montage of sights and sounds
                                    of an assembly of soldiers and an attendant entourage where the
                                    fashionable and the military, the opulent and the vulgar, and,
                                    most of all, the sexual . . . become jarringly confused” (Daniel

                                        <emph>lost his Head</emph>: Hannibal Barca (247-183 BCE), a
                                    renowned Carthaginian military commander who, due to an
                                    infection, lost one of his eyes while crossing the Apennine
                                    Mountains. When Lady Rouleau says that Lord Rouleau has “lost an
                                    Eye,” she may be suggesting merely that he has lost sight in one
                                    eye (see “lose an eye,” <title level="m">OED</title>). “Lost his
                                    head” denotes beheading and, by association, the guillotine,
                                    which was first used in France on 25 April 1792 and which became
                                    a symbol of the “Reign of Terror” (the period from 1793 to
                                    1794), during which the Revolutionary Tribunal sanctioned
                                    execution on a mass scale. By linking “the pleasure of martial
                                    maneuvres” (see note 84) with the discussion of her husband’s
                                    body, Lady Rouleau also suggests a link between her husband’s

                                    Canto II, line 52 (“<emph>Belinda</emph> smil’d, and all the
                                    world was gay”) of Alexander Pope’s <title level="m">The Rape of
                                        the Lock</title> (1712/1714), a mock-heroic poem about the
                                    high-society heroine, Belinda, who has a lock of her hair
                                    snipped off of her head without her permission. In the poem,
                                    Pope paints a portrait of the glittering world of the
                                    beau-monde, in which social intercourse is dominated by
                                    fashionable appearances. Like Lady Languid who plays the card
                                    game Faro, Belinda plays the card game ombre, a precursor to
                                    whist and bridge.</note>

                                    (c.185-129 BCE), politician and general of the Roman Republic
                                    whose army destroyed Carthage in 146 BCE. He was the grandson
                                    (by adoption) of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and was a
                                    wealthy patron of the arts and sciences, renowned for founding
                                    the Scipionic Circle, a Roman intellectual group, consisting of
                                    philosophers, historians, poets, and other scholars. He is also
                                    remembered as a stern censor, a position he held in 142 BCE,
                                    during which time he served as supervisor of public morality and
                                    attempted to curb dissipation and corruption. He is the
                                    principal speaker in Cicero’s <title level="m">De re
                                        publica</title> (c.54-61 BCE), the sixth book of
                                    which—entitled <title level="m">Somnium Scipionis</title>
                                        (<title level="m">The Dream of Scipio</title>)—depicts him
                                    as a man of intellect and virtue. It is a text that, among other
                                    things, influenced Dante Alighieri’s the <title level="m">Divine
                                        Comedy</title> (1308-1321) and inspired Wolfgang Amadeus
                                    Mozart’s <title level="m">Il sogno di Scipione </title>(K. 126)
                                    (1772). The Tomb of the Scipios in Rome was rediscovered in
                                    1780, and images of the tomb were published in Rome in 1785 by
                                    Francesco Piranesi in <title level="m">Monumenti degli

                                    word “horn.” Horns were attributes of a cuckold, and “Horn:Book”
                                    itself echoes the contemporary term “horn work,” which was slang
                                    for cuckold making; see, for instance Lawrence Sterne, <title
                                        level="m">Life of Tristram Shandy</title> (London: Penguin,
                                    2003), II.xii.98, where Sterne refers to the “horn-works of
                                    cuckoldom.” The word “horn” also connoted the penis as in
                                    “horn-colic,” cant for an erection; see Francis Grose, <title
