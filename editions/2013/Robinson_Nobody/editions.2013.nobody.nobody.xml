As <ref target="./context_newspaper.html#Dec3"><title level="j">The Morning Post</title>’s footnotes</ref> to the Prologue and Epilogue indicate, lines in both of them were omitted on the second night’s representation, the Prologue due to concerns over length and the Epilogue due to Dorothy Jordan’s inability to speak them. The Prologue was also published on 3 December 1794 in <ref target="./context_newspaper.html#Dec3Sun"><title level="j">The Sun</title></ref> and in <title level="j">The True Briton</title>, with additional variations. The Prologue and Epilogue were also published together in the 2 December to 4 December 1794 edition of <title level="j">The Whitehall Evening Post</title>.

In both instances, the men speak of young women—an eighteen-year-old (Molière) and a ten-year-old (Berington); clearly, as Brewer points out, the widow Lady Languid’s beauty is not in a similarly “budding” state.</note> You’ll come to our wedding[.] Mean to have it in Stile – Drolle Business.</p></sp>

                                                    <emph>Midsummer Eve . . . was falsehearted</emph>: Midsummer’s Eve, also known as St. John’s Eve (the evening prior to the Feast of St. John the Baptist), is a holiday honoring the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and, in the Catholic religion, the nativity of St. John. In much of Britain, it was customary to light bonfires and celebrate with drink and food, including sweetmeats and fruit. Maidens, in particular, often engaged in superstitious practices either to gain a glimpse of their future sweetheart or to determine the faithfulness of their current love interest. William Hone in his <title level="m">Every-day Book</title> (1827) for 24 June notes that in “One of the ‘Cheap Repository Tracts,’ entitled, ‘Tawney Rachel, or the Fortune-Teller,’ said to have been written by Miss Hannah More, relates, among other superstitious practices of Sally Evans, that ‘she would never go to bed <emph>on Midsummer eve</emph>, without sticking up in her room the well-known plant called <emph>Midsummer Men</emph>, as the bending of the leaves to the right, or to the left, would never fail to tell her whether her lover was true or false’”; see William Hone, <title level="m">The Every-day Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements</title>, 2 vols. (London: Published for William Hone, 1827), I: 850. Nelly states that she played the jaw harp in a transept or a side chapel of the church in order to make the sexton believe that his deceased sweetheart was haunting him on Midsummer Eve because he had not been true or, in other words, because he had been unfaithful or “falsehearted.” </note>

                                <emph>How cou’d the Porch be falsehearted, Child?</emph>: Here, Lady Languid mistranslates the final phrase of Nelly's last sentence. Rather than interpreting Nelly’s “a” for “he,” she interprets the pronoun “a” as “it,” which comically attributes falseheartedness to the “Porch” rather than to the sexton. </note>

Nelly seems to indicate that if she had not played the joke on the sexton (i.e. made him believe that his deceased sweetheart was haunting him), he would have remained unrepentant, and the devil would have taken the sexton to hell just as he did Faustus.</note> Oh!</p></sp>

                                <emph>Seven Senses</emph>: The Apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus identifies seven senses: “The Lord created man; and they received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof” (King James Version 17:5). Brewer cites the following explanation: “According to ancient teaching, the soul of man or his ‘inward holy body’ was compounded of the seven properties which were under the influence of seven planets. Fire, animated; earth gave the sense of feeling; water, speech; air, taste; mist gave sight; flowers, hearing; and the south wind, smelling. Hence the seven senses were—animation, feeling, speech, taste, sight, hearing, smelling” (W. Chambers and R. Chambers, <title level="a">The Origin of Some Slang Phrases,</title> in <title level="j">Chambers’s Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts</title> [London and Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1878], 87); see Brewer 277n.</note> <stage rend="stageInline">(<hi rendition="#underline">Exit</hi>)</stage></p></sp>

                            <emph>amusements in Camp</emph>: Military camps during the eighteenth century were occupied by both men and women. As Gillian Russell observes, wives accompanied their soldiering husbands, and women, in general, from daughters to cooks, nurses, laundresses, seamstresses, and prostitutes, participated in camp life. Due to the casual intermixture of men and women, camps became equated with “sexual license. . . . Sex, it seems was everywhere. ‘Half the girls in the country will get husbands by Coxheath-camp,’ declared the <title level="j">Morning Chronicle</title>, while . . . prostitutes in general were admitted behind the lines”; see Russell, <title level="m">The Theatres of War: Performance, Politics, and Society, 1793-1815</title> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), 39. In her poem, <title level="a">The Camp</title> (1800), Mary Robinson captures the atmosphere of a military camp in what Daniel Robinson calls a “satirical montage of sights and sounds of an assembly of soldiers and an attendant entourage where the fashionable and the military, the opulent and the vulgar, and, most of all, the sexual . . . become jarringly confused” (Daniel Robinson, <title level="m">The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame</title> [New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011], 30):

                                <emph>Hannibal</emph> . . . <emph>lost an Eye</emph> . . . <emph>lost his Head</emph>: Hannibal Barca (247-183 BCE), a renowned Carthaginian military commander who, due to an infection, lost one of his eyes while crossing the Apennine Mountains. When Lady Rouleau says that Lord Rouleau has “lost an Eye,” she may be suggesting merely that he has lost sight in one eye (see “lose an eye,” <title level="m">OED</title>). “Lost his head” denotes beheading and, by association, the guillotine, which was first used in France on 25 April 1792 and which became a symbol of the “Reign of Terror” (the period from 1793 to 1794), during which the Revolutionary Tribunal sanctioned execution on a mass scale. By linking “the pleasure of martial maneuvres” (see note 84) with the discussion of her husband’s body, Lady Rouleau also suggests a link between her husband’s military vigor and his sexual appeal.</note> – He has lost an Eye, and it wou’d give me great Pleasure if he lost his Head in the Service of his Country!

Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s play, <title level="m">The Glorious First of June</title>, debuted at Drury Lane the following month on 2 July 1794. The “countersign” is a password or watchword given to all soldiers on guard (<title level="m">OED</title>).</note> – Have you heard of the Adventure between Sir Hercules Tactic and Clara Cartouch?

For “quiz,” see note 29. “Scipio” refers to Scipio Aemilianus Africanus (c.185-129 BCE), politician and general of the Roman Republic whose army destroyed Carthage in 146 BCE. He was the grandson (by adoption) of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and was a wealthy patron of the arts and sciences, renowned for founding the Scipionic Circle, a Roman intellectual group, consisting of philosophers, historians, poets, and other scholars. He is also remembered as a stern censor, a position he held in 142 BCE, during which time he served as supervisor of public morality and attempted to curb dissipation and corruption. He is the principal speaker in Cicero’s <title level="m">De re publica</title> (c.54-61 BCE), the sixth book of which—entitled <title level="m">Somnium Scipionis</title> (<title level="m">The Dream of Scipio</title>)—depicts him as a man of intellect and virtue. It is a text that, among other things, influenced Dante Alighieri’s the <title level="m">Divine Comedy</title> (1308-1321) and inspired Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s <title level="m">Il sogno di Scipione </title>(K. 126) (1772). The Tomb of the Scipios in Rome was rediscovered in 1780, and images of the tomb were published in Rome in 1785 by Francesco Piranesi in <title level="m">Monumenti degli Scipioni</title>, a work begun by his father Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Salmagundi, in this context, means “mixture.”</note> – Pray, Sir Henry, tell us <hi rendition="#underline">what</hi> you are?</p></sp>

                            <emph>I love a Book; – the Title I leave to your Lordship</emph>: Sir Henry Rightly draws attention, here, to the word “horn.” Horns were attributes of a cuckold, and “Horn:Book” itself echoes the contemporary term “horn work,” which was slang for cuckold making; see, for instance Lawrence Sterne, <title level="m">Life of Tristram Shandy</title> (London: Penguin, 2003), II.xii.98, where Sterne refers to the “horn-works of cuckoldom.” The word “horn” also connoted the penis as in “horn-colic,” cant for an erection; see Francis Grose, <title level="m">A Dictionary of Buckish Slang, University Wit, and Pickpocket Eloquence</title> (London: Printed for C.
