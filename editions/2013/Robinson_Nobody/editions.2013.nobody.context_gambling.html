            <p class="noCount"><em>from</em><br/> Robinson, Mary. 
               “Present State of the Manners, Society, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the Metropolis of England”
               . <em>Monthly Magazine; or British Register.</em> Vol. 10 (September 1800): 138-140.</p>
            <p class="noCount">p. 140: The vice of <span class="smcap">gaming</span> seems to have reached its climax at the fashionable end of the metropolis: and though
               the magistrates have endeavoured to check its progress among the subordinate ranks
               of society, it is still not only winked at, but tolerated, in the higher circles.
               The petty gambler, who opens his shop of iniquity with the puny traffic of silver,
               is without mercy punished, and held up as an example of depraved manners; while the
               nobles hold their public clubs, gamble for thousands, outface the magistrates, and
               defy the laws, with boldness and impunity! It is at the gaming-tables of the exalted,
               that our legislators, our nobility, our generals, and our country-gentlemen practice
               those very vices which the needy and the private individual is punished for attempting.
               It is at those ennobled midnight scenes of folly and rapacity, that the <span class="smcap">demon of suicide</span> anticipates his triumphs over the weakness, avarice, and false pride of mortals.
               The effects of those scenes have recently presented <span class="smcap">horrors</span> and <span class="smcap">death</span>! yet the magistrates are passive, and the laws tardy in the occupation of administering
               justice; and it is with sorrow that the moralist and the philanthropist have traced
               the progress of this pernicious propensity even to the private assemblies of the most
               elegant <span class="smcap">women</span>; while the ruined husband, and the thoughtless wife, have, by dissipating their children’s
               patrimony, exposed the females to the miseries of seduction, and set an example to
               the males, which has undermined both the wealth and the honour of their family. Indeed
               to this fatal employment may be attributed the many domestic exposures which have
               taken place within the last twenty years. Men now devote their hours to clubs, to
               gaming-tables, to tennis-courts, and to cricket-grounds. Wives are left to roam, or
               permitted to hold their midnight orgies, with the most dissipated of their own as
               well as of the other sex. Play involves them in debts of honour, which the <em>sacrifice of honour</em> too frequently discharges: and, it is an absolute fact, that even the family jewels
               and the family plate have been disposed to supply the <span class="smcap">faro bank</span> of one of those infamous scenes of profligate debasement; while the husband has been
               the passive spectator, and the daughters employed at places of public entertainment,
               as decoys to ensnare the young, the wealthy and the unwary!</p>
