                  <head>About this Edition</head>
                  <p>This electronic edition of Mary Robinson’s <title level="m">Nobody</title> (Drury Lane, 1794) is the first to present a widely available and searchable transcript of the play along with a comprehensive introduction, extensive notes by the editor, and contexts of the drama. The open-access format and the accompanying contextual materials make this edition ideal for teaching and research.</p>
                  <p>Based on the only surviving manuscript of the play (LA 1046) housed in the Larpent collection at the Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, CA, this edition reproduces the clean copy made by the theater and submitted to the Licensor of Plays. It is an edition that presents few difficulties for transcription. I have made only the following minor alterations:
            <quote>
                        <list type="unordered">
                           <item>In the manuscript, the epilogue immediately follows the prologue. I have moved the epilogue to the end of the play in keeping with the order in which it would be performed.</item>
                           <item>I have not reproduced page numbers and have not maintained the line breaks as they appear in the manuscript. Accordingly, I have also removed hyphens when they appear in words across line breaks.</item>
                           <item>In the manuscript, end punctuation is sometimes omitted in sentences that conclude at the right margin of the page. I have inserted appropriate punctuation in brackets to mark these instances, but only when a sentence of this sort is followed by another complete sentence, spoken by the same character.</item>
                           <item>I have deleted repetitions of text when they provide no further information. For instance, in the manuscript, two subsequent pages indicate the beginning of “Act 2.” I have therefore omitted one of these instances.</item>
                           <item>In the manuscript, periods or colons appear at the end of characters’ names, though not always, and this punctuation is sometimes underlined. For consistency, I have inserted a period at the end of all character names but do not underline the period.</item>
                        </list>
                     </quote>
I have otherwise maintained the characteristic features of the manuscript, including format, spelling, capitalization, punctuation, act and scene headings, and stage directions. My aim has been to present, as closely as possible, the state of the play in 1794, when it was submitted for production.</p>
                  <p>The contexts section of this edition—comprised of a collection of newspaper puffs and reviews, visual satire, and poetry and prose extracts—provides a snapshot of the build up and intense reaction to the staging of <title level="m">Nobody</title>.  Contemporary texts, images, and commentary uncover the historical and cultural framework within which Robinson produced her drama and, as such, offer insight into how <title level="m">Nobody</title> engages some of the most pressing socio-political issues of the day.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Terry F. Robinson</hi> is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto. Her current book project examines how eighteenth-century histrionic theory and practice influenced literary, artistic, and cultural innovation in the Romantic period. She is co-editor of the essay collection <title level="m">Transnational England: Home and Abroad, 1780-1860</title> (Cambridge Scholars, 2009), and her articles have appeared in <title level="j">Nineteenth-Century Literature</title>, the <title level="j">European Romantic Review</title>, and <title level="j">Studies in Romanticism</title>, among others.  In 2010, she was awarded the Nineteenth-Century Studies Association best essay prize for <title level="a">Mary Robinson and the Dramatic Art of the Comeback.</title>

                  <p>This edition was designed and TEI-encoded at the University of Maryland by Michael Quilligan, Site Manager at <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>. Laura Mandell developed the modified versions of the transforms provided by the TEI that were used to convert the TEI files into HTML. TEI renders text archival quality for better preservation and future access. The image associated with this edition includes elements from Thomas Rowlandson's <title level="m">The Gaming Table at Devonshire House</title> (1791).</p>

                  <p>
            I would like to thank the Henry E. Huntington Library, namely Sue Hodson, for granting permission to reproduce <title level="m">Nobody</title> online and Meredith Berbée and Catherine Wehrey for their helpful assistance with the manuscript. I am also indebted to Jeffrey N. Cox, Taryn Hakala, Daniel Robinson, and Dana Van Kooy for reading various portions of this edition and for providing constructive and insightful feedback. Many thanks are due as well to <title level="m">Romantic Circles</title>, particularly to Tilar Mazzeo for her fast and friendly responses and to my blind reader for valuable recommendations concerning formatting and notations. This edition has also benefited from the publication of <title level="m">The Works of Mary Robinson</title> (London: Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2010), particularly with regard to William D. Brewer’s insights into Robinson’s drama.</p>

    Boaden, James. <title level="m">The Life of Mrs. Jordan</title>. Vol. 1. London: E. Bull, 1831. 
</p>
               <p rend="noCount">p. 271: Mrs. Robinson, this season, added to the failures of the commencement, a two-act comedy called <title level="m">Nobody</title>. An actress formerly herself, she had influence enough to bring the following ladies together in so mere a trifle. I remember the delight she expressed at Mrs. Jordan’s heading the list, followed by Mrs. Goodall, Miss Pope, Miss Collins, Miss Heard, and Miss Decamp. I cannot detail the incidents, but I know well that to have great names for trivial business is certain death to any author. The spectators soon see that the performers are discontented in their situations, and if they condescend to them in mere kindness, it is the unkindest thing they can do. The audience soon avenge their complaisance upon the writer of the piece; what he courted for his support shrinks from the voluntary task, and he falls, good easy man, from his confidence in hollow professions.</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Our dear Mrs. Jordan had powers of kindness equal to her other gifts; but she was not made for a storm; and grew pitiably nervous if the house shewed marks of displeasure and contest, which [to p. 272] they liberally or illiberally did in abundance on the present occasion. One might have supposed Mrs. Robinson prescient of her fate, by her epilogue—for Mrs. Jordan hurried on to address the audience in the words following, “half dead and scarce recovered from my fright.” Recovered! she was so far from being recovered, that she only repeated twenty lines out of the epilogue, that had no connexion with each other; and the authoress was indignant with manager, actress, proprietor, and even the public, for not embalming <title level="m">Nobody</title>. It had a prologue as well as an epilogue, for mere verse cost her nothing. The piece was tried again, but “who can revive the dead?”</p>
               <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Mrs. Robinson was a good deal connected with newspapers; and as her lameness confined her to the chair when at home, she was constantly writing, and tolerably free in her remarks. This always operates mischievously upon the mind of an actor, who is quite sure that the writer turned dramatist will visit failure upon any thing rather than his piece—<emph>that</emph> in fact had passed his tribunal before.</p>

               <p rend="noCount">p. 140: In the year 1793, a little farce, entitled <title level="m">Nobody</title>, was written by Mrs. Robinson. This piece, designed as a satire on <emph>female gamesters</emph>, was received at the theatre, the characters distributed, and preparations made for its exhibition. At this period one of the principal performers gave up her part, alleging that the piece was intended as a ridicule on her particular friend. Another actress also, though in “herself an host,” was intimidated by a letter, informing her that “Nobody should be damned!” The author received likewise, on the same day, a scurrilous, indecent, and <emph>ill-disguised</emph> scrawl, signifying to her that the farce [to p. 141] was already condemned. On the drawing up of the curtain, several persons in the galleries, whose <emph>liveries</emph> betrayed their <emph>employers</emph>, were sent to <emph>do up</emph> Nobody. Even women of distinguished rank hissed through their fans. Notwithstanding these manœuvres and exertions, the more rational part of the audience seemed inclined to hear before they passed judgment, and, with a firmness that never fails to awe, demanded that the piece should proceed. The first act was accordingly suffered without interruption: a song in the second being unfortunately encored, the malcontents once more ventured to raise their voices, and the malignity that had been forcibly suppressed burst forth with redoubled violence. For three nights, the theatre presented a scene of confusion, when the [to p. 142] authoress, after experiencing the gratification of a zealous and sturdy defence, thought proper wholly to withdraw the cause of contention.</p>

The petty gambler, who opens his shop of iniquity with the puny traffic of silver, is without mercy punished, and held up as an example of depraved manners; while the nobles hold their public clubs, gamble for thousands, outface the magistrates, and defy the laws, with boldness and impunity! It is at the gaming-tables of the exalted, that our legislators, our nobility, our generals, and our country-gentlemen practice those very vices which the needy and the private individual is punished for attempting. It is at those ennobled midnight scenes of folly and rapacity, that the <hi rendition="#smcap">demon of suicide</hi> anticipates his triumphs over the weakness, avarice, and false pride of mortals. The effects of those scenes have recently presented <hi rendition="#smcap">horrors</hi> and <hi rendition="#smcap">death</hi>! yet the magistrates are passive, and the laws tardy in the occupation of administering justice; and it is with sorrow that the moralist and the philanthropist have traced the progress of this pernicious propensity even to the private assemblies of the most elegant <hi rendition="#smcap">women</hi>; while the ruined husband, and the thoughtless wife, have, by dissipating their children’s patrimony, exposed the females to the miseries of seduction, and set an example to the males, which has undermined both the wealth and the honour of their family. Indeed to this fatal employment may be attributed the many domestic exposures which have taken place within the last twenty years. Men now devote their hours to clubs, to gaming-tables, to tennis-courts, and to cricket-grounds. Wives are left to roam, or permitted to hold their midnight orgies, with the most dissipated of their own as well as of the other sex. Play involves them in debts of honour, which the <emph>sacrifice of honour</emph> too frequently discharges: and, it is an absolute fact, that even the family jewels and the family plate have been disposed to supply the <hi rendition="#smcap">faro bank</hi> of one of those infamous scenes of profligate debasement; while the husband has been the passive spectator, and the daughters employed at places of public entertainment, as decoys to ensnare the young, the wealthy and the unwary!</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">A New Farce, entitled, <hi rendition="#smcap">Nobody</hi>, written by Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, was performed at this Theatre on Saturday night. The scene is taken from high life, and is intended as a laudable exposure of those dames of Fashion, who in departing from the delicacy of their sex, commence Gamesters, involving by such conduct, not only their own characters in ruin, but that of others in this Vortex of fashionable depravity. The story of the piece is simple. Lady <hi rendition="#smcap">Languid</hi>, the heroine of the scene, is beset by a croud of flutterers, but her admirers diminish in proportion to her ill success at Play. Sir <hi rendition="#smcap">Harry Rightly</hi>, a respectable citizen, is rewarded by her hand, in consequence of his generosity and constancy: a reformation takes place in the lady, and the parties are happily united.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">With such slender Materials, it cannot be expected that this Farce abounds in Incident or Interest. <hi rendition="#smcap">Bannister</hi> represents one of those nauseous and senseless Fops, that infest every place of public resort, and though the character is well conceived, it is not as well drawn as we could have wished.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">There are certain objectionable <emph>things</emph> in the double entendre, that the good sense of the Lady will induce her to expunge, and we “<emph>cry her mercy</emph>,” if we should, in defiance of her superior judgment, disagree with her in observing, that it is possible to have too much of a <emph>good thing</emph>. The House was full of Fashion, and to this we attribute the sentiments of disapprobation manifested at the conclusion, as Gambling is become a vice so general that there were few in the Boxes that were not displeased at the exposure of their dissipation and depravities.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The Prologue was delivered by Mr. Barrymore, and the Epilogue by Mrs. Jordan. They were both well received, and do honour to Mrs. Robinson, from whose pen they come. The Farce was given out for a second representation for this evening.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount">A new Afterpiece, whimsically called “<title level="m">Nobody</title>,” was brought out before a numerous assembly on Saturday.—It is the production of Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, whose poetical talents have so justly raised her to literary distinction. The plan of this little Comedy (for its structure is correctly within the rules of regular Drama) is, to exhibit in gay satire the frivolous manners, and degrading dissipation of high life. Though there is no novelty in the idea, there is pleasurable ease in the dialogue, and severe truth in the pictures which she draws. If the characters, though all theatrically familiar to the Audience, had been actively engaged in business, and their conversations had been animated by incident, of which the subject was fruitful, it would have been a most agreeable Afterpiece; but unfortunately they have so little to do, that the heart is fatigued with scenes which lead to no purpose, and which do not connect and carry on an interest. A pair of jack-boots, left by an arch simpleton in the dressing-room of <emph>Lady Languid</emph> is neatly and dramatically improved into a tale of scandal by her friends; and the wisdom of such friendships is still further exemplified by their refusing to lend her a rouleau, when pigeoned at the Faro-table. If something more of this kind of incident had been sprinkled over the light surface of the fable, it would have been a favourite performance. The writing is easy, and in parts epigrammatic; but we cannot flatter Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi> with saying that her muse is likely, in this instance, to shine with the graceful eclat that u[s]ed to accompany her personal appearance on the Boards.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi> performed the part of the arch simpleton, which she did with that force and energy which characterise her humour.—She sang a little Scots madrigal with the most touching melody, and in which she was rapturously encored. Miss <hi rendition="#smcap">Pope</hi>, who never appears without giving pleasure to every heart, had, in her first scene, a good female caricature of masculine manners to exhibit, which she did with true comedy.—She had afterwards to undergo the trouble of dressing for nothing. Mr. <hi rendition="#smcap">Bannister</hi> had literally nothing to do worthy of himself. The wit of the part was exhausted in the dress. Mr. <hi rendition="#smcap">Barrymore</hi> wore, what no gentleman ever appears in, black silk breeches with a frock coat.—We mention it only because we see the gallants at this Theatre too often drest in this shabby style.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">I was one of the many at Drury-lane House, on Saturday evening, to attend the performance of the new Comedy, entitled, <title level="m">Nobody</title>, and saw the first act with pleasure, although mixt with expectation and hopes of something better. The second act unfortunately fell off, rather than rose, in degree of attraction, point, and merit, and ultimately provoked the displeasure of that important <emph>Somebody</emph>, the Audience, the generality of whom seemed disgusted with the manners, and disappointed by the use and disposal of the characters and their escape of justice. I have often witnessed a more unwarrantable sentence of judgment passed in the Theatre, from caprice, accidental ill-temper, or want of due attention to the grounds and aim of the satire exhibited. In <title level="m">Nobody</title>’s case nobody was to blame; and I may be bold to say this, because the author of the <emph>petite Comedie</emph> of Saturday has taught me, that, as <emph>nobody </emph>was meant to be personified, <title level="m">Nobody</title> can claim a right to complain: but, all play upon words apart, I should forget what is due to Mrs. Robinson’s merit as a poet and general writer, if, as one of her literary admirers, I did not step forward, and admit that her object was a fair one, her way of treating it entitled to credit, her colouring correct, and her picture strikingly just; but unfortunately her subject was ill-chosen, her characters were too faint for general intelligibility and relish, and her <emph>tout ensemble</emph> wanted interest, and consequently was deficient in impression and effect. The truth is, the topics have already been touched on by Mrs. Inchbald, in her Comedy of <emph>Next-door Neighbours</emph>, and the satire brought to a point by the author of a short piece, called, <emph>A Quarter of an Hour before Dinner</emph>, frequently performed at Mr. Colman’s Theatre. The dissipation of high life is itself a mere matter of censurable affectation; for I defy a human being possessed of a tolerable understanding, to say conscientiously, that he or she derives any rational gratification from it: hence it is too unsubstantial for satire, and too feeble for ridicule. It will not bear the light, but, upon exposure, appears to be a system of folly so flimsy, so false, and so unnatural, that <title level="m">Nobody</title> will believe any such system every had existence, or that two individuals possessed of a grain of sense could possibly agree to persist in so absurd a system of life.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">In the Comedy called <title level="m">Nobody</title>, all the characters promise much in the first act, but, excepting <emph>Nelly Primrose</emph>, like true West-end-of-the-town folks, they promise much and perform nothing. <emph>Sharpley</emph> is the dullest nobody that ever belied his name with utterance.<emph> Lady Rouleau</emph> also comes on with a bustle, and ends with shewing that her dress, forward manners, and forward tongue only serve to prove that she is <emph>nobody</emph>. In short, the manners of the dissipated Great may be chosen for a <emph>tableau</emph> by the artist who lives on their favours, but they will never furnish a good subject for a <emph>tableau parlant</emph>: like the visionary presentment of future Kings to Macbeth, they may be said to “come like shadows, so depart.” 		<hi rendition="#right">W.</hi>

                  <p rend="noCount">Report ascribes this production to Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, and indeed the second act bears evidence of its truth, in the delicacy and neatness of the sentiments from the character of a philanthropist.</p>

                     <hi rendition="#smcap">Nobody</hi>, we conceive to be so named, inasmuch as the Author wishes to exhibit fashion without individuality. Whether any <emph>faux pas</emph> has arisen from the aukward introduction of <emph>jackboots</emph>, instead of those belonging to any of our female equestrians, we neither know, nor is it material to enquire. Such an incident constitutes the <emph>embarras </emph>of the present trifle.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi> has always lived in fashionable life; and <title level="m">Nobody</title> need take the trouble to tell her how evanescent are the essences of which it is composed.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">This being premised, we must acknowledge that the copies are correctly drawn. The slandering coxcomb, at once a fool and a fortune-hunter, is every day to be seen sauntering up St. James’s-street. You cannot turn the corner of the promenade without receiving a whiff of his unintelligible jargon, addressed to a creature, who associates without hearing, and who is welcomed in his turn with the same polished inattention.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The Faro party might have more to say, and <emph>Lady Languid </emph>would be the better for some act of virtue, which might make her merit her good fortune.

                     <emph>Nelly Primrose</emph> and her innocent blunders are pleasing, though not quite broad enough for an after piece, where to laugh, and laugh heartily, is always expected.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The <hi rendition="#smcap">Prologue</hi> intimated that all assistance had been declined: and the audience were conjured to kindness, lest the contrary should bring the writer to her <emph>last night</emph>. Certainly the <hi rendition="#smcap">many</hi> had a struggle against the <hi rendition="#smcap">illnature</hi> which a <hi rendition="#smcap">few</hi> were forward in displaying.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">This piece is the avowed production of Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, whom the Prologue stated to have formerly trod the boards of <emph>Old Drury</emph>, and who is better known to the world at large by the title of <emph>The Perdita</emph>.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">It was rather unfortunate, notwithstanding the strong<emph> cast</emph> of <title level="m">Nobody</title>, that hardly <emph>any body</emph> was disposed to give it a parting plaudit. The fact is, that in a very humble attempt to give a large portion of smart dialogue, the necessary requisites of an interesting plot, novelty of character, and probability of situation, have been totally placed on the dramatic shelf.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi> is brought forward as an aukward country servant, merely to misunderstand the manners and expressions of a fine Lady; and, to use the language of <hi rendition="#smcap">Bayes</hi>, all the wit of the piece lies in the <emph>boots</emph> of the Butler, which she introduces by mistake into her Mistress’s dressing room. This, and a trifling attempt at the drawling <emph>non chalance</emph> of a Modern Beau, and the forward excentricity of a Female Martinet, completely anticipated by Reynolds’s <emph>Lady Sarah Savage</emph>, make up the sum total of <title level="m">Nobody</title>’s merits.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The dialogue is replete with puns of the coarsest kind; some of them too forced and far fetched even for Farce. The tedious scene of cross purposes and cross readings in the first act, is wholly taken from <title level="m">Barnaby Brit[tle]</title>, and the <title level="m">Deaf Lover</title>; but unfortunately the situations only have been borrowed.—The wit and humor are left untouched. Though the sense of the House was completely against a repetition of such nonsense, it was given out with much flippancy by <hi rendition="#smcap">Barrymore</hi>. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the interval between Saturday and Monday has been employed in a judicious compressment by the Manager. Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Goodall</hi> should be instructed not to call for her carriage so often, and it would be as well not to let the Lady’s Maid so grossly disturb the propriety and etiquette of a drawing room, as to break in abruptly, in order to tell the company she was quitting her place because the Butler had called her an ORIGINAL.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">We had almost forgot to add, that Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi> sung a Scotch ballad, unaccompanied, in a very charming stile, which gained a deserved encore.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The Prologue and Epilogue turned on the title of the Comedy. In the latter, Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi> proved much at fault; and of course the little effect intended, was entirely destroyed.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The opposition which it experienced throughout was considerable, and a part of the audience carried their disapprobation to the length of not suffering the performers to go through the whole of the piece, which terminating thus abruptly, Mrs. Jordan came forward, and delivered the Epilogue in a tremulous and agitated tone of voice, evidently much embarrassed. The Prologue was spoken by Barrymore.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">When announced for a second representation, the <emph>noes</emph> appeared to have the majority. It cannot be said, however, that <emph>No-Body</emph> supported it, for the plaudits, although in the minority, were very numerous.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The object of this piece was to place in proper ridicule the follies and vices of fashionable life; and the piece, though evidently intended as a mere dramatic sketch, was really a pleasant portrait of the manners of the higher ranks. There was also another purpose in this drama, of more value in point of morals: for it was also intended to show how easily a reputation may be lost by the use to which mere <emph>appearances</emph> may be converted by the aid of <emph>malice</emph>.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The story is simply as follows:—<emph>Lady Languid</emph>, a widow with a considerable fortune, is seduced into the gay world, and precipitated into most of its follies, and particularly into the vice of gaming, by which she is nearly ruined. She is beset with fortune-hunters of <emph>Ton</emph>, who, without delicacy, leave her the moment her fortune is supposed to be lost.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">
                     <emph>Sir Henry Rightly</emph>, a wealthy and amiable city merchant, is in love with her; and though his worth makes little impression upon her amidst the seduction of fashion, he determines to make a final effort to save her from ruin, to reform her morals, and to make her the partner of his life. For this laudable purpose he accompanies her to a fashionable rout, and at length succeeds in reclaiming her, after she has proved the insincerity of all her gay connexions.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">There is much pleasantry arising from the awkward mistakes of a <emph>Somersetshire wench</emph>, who attends <emph>Lady Languid</emph> in her dressing-room, and who commits numerous blunders in attempting to obey the orders of her mistress. One of her mistakes, when her mistress calls for her <emph>boots</emph>, (an article of attire with modern fine Ladies) is, to bring in a dirty pair of <emph>jack-boots</emph> belonging to the Butler; and, upon the circumstance of finding these boots in the dressing-room of <emph>Lady Languid</emph>, does malevolence ground its attempts to destroy her reputation.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The first Act of this Piece was very favourably received; but an Air, by Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi>, somewhat too long, being <emph>encored</emph>, the Audience were thrown into ill-humour, and the performers disconcerted. The piece then met with some opposition, but however was heard amidst applause and murmurs to the end, when it was announced for Monday evening, without any decisive objection or concurrence.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">If the Performers have spirits enough to do justice to their characters on the repetition, we have no doubt of seeing the Piece received as a lively and whimsical sketch of passing manners.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">This Piece is attributed to Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Robinson</hi>, to whom the literary world is indebted for so many beautiful effusions of poetry. The Prologue and Epilogue, which seemed to be spirited compositions, were both written by the fair Author; but the agitated state of Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi>, on account of the opposition, obliged her, as we understand, to omit many lines. It is even said Mrs. <hi rendition="#smcap">Jordan</hi> was apprized of the intended presence of a party to damn the Piece, early on Saturday morning, and the apprehension of such an event was a constant bar to her exertions throughout the representation.</p>

                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">The Farce of <title level="m">Nobody</title> was performed for the third time on Saturday evening. Some alterations had taken place:—a new character is introduced, a Captain in the Navy, whose sword being left upon Lady <emph>Languid</emph>’s Sofa, gives ground for scandal against her in place of <emph>the Boots</emph>, and she marries the Officer, instead of <emph>Rightly</emph>, the Moralist.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">Considerable disapprobation was expressed through the whole of the last act; and towards the conclusion, a disposition to riot began to manifest itself. That there were persons in the House who came predetermined to condemn, was very obvious; and a Gentleman in the upper Boxes, pointing to one of these Ruffians in the front of the Gallery, he, actuated doubtless by that spirit of <emph>Equality</emph> which certain persons do sedulously inculcate, leapt from the Gallery into the Boxes, whither he was followed by several more. As it is the system of some Magistrates that the Mob shall be uncontrouled—in deference, we presume, to that comfortable system, not a Peace-officer was to be found; and had not a body of Gentlemen taken these Rioters into custody, very serious consequences might have ensued.</p>
                  <p rend="noCount" rendition="#paraIndent">If such proceedings are to be tolerated, we must not be surprised that not only fashion but even decency should be banished from our Theatres; for who will go thither to be liable to insult and outrage of the grossest kind? A few such nights as Saturday would, we presume, render this a <emph>National Theatre</emph> upon the true French principles of <emph>Equality</emph>; for we should see but one kind of Spectators in every part of the House.

Paula Byrne has concluded that she was likely born in 1757, based on the fact that Robinson’s own, pre-edited memoirs state that she was fifteen when she married Thomas Robinson and that a <title level="j">Morning Herald</title> newspaper report divulged her year of birth as 1757; see Byrne 430.</note> née Darby, achieved great celebrity during her lifetime as an actress, courtesan, fashion icon, and prolific author of poetry, essays, novels, and plays. Over the past twenty years, her life and work have received fresh attention from scholars and biographers who have become fascinated, as her contemporaries once were, with her dazzling personality, social prowess, thespian skill, and literary artistry.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="2">In addition to the many academic articles, book chapters, and editions devoted to the study of Mary Robinson, see the recent biographies of Robinson by Paula Byrne, Hester Davenport, and Sarah Gristwood, the historical fiction <title level="m">All for Love</title> by Amanda Elyot, and the first book-length study of her poetry by Daniel Robinson.</note> Despite this resurgence in interest, however, relatively little is known about Robinson’s dramas, <title level="m">The Lucky Escape, a Comic Opera</title> (Drury Lane, 1778; never published), <title level="m">Nobody</title> (Drury Lane 1794; never published) and <title level="m">The Sicilian Lover: A Tragedy in Five Acts</title> (never performed; published 1796).<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="3">
                        <title level="m">The Lucky Escape</title> was never published, though soon after its performance, a collection of the play’s songs appeared in the bookshops; see Robinson, <title level="m">Songs, Chorusses</title>. The licensing manuscript of <title level="m">The Lucky Escape</title> is held in the Larpent Collection at the Henry E. Huntington Library in San Marino, California. <title level="m">The Sicilian Lover</title>, while completed in the autumn of 1795 and intended for stage representation, was never performed. According to Robinson’s daughter, Maria Elizabeth, its presentation at Drury Lane was so long delayed by the managers that Robinson “resolved to <emph>print the tragedy</emph>, and leave its merits and defects to the decision of the public” (Robinson, <title level="m">Poetical Works</title> 1: xv-xvi). Robinson also authored an opera, which was neither performed nor published, though <title level="j">The Oracle</title> announced repeatedly in 1793 that it was to be produced. Plans for its representation were apparently halted, however, and on 17 October 1793, <title level="j">The Oracle</title> stated that Robinson “Means to print her Opera on her return to town; and with it, a full explanation of her reasons for withdrawing it from Drury-Lane Theatre.” According to Paula Byrne, the opera was entitled <title level="m">Kate of Aberdeen</title>, and the libretto was never printed. See <title level="j">The Oracle</title> for 11 January, 21 February, 23 March, 5 April, and 17 and 25 October 1793, and Byrne 309-310.</note> Though they comprise an important component of Robinson’s histrionic and literary legacy, they have received less critical attention than her poems, essays, and novels, due in part to academic prejudices and to access issues: Romantic-period plays have traditionally received the short end of the canonical stick, so to speak, and, as a result, Robinson’s contributions to the genre have only ever existed, until just recently, in manuscript or rare book form.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="4">Robinson’s dramas have been published in volume 8 of <title level="m">The Works of Mary Robinson</title>, ed. William D. Brewer (Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2010).</note> Even in the face of these setbacks, Robinson’s dramas are worth investigating because they provide a key to understanding Romantic-period society, the late eighteenth-century stage, contemporary satire, the birth of celebrity culture, and Robinson’s engagement with the theater during and after her acting career, when she took on her new role as a woman of letters.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="5">For an analysis of how Robinson engineered this transformation from actress to author, see Michael Gamer and Terry F. Robinson. </note> This <title level="j">Romantic Circles</title> edition of <title level="m">Nobody</title> thus represents an effort to bring Robinson’s dramatic work out of obscurity and onto the boards of modern scholarship and the literary stage by making it widely available through an open-access online environment.</p>
                  <p>In order to understand <title level="m">Nobody</title> and its reception, it is helpful to know about Robinson’s background. Born in a Bristol home constructed within the Gothic ruins of the medieval monastery of St. Augustine,<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="6">In her <title level="m">Memoirs</title>, Robinson speaks of her birthplace as “A spot . . . calculated to inspire the soul with mournful meditation” (1: 3).</note> Mary initially enjoyed a comfortable childhood as the daughter of Hester and Nicholas Darby, a well-to-do American-born merchant. Her early life began to be clouded with difficulties when her father abandoned his wife and their children after his plan to establish a fishery on the coast of Labrador failed. Fortunately, Mary had already gained an early education at a Bristol school run, in part, by the social reformer and author Hannah More, and despite her father’s subsequent desertion, the loss of their family home, and the auctioning off of the family’s more valuable possessions, she was able to continue her education at London schools in Chelsea and Battersea and to complete her studies at Oxford House, Marylebone. While attending the latter institution, her future fate began to crystallize when her dancing master introduced her to the Covent Garden Theatre actor Thomas Hull. Not long afterwards, she was called upon to meet the manager of London’s Drury Lane Theatre, David Garrick. </p>
                  <p>Mary Darby’s audition for Garrick at his Adelphi Terrace home was so successful that Garrick immediately adopted her as his protégée, instructing her in acting and dancing and tutoring her in the part of Cordelia opposite his Lear. Her 1773 stage debut in that role was cancelled, however, due to her marriage in April 1773 to Thomas Robinson, a man who proved feckless and unfaithful. She serendipitously gained another chance to ascend the stage when the actor William Brereton introduced her to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the new part-owner and manager of the Drury Lane Theatre. Sheridan was impressed with Robinson’s budding talent and called Garrick out of retirement to tutor her. The old Roscius worked tirelessly with his former pupil, preparing her for her debut as Juliet in his own reworking of Shakespeare’s <title level="m">Romeo and Juliet</title>, and, as a result, the production, which opened on 10 December 1776, was an instant hit. Robinson “was received with uncommon and universal applause” from the beginning to the end of her performance,<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="7">
                        <title level="j">The Gazetteer</title>, 11 December 1776.</note> and her success ensured her continued roles during that season and in those following. </p>
                  <p>Robinson’s most prominent role during her stage career was as Perdita in <title level="m">Florizel and Perdita</title>, Garrick’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s <title level="m">The Winter’s Tale</title>. On 3 December 1779, during a royal command performance of the play, her charming stage persona captivated the seventeen-year-old Prince of Wales (the future King George IV), and a scandalous romance between the newly styled “Florizel” and “Perdita” began shortly thereafter. Their affaire de coeur—a crossed-class liaison between the heir apparent and a merchant’s daughter-cum-actress—became the subject of heated gossip and formally launched Robinson’s career as a courtesan, fashionable trendsetter, and high-society sybarite. After her relationship with the Prince ended and she retired from the stage at the close of the 1779-1780 season,<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="8">The oft-repeated claim that Robinson returned to the stage in 1783 is incorrect and is based on connected reports in the 24 February 1783 <title level="j">Morning Herald</title>, the first concerning a “Mrs. Robinson” in the role of Victoria in Hannah Cowley’s new comedy, <title level="m">A Bold Stroke for a Husband</title>, at Covent Garden Theatre, and the second concerning the visual appearance of Mary Robinson’s opera box. The first “Mrs. Robinson” referred to is, however, not Mary Robinson but Hannah Henrietta Robinson, a different actress altogether. For more information on this matter, including a discussion of Robinson’s whereabouts in 1783, and an investigation into how contemporary newspapers juxtaposed reports about pubic figures, see Gamer and Robinson.</note> her ensuing celebrity and savvy navigation of public opinion made her wildly famous (and infamous) among the British public. The newspapers continually reported on her whereabouts, documenting, for instance, her 1781 sojourn to France, where, feted as “la belle Angloise,”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="9">Robinson, <title level="m">Memoirs</title> 2: 90.</note> she frequently attended the opera and dined with French aristocrats, including Marie Antoinette. The papers also detailed, in addition to her intrigue with the Prince, the ups and downs of her other amorous relationships, including her famous dalliance, begun in 1782, with the dashing Colonel Banastre Tarleton, the renowned leader of British troops in the American Revolutionary War.
         </p>
                  <p>In the summer of 1783, Robinson’s center-stage lifestyle took a sharp turn when, while traveling to Dover to meet Tarleton, she contracted acute rheumatic fever, possibly from a badly handled miscarriage. She never fully recovered, suffering from severe arthritis throughout the rest of her life, a condition that eventually resulted in her inability to walk. Because her rheumatism prevented her from conducting her life as she previously did, she became ever more devoted to one of her true loves—writing. Robinson had already published two volumes of poetry in 1775 and 1777, the latter under the patronage of the Duchess of Devonshire, and had seen her comic opera, <title level="m">The Lucky Escape</title>, produced on the Drury Lane stage in 1778. Now, during her illness, she embarked on a literary career with renewed determination. In 1788, she commenced a “poetical correspondence”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="11">Robinson, <title level="m">Memoirs</title> 2: 124.</note> in the newspaper <title level="j">The World</title> with Robert Merry, who a few years prior had contributed poems to <emph>The Florence Miscellany</emph> (1785) under the pseudonym “Della Crusca.” After inserting herself into the Della Cruscan circle and quickly establishing a popular poetic reputation, she moved from <title level="j">The World</title> to the rival publication, <title level="j">The Oracle</title>. In 1791, the first volume of her newest verse collection, <title level="m">Poems</title>, was published (the second volume would be released in 1793), and the following year saw the release of her first novel, <title level="m">Vancenza, or, The Dangers of Credulity</title>. During her life, she published many additional volumes of poetry, including her important <title level="m">Sappho and Phaon</title> (1796) and <title level="m">Lyrical Tales</title> (1800), a stylistic homage to Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s and William Wordsworth’s <title level="m">Lyrical Ballads</title> (1798); social-political critiques, including <title level="m">Impartial Reflections of the Present Situation of the Queen of France</title> (1791) and <title level="m">A Letter to the Women of England, on the Injustice of Mental Subordination</title> (1799); along with a number of novels, including <title level="m">The Widow, or a Picture of Modern Times</title> (1794), <title level="m">Angelina; A Novel</title> (1796), <title level="m">Hubert de Sevrac, A Romance, of the Eighteenth Century</title> (1796), <title level="m">Walsingham; or, The Pupil of Nature: A Domestic Story</title> (1797), <title level="m">The False Friend: A Domestic Story</title> (1799), and <title level="m">The Natural Daughter. With Portraits of the Leadenhead Family. A Novel</title> (1799). Her unfinished novel, <title level="m">Jasper, A Fragment</title>, was posthumously published in the <title level="m">Memoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, Written by Herself</title> (1801), an autobiography begun by Robinson, completed by her daughter Maria Elizabeth Robinson, and sought after by those curious about the life of such an iconic woman.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="12">For selections of Mary Robinson’s poetry and prose, see, among others, the collections edited by William D.

                  <p>One of Robinson’s most remarkable productions was her two-act farce <title level="m">Nobody</title> (Drury Lane, 1794), though now, even among scholars of the Romantic period, it is a play almost completely unknown. A biting satire on female gamblers, <title level="m">Nobody</title> documents the financial ruin and rescue of the recently widowed aristocrat, Lady Languid, who, having become caught up in a world of fashionable dissipation, squanders her fortune while playing faro, vingt-et-un, and rouge et noir, among other high-stakes games. At the outset of the comedy, Lady Languid laments her newfound addiction, crying “Play, destructive Play! Perpetual Losses, &amp; no rest have destroy’d me!”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="13">Robinson, <title level="m">Nobody</title> 1.3.</note> Even so, she remains resolutely determined to risk her fortune and reputation in the name of pleasure and “taste,” proclaiming the virtues of her aristocratic associates: “they are so pleasant! They know so well how to live! . . . to see the fritting, frowning beauteous Circle! – bending over pyramids of Rouleaus [rolls of coins] – To behold their delicious agonies! – their charming Anxieties – their laughable vexations, and provoking Triumphs! . . . Where else can a Woman of Fashion be happy?”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="14">Robinson, <title level="m">Nobody</title> 2.1.</note> Her friend and admirer, a London banker and philanthropist aptly named Sir Henry Rightly, checks her enthusiasm by suggesting to her that more pleasure is to be found in assisting those in need than in gambling. Doubting that this is so, she characteristically makes a bet with him: “If you will for once enter into the Spirit of the Play [i.e., gamble] – I will sink into the Apathy of Sentiment. . . . I will relieve a distress’d object Tomorrow – We will then compare Notes, and whoever is most satisfied shall be proclaimed the Victor.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="15">Robinson, <title level="m">Nobody</title> 2.1.</note> Sir Henry accepts her challenge and later appears at the agreed-upon gaming venue, but arrives before Lady Languid does and overhears a group of bon vivants engage in mean-spirited gossip about his friend. His subsequent defense of Lady Languid invites their mockery of him, but over the course of the evening, in his banter with the gathered party, Sir Henry comically exposes the fact that Lady Languid’s comrades are, rather than important somebodies, unfeeling fools and social <emph>nobodies</emph>, who will claim an affiliation with Lady Languid just so long as she has money to spend. Lady Languid soon arrives only to be met with a barrage of accusations about her sexual conduct, to lose her entire fortune at a game of Faro, and to be deserted by all of her associates except for Sir Henry Rightly who, having been a winner in the game, returns all of her money to her, but not without enjoining her to keep her promise to help the unfortunate. In this case, the hapless being turns out to be himself: while she is overwhelmed with his generosity, he declares his love for her, saying “believe me Lady Languid, ’till you are mine, no Man exists more wretched than myself!”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="17">Robinson, <title level="m">Nobody</title> 2.3.</note> The play ends with the suggestion of their imminent engagement, but Lady Languid does not let the curtain close upon her story without aiding the less fortunate. When her maidservant bursts into the drawing room in the final scene, shedding tears over the fact that she was teased earlier in the day by Lady Languid’s friends, Lady Languid placates her with five guineas; the elated maid exclaims, “By Jingo I’ve had many fine promises but a Bird in the Hand is worth Two in the Bush,”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="18">Robinson, <title level="m">Nobody</title> 2.3.</note> thereby suggesting one of the morals of the tale—that a tangible advantage is better than the chance of a greater one, or in the context of the play, holding on to one’s actual wealth is preferable to gambling it away in the expectation of more.</p>

                     <title level="m">Nobody</title> opened as an afterpiece at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on Saturday, 29 November 1794 and was performed again on Monday, 1 December, and on Saturday, 6 December. <title level="j">The Morning Chronicle</title>, <title level="j">The Morning Post</title>, <title level="j">The London Chronicle</title>, <title level="j">The Oracle</title>, and <title level="j">The Times</title>, among others, carried advertisements for the performances, touting the comedy’s cast of top actors—among them, John Bannister, William Barrymore, Robert Bensley, Charlotte Goodall, Jane Pope, and Dorothy Jordan—and promising a grand sartorial spectacle: “With New Dresses, &amp;c.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="19">

                     </note> Unfortunately for Robinson, the show did not go well, and the newspaper reviews, while not bad, were less than enthusiastic. Though many of the reviewers tipped their hats to Robinson by acknowledging her established talent as a poet and citing the play’s positive features, including clever dialogue (though overly laced with <foreign>double entendre</foreign>), truthfulness in its depiction of high-society dissolution, and a high degree of comic pleasantry, they were, nonetheless, hesitant to acknowledge her dramatic success, one paper expressing near regret for noting the comedy’s flaws and stating, “we cannot flatter Mrs. ROBINSON with saying that her muse is likely, in this instance, to shine with the graceful eclat that u[s]ed to accompany her personal appearance on the Boards.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="20">

                     </note> Contemporary assessments of <title level="m">Nobody</title> as promising but unexceptional cannot be read, however, as definitive measures of the play’s merit, since incidents surrounding its performance suggest that such judgments may have been colored by the social climate in which the drama debuted, a climate created by those in the auditorium who reacted negatively, less to its putative mediocrity than to its message.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="21">Newspaper reviewers sitting in the theater auditorium on the first night of the play likely had no knowledge of the planned sabotage of Robinson’s drama. The hisses of those offended by its message could have led the reviewers to conclude that <title level="m">Nobody</title> lacked merit.</note> Indeed, in the case of <title level="m">Nobody</title>, concerns over merit take a back seat to the more compelling and controversial issues that the comedy and its reception raise.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the first performance of <title level="m">Nobody</title>, news began filtering in about the utter commotion it had caused. <title level="j">The Sun</title> reported that when Dorothy Jordan, in the character of Nelly Primrose, duly repeated an “air” (the <title level="a">Ballad of Barbara Allen</title>) for which she had been encored, she received only “ill-humour” from the audience. The paper states that throughout the performance, the play “met with some opposition” and that at its conclusion, Jordan had become so “agitated” by the mixed and often hostile reaction of the crowd that she was unable to speak the Epilogue clearly, omitting lines and, according to <title level="j">The Times</title>, botching it altogether: “Mrs. JORDAN proved much at fault; . . . the little effect intended, was entirely destroyed.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="22">

            To put it another way, female gamblers were none too pleased with Robinson’s indictment of their activities, and voiced their objection not only at the play’s conclusion, as indicated here, but throughout the performance, as mentioned above, and even before the curtain rose. According to Robinson’s <title level="m">Memoirs</title>, a threatening letter was sent to Dorothy Jordan prior to the opening night “informing her that ‘Nobody should be damned!’”, and Robinson also received a “scurrilous, indecent, and <emph>ill-disguised</emph> scrawl, signifying to her that the farce was already condemned.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="27">Robinson, <ref target="./context_controversy.html">

                  As this report claims, the sabotage was planned and duly effected. “Instead of Nobody,” the same newspaper remarked, “we advise her [Robinson] to call it, ‘<emph>St. James’s square in an uproar</emph>.’ . . .

                  <p>By 1794, gambling had become a veritable institution in aristocratic society, but as early as 1783, <title level="j">The Morning Herald</title> observed that “The influence of gaming is so prevalent in polite circles, that in the house of a lady of the first quality, after the money is gone, they actually play for articles of dress, diamond pins, aigrettes, &amp;c. &amp;c. Their husbands may justly fear, lest their <emph>honor</emph> go with the <emph>odd trick!</emph>”.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="34">
                        <title level="j">The Morning Chronicle</title>, 22 March 1783.</note> This quotation suggests that female gamesters had become socially commonplace, and yet their activities were considered threatening to themselves and to those connected with them. In the creation of her play, Robinson exploited this perspective while, perhaps, underestimating the power of the nobility. By attacking one of their favorite pastimes, she was, in essence, attacking the patrician way of life. Robinson was certainly aware of this, and, indeed, <title level="m">Nobody</title> can be read as an indictment of aristocratic extravagance and “double-dealing” in general,<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="35">Robinson’s retaliation against the nobility seems probable in light of her vexation over the high “cost” of her relationship with the Prince. In a letter composed the month prior to the debut of <title level="m">Nobody</title>, she writes that while she had “sacrificed reputation . . . and the conscious delight of correct conduct,” the Prince was obliged only to pay her an annuity of £500, a meager amount, Robinson complained, in comparison with his other lavish expenditures. See Mary Robinson to John Taylor, 5 October 1794. Rpt. in Pascoe, <title level="m">Mary Robinson</title> 365-67. See Brewer, 'Mary Robinson,' for an assessment of how <title level="m">Nobody</title> evinces the changing moral and fiscal climate—from "fashionable aristocrats" to "enlightened plutocrats"—in late eighteenth-century England (271).</note> but her play’s inability to affect the habits of the nobility or their total ability to overrule her play seems to have surprised her. In short, if one can rely upon contemporary reports, <title level="m">Nobody</title> was doomed to failure from the beginning, for the people Robinson needed to please in order to ensure the play’s success—the modish elite—were the very ones whom she offended. Some of the day’s most notorious gamesters were, in fact, her own patrons and associates: Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, who in the early 1790s owed at least “£61,917 . . . Roughly £3,720,000 today, or $6 million” in gambling debts<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="33">Foreman 245.</note>; Charles James Fox; and the Prince of Wales, whose upcoming marriage to Princess Caroline had been arranged, in part, as a means to relieve his debt. 
         </p>
                  <p>One of the most striking phenomena surrounding <title level="m">Nobody</title> is that its scorn for fashionable imprudence, pretension, and extravagance was prefigured in <title level="j">The Morning Post</title>. Indeed, it might be said that the newspaper engendered the nettled reaction to Robinson’s play well before its debut. In the weeks prior to the first staging of <title level="m">Nobody</title>, <title level="a">The Fashionable World</title> section of <title level="j">The Morning Post</title>—in addition to puffing Mary Robinson and Dorothy Jordan—reported repeatedly on the sartorial follies and monetary fecklessness of the elite classes. It contains, for instance, colorful quips reprimanding fashionable interests: “Certain titled Ladies say, that the short waist, and flowing drapery is Grecian: we wish they had a taste for elegant literature, for which the <emph>Grecian</emph> women were also celebrated.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="40">

                     </note> By linking aristocratic profligacy with the country’s wartime ills, these lines boldly assert that high-society socialites drain the nation’s coffers, and what’s worse, claim justification in doing so. </p>
                  <p>That <title level="j">Morning Post</title> commentaries such as these were meant to set the stage for the debut of <title level="m">Nobody</title>, there can be no doubt. First, the popular London daily was known for its clever use of insinuation and association,<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="43">For more on <title level="j">The Morning Post</title>’s savvy use of suggestion and innuendo, see Gamer and Robinson.</note> and, second, not only do the commentaries' subject matter echo that of Robinson’s play, but a few of them also refer directly to it. On <ref target="./context_newspaper.html#Oct6">6 October 1794</ref>, for example, <title level="j">The Morning Post</title> features the following account: “A Turban, and single White Feather, is the simple head dress worn by our <foreign>Belles</foreign>. Equality seems the motto of the most dashing Fair, as they still appear as <emph>Nobody</emph>.” In addition to making a suggestion about the insubstantiality of high-end fashion and of those who indulge in it, the report contains the title of the play and discusses the very hat that Lady Languid wears in the second act. It is possible, given these connections, that Robinson herself had a hand in peppering <title level="j">The Morning Post</title> with these entries, if not the reviews of the performances themselves. This possibility increases when we consider the fact that their appearance in October-December of 1794 was accompanied by two poems composed by “Bridget,” one of Robinson’s pseudonyms, and addressed “Primrose-hill”—Primrose being the name of Lady Languid’s waiting maid in <title level="m">Nobody</title>. </p>
                  <p>Both poems appear as “letters to the editor” of <title level="j">The Morning Post</title>.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="44">For the complete text of these poems, see the “<ref target="./context_newspaper.html#Oct18">Contexts</ref>” section of this edition.</note> The first, published on 18 October 1794, opens with a discussion of a recent scandal in which an actress, Miss Wallis, was invited by a gentlewoman, Lady Loughborough, to sit with her in her theater box—a gesture that resulted in outrage amongst the nobility. This incident serves as a springboard for the rest of the poem, which spotlights aristocratic snobbery and insensitivity. A woman entitled “her Grace” announces,

            The poem concludes with the women’s assertion that because the masses display their emotion, because they “cry, when <hi rendition="#smcap">Siddons</hi> calls their tears!” and “laugh, ’till they have crack’d their ears, / (When <hi rendition="#smcap">Parsons</hi> plays, or Comic <hi rendition="#smcap">Suett</hi>;),” they lack refinement. For the elite, Lady Di declares, “All, all should be Delight and Fashion, / <foreign>Sans</foreign> Sentiment, <foreign>sans</foreign> Taste, <foreign>sans</foreign> Passion!” This divorce between fashion and feeling is one of the central concerns of <title level="m">Nobody</title>. While the modish set in the comedy refuse to “sink into the Apathy of Sentiment” (2.2), Sir Henry Rightly does, and he is ridiculed for it by a character who disdainfully tells him, “You’re . . . All Sentiment and feeling” (2.3). The poem, then, foreshadows <title level="m">Nobody</title>, for just as the titled women who voice their disapproval of Wallis become the object of ridicule, so, too, do the aristocrats in the play—who object to Rightly—become mocked as “nobodies.”</p>
                  <p>The second poetic “letter to the editor,” published on 5 November 1794, builds upon this hierarchical inversion and again features the indignation of noble women. “Lady Tippy” appears “in a rage” stating,

In <title level="m">Nobody</title>, Lady Languid similarly points out this particular social and intellectual divide between herself and Sir Henry Rightly. Just as Lady Tippy tells of a plebian with “Gothic maxims,” so Lady Languid speaks of how Rightly was “Educated in Gothic Simplicity” (2.2) and because of this, objects to her shaking a “Dice:Box.” Taken as a whole, these two <title level="j">Morning Post</title> poems showcase the discourse of indulgent and self-centered female aristocrats. The final verdict is clear: according to the poem of 18 October, “Fashion is a jade capricious, / Her vot’ries giddy, vain, and vicious.” Here, in the second poem, the women’s class-based concerns are ultimately written written off as “noisy.” </p>
                  <p>
                     <title level="j">The Morning Post</title> commentaries and the late 1794 “Bridget” poems shed light on the dynamic and interconnected nature of theatrical, socio-political, and economic concerns in the Romantic period. They also suggest the possibility that Robinson wrote for <title level="j">The Morning Post</title> prior to 1795 as a means to advertise, set the tone for, and defend her drama.<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="44">In 1831, James Boaden pointedly states that Robinson used her influence with the newspapers to defend <title level="m">Nobody</title> after its poor reception: "Mrs. Robinson was a good deal connected with newspapers; and as her lameness confined her to the chair when at home, she was constantly writing, and tolerably free in her remarks. This always operates mischievously upon the mind of an actor, who is quite sure that the writer turned dramatist will visit failure upon any thing rather than his piece" (272).</note> Further, they provide a clue as to why the “Lady Gamblers” may have felt compelled to sabotage <title level="m">Nobody</title> both during and <emph>before</emph> its debut. Robinson’s comedy, we find, was not meant simply to generate laughs but to transform public opinion.</p>
                  <p>Two weeks before the curtain rose on <title level="m">Nobody</title>, <title level="j">The Morning Post</title> optimistically proposed that dramatic comedy could prove “beneficial to Society” when “the preposterous manners of <emph>high life</emph>”<emph> and </emph>“<emph>Fashionable Folly</emph>” are “checked by the pen of fair and unoffending satire.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="45">

            When, in 1797, Lady Buckinghamshire’s Faro bank was reportedly stolen and her own footmen divulged her illegal gambling activities, the authorities intervened, and Lady Buckinghamshire and her fellow players were fined. Though Kenyon did not preside over the Buckinghamshire prosecution, the incident prompted a barrage of visual satire, which included images by James Gillray and Isaac Cruikshank. In May 1796, for instance, H. Humphrey published Gillray’s <title level="m">
                        <ref target="./images.html#exaltation">Exaltation of Faro’s Daughters</ref>
                     </title>, which features the pilloried Lady Buckinghamshire and Lady Archer exhibiting bemused resignation as the public throws mud and refuse at them. The same month also saw Cruikshank’s <title level="m">
                        <ref target="./images.html#daughters">Faro’s Daughters, or the Kenyonian blowup to Gamblers</ref>
                     </title>, which depicts Charles James Fox in the stocks, supporting on his shoulders one of four female gamblers in the pillories, and Lord Kenyon fanning the flames of a fire that burns dice, cards, and a Faro table. In February 1797, Gillray produced <title level="m">
                        <ref target="./images.html#loss">Loss of the Faro Bank; or, the Rook’s Pigeon’d</ref>
                     </title>, showing Lord Buckinghamshire, Lady Buckinghamshire, Mrs. Concannon, Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Colonel Hanger, and Lady Archer interrupted at Faro by the disconcerting news that the Faro bank has been robbed. The month following, he released <title level="m">
                        <ref target="./images.html#discipline">Discipline à la Kenyon</ref>
                     </title>, depicting Lord Kenyon whipping the bare back of Lady Buckinghamshire who is tied to a cart, while two of her fellow female gamesters observe the action from the pillory. Gillian Russell saliently observes that in such images “the female aristocrat . . . [is] reduced to the social level of a common whore” and that in the 1790s, in general, gambling amongst the “men and women of the Whig elite” was increasingly “condemned as a sign of the moral degeneracy and irresponsibility of the fashionable classes.”<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="49">Russell 495, 481. See Gillian Russell for a detailed analysis of the relationship between Faro, female gamesters, the Lord Kenyon ruling, contemporary political satire, and the late eighteenth-century banking crisis.</note>

                  <p>As Robinson had indicated in <title level="m">Nobody</title>, moral authority was supplanting class-based authority, and, consequently, gambling was becoming a vile activity associated not with the high, but with the low. At a time when women were increasingly expected to be moral models,<note place="foot" resp="editors" n="50">Russell 482.</note> Robinson speculates about the future of the female gamester and places her bets on the kind of woman exemplified by Lady Languid, an aristocrat who, at the very end of the drama, breaks away from the pack and takes her own chances. By acting out a new role through the procurement of a respectable husband and the sentimental exhibition (some might say guise) of charity, she adapts to the changing times by performing a new version of female power and privilege. True to form, the ever-fashionable Robinson had predicted, in the decline of gambling, the emergence of the next cutting-edge trend for high-class British women: domestic virtue.</p>

            <p>O, <emph>Fashion!</emph> delegate of taste and wit,		</p>
            <p>Oft do I see thee triumph in the pit;</p>
            <p>When Hobart’s critic fan attention draws,</p>
            <p>The airy signal of ill-judged applause!			280</p>
            <p>When pale-faced misses sigh from side-box rows,</p>
            <p>And <emph>painted</emph> matrons nod to <emph>painted</emph> beaux:</p>
            <p>Where the lank lord, incircled in the throng,</p>
            <p>Shews his white teeth, and hums a fav’rite song;</p>
            <p>Who, spite of season, crowds it to the play,			285</p>
            <p>Wrapp’d in six waistcoats—<emph>in the month of May</emph>;</p>
            <p>Who, just at noon, has strength to rise from bed,</p>
            <p>With empty pocket—and <emph>more empty head</emph>;</p>
            <p>Who, scarce recover’d from the courtly dance,</p>
            <p>Sees with disgust the vulgar day advance:			290</p>
            <p>Anticipates the wax-illumin’d night,</p>
            <p>Cassino’s charms, and Faro’s proud delight!</p>
            <p>Who hates the broad intolerable sun,</p>
            <p>That points his door to every gaping <emph>dun</emph>;</p>
            <p>Who saunters all the morn, and reads the news,		295</p>
            <p>’Midst clouds of odours and <emph>Olympian dews</emph>;</p>
            <p>Till three o’clock proclaims the time to meet</p>
            <p>On the throng’d pavement of St. James’s street;</p>
            <p>Where various shops on various follies thrive,</p>
            <p>‘Beaux, banish beaux—and coaches, coaches drive:’	300</p>
            <p>While to Hyde Park this titled tribe are flocking,</p>

            <p>From Man, and from the busy day.</p>
            <p>Mark how his lip is fever’d o’er,			5</p>

            <p>Now watch the varying gesture, wild,</p>
            <p>See how his tortur’d bosom heaves!		10</p>
            <p>Behold, Misfortune’s wayward child,</p>
            <p>For whom no kindred Nature grieves!</p>
            <p>Despis’d, suspected, ruin’d, lost!</p>

            <p>On mis’ry’s stormy ocean tost,			15	</p>
            <p>Condemn’d to curse his fate, and curse <emph>alone</emph>!</p>
            <p>Once, were his prospects bright and gay,</p>
            <p>And Independence blest his hours:</p>
            <p>
               <emph>His</emph> was the smooth and sunny way,</p>
            <p>Where tip-toe Pleasure scatter’d flow’rs.		20</p>
            <p>Love bound his brow with thornless sweets,</p>
            <p>And smiling Friendship fill’d his cup of joy;</p>
            <p>
               <emph>Now</emph>, not a Friend the victim meets,</p>
            <p>For, like a Wolf, he wanders to destroy.</p>
            <p>All day, upon a couch of thorn,			25</p>
            <p>His weary, fev’rish limbs recline;</p>
            <p>All night, distracted and forlorn,</p>
            <p>He hovers round the fateful shrine!</p>
            <p>Eager to seize, with grasping hands,</p>
            <p>The slender pittance of the easy Fool;		30</p>
            <p>He links himself with caitiff bands,</p>
            <p>And learns the lesson of the Gamester’s school!</p>
            <p>One-hour, elate with ill-got gold,</p>
            <p>And dazzled by the shining ore,			</p>
            <p>In plenitude of joys, behold				35</p>
            <p>The Prodigal display his store!</p>
            <p>The next, in poverty and fear,</p>
            <p>He hides him, trembling at approaching fate,</p>
            <p>While greedy Creditors appear,</p>
            <p>And with remorseless rage lurk round his gate.	40</p>
            <p>Then comes the horror-breeding hour!</p>
            <p>While recreant Suicide attends;</p>
            <p>Or Madness, with impetuous pow’r,</p>
            <p>The scene of desolation ends!</p>
            <p>Upon his grave no parent mourns,			45</p>
            <p>No widow’d Love laments with graceful woe;</p>
            <p>No dawn of joy for <emph>him</emph> returns—</p>
            <p>For Heav’n denies that peace, his frenzy lost below!</p>

                                <quote>I never saw her look so handsome; her Eyes, methought, never were before so piercing, never did they before inspire me with such violent Desires . . . Have I indulg’d that dearest Hope my Heart had fixt upon her budding Beauties? . . . have I fondled her to be my own, as I imagin’d, for a young Fool, whom she’s in love with, to come and run away with her before my Face, and that, even when she’s half marry’d to me? No, before <emph>George</emph>, my foolish young Friend; . . . I shall render all your Hopes abortive, and you’ll find no cause to laugh at me” (IV.I. p. 95, 97). </quote>
                              <title level="m">The School for Wives</title> also features Arnolph’s <title level="m">The Maxims of Marriage</title>, a conduct book that contains the following precept: “<emph>Every Woman that would preserve her Honour, ought to refrain from Gaming as a terrible thing; for Play is very bewitching, and often drives a Woman to venture all she has</emph>” (75). Brewer suggests, alternatively, that “budding beauties” alludes to Simon Berington’s fictional travel narrative <title level="m">The Memoirs of Sig<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Gaudentio di Lucca</title> (London: T. Cooper, 1737), which contains an account of Gaudentio’s love for a young African girl: “My choice was soon determin’d: the first Time I saw the incomparable <emph>Isiphena</emph>, the Regent’s Daughter, tho’ she was then but ten Years old, ten Thousand budding Beauties appear’d in her”; see Brewer (8: 276n). In both instances, the men speak of young women—an eighteen-year-old (Molière) and a ten-year-old (Berington); clearly, as Brewer points out, the widow Lady Languid’s beauty is not in a similarly “budding” state.</note> You’ll come to our wedding[.] Mean to have it in Stile – Drolle Business.</p>

                              <emph>Midsummer Eve . . . was falsehearted</emph>: Midsummer’s Eve, also known as St. John’s Eve (the evening prior to the Feast of St. John the Baptist), is a holiday honoring the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and, in the Catholic religion, the nativity of St. John. In much of Britain, it was customary to light bonfires and celebrate with drink and food, including sweetmeats and fruit. Maidens, in particular, often engaged in superstitious practices either to gain a glimpse of their future sweetheart or to determine the faithfulness of their current love interest. William Hone in his <title level="m">Every-day Book</title> (1827) for 24 June notes that in “One of the ‘Cheap Repository Tracts,’ entitled, ‘Tawney Rachel, or the Fortune-Teller,’ said to have been written by Miss Hannah More, relates, among other superstitious practices of Sally Evans, that ‘she would never go to bed <emph>on Midsummer eve</emph>, without sticking up in her room the well-known plant called <emph>Midsummer Men</emph>, as the bending of the leaves to the right, or to the left, would never fail to tell her whether her lover was true or false’”; see William Hone, <title level="m">The Every-day Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements</title>, 2 vols. (London: Published for William Hone, 1827), I: 850. Nelly states that she played the jaw harp in a transept or a side chapel of the church in order to make the sexton believe that his deceased sweetheart was haunting him on Midsummer Eve because he had not been true or, in other words, because he had been unfaithful or “falsehearted.” </note>

Rather than interpreting Nelly’s “a” for “he,” she interprets the pronoun “a” as “it,” which comically attributes falseheartedness to the “Porch” rather than to the sexton. </note>

                              <emph>Ould Scratch</emph> . . . <emph>Doctor Foster</emph>: Old Scratch is a term for the devil; Doctor Foster is Nelly’s amusing misnomer for Dr. Faustus, the German astronomer who, according to legend, sold his soul to the devil and who had been the subject of a drama by Christopher Marlowe. Nelly seems to indicate that if she had not played the joke on the sexton (i.e. made him believe that his deceased sweetheart was haunting him), he would have remained unrepentant, and the devil would have taken the sexton to hell just as he did Faustus.</note> Oh!</p>

                              <emph>Seven Senses</emph>: The Apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus identifies seven senses: “The Lord created man; and they received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof” (King James Version 17:5). Brewer cites the following explanation: “According to ancient teaching, the soul of man or his ‘inward holy body’ was compounded of the seven properties which were under the influence of seven planets. Fire, animated; earth gave the sense of feeling; water, speech; air, taste; mist gave sight; flowers, hearing; and the south wind, smelling. Hence the seven senses were—animation, feeling, speech, taste, sight, hearing, smelling” (W. Chambers and R. Chambers, <title level="a">The Origin of Some Slang Phrases,</title> in <title level="j">Chambers’s Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts</title> [London and Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1878], 87); see Brewer 277n.</note>

                              <emph>amusements in Camp</emph>: Military camps during the eighteenth century were occupied by both men and women. As Gillian Russell observes, wives accompanied their soldiering husbands, and women, in general, from daughters to cooks, nurses, laundresses, seamstresses, and prostitutes, participated in camp life. Due to the casual intermixture of men and women, camps became equated with “sexual license. . . . Sex, it seems was everywhere. ‘Half the girls in the country will get husbands by Coxheath-camp,’ declared the <title level="j">Morning Chronicle</title>, while . . . prostitutes in general were admitted behind the lines”; see Russell, <title level="m">The Theatres of War: Performance, Politics, and Society, 1793-1815</title> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), 39. In her poem, <title level="a">The Camp</title> (1800), Mary Robinson captures the atmosphere of a military camp in what Daniel Robinson calls a “satirical montage of sights and sounds of an assembly of soldiers and an attendant entourage where the fashionable and the military, the opulent and the vulgar, and, most of all, the sexual . . . become jarringly confused” (Daniel Robinson, <title level="m">The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame</title> [New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011], 30):

When Lady Rouleau says that Lord Rouleau has “lost an Eye,” she may be suggesting merely that he has lost sight in one eye (see “lose an eye,” <title level="m">OED</title>). “Lost his head” denotes beheading and, by association, the guillotine, which was first used in France on 25 April 1792 and which became a symbol of the “Reign of Terror” (the period from 1793 to 1794), during which the Revolutionary Tribunal sanctioned execution on a mass scale. By linking “the pleasure of martial maneuvres” (see note 84) with the discussion of her husband’s body, Lady Rouleau also suggests a link between her husband’s military vigor and his sexual appeal.</note> – He has lost an Eye, and it wou’d give me great Pleasure if he lost his Head in the Service of his Country!

For “quiz,” see note 29. “Scipio” refers to Scipio Aemilianus Africanus (c.185-129 BCE), politician and general of the Roman Republic whose army destroyed Carthage in 146 BCE. He was the grandson (by adoption) of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and was a wealthy patron of the arts and sciences, renowned for founding the Scipionic Circle, a Roman intellectual group, consisting of philosophers, historians, poets, and other scholars. He is also remembered as a stern censor, a position he held in 142 BCE, during which time he served as supervisor of public morality and attempted to curb dissipation and corruption. He is the principal speaker in Cicero’s <title level="m">De re publica</title> (c.54-61 BCE), the sixth book of which—entitled <title level="m">Somnium Scipionis</title> (<title level="m">The Dream of Scipio</title>)—depicts him as a man of intellect and virtue. It is a text that, among other things, influenced Dante Alighieri’s the <title level="m">Divine Comedy</title> (1308-1321) and inspired Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s <title level="m">Il sogno di Scipione </title>(K. 126) (1772). The Tomb of the Scipios in Rome was rediscovered in 1780, and images of the tomb were published in Rome in 1785 by Francesco Piranesi in <title level="m">Monumenti degli Scipioni</title>, a work begun by his father Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Salmagundi, in this context, means “mixture.”</note> – Pray, Sir Henry, tell us <hi rendition="#underline">what</hi> you are?</p>

As <title level="j">The Morning Post</title>’s footnotes to the Prologue and Epilogue indicate, lines in both of them were omitted on the second night’s representation, the Prologue due to concerns over length and the Epilogue due to Dorothy Jordan’s inability to speak them (<ref target="context_newspaper.html">see “Contexts” section of this edition</ref>). The Prologue was also published on 3 December 1794 in <title level="j">The Sun</title> and in <title level="j">The True Briton</title>, with additional variations. The Prologue and Epilogue were also published together in the 2 December to 4 December 1794 edition of <title level="j">The Whitehall Evening Post</title>.

                              <emph>budding Beauties</emph>: A possible allusion to Molière’s comedic play <title level="m">The School for Wives</title> (<foreign>L’école des femmes</foreign>, 1662; London: Printed for John Watts, 1732) in which Arnolph, much like Sharply, decides to compete with another man in order to win over the object of his affection: 
                                <quote>I never saw her look so handsome; her Eyes, methought, never were before so piercing, never did they before inspire me with such violent Desires . . . Have I indulg’d that dearest Hope my Heart had fixt upon her budding Beauties? . . . have I fondled her to be my own, as I imagin’d, for a young Fool, whom she’s in love with, to come and run away with her before my Face, and that, even when she’s half marry’d to me? No, before <emph>George</emph>, my foolish young Friend; . . . I shall render all your Hopes abortive, and you’ll find no cause to laugh at me” (IV.I. p. 95, 97). </quote>
                              <title level="m">The School for Wives</title> also features Arnolph’s <title level="m">The Maxims of Marriage</title>, a conduct book that, among others, features the following precept: “<emph>Every Woman that would preserve her Honour, ought to refrain from Gaming as a terrible thing; for Play is very bewitching, and often drives a Woman to venture all she has</emph>” (75). Brewer and Setzer suggest, alternatively, that “budding beauties” alludes to Simon Berington’s fictional travel narrative <title level="m">The Memoirs of Sig<hi rendition="#sup">r</hi> Gaudentio di Lucca</title> (London: T. Cooper, 1737), which contains an account of Gaudentio’s love for a young African girl: “My choice was soon determin’d: the first Time I saw the incomparable <emph>Isiphena</emph>, the Regent’s Daughter, tho’ she was then but ten Years old, ten Thousand budding Beauties appear’d in her”; see Brewer and Setzer (8: 276n). In both instances, the men speak of young women—an eighteen-year-old (Molière) and a ten-year-old (Berington); clearly, as Brewer and Setzer suggest, the widow Lady Languid’s beauty is not in a similarly “budding” state.</note> You’ll come to our wedding[.] Mean to have it in Stile – Drolle Business.</p>

                              <emph>Midsummer Eve . . . was falsehearted</emph>: Midsummer’s Eve, also known as St. John’s Eve (the evening prior to the Feast of St. John the Baptist), is a holiday honoring the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and, in the Catholic religion, the nativity of St. John. In much of Britain, it was customary to light bonfires and celebrate with drink and food, including sweetmeats and fruit. Maidens, in particular, often engaged in superstitious practices either to gain a glimpse of their future sweetheart or to determine the faithfulness of their current love interest. William Hone in his <title level="m">Every-day Book</title> (1827) for 24 June notes that in “One of the ‘Cheap Repository Tracts,’ entitled, ‘Tawney Rachel, or the Fortune-Teller,’ said to have been written by Miss Hannah More, relates, among other superstitious practices of Sally Evans, that ‘she would never go to bed <emph>on Midsummer eve</emph>, without sticking up in her room the well-known plant called <emph>Midsummer Men</emph>, as the bending of the leaves to the right, or to the left, would never fail to tell her whether her lover was true or false’”; see William Hone, <title level="m">The Every-day Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements</title>, 2 vols. (London: Published for William Hone, 1827), I: 850. Nelly states that she played the jaw harp in a transept or a side chapel of the church in order to make the sexton believe that his deceased sweetheart was haunting him on Midsummer Eve because he had not been true or, in other words, because he had been unfaithful or “falsehearted.” </note>

                              <emph>How cou’d the Porch be falsehearted, Child?</emph>: The joke here is in Lady Languid’s translation of the final phrase of Nelly’s last sentence. Rather than interpreting Nelly’s “a” for “he,” she interprets the pronoun “a” as “it,” which comically attributes falseheartedness to the “Porch” rather than to the sexton. </note>

Nelly seems to indicate that if she had not played the joke on the sexton (i.e. made him believe that his deceased sweetheart was haunting him), he would have remained unrepentant, and the devil would have taken the sexton to hell just as he did Faustus.</note> Oh!</p>

                              <emph>Seven Senses</emph>: The Apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus identifies seven senses: “The Lord created man; and they received the use of the five operations of the Lord, and in the sixth place he imparted them understanding, and in the seventh speech, an interpreter of the cogitations thereof” (King James Version 17:5). Brewer and Setzer cite the following explanation: “According to ancient teaching, the soul of man or his ‘inward holy body’ was compounded of the seven properties which were under the influence of seven planets. Fire, animated; earth gave the sense of feeling; water, speech; air, taste; mist gave sight; flowers, hearing; and the south wind, smelling. Hence the seven senses were—animation, feeling, speech, taste, sight, hearing, smelling” (W. Chambers and R. Chambers, <title level="a">The Origin of Some Slang Phrases,</title> in <title level="j">Chambers’s Journal of Popular Literature, Science and Arts</title> [London and Edinburgh: W. &amp; R. Chambers, 1878], 87.); see Brewer and Setzer (277n).</note>

                              <emph>amusements in Camp</emph>: Military camps during the eighteenth century were occupied by both men and women. As Gillian Russell observes, wives accompanied their soldiering husbands, and women, in general, from daughters to cooks, nurses, laundresses, seamstresses, and prostitutes, participated in camp life. Due to the casual intermixture of men and women, camps became equated with “sexual license. . . . Sex, it seems was everywhere. ‘Half the girls in the country will get husbands by Coxheath-camp,’ declared the <title level="j">Morning Chronicle</title>, while . . . prostitutes in general were admitted behind the lines”; see Russell, <title level="m">The Theatres of War: Performance, Politics, and Society, 1793-1815</title> (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), 39. In her poem, <title level="a">The Camp</title> (1800), Mary Robinson captures the atmosphere of a military camp in what Daniel Robinson calls a “satirical montage of sights and sounds of an assembly of soldiers and an attendant entourage where the fashionable and the military, the opulent and the vulgar, and, most of all, the sexual . . . become jarringly confused” (Daniel Robinson, <title level="m">The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame</title> [New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011], 30):

When Lady Rouleau says that Lord Rouleau has “lost an Eye,” she may be suggesting merely that he has lost sight in one eye (see “lose an eye,” <title level="m">OED</title>). “Lost his head” denotes beheading and, by association, the guillotine, which was first used in France on 25 April 1792 and which became a symbol of the “Reign of Terror” (the period from 1793 to 1794), during which the Revolutionary Tribunal sanctioned execution on a mass scale. By linking “the pleasure of martial maneuvres” (see note 84) with the discussion of her husband’s body, Lady Rouleau also suggests a link between her husband’s military vigor and his sexual appeal.</note> – He has lost an Eye, and it wou’d give me great Pleasure if he lost his Head in the Service of his Country!

Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s play, <title level="m">The Glorious First of June</title>, debuted at Drury Lane the following month on 2 July 1794.

About two months before the play’s debut, the 6 October 1794 edition of the <title level="j">Morning Post and Fashionable World</title> commented, “A Turban, and single White Feather, is the simple head dress worn by our <foreign>Belles</foreign>. Equality seems the motto of the most dashing Fair, as they still appear as <title level="m">Nobody</title>” (3). Robinson, herself, had been recognized in 1782 for setting the fashion with her own version of a “white chemise with <emph>No Waist</emph>”, otherwise known as the “Perdita chemise.” For more on Robinson’s famous chemise, see Paula Byrne, <title level="m">Perdita: The Life of Mary Robinson</title> (London: Harper Perennial, 2005), 203-06, 331.</note>}</stage>

                              <emph>Anchoret</emph> . . . <emph>Quiz</emph> . . . <emph>Scipio</emph> . . . <emph>Salmagundi</emph>: An “anchorite” is a religious recluse or hermit. For “quiz,” see note 29. “Scipio” refers to Scipio Aemilianus Africanus (c.185-129 BCE), politician and general of the Roman Republic whose army destroyed Carthage in 146 BCE. He was the grandson (by adoption) of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and was a wealthy patron of the arts and sciences, renowned for founding the Scipionic Circle, a Roman intellectual group, consisting of philosophers, historians, poets, and other scholars. He is also remembered as a stern censor, a position he held in 142 BCE, during which time he served as supervisor of public morality and attempted to curb dissipation and corruption. He is the principal speaker in Cicero’s <title level="m">De re publica</title> (c.54-61 BCE), the sixth book of which—entitled <title level="m">Somnium Scipionis</title> (<title level="m">The Dream of Scipio</title>)—depicts him as a man of intellect and virtue. It is a text that, among other things, influenced Dante Alighieri’s the <title level="m">Divine Comedy</title> (1308-1321) and inspired Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s <title level="m">Il sogno di Scipione </title>(K. 126) (1772). The Tomb of the Scipios in Rome was rediscovered in 1780, and images of the tomb were published in Rome in 1785 by Francesco Piranesi in <title level="m">Monumenti degli Scipioni</title>, a work begun by his father Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Salmagundi, in this context, means “mixture.”</note> – Pray, Sir Henry, tell us <hi rendition="#underline">what</hi> you are?</p>
