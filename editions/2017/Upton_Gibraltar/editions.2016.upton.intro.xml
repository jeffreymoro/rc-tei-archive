                    <p>Biographical information about Catherine Upton is scarce. Her maiden name may
                        have been Creswell; her brother Samuel Creswell was a tory who died in 1786
                        of a cold. Her husband, John Upton, was a lieutenant in the 72nd or Manchester Regiment.<note place="foot"
                            resp="editors" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"> This
                                biographical information comes from
                                <title level="m">Collections toward the History of Printing
                                    in Nottinghamshire </title>by
                                a Reverend S.F. Creswell (1863), ostensibly a history of typography
                                but which digresses into family history, miscellaneous information
                                about Nottinghamshire, lists of books and sermons, etc.</note> She was also a teacher; the title page of
                        <title level="m">Miscellaneous Pieces </title>identifies
                        her as “Governess of the ladies Academy, No. 43, Bartholomew Close.” She
                        may have been a widow; as Stephen Behrendt points out, “That she was by 1784
                        employed as a governess in a girls’ school suggests that he did not survive
                        the siege” (308n10); that she writes in publication, as she explains in the
                        preface to <title level="m">Miscellaneous Pieces</title>, with “a view to
                        support my children” further corroborates that suggestion. The two brief
                        volumes reproduced here form nearly all of what we know, or can conjecture,
                        about Upton.</p>
                    <p><title level="m">The Siege of Gibraltar</title> takes the form of a letter
                        addressed to Upton’s brother in England while she lived in Gibraltar with
                        her soldier husband and their children. The narrative describes her
                        experiences over about six weeks during the Great Siege of Gibraltar.
                        Gibraltar, long a point of contention between Spain and Great Britain, was
                        the site of fourteen sieges between the early fourteenth century and the
                        late eighteenth century. The final one, also known as the Great Siege, was
                        also the longest, lasting from 1779 to 1783. Spain attempted to claim the
                        territory three times over the course of the eighteenth century. Historians
                        Chris Gocott and Gareth Stockey explain the significance of the last siege
                        to Gibraltar’s place in the British cultural imaginary: <quote>[E]ach
                            attempt strengthened British resolve to retain it. In particular, the
                            last of these attempts—the Great Siege—appeared to solidify once and for
                            all Gibraltar’s place in the British public imagination. By this stage,
                            the fortress had acquired a reputation for defensibility, but it was the
                            events of the Great Siege, and subsequent presentation of that siege in
                            countless books and pamphlets, that cemented Gibraltar’s reputation as
                            “impregnable fortress.” (23)</quote> Gibraltar functioned as a symbol of
                        Britain’s power and strength, and much literature of the time circulated
                        such an image; Upton’s work is no exception. Generally speaking, it seems
                        that “the public,” as judged from popular publications, rallied around
                        British takeover of the area. Accordingly, Upton’s two poems about Gibraltar
                        paint Spain as a proud but erroneous force, which is defeated by the morally
                        just Britain. In the poem that concludes her epistolary account, “proud
                        Iberia” has sent “Her crafty sons [who] strain every Nerve to gain / Their
                        antient Rock, but all their <emph>Works are vain</emph>” (ll. 11-12). Spain
                        tries its best to regain Gibraltar—which Upton’s choice of pronoun here
                        suggests is its possession after all—but ultimately Britain’s moral
                        authority sanctions its military force. In other words, no matter
                        Gibraltar’s “true” owner, it is Britain’s right to take it, and Spain’s
                        defeat is inevitable. To underline this point, late in the poem Upton urges
                        soldiers to “Make haughty Spain submit to British laws” (l. 22). For Upton,
                        a British victory in Gibraltar means, not just taking possession of a piece
                        of land, but, more important, compelling a vainglorious nation to recognize
                        the indisputable glory of British rule. While “The Siege of Gibraltar”
                        continues in the same vein, deploying many of the same adjectives to
                        describe Gibraltar, the poem focuses to a greater extent on the experience
                        of the soldiers. Upton chastises those comfortable at home: <quote><lg>
                            <l>Ye sons of Britain, safe within your ports,</l>
                            <l>Immers’d in pleasure, luxury, and sports;</l>
                            <l>Small your ideas of the soldier’s toils,</l>
                            <l>Who fights your causes in all climes and soils;</l>
                            <l>Patient in dangers; firm, tho’ in want of food,</l>
                            <l>And only anxious for his country’s good.</l>
                            <l>These! These! Britannia! are thy sure support. (ll. 80-86)</l>
                        </lg></quote> Upton seeks to draw attention to those (like her husband) who actually
                        risk their lives in support of this invincible fortress—for, after all, if
                        Gibraltar is in fact invincible it is due to the efforts of soldiers
                        stationed there. Britain has a rightful claim to the land, she implies, but
                        it is British soldiers who must physically carry out that claim. Upton
                        further calls on her fellow citizens never to turn away from a veteran “but
                        his wants supply” (l. 93). Upton’s position as a soldier’s wife makes her
                        perspective understandable; but she also emphasizes the important point that
                        the actual day-to-day events of war are carried out by individual soldiers,
                        who, furthermore, do not disappear once the battle is over.</p>
                    <p>The prose account itself pays even greater attention to the day-to-day
                        experiences of both soldiers and their families. From the very beginning,
                        Upton foregrounds her and her family’s suffering, writing, “Heat and cold in
                        extreme, hunger and thrift I bore with some degree of firmness; but since
                        the haughty sons of Iberia have poured their shot and shells with
                        unremitting fury into Gibraltar, I have been an unhappy object indeed.” As
                        the account continues, Upton details their hunger and thrift. Indeed,
                        perhaps one of this work’s most significant features is its economic detail.
                        Upton notes the prices of food, including meat and eggs, as well as tea,
                        soap, and more. Upton can only purchase for her family inferior candles that
                        won’t even burn for an hour, biscuits full of maggots, watered-down goat’s
                        milk, and the like. In this way Upton provides a specific account of the
                        lived experience of a soldier’s family in wartime. She also contributes to a
                        notable trend in late-eighteenth-century women’s writing: a focus on money.
                        The “consumer agenda of women’s fiction” (1) is the subject of Edward
                        Copeland’s <title level="m">Women Writing about Money: Women's Fiction in
                            England, 1790-1820</title> (1995). He writes, “Women found themselves
                        vulnerable as economic beings, as authors now regularly noted in their
                        novels that featured heroines with specifically economic lives: heroines
                        barred from the possession of land (the period’s single most important
                        source of capital), or heroines with fixed incomes, usually in trusts,
                        annuities, and stocks” (17). Upton’s works appeared just before the period
                        Copeland examines, and, although she did not write fiction, Copeland’s book
                        demonstrates that money was a significant concern for women writers of all
                        stripes, who frequently placed the subject at the center of their literary
                        output. When Upton details her financial troubles, then, she joins a
                        tradition of women whose own precarious economic statuses informed and
                        shaped the work they produced.</p>
                    <p>Upton follows another trend in women’s writing of the period: she deploys
                        various strategies to preempt potential criticism. In the preface to <title
                            level="m">The Siege of Gibraltar</title>, Upton addresses the
                        unfavorable reception of her poem of the same name, chalking it up to
                        sexism. If her versification is bad, she tells us, she has joined the
                        company of Dryden and Pope, whose flaws, as men, are routinely forgiven. But
                        she also preemptively defends more specific criticisms of this new work: she
                        writes that she not only has “but little time to write, or [to]
                        <emph>correct </emph>what I write,” but that she writes
                        exclusively “with a view to <emph>support my children</emph>, not to extend
                        my own fame.” These are strategies similar to those of many women
                        contemporaries. Charlotte Smith, for instance, discussed in the preface to
                        <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets </title>her financial
                        troubles and her need to support her children. Stephen Behrendt explains,
                        “Women writers knew what they were doing when they launched preemptive
                        strikes to forestall critical churlishness by pleading everything from lack
                        of educational refinement to straitened economic circumstances to sheer lack
                        of time for ‘polishing.’ Upton herself offers a good illustration” (88). But
                        many of these women also wrote novels, which were generally more profitable
                        than poetry, if less well-regarded within British literary culture.
                        Charlotte Smith perhaps most famously “sold her sorrows,” but although her
                            <title level="m">Elegiac Sonnets</title> (published in 1784, the same
                        year as Upton’s <title level="m">Miscellanies</title>) “generated both cash
                        and reputation for Smith,” she “wrote poetry to uphold her sense of self and
                        to pursue the individuality her culture withheld from the married woman, she
                        wrote novels and other prose works to bring in the money necessary to
                        support her children” (Labbe 12). Smith is a good example here because she
                        illustrates a crucial point: poetry was a matter of artistic validation for
                        Smith, and novels her principal moneymaker. Upton’s strategy is rather more
                        blurred (and this is so partly, and quite simply, because we know so little
                        about Upton). While she is careful to point out the gendered prejudices of
                        literary criticism, she also asserts that she sought publication only as a
                        means of earning income for her children, not as a matter of personal
                        artistic expression. </p>
                    <p>In her poetry, her addresses to the muse continually deflect her own status
                        as a writer. “The Siege of Gibraltar” begins with an address to the muse, as
                        in an epic of war: “My Muse awake, and sing that awful day, / When Spain
                        determin’d with tyrannic sway / To crush this rock!” (ll. 1-3). Unlike in,
                        for example, the <title level="m">Aeneid</title> (“I sing of arms and the
                        man”), Upton does not invoke a muse to aid her own performance, however, but
                        instead presents herself as recorder or vehicle of the muse’s performance,
                        in recording a part of history that emphasizes Britain’s strength.
                        Throughout the poem, she continues to remind us of the Muse’s presence. In
                        the second stanza, Upton urges the muse to proceed, and in the last, asks
                        General Boyd, the book’s dedicatee, to “permit my artless muse / To speak
                        thy worth” (ll. 99-100). Upton even couches emotional response in terms of
                        the muse’s feelings: “Permit the Muse to drop a grateful tear,” she
                        implores, for the potential failure of two leaders’ military careers (l.
                        75). This may be an authorial strategy to anticipate accusations of
                        sentimentality. Upton’s obscuring of herself in this way aligns with the
                        book’s preface, in which she likewise deflects criticism by insisting that
                        she only published for essential money, not for literary fame. The range of
                        literary references in both of her books, though, testify to her education,
                        specifically to her knowledge of great poetry—she mentions classical authors
                        such as Ovid and Homer in addition to English poets including Milton, Pope,
                        and Prior.</p>
                    <p>The poem that follows “The Siege of Gibraltar,” “Wrote at Gibraltar . . .”
                        (the same one included at the end of her previous book, with minor edits),
                        changes tack. Upton writes, “For once Æolus hear a female Muse, / And be
                        propitious—when a Woman sues” (ll. 1-2). Now she herself may be the muse,
                        but she nevertheless appeals to a god, the ruler of the winds; her poem
                        serves the practical purpose of seeking assistance. Many other poems in
                            <title level="m">Miscellaneous Pieces </title>function as “useful”
                        literature, deflecting criticism by their very nature. Following the poems
                        about Gibraltar are several verse epistles to her friends and family; an
                        epitaph; instructional dialogues; and brief prose reflections on love and
                        marriage and on education—the volume is truly a miscellany. The most unusual
                        and amusing piece is entitled simply “Intended for the Lady’s Magazine.” It
                        recounts a dream Upton had in which she becomes wealthy, travels to
                        Laputa—one of the lands to which Gulliver traveled—ingratiates herself with
                        the people by distributing her money to those in need, and finally incurs
                        the ire of the greedy king, who wants to claim all her money for himself.
                        The aim is didactic; Upton emphasizes the value of humility and the dangers
                        of wealth. Nearly every piece in the collection could be said, like this
                        one, to have either a didactic or a practical function: it instructs the
                        reader or serves as an address to mark some occasion; Upton's strategy
                        appears to be to disarm criticism of her works by presenting them as
                        practical compositions, not as studied works of art.</p>
                    <p>As it turns out, Upton seems to have avoided negative criticism of
                        <title level="m">Miscellaneous Pieces. </title>Contemporary
                        criticism of the volume is rather scarce, but it seems to take her
                        introduction at face value, evincing a patronizing tone to her and her work.
                        Volume 4 of
                        <title level="j">The English Review </title>(1784)
                        delivers an ambivalent verdict: <quote>Though there be nothing in this
                            collection that tends to impress us with a high opinion of the writer’s
                            poetical talents; yet it exhibits the picture of a chearful and placid
                            temper, a competent share of discernment upon common subjects, and such
                            a portion of tenderness and humanity, as may probably render Mrs. Upton
                            extremely respectable in the path of life she has chalked out for
                            herself.” (467)</quote> Volume 73 of
                        <title level="j">The Monthly Review </title>(1785)
                        contains a brief entry on the work, similar in tone: “These pieces, as the
                        Authoress ingenuously confesses, are sent into the world ‘to support her
                        children, not to extend her fame.’ We heartily wish her publication all
                        imaginable success, which no criticism of ours shall obstruct” (237). Both
                        of these reviews indicate that Upton is a competent poet; they essentially
                        wish her well and, having done so, dismiss her.</p>
                    <p> Modern literary criticism of Upton is nearly nonexistent; what does exist
                        mostly amounts to entries in biographical dictionaries. A notable exception
                        is Stephen Behrendt’s <title level="m">British Women Poets and the Romantic
                            Writing Community</title> (2009), which includes a discussion of “The
                        Siege of Gibraltar” in a chapter on women's writing about war. In <title
                            level="m">A Dictionary of British and American Women Writers
                            1660-1800</title> (1985) Janet Todd notes the “pedestrian verse” of “The
                        Siege of Gibraltar,” though she also identifies a verse letter addressed to
                        Upton’s father as “engaging.” Upton’s entry in Virginia Blain, Isobel
                        Grundy, and Patricia Clements’s <title level="m">The Feminist Companion to
                            Literature in English </title>(1990) succinctly comments that Upton “is
                        better in informal than heroic poems.” If Upton’s versification may leave
                        something to be desired, as Upton anticipated, her small body of work
                        remains of interest. The importance of
                        <title level="m">The Siege of Gibraltar </title>lies in
                        its valuable, detailed insights into the economy—literal and figurative—of
                        war. As Paula Backscheider notes, “Few of us would read poetry as a means of
                        social advancement, as a source of news, or as mass entertainment, but
                        eighteenth-century people increasingly did. For example, miscellanies,
                        anthologies, and collections of poems rode the obsession with developing and
                        displaying taste” (36). Upton attempts to adopt just such a role—an arbiter
                        of taste, at least for a certain subset of people, particularly young
                        women—in <title level="m">Miscellaneous Pieces</title>, and in
                        <title level="m">The Siege of Gibraltar </title>she
                        attempts to shed light on the conditions of soldiers and their families in
                        wartime. For that reason Upton’s work deserves our continued attention: she
                        produced documents of war with an eye to social justice as well as socially
                        engaged pieces that reflect both the multitude of interests and ideas to
                        which eighteenth-century women writers were open, and the variety of work
                        they produced.</p>
