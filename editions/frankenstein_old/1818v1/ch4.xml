<item>
<p>IT was on a
dreary night of November, that I beheld the accomplishment of
my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the
instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless
thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the
rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was
nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished
light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it
breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
the wretch whom with such
infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were
in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!—Great God! His
yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries
beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth
of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more
horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the
same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his
shrivelled complexion, and straight black lips.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of
human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose
of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of
rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation;
but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled
my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed
out of the room, and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At
length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured; and I threw
myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of
forgetfulness. But it was in vain: I slept indeed, but I was disturbed by
the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health,
walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced
her; but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I
held the corpse of my dead mother in
my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling
in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth
chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow
light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window-shutters, I
beheld the wretch—the miserable
monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his
eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and
he muttered some inarticulate sounds,
while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not
hear; one hand was stretched out,
seemingly to detain me, but I
escaped, and rushed down stairs. I took refuge in the court-yard belonging
to the house which I inhabited; where I remained during the rest of the
night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening
attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the
approach of the demoniacal corpse
to which I had so miserably given life.
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I had
gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then; but when those muscles
and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even
Dante could not have conceived.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>
I passed the night wretchedly.
Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly, that I felt the palpitation
of every artery; at others, I nearly sank to the ground through languor
and extreme weakness. Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of
disappointment: dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long
a space, were now become a hell to me;
and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned, and discovered to my sleepless
and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which
indicated the sixth hour. The porter
opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I
issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to
avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present
to my view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but
felt impelled to hurry on, although wetted by the rain, which poured from
a black and comfortless sky.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring, by bodily
exercise, to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed the
streets, without any clear conception of where I was, or what I was doing.
My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear; and I hurried on with
irregular steps, not daring to look about me:
</p>
<lg>
<l>

Like one who, on a lonely road,<lb/>
   Doth walk in fear and dread,<lb/>
And, having once turn'd round, walks on,<lb/>
   And turns no more his head;<lb/>
Because he knows a frightful fiend<lb/>
   Doth close behind him tread.*</l>
</lg>
<p>Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;
but I remained some minutes with my
eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of
the street. As it drew nearer, I observed that it was the Swiss diligence: it stopped just where I was
standing; and, on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,
instantly sprung out. "My dear Frankenstein," exclaimed he, "how glad I am
to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my
alighting!"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought
back to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so
dear to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my
horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many
months, calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend therefore, in the most
cordial manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued
talking for some time about our mutual friends, and his own good fortune
in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt. "You may easily believe," said
he, "how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that it was not
absolutely necessary for a merchant
not to understand any thing except book-keeping; and, indeed, I believe I
left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied
entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch school-master in the Vicar of Wakefield: 'I have ten
thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.' But
his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he
has permitted me to undertake a voyage
of discovery to the land of knowledge."
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how
you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they
hear from you so seldom. By the bye, I mean to lecture you a
little upon their account myself.—But, my dear Frankenstein,"
continued he, stopping short, and gazing full in my face, "I did
not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you
look as if you had been watching for several nights."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one
 occupation, that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see:
 but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
 end, and that I am at length
 free."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to
 allude to the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a quick
 pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and the thought
 made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might
 still be there, alive, and walking
 about. I dreaded to behold this monster; but I feared still more
 that Henry should see him. Entreating him therefore to remain a few
 minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My
 hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I
 then paused; and a cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly
 open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
 waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped
 fearfully in: the apartment was empty; and my bed-room was also freed from
 its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good-fortune
 could have befallen me; but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my
 hands for joy, and ran down to Clerval.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but
 I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of
 sensitiveness, and my pulse beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a
 single instant in the same place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my
 hands, and laughed aloud. Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits
 to joy on his arrival; but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a
 wildness in my eyes for which he
 could not account; and my loud, unrestrained, heartless laughter, frightened and
 astonished him.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>My dear Victor," cried he, "what, for God's sake, is the
matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the
cause of all this?"</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Do not ask me," cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I
saw the dreaded spectre glide into
the room; "he can tell. —Oh, save me! save me!" I imagined that
the
monster seized me; I struggled
furiously, and fell down in a fit.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Poor Clerval! what must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he
anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I was
not the witness of his grief; for I was lifeless, and did not recover my
senses for a long, long time.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>This was the commencement of a nervous
fever, which confined me for several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I afterwards
learned that, knowing my father's advanced age, and unfitness for so long a journey, and
how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief
by concealing the extent of my disorder. He knew that I could not have a
more kind and attentive nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt
of my recovery, he did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the
kindest action that he could towards them.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>But I was in reality very ill; and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life. The form of the
monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes, and
I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my words surprised Henry: he
at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination; but the
pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject
persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and
terrible event.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved
my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became capable of observing outward objects
with any kind of pleasure, I perceived that the fallen leaves had
disappeared, and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees
that shaded my window. It was a divine
spring; and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence. I felt
also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom
disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was
attacked by the fatal passion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Dearest Clerval," exclaimed I, "how kind, how very good you are to me.
This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised
yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I
feel the greatest remorse for the
disappointment of which I have been the occasion; but you will forgive
me."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"You will repay me entirely, if you do not discompose
yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear
in such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I
not?"
</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I trembled. One subject! what could it be? Could he allude to
an object on whom I dared not even
think?</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Compose yourself," said Clerval, who observed my change of colour, "I
will not mention it, if it agitates you; but your father and cousin would
be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting.
They hardly know how ill you have been, and are uneasy at your long silence."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Is that all? my dear Henry. How could you suppose that my first thought would not fly towards
those dear, dear friends whom I love, and who are so deserving of my
love."<lb/> "If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be
glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you: it is
from your cousin, I believe."</p>
