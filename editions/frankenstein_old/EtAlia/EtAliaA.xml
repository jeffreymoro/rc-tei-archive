						<p rend="emph">Alexander Anderson (from A Song of Labour [1873])</p>
						<p> </p>
						<p>In my boyhood time long years ago,<lb/>    When life was half divine,<lb/> I read, with a horror you may not know,<lb/>
							   The story of Frankenstein— </p>
						<p> That student wild and deep who wrought<lb/>    Alone in his silent room,<lb/> Till the monster-man of his midnight
							thought<lb/>    Took shape in the ghostly gloom.</p>
						<p> Then when life woke up in each heavy limb,<lb/>    And the pulses began to play,<lb/> And its dull, blank eyes open'd up
							on him,<lb/>    He rush'd from his work away.</p>
						<p> But still through his life, when Hope held high<lb/>    Her cup full to the brim,<lb/> The demon whose life was his came
							by<lb/>    And dash'd the bliss from him.</p>
						<p>Ah! fearful story it was and seem'd<lb/>    To wear little purpose then;<lb/> But its deeper truths have upon me
							gleam'd<lb/>    Since I look'd as a man on men.</p>
						<p> For still in the hurry and fret of life,<lb/>    When I see the brow bent down,<lb/> And the hand stretch'd out for the
							straws of strife,<lb/>    Instead of the golden crown,</p>
						<p> Then I whisper—Here is one who moulds<lb/>    In his heart, and knows it not,<lb/> A monster that yet will burst its
							folds,<lb/>    And haunt him from spot to spot—</p>
						<p> Haunt him till life's frail powers grow weak,<lb/>    And the hopes we keep to cheer<lb/> Turn away from the deathlike
							brow and cheek,<lb/>    And come no more anear.</p>
						<p> Ah me! what wisdom this might teach,<lb/>    If we lent but our ear and will;<lb/> What inward things would rise up and
							preach,<lb/>    For our better guidance still!</p>
						<p> But this working world rolls on, and we shape<lb/>    All things but the high divine;<lb/> And still, far down in our
							heart, we ape<lb/>    The story of Frankenstein.</p>

						<term rend="bold">"City and Village"</term>
						<p rend="emph">Alexander Anderson (from Songs of the Rail [1878])</p>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Anderson likens sorrow to "the huge unshapen monster [who] glared in on pale Frankenstein."</p>
						<p>Once again within the city, 'mid its multitudinous din,<lb/>    Stand I, while, as sinks a leaf when left by the uncertain
							wind,<lb/> So the daily village quiet, and the calm I had within,<lb/>    Shrinks before the magic contact of the
							ever-shaping mind.</p>
						<p> In the village life is sluggish, waking up but for a space,<lb/>    As the engines shriek and whistle down by hill and
							wooded glen;<lb/> But here a mightier striving stamps itself upon my race—<lb/>    Here are all the active ages, and the
							tramp of busy men.</p>
						<p> Then away with daily labour, thoughts of books or weary rhyme,<lb/>    Let me plunge into this whirlpool rolling on in mad
							unrest—<lb/> Let me, Faust-like, have the weal of men in all the coming time,<lb/>    That its triumph may strike vigour
							through the soul within my breast.</p>
						<p> Hush! we spoke not of the sorrow that upon their joys will peer,<lb/>    As the huge unshapen monster glared in on pale
							Frankenstein,<lb/> Edging life's uncertain smile with all the drapery of a tear,<lb/>    And placing in the cup the drop
							that dulls and drugs the wine.</p>
						<p> But heed not this, and think that, in the rolling on of years,<lb/>    The slow whirlpool of sure change will lift this
							life still higher up,<lb/> Till it leave behind its apehood, and its daily load of fears,<lb/>    And drink existence
							gladly as if angels held the cup.</p>
						<p> Far apocalyptic touches that unveil the years to be,<lb/>    Show this in ecstatic glimpses, as when mists upon a
							hill<lb/> Lift their trailing arms of whiteness, till, as in a dream, we see<lb/>    A summer gush of glory lying hid
							behind them still.</p>
						<p> Is the pencil of broad Hogarth still to keep its biting truth,<lb/>    And for ever flash its satire on the world's
							sweat-blinded sight?<lb/> Are we still to stumble onward on a pathway all unsmooth,<lb/>    Like a Cyclops in his cavern
							smitten with the loss of light?</p>
						<p> Ay, the time will come, my brothers, though it lies behind far hope,<lb/>    Yet faint flashes rise up from it, like the
							northern lights we see;<lb/> Then, while all the ages come to widen out the mighty scope,<lb/>    Let us lap ourselves in
							dreams of what our fellow-men will be.</p>
						<p> Look not back with idle murmur lying fretting on thy lips,<lb/>    That which lies behind is but the crude world's shadow
							in dull light;<lb/> Look thou forward where the sunshine from a kindlier heaven slips,<lb/>    Cheering on thy kind to
							wider vantage-grounds for truth and right.</p>
						<p> The far ages bristling upward, waiting for their unborn men,<lb/>    Have in them the golden blossom of the seed we sow in
							fear;<lb/> Wider growths of thought and ripeness, nobler tasks for brain and pen,<lb/>    Fuller brotherhood in all that
							perfects us to manhood here.</p>
						<p> Heart! to see our future fellows standing on our present gain,<lb/>    Which we wrench'd from the stern centuries, and
							Samson-like made ours,<lb/> Shaping, with a larger forethought and a finer grasp of brain,<lb/>    Pathways to the purer
							use of life and all our human powers.</p>
						<p> Theirs shall be our slow improvement rising up to perfect bloom,<lb/>    Through the centuries niggard of it, like the
							aloe with its bud;<lb/> It shall bring new modes of thinking that shall all the old entomb,<lb/>    Building up a higher
							channel for the rushing on of good.</p>
						<p> For our fellows striving onward, though they wear the stain of toil,<lb/>    Ever yearn to shape out goals to which their
							better natures tend;<lb/> And their good within shoots upward, like a plant within the soil,<lb/>    To the higher,
							grander freedom, to the nobler godlike end.</p>
						<p> Then let change come striking outward, with soft touch or sudden shock,<lb/>    Let the years glide by, if we can feel
							that in the lapse of time,<lb/> As a leaping mountain torrent through decades can smooth the rock,<lb/>    We are growing
							better, wiser, surer of the foot to climb.</p>
						<p> For the struggle in the climbing will be hard and ill to bear;<lb/>    Each one, like the souls in Dante, wearing cloaks
							and hoods of lead;<lb/> But for ever as we struggle, with half breath to breathe a prayer,<lb/>    From above we hear the
							echo of another brother's tread.</p>
						<p> For the selfless souls amongst us, hearted with the heart of Christ,<lb/>    Ever turn and beckon onward that their
							strength may be our own;<lb/> And we hear their potent watchwords, which, if we could still resist,<lb/>    It were shame
							upon our foreheads burning to the very bone.</p>
						<p> All their lives and thoughts are with us, and the strong world's future weal<lb/>    Will be shaped by what they fought
							for, though it may be ere it form<lb/> (For it will not take their semblance as soft wax takes on the seal),<lb/>
							   Cycles may rise up, and set in cloudless calm or sudden storm.</p>
						<p> But it will be: higher comfort as we labour scarce can be;<lb/>    Mists may rise and wrap it from us, but the mighty
							darting sun<lb/> Will strike heat throughout the shadows till like phantom shapes they flee,<lb/>    Leaving all the good
							we strove for, and the better laurels won.</p>
						<p> Thanks, then, toiling, restless city, that my heart should leap and fill<lb/>    With such thoughts to help me onward in
							my own rough life and toil,<lb/> That I see through all this hurry one ennobling purpose still;<lb/>    Dim as yet, but
							growing brighter, like the mists that leave the soil.</p>
						<p> And that purpose still turns brighter at the touch on either hand<lb/>    Of my fellow-kind who, with me, hold the same
							high hope of this,<lb/> Each one sets it to that music reaching him where he may stand;<lb/>    But it still keeps ring
							and measure to the far-off coming bliss.</p>
						<p> Teach, then, poet, prophet, priest, with hands stretch'd out to that desire;<lb/>    Ring it forth to toiling men, and
							waft it over land and sea,<lb/> As the rugged Hebrew prophet, while his eyeballs swam in fire,<lb/>    Sent down through
							his vatic brotherhood the Christ that was to be.</p>
						<p> Far behind me lies the city, with its ebb and flow of men,<lb/>    But the thoughts that came within it are for ever in my
							breast;<lb/> And they leap up as the engines thunder down by hill and glen,<lb/>    Or in my walks at night-time when the
							village is at rest.</p>

						<term rend="bold">"The Engine"</term>
						<p rend="emph">Alexander Anderson (from Ballads and Sonnets [1879])</p>
						<p> </p>
						<p>Anderson likens the creation of the "fire engine" to that of "the monster of Frankenstein's." </p>
						<p>"On fire-horses and wind-horses we
							career."<lb/>                                                                                          —Carlyle.</p>
						<p>Hurrah! for the mighty engine,<lb/>    As he bounds along his track:<lb/> Hurrah, for the life that is in him,<lb/>    And
							his breath so thick and black.<lb/> And hurrah for our fellows, who in their need<lb/>    Could fashion a thing like
							him—<lb/> With a heart of fire, and a soul of steel,<lb/>    And a Samson in every limb. </p>
						<p> Ho! stand from that narrow path of his,<lb/>    Lest his gleaming muscles smite,<lb/> Like the flaming sword the archangel
							drew<lb/>    When Eden lay wrapp'd in night;<lb/> For he cares, not he, for a paltry life<lb/>    As he rushes along to
							the goal,<lb/> It but costs him a shake of his iron limb,<lb/>    And a shriek from his mighty soul.</p>
						<p> Yet I glory to think that I help to keep<lb/>    His footsteps a little in place,<lb/> And he thunders his thanks as he
							rushes on<lb/>    In the lightning speed of his race;<lb/> And I think that he knows when he looks at me,<lb/>    That,
							though made of clay as I stand,<lb/> I could make him as weak as a three hours' child<lb/>    With a paltry twitch of my
							hand.</p>
						<p> But I trust in his strength, and he trusts in me,<lb/>    Though made but of brittle clay,<lb/> While he is bound up in
							the toughest of steel,<lb/>    That tires not night or day;<lb/> But for ever flashes, and stretches, and strives,<lb/>
							   While he shrieks in his smoky glee—<lb/> Hurrah for the puppets that, lost in their thoughts,<lb/>    Could rub the
							lamp for me!</p>
						<p> O that some Roman—when Rome was great—<lb/>    Some quick, light Greek or two—<lb/> Could come from their graves for one
							half-hour<lb/>    To see what my fellows can do;<lb/> I would take them with me on this world's wild steed,<lb/>    And
							give him a little rein;<lb/> Then rush with his clanking hoofs through space,<lb/>    With a wreath of smoke for his
							mane.</p>
						<p> I would say to them as they shook in their fear,<lb/>    "Now what is your paltry book,<lb/> Or the Phidian touch of the
							chisel's point,<lb/>    That can make the marble look,<lb/> To this monster of ours, that for ages lay<lb/>    In the
							depths of the dreaming earth,<lb/> Till we brought him out with a cheer and a shout,<lb/>    And hammer'd him into
							birth?"</p>
						<p>Clank, clank went the hammer in dusty shops,<lb/>    The forge-flare went to the sky,<lb/> While still, like the monster of
							Frankenstein's,<lb/>    This great wild being was nigh;<lb/> Till at length he rose up in his sinew and strength,<lb/>
							   And our fellows could see with pride<lb/> Their grimy brows and their bare, slight arms,<lb/>    In the depths of his
							glancing side.</p>
						<p> Then there rose to their lips a dread question of fear—<lb/>    "Who has in him the nerve to start<lb/> In this mass a
							soul that will shake and roll<lb/>    A river of life to his heart?"<lb/> Then a pigmy by jerks went up his side,<lb/>
							   Flung a globe of fire in his breast,<lb/> And cities leapt nearer by hundreds of miles<lb/>    At the first wild snort
							from his chest.</p>
						<p> Then away he rush'd to his mission of toil,<lb/>    Wherever lay guiding rods,<lb/> And the work he could do at each throb
							of his pulse<lb/>    Flung a blush on the face of the gods.<lb/> And Atlas himself, when he felt his weight,<lb/>    Bent
							lower his quaking limb,<lb/> Then shook himself free from this earth, and left<lb/>    The grand old planet to him.</p>
						<p> But well can he bear it, this Titan of toil,<lb/>    When his pathway yields to his tread;<lb/> And the vigour within him
							flares up to its height,<lb/>    Till the smoke of his breath grows red;<lb/> Then he shrieks in delight, as an athlete
							might,<lb/>    When he reaches his wild desire,<lb/> And from head to heel, through each muscle of steel,<lb/>    Runs the
							cunning and clasp of the fire.</p>
						<p> Or, see how he tosses aside the night,<lb/>    And roars in his thirsty wrath,<lb/> While his one great eye gleams white
							with rage<lb/>    At the darkness that muffles his path;<lb/> And lo! as the pent-up flame of his heart<lb/>    Flashes
							out from behind its bars,<lb/> It gleams like a bolt flung from heaven, and rears<lb/>    A ladder of light to the
							stars.</p>
						<p> Talk of the sea flung back in its wrath<lb/>    By a line of unyielding stone,<lb/> Or the slender clutch of a thread-like
							bridge,<lb/>    That knits two valleys in one!<lb/> Talk of your miracle-working wires,<lb/>    And their world-embracing
							force,<lb/> But himmel! give me the bits of steel<lb/>    In the mouth of the thunder-horse!</p>
						<p> Ay, give me the beat of his fire-fed breast,<lb/>    And the shake of his giant frame,<lb/> And the sinews that work like
							the shoulders of Jove<lb/>    When he launches a bolt of flame;<lb/> And give me that Lilliput rider of his,<lb/>    Stout
							and wiry and grim,<lb/> Who can vault on his back as he puffs his pipe,<lb/>    And whisk the breath from him.</p>
						<p> Then hurrah for our mighty engine, boys;<lb/>    He may roar and fume along<lb/> For a hundred years ere a poet arise<lb/>
							   To shrine him in worthy song;<lb/> Yet if one with the touch of the gods on his lips,<lb/>    And his heart beating
							wildly and quick,<lb/> Should rush into song at this demon of ours,<lb/>    Let him sing, too, the shovel and pick.</p>

						<p> We must return to John Barton. Poor John! He never got over his disappointing journey to London. The deep mortification he
							then experienced (with, perhaps, as little selfishness for its cause as mortification ever bad) was of no temporary
							nature; indeed few of his feelings were.</p>
						<p> Then came a long period of bodily privation; of daily hunger after food; and though he tried to persuade himself he could
							bear want himself with stoical indifference, and did care about it as little as most men, yet the body took its revenge
							for its uneasy feelings. The mind became soured and morose, and lost much of its equipoise. It was no longer elastic, as
							in the days of youth, or in times of comparative happiness; it ceased to hope. And it is hard to live on when one can no
							longer hope. </p>
						<p> The same state of feeling which John Barton entertained, if belonging to one who had had leisure to think of such things,
							and physicians to give names to them would have been called monomania; so haunting, so incessant, were the thoughts that
							pressed upon him. I have somewhere read a forcibly described punishment among the Italians, worthy of a Borgia. The
							supposed or real criminal was shut up in a room, supplied with every convenience and luxury; and at first mourned little
							over his imprisonment. But day by day he became aware that the space between the walls of his apartment was narrowing, and
							then he understood the end. Those painted walls would come into hideous nearness, and at last crush the life out of him. </p>
						<p> And so day by day, nearer and nearer, came the diseased thoughts of John Barton. They excluded the light of heaven, the
							cheering sounds of earth. They were preparing his death.</p>
						<p> It is true much of their morbid power might be ascribed to the use of opium. But before you blame too harshly this use, or
							rather abuse, try a hopeless life, with daily cravings of the body for food. Try, not alone being without hope yourself,
							but seeing all around you reduced to the same despair, arising from the same circumstances; all around you telling (though
							they use no words or language), by their looks and feeble actions, that they are suffering and sinking under the pressure
							of want. Would you not be glad to forget life, and its burdens? And opium gives forgetfulness for a time.</p>
						<p> It is true they who thus purchase it pay dearly for their oblivion; but can you expect the uneducated to count the cost of
							their whistle? Poor wretches! They pay a heavy price. Days of oppressive weariness and languor, whose realities have the
							feeble sickliness of dreams; nights, whose dreams are fierce realities of agony; sinking health, tottering frames,
							incipient madness, and worse, the consciousness of incipient madness; this is the price of their whistle. But have you
							taught them the science of consequences? </p>
						<p> John Barton's overpowering thought, which was to work out his fate on earth, was rich and poor; why are they so separate,
							so distinct, when God has made them all? It is not His will that their interests are so far apart. Whose doing is it? </p>
						<p> And so on into the problems and mysteries of life, until, bewildered and lost, unhappy and suffering, the only feeling
							that remained clear and undisturbed in the tumult of his heart, was hatred to the one class, and keen sympathy with the
							other.</p>
						<p> But what availed his sympathy? No education had given him wisdom; and without wisdom, even love, with all its effects, too
							often works but harm. He acted to the best of his judgement, but it was a widely erring judgement.</p>
						<p>The actions of the uneducated seem to me typified in those of Frankenstein, that monster of many human qualities, ungifted
							with a soul, a knowledge of the difference between good and evil.</p>
						<p> The people rise up to life; they irritate us, they terrify us, and we become their enemies. Then, in the sorrowful moment
							of our triumphant power, their eyes gaze on us with mute reproach. Why have we made them what they are; a powerful
							monster, yet without the inner means for peace and happiness?</p>
						<p> John Barton became a Chartist, a Communist; all that is commonly called wild and visionary. Aye! but being visionary is
							something. It shows a soul, a being not altogether sensual; a creature who looks forward for others, if not for himself. </p>
						<p> And with all his weakness he had a sort of practical power, which made him useful to the bodies of men to whom he
							belonged. He had a ready kind of rough Lancashire eloquence, arising out of the fulness of his heart, which was very
							stirring to men similarly circumstanced, who liked to hear their feelings put into words. He had a pretty clear head at
							times, for method and arrangement; a necessary talent to large combinations of men. And what perhaps more than all made
							him relied upon and valued, was the consciousness which every one who came in contact with him felt, that he was actuated
							by no selfish motives; that his class, his order, was what he stood by, not the rights of his own paltry self. For even in
							great and noble men, as soon as self comes into prominent existence, it becomes a mean and paltry thing. </p>
						<p> A little time before this, there had come one of those occasions for deliberation among the employed, which deeply
							interested John Barton, and the discussions concerning which bad caused his frequent absence from home of late.</p>
						<p> I am not sure if I can express myself in the technical terms of either masters or workmen, but I will try simply to state
							the case on which the latter deliberated.</p>
						<p> An order for coarse goods came in from a new foreign market. It was a large order, giving employment to all the mills
							engaged in that species of manufacture; but it was necessary to execute it speedily, and at as low prices as possible, as
							the masters had reason to believe that a duplicate order had been sent to one of the continental manufacturing towns,
							where there were no restrictions on food, no taxes on building or machinery, and where consequently they dreaded that the
							goods could be made at a much lower price than they could afford them for; and that, by so acting and charging, the rival
							manufacturers would obtain undivided possession of the market. It was clearly their interest to buy cotton as cheaply, and
							to beat down wages as low as possible. And in the long run the interests of the workmen would have been thereby benefited.
							Distrust each other as they may, the employers and the employed must rise or fall together. There may be some difference
							as to chronology, none as to fact.</p>
						<p> But the masters did not choose to make all these facts known. They stood upon being the masters, and that they had a right
							to order work at their own prices, and they believed that in the present depression of trade, and unemployment of hands,
							there would be no difficulty in getting it done.</p>
						<p> Now let us turn to the workmen's view of the question. The masters (of the tottering foundation of whose prosperity they
							were ignorant) seemed doing well, and, like gentlemen, "lived at home in ease," while they were starving, gasping on from
							day to day; and there was a foreign order to be executed, the extent o f which, large as it was, was greatly exaggerated;
							and it was to be done speedily. Why were the masters offering such low wages under these circumstances? Shame upon them!
							It was taking advantage of their workpeople being almost starved; but they would starve entirely rather than come into
							such terms. It was bad enough to be poor, while by the labour of their thin hands, the sweat of their brows, the masters
							were made rich; but they would not be utterly ground down to dust. No! they would fold their hands and sit idle, and smile
							at the masters, whom even in death they could baffle. With Spartan endurance they determined to let the employers know
							their power, by refusing to work. </p>
						<p> So class distrusted class, and their want of mutual confidence wrought sorrow to both. The masters would not be bullied,
							and compelled to reveal why they felt it wisest and best to offer only such low wages; they would not be made to tell that
							they were even sacrificing capital to obtain a decisive victory over the continental manufacturers. And the workmen sat
							silent and stern with folded hands refusing to work for such pay. There was a strike in Manchester. </p>
						<p> Of course it was succeeded by the usual consequences. Many other Trades' Unions, connected with different branches of
							business, supported with money, countenance, and encouragement of every kind, the stand which the Manchester power-loom
							weavers were making against their masters. Delegates from Glasgow, from Nottingham, and other towns, were sent to
							Manchester, to keep up the spirit of resistance; a committee was formed, and all the requisite officers elected; chairman,
							treasurer, honorary secretary:—among them was John Barton. </p>
						<p> The masters, meanwhile, took their measures. They placarded the walls with advertisements for power-loom weavers. The
							workmen replied by a placard in still larger letters, stating their grievances. The masters met daily in town, to mourn
							over the time (so fast slipping away) for the fulfilment of the foreign orders; and to strengthen each other in their
							resolution not to yield. If they gave up now, they might give up always. It would never do. And amongst the most energetic
							of the masters, the Carsons, father and son, took their places. It is well known, that there is no religionist so zealous
							as a convert; no masters so stern, and regardless of the interests of their workpeople, as those who have risen from such
							a station themselves. This would account for the elder Mr Carson's determination not to be bullied into yielding; not even
							to be bullied into giving reasons for acting as the masters did. It was the employers' will, and that should be enough for
							the employed. Harry Carson did not trouble himself much about the grounds for his conduct. He liked the excitement of the
							affair. He liked the attitude of resistance. He was brave, and he liked the idea of personal danger, with which some of
							the more cautious tried to intimidate the violent among the masters. </p>
						<p> Meanwhile, the power-loom weavers living in the more remote parts of Lancashire, and the neighbouring counties, heard of
							the masters' advertisements for workmen; and in their solitary dwellings grew weary of starvation, and resolved to come to
							Manchester. Foot-sore, way-worn, half-starved looking men they were, as they tried to steal into town in the early dawn,
							before people were astir, or in the dusk of the evening. And now began the real wrong-doing of the Trades' Unions. As to
							their decision to work, or not, at such a particular rate of wages, that was either wise or unwise; all error of judgement
							at the worst. But they had no right to tyrannize over others, and tie them down to their own Procrustean bed. Abhorring
							what they considered oppression in the masters, why did they oppress others? Because, when men get excited, they know not
							what they do. Judge, then, with something of the mercy of the Holy One, whom we all love. </p>
						<p> In spite of policemen, set to watch over the safety of the poor country weavers—in spite of magistrates, and prisons, and
							severe punishments—the poor depressed men tramping in from Burnley, Padiham, and other places, to work at the condemned
							"Starvation Prices," were waylaid, and beaten, and left almost for dead by the road-side. The police broke up every
							lounging knot of men:—they separated quietly, to reunite half-a-mile further out of town. </p>
						<p> Of course the feeling between the masters and workmen did not improve under these circumstances. </p>
						<p> Combination is an awful power. It is like the equally mighty agency of steam; capable of almost unlimited good or evil.
							But to obtain a blessing on its labours, it must work under the direction of a high and intelligent will; incapable of
							being misled by passion or excitement. The will of the operatives had not been guided to the calmness of wisdom. </p>
						<p> So much for generalities. Let us now return to individuals. </p>
						<p> A note, respectfully worded, although its tone of determination was strong, had been sent by the power-loom weavers,
							requesting that a "deputation" of them might have a meeting with the masters, to state the conditions they must have
							fulfilled before they would end the turn-out. They thought they had attained a sufficiently commanding position to
							dictate. John Barton was appointed one of the deputation. </p>
						<p> The masters agreed to this meeting, being anxious to end the strife, although undetermined among themselves how far they
							should yield, or whether they should yield at all. Some of the old, whose experience had taught them sympathy, were for
							concession. Others, white-headed men too, had only learnt hardness and obstinacy from the days of the years of their
							lives, and sneered at the more gentle and yielding. The younger men were one and all for an unflinching resistance to
							claims urged with so much violence. Of this party Harry Carson was the leader. </p>
						<p> But like all energetic people, the more he had to do the more time he seemed to find. With all his letter-writing, his
							calling, his being present at the New Bailey when investigations of any case of violence against knob-sticks was going on,
							he beset Mary more than ever. She was weary of her life for him. From blandishments he had even gone to threats—threats
							that whether she would or not she should be his; she showed an indifference that was almost insulting to everything which
							might attract attention and injure her character. </p>
						<p> And still she never saw Jem. She knew he had returned home. She heard of him occasionally through his cousin, who roved
							gaily from house to house, finding and making friends everywhere. But she never saw him. What was she to think? Had he
							given her up? Were a few hasty words, spoken in a moment of irritation, to stamp her lot through life? At times she
							thought that she could bear this meekly, happy in her own constant power of loving. For of change or of forgetfulness she
							did not dream. Then at other times her state of impatience was such, that it required all her self-restraint to prevent
							her from going and seeking him out, and (as man would do to man, or woman to woman) begging him to forgive her hasty
							words, and allow her to retract them, and bidding him accept of the love that was filling her whole heart. She wished
							Margaret had not advised her against such a manner of proceeding; she believed it was her friend's words that seemed to
							make such a simple action impossible, in spite of all the internal urgings. But a friend's advice is only thus powerful,
							when it puts into language the secret oracle of our souls. It was the whisperings of her womanly nature that caused her to
							shrink from any unmaidenly action, not Margaret's counsel. </p>
						<p> All this time, this ten days or so, of Will's visit to Manchester, there was something going on which interested Mary even
							now, and which, in former times, would have exceedingly amused and excited her. She saw as clearly as if told in words,
							that the merry, random, boisterous sailor had fallen deeply in love with the quiet, prim, somewhat plain Margaret: she
							doubted if Margaret was aware of it, and yet, as she watched more closely, she began to think some instinct made the blind
							girl feel whose eyes were so often fixed upon her pale face; that some inner feeling made the delicate and becoming
							rose-flush steal over her countenance. She did not speak so decidedly as before; there was a hesitation in her manner,
							that seemed to make her very attractive; as if something softer, more loveable than excellent sense, were coming in as a
							motive for speech; her eyes had always been soft, and were in no ways disfigured by her blindness, and now seemed to have
							a new charm, as they quivered under their white downcast lids. She must be conscious, thought Mary—heart answering to
							heart. </p>
						<p> Will's love had no blushings, no downcast eyes, no weighing of words; it was as open and undisguised as his nature; yet he
							seemed afraid of the answer its acknowledgment might meet with. It was Margaret's angelic voice that had entranced him,
							and which made him think of her as a being of some other sphere, that he feared to woo. So he tried to propitiate Job in
							all manner of ways. He went over to Liverpool to rummage in his great sea-chest for the flying-fish (no very odorous
							resent, by the way). He hesitated over a child's caul for some time, which was, in his eyes, a far greater treasure than
							any Exocetus. What use could it be of to a landsman? Then Margaret's voice rang in his ears: and he determined to
							sacrifice it, his most precious possession, to one whom she loved as she did her grandfather. </p>
						<p> It was rather a relief to him, when having put it and the flying-fish together in a brown paper parcel, and sat upon them
							for security all the way in the railroad, he found that Job was so indifferent to the precious caul, that he might easily
							claim it again. He hung about Margaret, till he had received many warnings and reproaches from his conscience in behalf of
							his dear aunt Alice's claims upon his time. He went away, and then he bethought him of some other little word with Job.
							And he turned back, and stood talking once more in Margaret's presence, door in hand, only waiting for some little speech
							of encouragement to come in and sit down again. But as the invitation was not given, he was forced to leave at last, and
							go and do his duty.</p>
						<p> Four days had Jem Wilson watched for Mr. Harry Carson without success; his hours of going and returning to his home were
							so irregular, owing to the meetings and consultations among the masters, which were rendered necessary by the turn-out. On
							the fifth, without any purpose on Jem's part, they met. </p>
						<p> It was the workman's dinner hour, the interval between twelve and one; when the streets of Manchester are comparatively
							quiet, for a few shopping ladies, and lounging gentlemen, count for nothing in that busy, bustling, living place. Jem had
							been on an errand for his master, instead of returning to his dinner; and in passing along a lane, a road (called, in
							compliment to the intentions of some future builder, a street), he encountered Harry Carson, the only person, as far as he
							saw, beside himself, treading the unfrequented path. Along one side ran a high broad fence, blackened over by coal-tar,
							and spiked and stuck with pointed nails at the top, to prevent any one from climbing over into the garden beyond. By this
							fence was the footpath. The carriage-road was such as no carriage, no, not even a cart, could possibly have passed along,
							without Hercules to assist in lifting it out of the deep clay ruts. On the other side of the way was a dead brick wall;
							and a field after that, where there was a sawpit, and joiner's shed. </p>
						<p> Jem's heart beat violently, when he saw the gay, handsome young man approaching, with a light buoyant step. This, then,
							was he whom Mary loved. It was, perhaps, no wonder; for he seemed to the poor smith so elegant, so well appointed, that he
							felt the superiority in externals, strangely and painfully, for an instant. Then something uprose within him, and told
							him, that "a man's a man for a' that, for a' that, and twice as much as a' that." And be no longer felt troubled by the
							outward appearance of his rival.</p>
						<p> Harry Carson came on, lightly bounding over the dirty places with almost a lad's buoyancy. To his surprise the dark,
							sturdy-looking artisan stopped him, by saying respectfully,</p>
						<p> "May I speak a word wi' you, sir?" </p>
						<p> "Certainly, my good man," looking his astonishment; then finding that the promised speech did not come very quickly, he
							added, "But make haste, for I'm in a hurry." </p>
						<p> Jem had cast about for some less abrupt way of broaching the subject uppermost in his mind than he now found himself
							obliged to use. With a husky voice that trembled as he spoke, he said, </p>
						<p> "I think, sir, yo're keeping company wi' a young woman called Mary Barton." </p>
						<p> A light broke in upon Henry Carson's mind, and he paused before he gave the answer for which the other waited. </p>
						<p> Could this man be a lover of Mary's? And (strange stinging thought) could be be beloved by her, and so have caused her
							obstinate rejection of himself? He looked at Jem from head to foot, a black, grimy mechanic, in dirty fustian clothes,
							strongly built, and awkward (according to the dancing master); then he glanced at himself, and recalled the reflection he
							had so lately quitted in his bedroom. It was impossible. No woman with eyes could choose the one when the other wooed. It
							was Hyperion to a Satyr. That quotation came aptly; he forgot, "The man's a man for a' that." And yet here was a clue,
							which he had often wanted, to her changed conduct towards him. If she loved this man. If—he hated the fellow, and longed
							to strike him. He would know all. </p>
						<p> "Mary Barton! let me see. Aye, that is the name of the girl. An arrant flirt the little hussy is; but very pretty. Aye,
							Mary Barton is her name." </p>
						<p> Jem bit his lips. Was it then so; that Mary was a flirt; the giddy creature of whom he spoke? He would not believe it, and
							yet now he wished the suggestive words unspoken. That thought must keep now, though even if she were, the more reason for
							there being some one to protect her; poor faulty darling. </p>
						<p> "She's a good girl, sir, though maybe a bit set up with her beauty; but she's her father's only child, sir, and"—he
							stopped; he did not like to express suspicion, and yet he was determined he would be certain there was ground for none.
							What should he say. </p>
						<p> "Well, my fine fellow, and what have I to do with that! It's but loss of my time, and yours, too, if you've only stopped
							me to tell me Mary Barton is very pretty; I know that well enough."</p>
						<p> He seemed as though he would have gone on, but Jem put his black, working, right hand upon his arm to detain him. The
							haughty young man shook it off, and with his glove pretended to brush away the sooty contamination that might be left upon
							his light greatcoat sleeve. The little action aroused Jem. </p>
						<p> "I will tell you, in plain words, what I have got to say to you, young man. It's been telled me by one as knows, and has
							seen, that you walk with this same Mary Barton, and are known to be courting her; and her as spoke to me about it, thinks
							as how Mary loves you. That may be, or may not. But I'm an old friend of hers and her father's; and I just wished to know
							if you mean to marry the girl. Spite of what you said of her lightness, I ha' known her on enough to be sure she'll make a
							noble wife for any one let him be what he may; and I mean to stand by her like a brother; and if you mean rightly, you'll
							not think the worse on me for what I've now said; and if—but no, I'll not say what I'll do to the man who wrongs a hair of
							her head. He shall rue it to the longest day he lives, that's all. Now, sir, what I ask of you is this. If you mean fair
							and honourable by her, well and good; but if not, for your own sake as well as hers, leave her alone, and never speak to
							her more." Jem's voice quivered with the earnestness with which he spoke, and he eagerly waited for some answer. </p>
						<p> Harry Carson, meanwhile, instead of attending very particularly to the purpose the man had in addressing him, was trying
							to gather from his speech what was the real state of the case. He succeeded so far as to comprehend that Jem inclined to
							believe that Mary loved his rival; and consequently, that if the speaker were attached to her himself, he was not a
							favoured admirer. The idea came into Mr Carson's mind, that perhaps, after all, Mary loved him in spite of her frequent
							and obstinate rejections; and that she had employed this person (whoever he was) to bully him into marrying her. He
							resolved to try and ascertain more correctly the man's relation to her. Either be was a lover, and if so, not a favoured
							one (in which case Mr Carson could not at all understand the man's motives for interesting himself in securing her
							marriage); or he was a friend, an accomplice, whom she had employed to bully him. So little faith in goodness have the
							mean and selfish!</p>
						<p> "Before I make you into my confidant, my good man," said Mr Carson, in a contemptuous tone, "I think it might be as well
							to inquire your right to meddle with our affairs. Neither Mary nor I, as I conceive, called you in as a mediator." He
							paused; he wanted a distinct answer to this last supposition. None came; so he began to imagine he was to be threatened
							into some engagement, and his angry spirit rose.</p>
						<p> "And so, my fine fellow, you will have the kindness to leave us to ourselves, and not to meddle with what does not concern
							you. If you were a brother or father of hers, the case might have been different. As it is, I can only consider you an
							impertinent meddler."</p>
						<p> Again he would have passed on, but Jem stood in a determined way before him, saying, </p>
						<p> "You say if I had been her brother, or her father, you'd have answered me what I ask. Now, neither father nor brother
							could love her as I have loved her—aye, and as I love her still; if love gives a right to satisfaction, it's next to
							impossible any one breathing can come up to my right. Now, sir, tell me! do you mean fair by Mary or not? I've proved my
							claim to know, and, by G—, I will know." </p>
						<p> "Come, come, no impudence," replied Mr Carson, who, having discovered what he wanted to know (namely, that Jem was a lover
							of Mary's, and that she was not encouraging his suit), wished to pass on. </p>
						<p> "Father, brother, or rejected lover" (with an emphasis on the word rejected), "no one has a right to interfere between my
							little girl and me. No one shall. Confound you, man! get out of my way, or I'll make you," as Jem still obstructed his
							path with dogged determination. </p>
						<p> "I won't then, till you've given me your word about Mary," replied the mechanic, grinding his words out between his teeth,
							and the livid paleness of the anger he could no longer keep down covering his face till he looked ghastly. </p>
						<p> "Won't you?" (with a taunting laugh), "then I'll make you." The young man raised his slight cane, and smote the artisan
							across the face with a stinging stroke. An instant afterwards he lay stretched in the muddy road, Jem standing over him,
							panting with rage. What he would have done next in his moment of ungovernable passion, no one knows; but a police man from
							the main street, into which this road led, had been sauntering about for some time, unobserved by either of the parties,
							and expecting some kind of conclusion like the present to the violent discussion going on between the two young men. In a
							minute he had pinioned Jem, who sullenly yielded to the surprise. </p>
						<p> Mr Carson was on his feet directly, his face glowing with rage or shame. </p>
						<p> "Shall I take him to the lock-ups for assault, sir?" said the policeman.</p>
						<p> "No, no," exclaimed Mr Carson; "I struck him first. It was no assault on his side; though," he continued, hissing out his
							words to Jem, who even bated freedom procured for him, however justly, at the intervention of his rival, "I will never
							forgive or forget your insult. Trust me," he gasped the words in excess of passion, "Mary shall fare no better for your
							insolent interference." He laughed, as if with the consciousness of power.</p>
						<p> Jem replied with equal excitement— </p>
						<p> "And if you dare to injure her in the least, I will await you where no policeman can step in between. And God shall judge
							between us two." </p>
						<p> The policeman now interfered with persuasions and warnings. He locked his arm in Jem's to lead him away in an opposite
							direction to that in which he saw Mr Carson was going. Jem submitted, gloomily, for a few steps, then wrenched himself
							free. The policeman shouted after him. </p>
						<p> "Take care, my man! there's no girl on earth worth what you'll be bringing on yourself, if you don't mind."</p>
						<p> But Jem was out of hearing.</p>

						<p>Brydges's long meditation on Lake Geneva describes both its natural and its cultural associations, including Rousseau, Mme

						<p> O strangely various is the human fate,<lb/> And human occupation! How wast thou<lb/> Employ'd, O learned Beza, on the
							banks<lb/> Of this lov'd lake for a long glorious life<lb/> Of intellectual energies, of taste,<lb/> Thought, poetry, and
							forceful sentiment,<lb/> And warm, heart-mellowing, and chaste Religion!<lb/> Far different from thy master, Calvin's,
							was<lb/> Thine heart: not dry, and hard, and in scholastic<lb/> And controversial divinity<lb/> Pent up, but with the
							captivating graces<lb/> Of ornamental letters deep imbued,<lb/> And joying to the last in the sweet studies<lb/> Of thy
							gay days of youthful efflorescence.—<lb/> Poet, and moralist, as elegant<lb/> As erudite! when more than eighty years<lb/>
							Had shook thy trembling hand, till scarce a stroke<lb/> Distinctly it could make, thou didst again<lb/> Freshen with dews
							these flowers, that in the garden<lb/> Of thy young fancy were rear'd up to bloom,<lb/> And flourish, and put forth their
							shining hues,<lb/> Spotted with all rich colours, and with scents<lb/> Vernal delighting. There they stand in pale<lb/>
							And venerable spells, in those fond haunts,<lb/> Where all thy worthies by the painter's skill,<lb/> Geneva, live—and all
							the labour'd fruits<lb/> Of their enlighten'd minds survive to teach<lb/> Posterity:—and my enthusiast eyes<lb/> Have
							dwelt upon them, and my feeble skill<lb/> Has striven to decypher them, and mark,<lb/> Compare, and contrast the
							slow-changing hues<lb/> From over-flowing youth to waning age!</p>
						<p> As thou wert champion of the Church Reform'd—<lb/> So keen were Rome's foul myrmidons against thee;<lb/> Then with
							incessant scandal did they stain<lb/> Thy venerable age, and all the levities<lb/> Brought of thy boyhood to reproach's
							aid.—<lb/> But thou in conscious rectitude revivedst<lb/> Those early blossoms; and they stand recorded<lb/> In the best
							types of thy most learned printers;</p>
						<p> And now the misty dawn of light begins<lb/> To break upon me! But not yet the hour<lb/> Of three has sounded from St.
							Peter's tower:<lb/> Yet short the space that after midnight's calm<lb/> Mantle had veil'd the skies, when all but I<lb/>
							Were wrapt in slumbrous rest, the Muse awoke me,<lb/> And I to my accustom'd toil applied,<lb/> My promis'd task to
							execute; and now<lb/> While I these lines am writing, quick the rays<lb/> Of sweet Aurora pierce the vapoury gray<lb/>
							That hastens off, as if affrighted, swifter<lb/> Than birds, that in the heavens dart away<lb/> From their strong-plum'd
							destroyers!</p>
						<p> O how intense the brilliance and the beauty<lb/> Of morning's golden dawn, that over Alpine<lb/> Summits I daily see
							arise, since thirteen<lb/> Months have near pass'd, and not e'en once have I<lb/> Fail'd from my bed to gaze upon the
							picture!<lb/> But thus our faculties their vigour gain,<lb/> And I my daily, nightly, efforts ply<lb/> T'approach to
							spirit! Thought, and words, and images<lb/> Thus multiply, and more distinctly come!<lb/> And on the verge of that extent
							of life,<lb/> Which is man's common lot, and after sickness<lb/> Of more than four much-troubled years, my brain,<lb/> If
							I do not delude myself, has grown<lb/> To strength and copiousness, before it knew not.<lb/> But 'tis perchance the
							cheer!—The cheer has come<lb/> At last, whose want I languish'd for, and now<lb/> Its motions are all energy and
							hope!<lb/> For nature made me timid: and timidity<lb/> Sits like a vampire over the mind's efforts.</p>
						<p>Coppet, when the Genevan Banker, risen<lb/> From counting his dry figures, to the state<lb/> Of Minister of mighty France,
							in times<lb/> Which all a politician's wisest powers<lb/> And most consummate arts call'd into play,—<lb/> Possess'd
							thee,—little were thy master's habits,<lb/> And trains of mind congenial to the fierce<lb/> And chivalrous ambitions, that
							in days<lb/> Of feudal splendor did for many ages<lb/> Rule thee, as thy proud lords! O gallant Grandson,<lb/> Burgundian
							chief, whose name is yet familiar<lb/> Throughout old Jura's heights, and echoes yet<lb/> Along Helvetian mountains, whose
							mail'd warrior<lb/> Amid the Gothic wonders of Lausanne's<lb/> Rich shrines in proud recumbent figure lies<lb/> Sculptur'd
							in stone, full many a tale have I<lb/> To tell of you; but the capricious Muse<lb/> Must wait her time.—Wide and remote
							the current<lb/> Of thy impetuous blood impelled thee on<lb/> To distant regions, and among the Barons<lb/> Of haughty
							England was thy stock establish'd;<lb/> And from thy veins the proud ambitious Beauforts<lb/> Sprung, and the saintly
							Margaret, the mother<lb/> Of the seventh Harry, monarch of the Isles<lb/> Whose swords, wealth, gallantries, and genius
							strong,<lb/> Have ever held their sway puissant over<lb/> The destinies of Europe:—monarch, sage and wily,<lb/> And
							prudent, and to whom, albeit stern<lb/> And avaricious, England much of vigour,<lb/> And much advance in commerce and the
							arts<lb/> Owes,—of the Tudor dynasty the chief—<lb/> A dynasty whose reign was short, but mighty,<lb/> And glorious—e'en
							though thou capricious king,—<lb/> A tyrant in tyrannic times; a lover<lb/> Of numerous wives, whom soon as sated
							with,<lb/> Of blood regardless, thou didst to the scaffold<lb/> With hatred merciless and savage humour<lb/> Consign—e'en
							thou, detested despot, were<lb/> Chief of the Line!—For from thee came a princess<lb/> Splendid, as most that on the'
							historic page<lb/> Have their reigns blazon'd! Yes, from Coppet's lords<lb/> Part of thy blood came in a gallant
							stream!</p>
						<p> O alter'd times! O good and evil mix'd,<lb/> That changes have effected! O how different<lb/> Was the wild splendor of thy
							board, De Stael,<lb/> When in October's moody evenings, as<lb/> The sobbing breeze drove the leaves on the Lake,<lb/> And
							stripp'd the groves of their umbrageous honours,<lb/> The gorgeous blaze of lamps the guests attracted,<lb/> Of wit and
							genius, to thy table, spread<lb/> With modern luxuries! Then converse bright<lb/> Eclips'd the show of the Financier's
							wealth.—</p>
						<p> And here again to thy fond name, O Byron,<lb/> I must return! I see thee listening now<lb/> To the conflict where at every
							dart flash forth<lb/> Splendors thou canst not reach; and then half angry,<lb/> Or envious, half delighted, thou dost
							shrink<lb/> Moody into thyself, and as the blast<lb/> By fits comes shrieking, or in deep hoarse roar<lb/> Over the
							beating waters, of thy boat<lb/> Think'st, and half risest to enjoy the battle<lb/> Of more congenial elements
							without;—<lb/> But then again to thy luxurious seat<lb/> Thyself thou reconcilest, and wouldst yet<lb/> Hope not eclips'd
							and vanquish'd to depart!<lb/> O pride intolerable, yet with flashes<lb/> Of generous submission and humility,<lb/> And
							admiration of corrival powers,<lb/> When not insulted, and the victory<lb/> Borne with meek placidness, devoid of
							vain<lb/> Arrogant triumph. But thy mind remains<lb/> E'en now but half develop'd, firey Bard!</p>
						<p> Perchance a poet only well can write<lb/> A poet's life, and such the fate which thee,<lb/> O Bard of Newsted, has
							awaited: Moore,<lb/> England's Anacreon, has fulfill'd the task;<lb/> But now and then it may be thought the strain<lb/>
							Was not congenial;—the profundity<lb/> Of the great poet's gloom was of the heart;<lb/> His frolic levities were but
							assum'd!<lb/> And sometines his companions seem'd th'effect<lb/> Of chance more than of choice. Thus he who perish'd<lb/>
							Upon the shores of Lirici so fatally,<lb/> Whelm'd in the waves of the tempesturous Ocean—<lb/> Himself also a bard,—but
							yet a bard<lb/> Of mingled stars and clouds!—he touch'd the lyre<lb/> Sometimes in happier hour with a light hand,<lb/>
							That drew forth tones most exquisitely sweet;<lb/> But then again he labour'd in confusion<lb/> Dark, enigmatic, falsely
							gorgeous, struggling<lb/> To grasp at monstrous unmatur'd conceptions,<lb/> Unmanag'd, and unmanagable, mystic,<lb/>
							Dangerous, sceptical, and fanciful.</p>
						<p> Beneath the roof that Diodati's name<lb/> Has consecrated to the Muses, he,<lb/> The victim of the stormy billows,
							pass'd<lb/> The autumn, to the noble poet big<lb/> With such heart-swelling sorrows!—He whose tales<lb/> Of Monks profane,
							and of hobgoblins dire,<lb/> Won a false sensual taste, and a foul fame<lb/> Of spurious wit,—a guest was also
							there;<lb/>And she the genius deep of Frankenstein,<lb/> And others known perchance, or thirstily<lb/> Aspiring to be
							known,—a motley crew;—<lb/> Not one congenial with his noble host!</p>
						<p> Above thy banks, O Leman, to a point<lb/> Where thy waves gather, at its western bound,<lb/> And, issuing in a purple
							torrent, force<lb/> Their passage thro the strait, on whose steep banks<lb/> Stands thy fam'd city once the capital<lb/>
							Of the Burgundian realm— now numerous<lb/> On thy o'ershadowing heights the fair campaignes<lb/> Glitter. Here d'Aubigné
							the fair abode<lb/> Of his last days, the wreck of a long life<lb/> Of busy conflicts and adventures bold,<lb/>
							Fix'd;—while his plume as ready as his sword<lb/> Told the long tale of many a feat of gallantry,<lb/> And many a court
							intrigue, and many a danger,<lb/> In the fierce wars of bigot zeal, which stain'd<lb/> The bloody struggles for a pure
							religion.</p>
						<p> O Bourbon, in whose generous character,<lb/> The wit, the hero, the sagacious wordling,<lb/> The chivalrous adventurer,
							the lover,<lb/> The friend, th'abandon'd to luxurious pleasure,<lb/> A many-colour'd web of brilliant hues<lb/> Is woven,
							and whose threads of gloomier tint<lb/> Were cut at last too short by the dire dagger<lb/> Of an insane assassin, well has
							d'Aubigné<lb/> Recorded the memorials, that still prove<lb/> The truth of thy well-merited renown!</p>
						<p> Here in his old age were the nuptials gaily<lb/> A second time perform'd, and proud Geneva<lb/> Received him to the bosom
							of a House,<lb/> It cherished much—from Lucca's warmer skies<lb/> Transplanted,—Burlamachi's race, long flourishing—<lb/>
							Extinct at last. But from his veins descended<lb/> Of his first issue one, who to the heir<lb/> Of his great kingly
							friend, and to the court<lb/> Of brilliant and ambitious France, nor less<lb/> To Europe's wide-spread nations, was a
							star<lb/> Of female brilliance, that eclips'd the lights<lb/> Of other deep intriguers! Maintenon,<lb/> Who does not know
							thy name; while yet thy character<lb/> Remains an half enigma, which Saint-Simon's<lb/> Piercing, acute, sincere, but
							somewhat tedious<lb/> Pen, has not yet entirely clear'd from doubt?</p>
						<p> Here Rohan's Duke, who fought so long with bravery<lb/> The Protestant cause against the force of France,<lb/> The remnant
							of his days, to seek for calm,<lb/> And nature's tranquil but majestic scenes,<lb/> Appointed, and in thy cathedral
							walls<lb/> His relics, and the funeral memorial,<lb/> Defil'd in latter years by hands profane<lb/> Of revolutionary
							rabbles, still<lb/> Beneath thy Gothic roofs, displays its broken<lb/> Sculpture: but better were the history<lb/> Of his
							field-active days, for prose than verse;<lb/> And well has he himself the story given.</p>
						<p> Here Bonnet on low Genthod's jutting point<lb/> In philosophic studies, natural science,<lb/> And expositions of the Power
							Divine,<lb/> His long life of incessant study pass'd.<lb/> If reader thou art curious, thou mayst read<lb/> In the rich
							pages of historic Müller<lb/> The record of his calm yet busy days,<lb/> And virtuous simple life. Here Mallet vers'd<lb/>
							In antiquarian lore, and philosophic<lb/> Annals of Europe's politics, his labours<lb/> Oft gather'd from the sources far
							remote<lb/> Of other realms, beneath more northern skies<lb/> Sometimes applied; tho from his native soil<lb/> Distant,
							too much of his researchful life<lb/> Was spent: but not on frozen themes, or rude;<lb/> For curious are the sources he
							evolv'd<lb/> Of the bold Runic Muse; and much our Gray,<lb/> And much our Percy, of old poetry,<lb/> The elegant and
							learned chronicler,<lb/> Drew cups of inspiration from the fount!<lb/> But richly-stor'd, and eloquently-gifted,<lb/>
							Sismondi has a brief memorial given<lb/> Of the learn'd annalist; and now his fame<lb/> Rests undisturb'd. Here Stanhope
							from the councils<lb/> Of Albion's ermin'd robes retir'd to nurse<lb/> His scientific passions: here Mahon<lb/> In his
							sire's dry philosophy imbued,<lb/> Yet with the passion of an ardent mind,<lb/> Drank in republican notions from his
							cradle,<lb/> And in his manhood to his native land<lb/> Returning, spent a life of usefulness<lb/> In his laborious
							youth's profound pursuits<lb/> Of science practical, and in the plain<lb/> Habits by puritanic Calvin nurs'd.<lb/> But he
							was wise and virtuous,—and, exempt<lb/> From pride aristocratic, wide secur'd<lb/> Love and respect, though sometimes
							intermingled<lb/> With scorn dealt out by brother-peers, who thought<lb/> Their ermine soil'd by puritanic manners.</p>
						<p> So Pitt, his near alliance, though himself<lb/> Of manners plain and simple, and absorb'd<lb/> In intellect, yet deem'd:
							nor would allow<lb/> The politics of a minute republic<lb/> Well suited to a mighty kingdom's state:<lb/> And surely wise
							and undeniable<lb/> Was the great Minister's judgment: for the rule<lb/> Of human beings lies upon the heart;<lb/> And not
							in dry deductions from the mechanism<lb/> Of reason plied to abstract sciences:—<lb/> And the mere reasoner is a man who
							sees<lb/> A distance short—nay shortest, while the lamp<lb/> Of bright imagination, that has insight<lb/> Of the dark
							passions working in man's bosom,<lb/> And has sagacity and judicious choice,<lb/> Alone can lay profound designs,
							adapted<lb/> For government of man's mysterious character.<lb/> Thus Burke,— of politicians of his age<lb/> The nearest
							inspiration,— thought: and thus<lb/> Immortal Bacon, the bright luminary<lb/> Of science!—Thus endow'd have ever been<lb/>
							The mighty statesmen of the world: thus Buckhurst,<lb/> Clarendon, Somers, St. John, Pulteney, Carteret,<lb/> And Chatham,
							high and bright above the highest.<lb/> Thus Canning, latest dead, and most deplor'd<lb/> In days of utmost need;— since
							which the glory<lb/> Of Britain's radiant countenance has paled<lb/> Her beams in darkness to the rival eye<lb/> Of
							Europe,—envious then,—triumphant now,<lb/> And most insulting! But a little while,<lb/> And proudly shall she raise her
							head again,<lb/> And bid defiance to her enemies!</p>
						<p> But I am once more wandring,—ever flying<lb/> Back to those native soils, which scarcely man<lb/> Could ever from his
							bosom's depths eradicate;<lb/> However like a stepmother she acted!</p>
						<p> Geneva, cherish'd, lov'd, admir'd Geneva,<lb/> I will resume thy tales gain, and bring<lb/> Thy worthies back to view!
							Here the learn'd stock<lb/> Of Stephens half a century pursued<lb/> Their most enlightened toils, and hence sent
							forth<lb/> The stores of ancient literature, to teach<lb/> Reviving taste, and those enlighten'd strains,<lb/> Whether in
							verse or prose, which Greece and Rome<lb/> Had once instructed, and adorn'd the world with;<lb/> And which for long long
							centuries inhum'd<lb/> In monkish cells unnotic'd, now came forth<lb/> By late-discover'd printing's aid, (decipher'd<lb/>
							By erudition never rival'd since,)<lb/> To the film-clear'd, and sharp enraptured eye<lb/> Of Learning's sons, in types
							correctly plac'd,<lb/> Text clear, and notes and comments, keen, profound,<lb/> The fruits of talent, sedulously
							bent,<lb/> And ardent deep research, incessantly<lb/> Pursued, and never weary.—Son to son<lb/> The erudite and happy zeal
							descended,<lb/> In generations more than I can count:<lb/> But in thy pages, classical Maittaire,<lb/> The story may be
							found; and he who reads<lb/> And feels no interest, is but a clown<lb/> With a clod heart and head of barren wood.</p>
						<p> Here Henry thou, of this Stephensian race<lb/> The third,—but not the last,—didst carry on<lb/> Thy erudite and most
							wreath-worthy works<lb/> In moody humour, thou thyself a wit<lb/> Of most capricious hues, sometimes in joy,<lb/> But
							oftner in dark clouds and heart-consuming<lb/> Adversity: and sometimes with thy brain<lb/> Disorder'd by the troubles,
							and the restless<lb/> Emotions of thine ever-busy spirit!</p>
						<p> Then Casaubon, perchance by thine alliance<lb/> Prompted, his days of unrelenting study<lb/> Gave to pursuits congenial;
							and his name,<lb/> And the ripe fruits of his assiduous culture,<lb/> Live as of yesterday. Again my theme<lb/> Leads me
							to native regions: England's Monarch<lb/> Attracted by his learned reputation,<lb/> Hence drew him, in the splendor of the
							throne<lb/> Of Britain, recompence and patronage<lb/> To seek; and thus the son, part-heritor<lb/> Of his paternal arts,
							was plac'd a canon<lb/> In Dorovernium's magnificent<lb/> Structure, where Becket's archiepiscopal<lb/> Blood purples yet
							the church's sacred stone,<lb/> And, neighbouring Ickham, thou, whence last my sickly<lb/> Frame I transported hither,
							didst receive<lb/> The learned critic for thy church's pastor!</p>
						<p> Hence, Stanley, thou of Greek celebrity,<lb/> Perchance thine Æschylusian notes and comments<lb/> In part mightst draw,
							for Casaubon in ties<lb/> Of social vicinage might oft enjoy<lb/> Thy conversation, where in bonds of union<lb/> The
							travel'd and poetic Sandys, and Digges,<lb/> Of fame historic in the civil broils<lb/> Of those unhappy days, and many a
							name,<lb/> In registers of learning yet preserv'd,<lb/> Liv'd in alliance and kind neighbourhood:<lb/> And thy
							descendants, Meric, yet remain<lb/> In Durovernium's walls, and in its province!</p>
						<p> Thus ever have thy sympathies and ties<lb/> Of blood and friendship, O Geneva, been<lb/> With England's children! Nor is
							Ickham's hamlet,<lb/> Its ivied towers, and its rude antique rectory,<lb/> And thy rich pastures, Lee, now first
							connected<lb/> With the broad Lake, where mountainous Mont-Blanc<lb/> Daily in majesty among the clouds<lb/> Smiles, or
							frowns over the assembled torrents<lb/> By Alpine fountains fed, and sends its waters<lb/> By the circuitous Arve's
							impetuous channels<lb/> To join the Rhone, that through the narrow gorge<lb/> Of Alps and Jura met, in purple
							stain'd,<lb/> Bursts with a fearful roar!—Yet distant countries<lb/> Not then, as now, communication held<lb/> By beaten
							tracks, and all the luxuries<lb/> Of easy transit, while the missive charge<lb/> Of the pen's register'd mirror of the
							mind<lb/> Was slow and interrupted. Nations now<lb/> Mingle almost as brothers of the same<lb/> Stock, education, habits,
							morals, feelings!</p>
						<p> Voltaire! I hear thy spirit vain reproach me,<lb/> That I so long have thy proud name delay'd!<lb/> Close to my window
							lies thine ancient haunt<lb/> O'erlooking the blue waters, and the towers<lb/> And cluster'd roofs of old Geneva's
							town,<lb/> Once princely and imperial, now to other<lb/> Glory political aspiring!—Here<lb/> By appellation known, that
							well befits<lb/> The purposes it sought, (for les Delices<lb/> 'Twas call'd, and still is call'd,) the accomplish'd
							Bard<lb/> His captivating lures to the sour temper<lb/> Of puritanic strictness dar'd display.<lb/> Here the world by the
							drama's mirror he<lb/> And all th' attractions of Parisian gaiety<lb/> Shew'd! till th'insulted government assuming<lb/>
							Its proper force, to Ferney's French domains<lb/> Expell'd him! 'Tis a perilous adventure<lb/> To draw the portrait of a
							genius, whom<lb/> The world has for a century endeavour'd<lb/> With all the force of critical acumen<lb/> To paint in his
							true colours; who e'en now<lb/> In popularity thro all the letter'd<lb/> Society of nations still augments!<lb/> For me
							against a sense so universal<lb/> To lift my voice seems madness.—I have task'd<lb/> My taste and judgment o'er and o'er
							again;—<lb/> And yet I think the same!— I am not able<lb/> This charm to pierce: in it there is to me<lb/> But little
							merit, and still less attraction.<lb/> It is a clear transparent stream of elegance,<lb/> With a light bottom. Never does
							it rise<lb/> To eloquence, or energy!—It has<lb/> The art of throwing all vain accessaries<lb/> Away, and seeming to
							extract the essence<lb/> Of every subject:—it is in sooth a trick,<lb/> If I may so express myself, of saying<lb/> Trite
							things, adapted to the apprehension<lb/> Of common minds, as if they were discoveries<lb/> Of deep and philosophic genius;
							and<lb/> A shrewd appeal to what the populace<lb/> Calls common sense;—forever mingled with<lb/> That jest and ridicule
							and irony<lb/> And taunt, which are the unresisted masters<lb/> Of vulgar intellects. But for the heart,—<lb/> The
							generous feeling,—the emotion grand,—<lb/> Never by chance is there a single spark!<lb/> His proper motto is—"The world's
							a jest,<lb/> "And all things shew it!"—But the world is not<lb/> A jest! and therefore he's no sage or bard!<lb/> Yet even
							in the apprehensions of<lb/> The people will a witticism be<lb/> The most consummate and resistless argument;<lb/> And he
							who laughs;—and has th' ungenerous talent<lb/> To see th' absurd, or make it, holds a rod,<lb/> A spear—whose touch is
							instant victory.<lb/> But I would never trust the bosom, which<lb/> First sees th'incongruent in presented objects,<lb/>
							Material or ideal!—It betrays<lb/> A littleness of mind; a microscopic<lb/> Habit of searching with ungenerous
							labour,<lb/> Not for the good, but bad:—for combinations<lb/> Invented ill; for failures, which may prove<lb/> Man's
							being, and the Universe, a folly!—<lb/> It soothes frail human envy to believe<lb/> There is no greatness;—that pretended
							wisdom,<lb/> Virtue, and magnanimity, cannot<lb/> The sharp dissecting eye of wit withstand;<lb/> And that the greatest
							sage is he, whose insight<lb/> Can shew them all to be unsound delusions.</p>
						<p> Thou wast, Voltaire, as I conceive, in midst<lb/> Of all thy worldly elevation, ill<lb/> At ease in thine own heart;—thy
							spirit working<lb/> To carry thine own points by artifice,<lb/> Mistrustful of intrinsic strength or greatness;<lb/>
							Thinking that genius was, in truth, a farce;<lb/> And in thine own art drowning all thy comfort;<lb/> Seeking the
							plausible, and not the true;—<lb/> Witty, not wise; and deeming grandeur, beauty,<lb/> To lie i' the pictur'd image
							only;—not<lb/> In the reality! the passions ever<lb/> At work to crush thy rivals by deep artifice<lb/> And living only in
							the vain applause<lb/> Of loud capricious multitudes! In thee<lb/> There was no genuine love of nature's charms;<lb/> Of
							beauty no idolatry;—no fictions<lb/> Of fairy lands; no heavenly visitings<lb/> Involuntary of imagination.<lb/> But ever
							the long studied combination<lb/> Of forc'd, not forceful, art!—Then daily watchfulness<lb/> Of rival power no peace
							within the bosom<lb/> Left, and the rising genius of Rousseau<lb/> Was poison thus to thy frail veteran breast.<lb/> And
							thus in secret were the enmities</p>
						<p> Of the all-morbid dreamer's fellow-citizens<lb/> Nurs'd, and incessant by the insidious darts<lb/> Of wit perverted the
							sad wanderer's step<lb/> Prevented from return to the dear spot<lb/> Of his inspir'd nativity! But ye,<lb/> Who in these
							two dispute the palm of genius,<lb/> First fix precisely that which constitutes<lb/> True genius! If, as said, it be
							th'invention<lb/> Of what is grand, or beautiful, or tender,<lb/> And simpathises with the native movements<lb/> That
							Heaven into the human breast instils,<lb/> Then who will most abide this test? the rhymer<lb/> In verse prosaic of dull
							Ferney's lord,<lb/> Or he, the eloquent and passionate<lb/> Dreamer of Heloise's melting bosom,<lb/> The painter of the
							storm on Leman's Lake,<lb/> The muse-enchanted wood-crownd rocks that hang<lb/> Over the bright waves at La
							Meilleirai:<lb/> If it were true, that Ferney's Lord has drawn<lb/> Man as he is with more fidelity,<lb/> 'Tis man alone
							in his material essence,<lb/> Mingled with earth's contaminating grossness.</p>
						<p> Genius is better conversant with man's<lb/> Feelings and thoughts than with his coarsest actions.<lb/> O call not this
							delusion! Virtue lives<lb/> More in the mind and heart than in the body,<lb/> And all of grandeur we enjoy, and
							beauty,<lb/> And love, and admiration, not the less<lb/> Is genuine, if it only be ideal!—<lb/> Without th'associations,
							which the mind<lb/> To matter brings, it is a barren essence.</p>
						<p> It may be said that Ferney's Bard is ever<lb/> All intellect:—but then it is an intellect<lb/> Applied to Man in his most
							artificial<lb/> Condition in society; with manners,<lb/> Passions, ambitions, toils, pursuits of pleasure,<lb/> Of
							judgment rules, and estimates of merit,<lb/> Conventional,—far more the close result<lb/> Of nice observance, than of pure
							invention:<lb/> Not the embodiment of abstract thoughts<lb/> In living imagery, but itself abstraction,<lb/> Subtle,
							unsimpathising with the heart,<lb/> Calling forth only the keen faculties<lb/> Of apprehension, judgment, memory!—</p>
						<p> These are miscall'd delusions, which removed,<lb/> Then all the charms of life dissolve away!<lb/> It is not reason, which
							the callous give<lb/> That sacred name! They stupidly call reason<lb/> That which their hands can touch, and eyes can
							see,<lb/> And ears can hear; and they are sceptical<lb/> On all which is unseen, unheard, unknown,<lb/> Save in the
							regions of imagination!<lb/> So, when the heart at the sublime and fair<lb/> In Man's conceptions to high rapture
							swells,<lb/> They call it an irrational delusion!<lb/> Thus reason is the damper and extinguisher,<lb/> Which not produces
							fruit, but only blights it.</p>
						<p> Far up among the mountain gorges lies<lb/> The rude domain of craggy Faucigny.<lb/> Its ancient feudal lords were
							sovereign princes;<lb/> And high were their alliances, and rivals<lb/> Of the Genevan Counts, and those of Savoy!<lb/> Oft
							on the summits of its crags are perch'd<lb/> The fragments of their castellated towers<lb/> Among the clouds in most
							magnificent form;<lb/> And in its narrow vallies green is view'd<lb/> The loveliness of nature in her softest<lb/> And
							sweetest hues and features. There, St.-Gervais,<lb/> I pass'd an autumn month in thy abode,<lb/> Since which twelve busy
							years have pass'd away,<lb/> Bringing in their career full many a change<lb/> To Europe, and to half the world
							besides!</p>
						<p> Imagination cannot figure scenes<lb/> More beautiful, more grand, of rural shapes<lb/> And hues more full of
							ravishment,<lb/> Than thine, St.-Gervais, in an autumn day<lb/> Of splendor; nor a peasantry in childhood<lb/> Of face
							more lovely, and seemingly more happy!<lb/> Beneath th'incessant sound of the cascade,<lb/> In foamy torrents of white
							spray descending<lb/> From its precipitous heights, was plac'd th'abode,<lb/> For congregated crews of strangers
							built,<lb/> Who come the medical powers to seek of waters<lb/> Sulphureous, bursting from its iron rocks!<lb/> It is a
							strange concurrence, from all nations<lb/> Deep in this mountainous solitude to meet<lb/> The creatures of the busy social
							world,<lb/> Soldiers, and politicians, lawyers, authors,<lb/> Churchmen, and men of commerce, fluttering insects<lb/> Of
							buzzing fashion;—most in morning rambles<lb/> Seeking by air and exercise, and impulse<lb/> Of viewing nature's wonders to
							beguile<lb/> The loneliness and savage imagery,<lb/> Which overcomes the feebleness of spirits<lb/> Of artificial
							creatures bred in cities;<lb/> A vain enervating and languid course<lb/> Of days to seek a false enjoyment in!</p>
						<p> Roving along the river's banks, or clambering<lb/> The rocky summits by the brushwood twigs,<lb/> Or by the circling or
							meandring paths<lb/> Cut thro dwarf woods, hard labouring up the steeps<lb/> To hamlets perch'd like eagle eyries
							high<lb/> Among the snowy clouds, where yet the haunts<lb/> Of mountain-peasantry at crowded marts<lb/> Are found with
							human commerce babbling loud,<lb/> And striking by the sight of wild costume,<lb/> Of Alpine loneliness, where half the
							winter<lb/> In snow immur'd they sleep their hours away!<lb/> Yet here the busy passions, here the cunning<lb/> Of
							bargain-makers, the pert vanity<lb/> Of ogle-eyed coquets, in restless search<lb/> Of admiration, the devices subtle<lb/>
							Of craving avarice, and the dull obstinacy<lb/> Of boors, from ignorant demand ne'er driven!</p>
						<p> But, O how active in these mighty frolics<lb/> Of nature is imagination's power!<lb/> Here where the ruin'd turret,
							hanging still<lb/> On heights of seeming inaccessibility,<lb/> Impels the mind to work upon the hardihood<lb/> Of feudal
							gallantry, yet richly dight<lb/> With chivalrous adornments of grand feasts,<lb/> The music and the dance, and beauty's
							eyes<lb/> Reigning their influence,"— the heart-rousing tale<lb/> Of damsels in distress, by giants held<lb/> Imprison'd,
							and by fell enchanter's wands<lb/> Kept in delusion's sense-distracting wiles,<lb/> In danger to the pure fidelity,<lb/>
							Sworn to some favour'd lover,—with a store<lb/> Of fictions raising up the hair on end,—<lb/> Visit thy poet's dreams, and
							daily musings:—<lb/> And here with half-shut eyes he sits, absorb'd<lb/> In visions, while the torrents roar, and
							sparkles<lb/> Of upthrown spray awake him now and then;<lb/> And from his seat he starts, and recollects<lb/> He yet is
							mingled with the damping intercourse<lb/> Of daily life, and groveling characters,<lb/> Who lick the dust alone, and crawl
							the earth;<lb/> And soon the bell will sound to summon him<lb/> To crowded table of world-judging strangers.</p>
						<p> Beneath the scorching sun too oft I rambled<lb/> Over thy burning rocks; when fierce disease<lb/> Rag'd in my veins, and
							made my painful footsteps<lb/> Trembling and insecure; and thus when winter<lb/> Came sharp at Florence over Arno's
							waves,<lb/> Curdled my blood again, and I once more<lb/> On the sad couch of sickness doom'd to linger,<lb/> Pass'd many a
							month, while o'er me death his dart<lb/> Held. Still I strove the mental flame to nurse,<lb/> And with the visions of the
							moral fable,<lb/> And curious rolls of antiquarian lore,<lb/> Alternately my agonies I sooth'd:<lb/> Nor yet are all the
							fruits of those fair studies<lb/> Utterly faded and forgotten. Willoughby,<lb/> Thy fiction, seemingly historic,
							draws<lb/> Sometimes the thoughtful reader's eye, where shines<lb/> Raleigh's adventrous spirit, mingled with<lb/> Thy
							softer sufferings, sweet Arabella,<lb/> Punish'd for too much royalty of blood!</p>
						<p> And thus the genealogic lore work'd out<lb/> From many a dry and uninviting source,<lb/> Stands in fair types of thy
							illustrious city,<lb/> O Florence, ancient seat of mighty genius,<lb/> Of splendid arts and learning from the dust<lb/> Of
							black oblivion to full life recall'd!<lb/> Sometimes 'tis good that we should quit the world,<lb/> And in earth's most
							magnificent solitudes<lb/> New-plume our wings for contemplation.<lb/> But th'intermixture of the odious puppets<lb/> Of
							that world's most delusive stage, our steps<lb/> Following, defeats the working of the spell.<lb/> Strange mixtures in my
							mind did that month's residence<lb/> Produce;—and not less strange, perchance, upon<lb/> The morbid current of my heated
							veins,<lb/> By force of the sulphureous waters, that<lb/> The vapoury rocks threw forth. There, Coningsby,<lb/> I clos'd
							thy tragic Tale: a tale neglected<lb/> By the hard-hearted reading multitude;<lb/> Yet, confident am I, not
							undeserving<lb/> Of sensibility's abundant tears.</p>
						<p> These Baths did for a time appease the tumults<lb/> Raging within my being's purple streams:<lb/> But much I doubt, if
							they did not repell,<lb/> Rather than cure. For never from that year<lb/> Has my blood rightly flow'd. And then the
							troubles<lb/> Of mind and heart, without the added pangs<lb/> Of a disorder'd body, were sufficient<lb/> To overwhelm
							gigantic strength of spirit!</p>
						<p> But Italy, O Italy, in charms<lb/> Of Nature most profuse, would I could live<lb/> With thee! The Alpine passage to thy
							realms<lb/> Gave me new life by its stupendous grandeur.</p>
						<p> And thou, O Florence, smiling then in warmth,<lb/> Like spring, though dark November's clouds in other<lb/> Climes were
							collecting o'er the misty sky!</p>
						<p> But Winter came at last,—and with a vengeance,<lb/> As sharp as in the dreaded North! And now<lb/> I sunk once more, and
							bow'd to kiss the feet<lb/> Of Death. In that forever-fam'd abode,<lb/> My hours were doom'd to the sick chamber's
							bounds,<lb/> And where adored poetry, and rich painting,<lb/> And magic sculpture, reign'd o'er every scene,<lb/> And
							shone on every wall; where history,<lb/> And all the mellowest eloquence of learning,<lb/> Haunted all sites; and Medicean
							splendor<lb/> Was intertwined with every hallow'd object,<lb/> All was a blank to me! For in the tortures<lb/> Of my
							convulsed frame, and use of limbs<lb/> Lost, my position was scarce more auspicious,<lb/> Than in some dull unconsecrated
							haunt.</p>
						<p> Then once more with the spring the fever'd blood<lb/> Seem'd it's sad venomous bitterness to calm,<lb/> And now where
							Virgil's holy relics lie,<lb/> And o'er the Neapolitan Bay the summit<lb/> Of proud Vesuvius vomits fluid flames,<lb/> My
							destiny convey'd me. Pisa fam'd<lb/> In all Italian annals, and of late<lb/> To Britons dear for its most noble
							poet's<lb/> Abode, in the hurried tempest-shaken days<lb/> Preceding his heroic Grecian death,<lb/> I pass'd, and at
							Livornia's busy port<lb/> First cast my eyes on Mediterranean waves.</p>
						<p> Thence round Italia's shores, and sea-gem'd isles,<lb/> Elba, and Sarde, and many a name in story<lb/> Familiar, for
							eleven long sunburnt days,<lb/> We voyag'd—not without full many a peril<lb/> Of tempest and of pirates; and with joy<lb/>
							Laugh'd, and were near convuls'd, when that bright Bay<lb/> Of glorious beauty and sublimity<lb/> Mix'd, to whose shores
							our frail and crowded bark<lb/> Was destin'd, open'd on our dazzled view.<lb/> 'Twas noon, the end of May:—the radiant
							sun<lb/> Was on the bosom of the mighty waters,<lb/> And on the tops of the unnumbered promontories,<lb/> Towns, hamlets,
							castles, villas; and St.-Elmo<lb/> Shew'd her magnificent summit. To the harbour,<lb/> Crowded with ships of many a
							distant nation,<lb/> Our prow in joy exulting cut its way.</p>
						<p> The solar beams now with a flame intolerable<lb/> Shot right upon our heads: and still we had<lb/> T'endure the torments
							long of quarantine,<lb/> Mid crowded vessels, filth, and stench, and noise,<lb/> Lock'd closely side to side,—the
							suffering<lb/> Was scarce endurable;—and then, to crown it,<lb/> My passport was irregular,—and I<lb/> Was threaten'd with
							a prison, and had nearly<lb/> Incurr'd that order of a despot power.</p>
						<p> Now in that beautiful and unrival'd city<lb/> Hotels were crowded, and around the beds,<lb/> And on the floors where we
							repos'd, were seen<lb/> Scorpions disporting in dire multitudes.<lb/> But soon, Chiaia, thy enchanting spot<lb/> Receiv'd
							us, with Vesuvius on our left,<lb/> The Bay before us—and upon the rock<lb/> Of laurel to the right where Sannazaro<lb/>
							Dwelt, the still worship'd tomb where Virgil sleeps!<lb/> There six sweet months of nature's highest brilliance<lb/> We
							whil'd away, though Carbonari troubles<lb/> For a short moment clouded our fair joys<lb/> With fear and peril, and at last
							the storm<lb/> Blackening, and seemingly about to burst,<lb/> Drove us away to Rome. It was an earthly<lb/> Paradise,
							inasmuch as nature's charms<lb/> Could make it one—and ill departed from!<lb/> For Rome—the heavy air to me o'ercame<lb/>
							All its attractions. Not a day of health<lb/> There could I find, and gladly did I seek,<lb/> After four months another
							change of climate.</p>
						<p> Then thee, Ferrara, fam'd for Estè's house,<lb/> And Tasso's amorous madness, and ye hills<lb/> Of Euganean lustre, that
							the beams<lb/> Of eve on Petrarch's holy age reflected;<lb/> And Padua, thee; and most of all immortal<lb/> Gem of the
							Adriatic, wave-clad Venice!</p>
						<p> And then a roll of names which but to mention<lb/> Awakens all the treasures of the mind<lb/> Verona, Bergamo, Vicenza,
							Milan,<lb/> Turin and Chambery, and steep Mont Cenis.</p>
						<p> And then again we to thy Lake return'd,<lb/> O subject of my song, and where an empress<lb/> Had late resided, took up our
							abode.<lb/> Intensely here my literary labours<lb/> I plied, and clos'd the haunted Tale of Huntley<lb/> And Alice
							Berkeley, and Sir Ambrose Grey,<lb/> And shriek-fill'd Hellingsley's spoil-coverd hall:<lb/> And here the Tale of Odo's
							Count went on,<lb/> Where innocent and most angelic Bertha<lb/> Bore on the scaffold an heroic death.</p>
						<p> And now upon the dry and most perplex'd<lb/> Question of Wealth of Nations, and the means<lb/> Of wise and economic
							circulation,<lb/> I meditated deeply, and thus clear'd<lb/> To my own mind's conviction the enigma.</p>
						<p> And then the Bibliomania, which had long<lb/> Infected my researches, came again<lb/> To occupy too many of my hours.<lb/>
							And all the while the torments of affairs<lb/> Of wretched business, and the wiles of cunning<lb/> Extortion, wickedness,
							ingratitude,<lb/> Audacious insult, inconceivable<lb/> Perversion of the laws, meant for protection,<lb/> To instruments
							of wrong and ravenous rapine!<lb/> And during all, a heart by nature timid,<lb/> Morbid, and rous'd with dangerous
							emotion<lb/> At slightest cause for care, grief, or regret:<lb/> And when they touch'd, losing the happy train<lb/> Of
							those ideas to the Muses suited.<lb/> But ever in my utmost agonies<lb/> I struggled still the trembling pen to
							guide,<lb/> And call'd the frighten'd Muse to calm my breast.</p>
						<p> Yet what will not malignity pervert?<lb/> This energy of stout resistance, which<lb/> May fairly arrogate the name of
							virtue,<lb/> Has oft-times by the cruelty of censure<lb/> Been deem'd a reckless disregard of duties!<lb/> As if the
							virtue were in brooding over<lb/> Evils we cannot change! as if to smile,<lb/> And live in regions of imagination,<lb/>
							When coarse reality is unendurable<lb/> Misery, were a crime to be reproach'd!<lb/> "But when" it may be said, "your
							enchanted ears<lb/>"Are listening to Elysian waterfalls,<lb/> "You will not hearken to the trumpet's call,<lb/> "When
							summon'd back to duty!" It may be,<lb/> The Muse's votary is sometimes lost<lb/> In this delirium: will he be the
							less<lb/> In the wild depths of unresisted grief?</p>
						<p> But now incessant were th'insulting calls<lb/> On my most outrag'd spirit! Morns and nights<lb/> Scarcely suffic'd for the
							exhausting tasks,<lb/> Necessity and just defence impos'd<lb/> On my worn pen. But my afflicted heart,<lb/> Ah, far more
							than my pen, was work'd and worn.</p>
						<p> It was an iron winter, most severe<lb/> In its extremities of snow and storm.<lb/> Right up against the roaring Lake the
							windows<lb/> Of my abode, now far within the city,<lb/> Lay. One dark morning in December's depth,<lb/> As by the blazing
							fire on that romance<lb/> Most magical above all others of<lb/> The great Magician of the North, the Pirate,<lb/> My eyes,
							imagination, heart, intent<lb/> I sat, a shriek came down the Lake, the House<lb/> Trembled and rock'd, and twice from my
							shook chair<lb/> Was I near tumbled on the floor: the bells<lb/> Through all the house rang, and St. Peter's sounded,<lb/>
							And all the church bells thro the town were shaken,<lb/> And also gave the signal. 'Twas an earthquake!—<lb/> Slight—but
							appalling! Ah! how often since<lb/> Have I on the portentous moment dwelt!<lb/> In the same room, and by the self-same
							fire,<lb/> After an interval of an hundred months,<lb/> When I had dwelt in many a far abode,<lb/> And once for eight and
							twenty months again<lb/> My native soil inhabited, some sudden<lb/> Convulsion struck upon my vital strings;<lb/> And
							eight and forty hours I gasp'd for breath.</p>
						<p> Then came the sleepless bed again; the appetite<lb/> Gone; and the loss of limbs; and eighteen nights<lb/> Of dangerous
							agony, and strange excitement<lb/> Of intellect, beyond its natural power;<lb/> Bursts of wild brilliance hitherto
							unknown<lb/> To my weak faculties; unintermitted<lb/> Toil of the intellect e'en for nineteen<lb/> Successive hours; and
							still the body torn;<lb/> Limbs paralis'd, and all the mortal part<lb/> Of earthly mould, sick even to death's door!</p>
						<p> Thus it appears, as if the soul can work,<lb/> In bold defiance of the body's will:—<lb/> And sometimes blazes most, when
							it is nearest<lb/> To its departure. Much I've travel'd since<lb/> In mind and heart; and in my own conceit<lb/> Have far
							advanc'd. I cannot count the pages<lb/> Of various matter I have written and printed<lb/> Since that most perilous
							crisis,—poetry,<lb/> And prose-romance, and politics, and memoirs;<lb/> And dry antiquities, and moral essays,<lb/> On
							which my busy pen is ever running.<lb/> "Accursed scribbler!" cries the wretch, whose false<lb/> Concoctions, like
							th'enchanter's forceful spear,<lb/> My plume goes forth to pierce, and open lay<lb/> His snares of dread destruction to
							the sun!<lb/> "Scribendi cacoethes! odious passion!<lb/> "Be fire to its relentless energies,<lb/> "And light upon it
							quickly, and consume it!"</p>
						<p> Not yet thou grand destroyer! O not yet<lb/> Will be thy wish accomplish'd! I have slept<lb/> At times, 'tis true, amid
							this morning's task,<lb/> As if my strength was failing, and that weakness<lb/> And age, not fire and violence, would
							consume me!<lb/> There are, on whose enormous wickedness<lb/> When I am call'd to meditate, the' emotion<lb/> Exhausts my
							spirits more than other labour<lb/> By day and night continued! My torn nerves<lb/> Long tremble and distort, ere they
							subside<lb/> Again, the calm idea to permit!<lb/> I am the being but of impulses,<lb/> And when my heart cannot direct,
							and light,<lb/> My head is barren, and my hand is weak.<lb/> I have no abstract intellect, and cannot<lb/> Act by what
							cold dry reason calls a duty;—<lb/> The worse for me! for I am told 'tis this<lb/> Which only virtue constitutes! and
							feeling<lb/> And grand emotion, though 'tis on the side<lb/> Of virtuous sympathies, and love of beauty,<lb/> And
							admiration of heroic conduct,<lb/> Is but an impulse of involuntary<lb/> Unconscience-sprung, and therefore valueless,
							passion!<lb/> As for myself, I cannot comment thus<lb/> In my severest and most self-condemning<lb/> Moments! For
							impulses, if they are good,<lb/> Must spring from virtue's fountains: a bad heart<lb/> Can never pour forth pure and
							blessed waters!<lb/> It may produce them mingled: but the taste,<lb/> The scent, the penetrating eye, th'effect,<lb/>
							After a moment's pause upon the bosom,<lb/> Will the infusion of the ill discover:—<lb/> The false bursts, murmurs,
							flashes, sparkles, dies!</p>
						<p> If such are these effusions, if the vapour<lb/> Of false emotion swells them, if the thoughts<lb/> Come not direct and
							unsophisticate<lb/> From the undrug'd and uninfected bosom,<lb/> If the heart's fiat be not on their utterance,<lb/> Then
							sweep them to the pit where they may perish,<lb/> And never bubble, murmur, sparkle more!<lb/> And may I be obedient to
							the doom<lb/> That I shall then deserve, and hide my head<lb/> In just obscurity, and linger out<lb/> The little remnant
							of my days in silence,<lb/> And sink into the grave, unwept, unknown! </p>

						<p rend="emph">Robert Williams Buchanan (from The Earthquake [1885], in The Complete Poetical Works [1901], vol. II)</p>
						<p> </p>
						<p> Buchanan recounts Magellan's voyage, and likens "War, Superstition, Anarchy, Disease, / Monsters that Man has fashion'd"
							to Frankenstein.</p>
						<p> (SPOKEN IN THE PERSON OF ONE OF HIS LIEUTENANTS,<lb/> DYING AT HOME, YEARS AFTER <lb/> THE WONDERFUL VOYAGE WAS OVER.)</p>
						<p> Send no shaven monks to shrive me, close the doors against their cries;<lb/> Liars all! ay, rogues and liars, like the
							Father of all lies;<lb/> Nay, but open wide the casement, once more let me feast my gaze<lb/> On the glittering signs of
							Heaven, on the mighty Ocean-ways!</p>
						<p> Who's that knocking? Fra Ramiro? Left his wine-cup and arm-chair,<lb/> Come again with book and ointment, to anoint me and
							prepare?<lb/> Sacramento!— send him packing, with his comrades shaven-crown'd:<lb/> Liars all! and the prince of liars is
							their Pope! The world is round! </p>
						<p> See, the Ocean! like quicksilver, throbbing in the starry light!<lb/> See the stars and constellations, strangely,
							mystically bright!<lb/> Ah, but there, beyond our vision, other stars look brightly down,<lb/> Other stars, and high among
							them, great Magellan's starry crown! </p>
						<p> O Magellan! lord and master!— mighty soul no Pope could tame!<lb/> On the seas and on the heavens you have left your
							radiant name;<lb/> Brightly shall it burn for ever, o'er the waters without bound,<lb/> Proving Pope and Priests still
							liars, while the sun-kist world is round.</p>
						<p> Let the cowls at Salamanca cluster thick as rook and daw!<lb/> Let the Pope, with right hand palsied, clutch his
							thunderbolts of straw!<lb/> Heaven and Ocean, here and yonder, put their feeble dreams to shame;<lb/> Earth is round, and
							high above it shines Magellan's starry name!</p>
						<p> Have you vanish'd, O my Master? O my Captain, King of men,<lb/> Shall I never more behold you standing at the mast
							again,<lb/> Eagle-eyed, and stern and silent, never sleeping or at rest,<lb/> Pallid as a man of marble, ever looking to
							the west?</p>
						<p> As I lie and watch the heavens, once again I seem to be<lb/> Out upon the waste of waters, sailing on from sea to sea. . .
							.<lb/> Hark! what's that?— the monks intoning in the chapel close at hand?<lb/> Nay, I hear but sea-birds screaming, round
							dark capes of lonely land. </p>
						<p> Out upon the still equator, on a sea without a breath,<lb/> Burning, blistering in the sunlight, we are tossing sick to
							death;<lb/> Every night the sun sinks crimson on the water's endless swell,<lb/> Every dawn he rises golden, fiery as the
							flames of Hell.</p>
						<p> Seventy days our five brave vessels welter in the watery glare,<lb/> O'er the bulwarks hang the seamen panting
							open-mouth'd for air;<lb/> On the 'Trinitie' Magellan watches in a fierce unrest,<lb/> Never doubting or despairing, ever
							looking to the west.</p>
						<p> Then at last with fire and thunder open cracks the sultry sky,<lb/> While the surging seas roll under, swift before the
							blast we fly,<lb/> Westward, ever westward, plunging, while the waters wash and wail;<lb/> Nights and days drift past in
							darkness while we sail, and sail, and sail.</p>
						<p> Then the Tempest, like an eagle by a thunderbolt struck dead,<lb/> With one last wild flap of pinions, droppeth spent and
							bloody-red,<lb/> Purpling Heaven and Ocean lieth on the dark horizon's brink,<lb/> While upon the decks we gather
							silently, and watch him sink.</p>
						<p> Troublously the Ocean labours in a last surcease of pain,<lb/> While a soft breath blowing westward wafts us softly on the
							main,— ;<lb/> Nearer to the edge of darkness where the flat earth ends, men swear,<lb/> Where the dark abysses open, gulf
							on gulf of empty air!</p>
						<p> Creeping silently our vessels enter wastes of wondrous weed,<lb/> Slimy growth that clings around them, tangle growing
							purple seed,<lb/> Staining all the waste of waters, making isles of floating black,<lb/> While the seamen, pointing
							fingers, shrink in dread, and cry, 'Turn back!'</p>
						<p> On the 'Trinitie' Magellan stands and looks with fearless eyes — ;<lb/> 'Fools, the world is round!' he answers, 'onward
							still our pathway lies;<lb/> Though the gulfs of Hell yawn'd yonder, though the Earth were ended there,<lb/> I would
							venture boldly forward, facing Death and Death's despair.'</p>
						<p> On their knees they kneel unto him, cross themselves and shriek afraid,<lb/> Pallid as a man of marble stands the Captain
							undismayed,<lb/> Claps on sail and leads us onward, while the ships crawl in his track,<lb/> Slowly, scarcely moving,
							trailing monstrous weeds that hold them back.</p>
						<p> On each vessel's prow a seaman stands and casts the sounding-lead,<lb/> In the cage high up the foremast gather watchers
							sick with dread.<lb/> Calmly on the poop Magellan marks the Heavens and marks the Sea,<lb/> Darkness round and darkness
							o'er him, closing round the 'Trinitie.'</p>
						<p> Days and nights of deeper darkness follow — ; then there comes the cry,<lb/> 'He is mad— ;Death waits before us— turn the
							ships and let us fly!'<lb/> Storm of mutinous anger gathers round the Captain stern and true,<lb/> Near the foremast,
							fiercely glaring, flash the faces of the crew.</p>
						<p> One there is, a savage seaman, gnashing teeth and waving hands,<lb/> Strides with curses to the Captain where with folded
							arms he stands,— <lb/> 'Turn, thou madman, turn!' he shrieketh— scarcely hath he spoke the word,<lb/> Ere a bleeding log
							he falleth, slaughter'd by the Leader's sword!</p>
						<p> 'Fools and cowards!' cries Magellan, spurning him with armèd heel,<lb/> 'If another dreams of flying, let him speak— and
							taste my steel!'<lb/> Like caged tigers when the Tamer enters calmly, shrink the band,<lb/> While the Master strides among
							them, cloth'd in mail and sword in hand.</p>
						<p> O Magellan! lord and leader!— only He whose fingers frame<lb/> Twisted thews of pard or panther, knot them round their
							hearts of flame,<lb/> Light the emeralds burning brightly in their eyeballs as they roll,<lb/> Could have made that
							mightier marvel, thine inexorable soul!</p>
						<p> Onward, ever on, we falter— till there comes a dawn of Day<lb/> Creeping ghostly up behind us, mirror'd faintly far
							away,<lb/> While across the seas to starboard loometh strangely land or cloud — <lb/> 'Land to starboard!' cries Magellan—
							'Land!' the seamen call aloud. </p>
						<p> Southward steering creep the vessels, while the lights of morning grow;<lb/> Fades the land, while in our faces chilly fog
							and vapour blow;<lb/> Colder grows the air, and clinging round the masts and stiffening sails<lb/> Freezes into crystal
							dewdrops, into hanging icicles!</p>
						<p> Suddenly arise before us, phantom-wise, as in eclipse,<lb/> Icebergs drifting on the Ocean like innumerable ships— <lb/>
							In the light they flash prismatic as among their throng we creep,<lb/> Crashing down to overwhelm us, thundering to the
							thund'rous Deep!</p>
						<p> Towering ghostly and gigantic, 'midst the steam of their own breath,<lb/> Moving northward in procession in their snowy
							shrouds of Death,<lb/> Rise the bergs, now overtoppling like great fountains in the air,<lb/> While along their crumbling
							edges slips the seal and steals the bear.</p>
						<p> With the frost upon his armour, like a skeleton of steel,<lb/> Stands the Master, waiting, watching, clad in cold from
							head to heel;<lb/> Loud his voice rings through the vapours, ordering all and leading on,<lb/> Till the bergs, before his
							finger, fall back ghostlike, and are gone!</p>
						<p> Once again before our vision sparkles Ocean wide and free,<lb/> With the sun's red ball of crimson resting on the rim of
							sea;— <lb/> 'Lo, the sun!' he laughs exulting— 'still he beckons far away— <lb/> Earth is round, and on its circle
							evermore we chase the Day!'</p>
						<p> As he speaks the sunset blackens. Twilight trembles through the skies<lb/> For a moment— then the heavens open all their
							starry eyes!<lb/> Suddenly strange Constellations flash from out the fields of blue— <lb/> Not a star that we remember,
							not a splendour priestcraft knew!</p>
						<p> Sinking on his knee, Magellan prays: 'Now glory be to God!<lb/> To the Christ who led us forward on His wondrous watery
							road!<lb/> See, the heavens give attestation that our search shall yet be crowned,<lb/> Proving Pope and Priests still
							liars, and the sun-kist world is round!'</p>
						<p> Sparkling ruby-ray'd and golden round the dusky neck of Night<lb/> Hangs the jewel'd Constellation, strangely, mystically
							bright— <lb/> Pointing at it cries the Master, 'By the God we all adore,<lb/> It shall bear my name, Magellan!' and it
							bears it, evermore.</p>
						<p> Storms arising sweep us onward, but each night our courage grows,<lb/> Newer portals of the Heavens seem to open and
							enclose,<lb/> Showing in the blue abysm vistas luminously strange,<lb/> Sphere on sphere, and far beyond them fainter
							lights that sparkle and change!</p>
						<p> Presently once more we falter among pools of drifting scum,<lb/> Weed and tangle— o'er the blackness curious sea-birds go
							and come— <lb/> While to southward looms a darkness, as of land or gathering cloud,<lb/> Northward too, another darkness,
							and a sound of breakers loud.</p>
						<p> Once again they call in terror, 'Turn again, for Death is near!<lb/> Once again he quells their tumult, smiting till they
							crouch in fear.<lb/> On the darkness closing round them, land or cloud, our fleet is led,<lb/> Fighting tides that sweep
							them backward, flowing from some gulf of dread.</p>
						<p> Next, the Vision! next the Morning, after rayless nights and days,<lb/> Twinkling on a great calm Ocean stretching far as
							eye can gaze,— <lb/> Newer heavens and newer waters, solitary and profound,<lb/> Rise before us, while behind us Day
							arises crimson-crown'd!</p>
						<p> Turning we behold the shadows of the straits through which we sped,<lb/> Then again our eyes look forward where the
							windless waters spread;<lb/> Overhead the sun rolls golden, moving westward through the blue,<lb/> Reddens down the
							far-off heavens, beckons bright, and we pursue.</p>
						<p> On that vast and tranquil Ocean, folding wings the strong winds dwell,<lb/> Sleeping softly or just stirring to the
							water's tranquil swell,<lb/> Peaceful as the fields of heaven where the stars like bright flocks feed,— <lb/> So that many
							dream they wander thro' the azure Heaven indeed!</p>
						<p> Then Magellan, from its scabbard drawing forth his shining sword,<lb/> Grasps the blade, and downward bending dips the
							bright hilt overboard— <lb/> 'By the holy Cross's likeness, mirror'd in this hilt!' cries he,<lb/> 'Be this Ocean called
							Pacific, since it sleeps eternallie!'</p>
						<p> Pastured with a calm eternal, drawing down the clouds in dew,<lb/> Sighing low with soft pulsations, darkly, mystically
							blue,<lb/> Lies that long untrodden Ocean, while for months we sail it o'er;<lb/> Ever dawns the sun behind us, ever
							swiftly sets before.</p>
						<p> But like devils out of Tophet, as we sail with God for Guide,<lb/> Rise the Spectres, Thirst and Hunger, hollow-cheek'd
							and cruel-eyed;<lb/> Fierce and famish'd creep the seamen, while the tongues between their teeth<lb/> Loll like tongues of
							hounds for water, dry as dust and black with death.</p>
						<p> Many fall and die blaspheming, 'Give us food!' the living call— <lb/> Pallid as a man of marble stands the Master gaunt
							and tall,<lb/> Hunger fierce within him also, and his parch'd lips prest in pain,<lb/> But a mightier thirst and hunger
							burning in his heart and brain!</p>
						<p> Black decks blistering in the sunlight, sails and cordage dry as clay,<lb/> Crawl the ships on those still waters night by
							night and day by day;<lb/> Then the rain comes, and we lap it as upon the decks it flows— <lb/> 'Spread a sail!' calls out
							the Master, and we catch it ere it goes.</p>
						<p> Now and then a lonely sea-bird hovers far away, and we<lb/> Crouch with hungry eyes and watch it fluttering closer o'er
							the sea,<lb/> Curse it if it flies beyond us, shoot it if it cometh nigh,<lb/> Share the flesh and blood among us,
							underneath the Captain's eye.</p>
						<p> Sometimes famish'd unto madness, fierce as wolves that shriek in strife,<lb/> One man springs upon another, stabs him with
							the murderous knife;<lb/> Then the Master, stalking forward where the murderer shrinks in dread,<lb/> Bids him kneel, and
							as he kneeleth cleaves him down, and leaves him dead.</p>
						<p> O Magellan! mighty Eagle, circling sunward lost in light,<lb/> Wafting wings of power and striking meaner things that
							cross thy flight,<lb/> God to such as thee gives never lambkin's love or dove's desire— <lb/> Nay, but eyes that scatter
							terror from a ruthless heart of fire!</p>
						<p> Give me wine. My pulses falter. . . So! . . . Confusion to the cowls!<lb/> They who hooted at my Eagle, eyes of bats and
							heads of owls!<lb/> Throw the casement open wider! There is something yet to tell— <lb/> How we came at last to waters
							where the naked islesmen dwell.</p>
						<p> Isles of wonder, fringed with coral, ring'd with shallows turquoise-blue,<lb/> Where bright fish and crimson monsters
							flash'd their jewel'd lights and flew,<lb/> Steeps of palm that rose to heaven out of purple depths of sea,<lb/> While
							upon their sunlit summits stirr'd the tufted cocoa-tree— </p>
						<p> Isles of cinnabar and spices, where soft airs for ever creep,<lb/> Scenting Ocean all around them with strange odours soft
							as sleep— <lb/> Isles about whose promontories danced the black man's light canoe,<lb/> Isles where dark-eyed women
							beckon'd, perfumed like the breath they drew.</p>
						<p> Drunken with the sight we landed, rush'd into the scented glades,<lb/> Treading down the scented branches, seized the
							struggling savage maids.<lb/> Ah, the orgy! Still it sickens!— blood of men bestrewed our path,<lb/> Till the islesmen
							rose against us, thick as vultures shrieking wrath.</p>
						<p> Then, the sequel! Nay, I know not how the damnëd deed could be— <lb/> By some islesman's poisoned arrow or some Spaniard's
							treacherie;<lb/> But one evening, as we struggled fighting to our boats on shore,<lb/> In the shallows fell the Captain,
							foully slain, and rose no more!</p>
						<p> O Magellan! O my Master! O my Captain, King of men!<lb/> Was it fit thou so shouldst perish, though thy work was over
							then,<lb/> Foully slain by foe or comrade, butcher'd like a common thing,<lb/> Thou whose eagle flight had circled Earth
							upon undaunted wing!</p>
						<p> Nay, but then my King had conquered! Earth and Ocean to his sight<lb/> Open'd had their wondrous visions, shaming
							centuries of night;<lb/> Nay, but even the shining Heavens kept the record of his fame— <lb/> Earth was round, and high
							above it shone Magellan's starry name. </p>
						<p> How our wondrous voyage ended? Nay, I know not,— all was done;<lb/> Lying in my ship I sickened, moaning, hidden from the
							sun.<lb/> Yea! the vessels drifted onward till they came to isles of calm,<lb/> Where some savage monarch hail'd them,
							standing underneath a palm.</p>
						<p> How the wanderers took these islands tributary to our King,<lb/> Show'd the Cross, baptized the monarch, homeward crept on
							weary wing?<lb/> Pshaw, 'tis nothing! All was over! He had staked his soul and gained,<lb/> They but reaped the Master's
							sowing, they but crawl'd where he had reigned!</p>
						<p> Hark! what sound is that? The chiming of the dreary vesper bell?<lb/> Nay, I hear but Ocean sighing, feel the waters heave
							and swell.<lb/> Earth is round, but sailing sunward with my Master still I fare— <lb/> Other Heavens his ship is
							searching,— and I go to seek him there! </p>
						<p> The wall of darkness round the rainy house<lb/> Broke as I ended, and a watery beam<lb/> Of sunshine struck the pane, and
							lingering on it,<lb/> Became prismatic. Then with quiet smile<lb/> Professor Mors, the truculent Irishman,<lb/> Whose
							treatise on the origin of worlds<lb/> Fluttered the Churches for a season, said:<lb/> 'Man conquers earth, and climbing
							yonder Heaven<lb/> Pursues the baleful gods from throne to throne!<lb/> Ah, but the strife was long, and even here<lb/> It
							hath not ended yet. Each Phantom laid,<lb/> Another rises, though on fearless wing<lb/> We creep from world to world. Evil
							abides,<lb/> And with her hideous mother, Ignorance,<lb/> Scatters pollution!'</p>
						<p>        Calmly answered him<lb/> Dan Paumanok, the Yankee pantheist:<lb/> 'Friend, I have dwelt on earth as long as
							you,<lb/> And found all evil here but forms of good!'<lb/> Whereat some laughed, and cried, 'A paradox!'<lb/> But, gravely
							leaning back in his arm-chair,<lb/> The greybeard cried, 'Knowledge and Ignorance,<lb/> I calculate, are sisters—
							otherwise<lb/> Named Good and Evil. Hand in hand they walk,<lb/> So like, that even those who know them best<lb/> Scarcely
							distinguish their identities!<lb/> Thro' the dark places of the troubled earth<lb/> The first walks radiant and the last
							gropes blind;<lb/> But when they come upon the mountaintops,<lb/> In the night's stillness, underneath the stars,<lb/> The
							last it is that ofttimes leads the first<lb/> And points her upward to the heavenly way!'</p>
						<p> 'If this be so,' the grim Professor cried,<lb/> Shrugging his shoulders with impatient sneer,<lb/> 'Then wrong is every
							whit as good as right,<lb/> The Darkness is no better than the Light<lb/> It comprehends not!' 'Certainly,' exclaimed<lb/>
							The melancholy transcendentalist;<lb/> 'One is the tally of the other, friend;<lb/> Nay more, they intermingle, and are
							one!<lb/> The morning dew, that scarcely bends the flowers,<lb/> Exhaled to heaven becomes the thunderbolt<lb/> That
							strikes and slays at noon.'</p>
						<p>             But Mors replied<lb/> With cold superior smile: 'A cheerful creed!<lb/> And comfortable,— since, whate'er
							befalls,<lb/> No matter if the foemen sack the city,<lb/> No matter if the plague-cart comes and goes,<lb/> No matter if
							the starving cry for bread,<lb/> The sleepy watchman calmly cries "All's well!"<lb/> For my poor part, as one whose youth
							was spent,<lb/> Not in pursuit of vain delusive dreams,<lb/> But in the halls of Science, whom I serve,<lb/> I fail to
							find in Evil any form<lb/> My mistress would be brought to christen good;<lb/> Nay, on my life,' he added, gathering
							zeal,<lb/> 'Than such a pantheistic lotus-flower<lb/> I'd rather choose those husks and shells of grace<lb/> John Calvin
							found when, prone on hands and knees,<lb/> He searched the garbage of Original Sin!<lb/> And rather than believe that Hell
							was Heaven,<lb/> People my Hell once more with soot-black fiends!<lb/> For Fever, Pestilence, and Ignorance<lb/> No angels
							are, fall'n from some high estate,<lb/> But devilish shapes indeed, beneath the heel<lb/> Of Hermes, god of healing and of
							light,<lb/> Soon to be trampled down and vanquishëd.<lb/>And other hideous things that waste the world,<lb/> War,
							Superstition, Anarchy, Disease,<lb/> Monsters that Man has fashion'd, like to that<lb/> Framed in the poet's tale by
							Frankenstein — <lb/> These shall be slain by their creator's hand,<lb/> Their Master's, even Man's. Survey the earth;<lb/>
							And see the sunrise of our saner creed<lb/> Scattering the darkness and the poisonous fumes<lb/> Which eighteen hundred
							weary years ago<lb/> Came from the sunless sepulchre of Christ.<lb/> Where Fever poisoned the pellucid wel<lb/> The
							drinking-fountain clear as crystal flows;<lb/> Where the marsh thicken'd and miasma spread,<lb/> Cities arise, with clean
							and shining streets<lb/> And sewers transmuting garbage into gold;<lb/> Where the foul blood-stained Altar once was
							set,<lb/> Stand the Museum and Laboratory;<lb/> The Library, the Gymnasium, and the Bath<lb/> Replace the palace;
							Manufactories,<lb/> Gathering together precious gifts for man,<lb/> Supplant the Monolith and Pyramid.<lb/> Thus
							everywhere the light of human love<lb/> Brightens a wondering convalescent world<lb/> Just rising from the spectre-haunted
							bed<lb/> Whereon it sickened of a long disease,<lb/> Attended by the false physician, Christ.'</p>
						<p> He paused; the fever of his eager words<lb/> Flash'd on from face to face until it reached<lb/> The face of Verity, the
							priest of Art;<lb/> But there it faded, for with pallid frown<lb/> And lifted hands, the gentle prophet cried:<lb/>
							'Light? Sunrise? Sunlight? I who speak have eyes,<lb/> And yet I see but darkness visible!<lb/> Lost is the azure in whose
							virgin depths<lb/> The filmy cirrus turn'd to Shapes divine,<lb/> Goddess and god, soft-vestured, white as wool!<lb/>
							Faded the sun, which, striking things of stone,<lb/> Turn'd them to statues which like Memnon's sang,<lb/> And palpitating
							over domes and walls,<lb/> Cover'd them o'er with forms miraculous,<lb/> Prismatic, which the hand of genius touch'd<lb/>
							And fixed in colour ere the forms could fade!<lb/> The world, you say, is heal'd; to me, it seems<lb/> Just smitten with
							the plague, and everywhere<lb/> The foul cloud gathers, shutting out the sun.<lb/> And that faint sound we deem the sweet
							church chimes,<lb/> Is but the death-bell tinkling, while the cart<lb/> Comes for its load of dark disfigured dead.<lb/>
							Meantime, within the foul dissecting-room<lb/> The form of Man, which, ere our plague-time came,<lb/> Was reverenced in
							shapes of loveliness,<lb/> Rosy in flesh, or snowy white in stone,<lb/> Lies desecrated, hideous, horrible,<lb/> Pois'ning
							the air and sickening the soul!<lb/> And on the slab, beneath the torturer's knife,<lb/> Man's gentle friend, the hound,
							shrieks piteously,<lb/> Answer'd by all the bleeding flocks of Pan!<lb/> And everywhere the fume of Anarchy,<lb/> And
							hideous monsters of machinery<lb/> Toiling for ever in their own thick breath,<lb/> Blends with the plague-smoke, blotting
							out the sun,<lb/> Whereby alone all shapes of beauty live!'</p>
						<p> 'Nay, nay,' cried Barbara, 'though it rains to-day<lb/> The lift will clear to-morrow. I believe<lb/> You all are partly
							right and partly wrong,<lb/> For surely many things in life that seem<lb/> Most evil are but blessings in disguise?<lb/>
							And difficult 'tis, maybe, to discern<lb/> Where Knowledge ends and Ignorance begins.<lb/> But then, again, what soul
							rejoices not<lb/> To see yon mailéd Perseus, Science, stand<lb/> Bruising the loathsome hydra of Disease,<lb/> Ay, often
							slaying Sin and conquering Death?<lb/> And yet, again, the counter-plea is true,<lb/> That Science, though she heals the
							wounds of life,<lb/> Whiles heals them cruelly and uncannily, — <lb/> Just shuts the sufferer in a sunless room,<lb/> And
							changes the old merry tunes of time<lb/> To daft mechanic discord, such as that<lb/> Which issues from the throats of mine
							and mill,<lb/> With sough of poisonous reek and flames more sad<lb/> Than ever came from Tophet!'</p>
						<p>             As she ceased,<lb/> Professor Mors, the pallid pessimist,<lb/> Outstretched his lean and skeletonian
							hand,<lb/> Pointing out sunward:— 'See!' he cried, 'the God,<lb/> Last-born and first-born, Nature's microcosm,<lb/> Who,
							sitting on his mighty throne of graves,<lb/> Murmurs the death-dirge of Humanity!<lb/> Had ye but ears, methinks that you
							might catch<lb/> The burthen of his melancholy song,<lb/> As I myself have heard it oftentimes<lb/> When wandering weary
							underneath the stars.<lb/> 'Twas thus, methinks, it ran, or something thus,<lb/> Full of a burthen strange and sad as
							ever<lb/> Was heard beside the wave-wash'd shores of Time.</p>

						<p> </p>
						<p>Evans calls the prospect that a painting has a life independent of its artist mere "Frankenstein nonsense." </p>
						<p>So, once more, my redoubtable painting,<lb/>    We'll battle it out, you and I!<lb/> In spite of your fencing and
							feinting,<lb/>    I swear to be master or die!</p>
						<p> What! your cunning shall baffle me? Shall it?<lb/>    Set your back to the easel and see!<lb/> Mark me! War to the
							knife—of the palette!<lb/>    No Frankenstein nonsense for me!</p>
						<p> No, my picture, I mean to achieve you,<lb/>    Yea, sell you, perhaps—and buy shares,<lb/> If indeed, I don't royally
							leave you,<lb/>    Encodicilled safe from my heirs,</p>
						<p> To the Gallery whence in defiance<lb/>    Pepper-Castor and Pollux astare<lb/> Look askant on the column and lions<lb/>
							   Through the haze of the squirts of the Square.</p>
						<p> Oh, I know all your tricks, to my sorrow,<lb/>    How you gird at your maker, and grin!<lb/> Well, it mayn't be to-day nor
							to-morrow;<lb/>    Who cares? I can wait and can win.</p>
						<p> Yet I own that a spirit more tricksy<lb/>    No wizard e'er spelled from the spheres:<lb/> Never Will-o'-the-Wisp, Puck or
							Pixie<lb/>    Led a thornier dance through the breres.</p>
						<p> Talk of spirits departed, out raking,<lb/>    Invading our ceilings and floors;<lb/> Not a whole neck-and-cropolis
							waking<lb/>    Could play me such antics as yours!</p>
						<p> One day, o'er my matins Manilla,<lb/>    I see through the smoke-eddies' curl<lb/> How you show me a skinless gorilla<lb/>
							   Where I fancied I painted a girl!</p>
						<p> On the limbs of my gracious she-presence<lb/>    I had dreamed I caught splendour and sun;<lb/> You display me the blue
							iridescence<lb/>    Of muscular veal, underdone!</p>
						<p> I wax wroth: 'tis the pestilent weather!<lb/>    This fog would make saffron look blue!<lb/> I re-glaze you: there's
							nothing like leather?<lb/>    Saint Luke, but there is! and 'tis you!</p>
						<p> With the tints of a tea-rosy dawn, I<lb/>    Re-glaze you again before dusk:<lb/> Next day you're a fine foxy-tawny,<lb/>
							   With a skin like a husk or a rusk!</p>
						<p> Yet again, with my model to study,<lb/>    Fighting shy of the yellows and blues;<lb/> You are clear of them both. You're
							pure muddy,<lb/>    With a patch on your cheek like a bruise!</p>
						<p> Well, who cares? Ere I finish the figure,<lb/>    My chameleon turn-coat, at last,<lb/> Spot of leopard and swartness of
							nigger<lb/>    Shall be printed in colours less fast!</p>
						<p> No, my Proteus, you quit not my fingers<lb/>    Till you tell Aristæus the whole:<lb/> Till you chant the last secret that
							lingers<lb/>    Untold in the deeps of your soul:</p>
						<p> Till you sing me how Art hath a story<lb/>    For all, yet for each one alone;<lb/> Like a rainbow, for all shedding
							glory,<lb/>    Though each sees a bow of his own!</p>
						<p> I can wait till I win. All the trouble<lb/>    Shall bloom in repose at the end;<lb/> All the glazing and scumbling thrice
							double<lb/>    I grudge not, to make you or mend.</p>
						<p> He did it, my Titian did it!<lb/>    He glazed, painting into the glaze;<lb/> Glazed again, again painted, and hid it<lb/>
							   Yet again with a radiant haze;</p>
						<p> Working on, till he showed you like Nature<lb/>    Life's flame shining out through the skin,<lb/> All the outlines and
							forms of the creature<lb/>    Lit up by the spirit within.</p>
						<p> Not the trick of the trowel and plaster<lb/>    To prove that his handling was free,<lb/> But the trick of the genuine
							master,<lb/>    The trick that no mortal can see.</p>
						<p> Aye, the deftest of all cheiromancy<lb/>    Is a Titian's sleight with the brush;<lb/> But the "handling" your critics so
							fancy<lb/>    He valued at less than a rush.</p>
						<p> Yes, for all that is greatest in painting<lb/>    The secret of secrets is work:<lb/> 'Tis your little Great Master, who,
							fainting,<lb/>    Casts about how to seem not to shirk.</p>
						<p> True, the rudest of strokes tells you clearly<lb/>    The artist who can from who can't:<lb/> But in Art, 'tis the master
							not merely<lb/>    Who can, but who does, that we want!</p>
						<p> Was it wrong, when old Fubsey, the dealer,<lb/>    Came ferreting over my way,<lb/> To leave you about as a feeler,<lb/>
							   To hear what mine ancient would say?</p>
						<p> "Har," quoth F, "going in for the Grecian?<lb/>    Classic, hay? Well, your model ain't bad:<lb/> And your colour—a shy at
							Venetian?<lb/>    You always was fond of a fad!"</p>
						<p> Was it wrong to explain: "This young person<lb/>    Is Calypso, once reckoned divine:<lb/> Highly mentioned by Homer,
							whose verse on<lb/>    The subject is thought rather fine.</p>
						<p> "This is how she appeared when she parted<lb/>    From an elderly gent in the Guards,<lb/> Whom she kept seven years, and
							then started<lb/>    To his wife with her kindest regards.</p>
						<p> "Poor young thing, you can see how acutely<lb/>    She feels it, her happiness wreckt!<lb/> Homer gives the costume, too,
							minutely,<lb/>    Which vastly improves the effect!"</p>
						<p> "Hm!" says Fubsey, "Next time you're a-doing<lb/>    A pot-boiler, take my advice,<lb/> And don't go a-fretting and
							stewing<lb/>    On subjects as won't fetch the price.</p>
						<p> "But you're always for fads! They don't answer:<lb/>    They're all well enough for mere lads:<lb/> But for you? I'm a
							practical man, sir,<lb/>    The market's too risky for fads!"</p>
						<p> Was it wrong to respond: "Yes, precisely,<lb/>    But suppose I've an object in view?<lb/> My Fubsey, thou reasonest
							wisely,<lb/>    But what's a poor devil to do?</p>
						<p> "Suppose, now, I wish to be famous?<lb/>    Don't you think I should get my R.A.?<lb/> I allow I'm a mere ignoramus,<lb/>
							   But isn't this picture the way?"</p>
						<p> "Har," says he, "well, I know what you are at, now,<lb/>    Though I don't see your way over clear:—<lb/> The R.A.—Yes,
							there's something in that, now,<lb/>    As good as two thousand a-year!</p>
						<p> "I like a young feller to hanker<lb/>    For fame as will help him to sell:<lb/> When fame is hard cash with your
							banker,<lb/>    Why, in course, to be famous is well.</p>
						<p> "It's your grand, high-falutin' vagaries,<lb/>    Your Haydons and that, as I hate:<lb/> Fools as fancy the world out o'

						<p> "There's yourself, now, at times. What a bother<lb/>    You make with your Titian and such!<lb/> Michael Angelo, this,

						<p> "Lord! It ain't as I don't understand your<lb/>    Tall talking: He's great, Michael A!<lb/> But I tell you, his grimness
							and grandeur<lb/>    Aren't articles likely to pay!</p>
						<p> "Look'ee here! Since I first took to dealing,<lb/>    There's a dozen at least made a name:<lb/> I don't paint, but I've
							got the right feeling,<lb/>    And I've noticed they all did the same.</p>
						<p> "It's the manner, sir! Manner's the ticket<lb/>    That brings in the grist to their mills:<lb/> Why, all over their
							pictures they stick it<lb/>    As plain as the stamp on Parr's pills.</p>
						<p> "Never mind what it is! Don't be queasy!<lb/>    Only yours let it be,—no mistake!<lb/> And, mind! It must come to you
							easy,<lb/>    Or you can't do the work that you'll take!</p>
						<p> "Ev'ry canvas as comes from your easel<lb/>    Must speak in the clearest of tones;<lb/> So that even the 'bus-cad who
							sees'll<lb/>    Say straight without book, 'That's a Jones!'</p>
						<p> "Look you, Tibbs—he can't paint worth a copper,<lb/>    But he's just got the manner as pays;<lb/> Why, he's twice as much
							grist in his hopper<lb/>    As he'll grind all the rest of his days!"</p>
						<p> Wouldst thou teach me, my Fubsey, what Art is?<lb/>    Nay, prithee, the lesson forbear!<lb/> I can dine, I can dance at
							thy parties,<lb/>    And learn the last Shibboleth there!</p>
						<p> Why, Miss A. can expound me all Ruskin<lb/>    As we swing from the whirl of a waltz;<lb/> Lady B., of the statelier
							buskin,<lb/>    Teach me Blake through the lancers by halts;</p>
						<p> Miss de C., like a seraph, but more so,<lb/>    O'er a spoonful of pine-apple ice<lb/> Can in confidence tell me the
							Torso<lb/>    Isn't Theseus at all—but so nice!</p>
						<p> My superfluous Fubsey! The manner,<lb/>    Past doubt, is the point to achieve.—<lb/> But which shall we follow—the
							banner<lb/>    Of Doing, or Making Believe?</p>
						<p> I opine, if I puzzled my cranium,<lb/>    Keeping always an eye on the till,<lb/> I could hit on a fine succedaneum<lb/>
							   More paying, my Fubsey, than skill.</p>
						<p> Say, for instance, I grandly demolish<lb/>    Chiaroscuro itself, thick and thin:<lb/> From my canvas all shadow
							abolish<lb/>    As a note of original sin?</p>
						<p> Bibbs has done it, and finds that it answers<lb/>    In quasi-Greek figure and group;<lb/> And a score or so young
							necromancers<lb/>    Follow Peter Schlemihl in a troop!</p>
						<p> Or suppose, with old Fibbs, the prodigious,<lb/>    I leave Nature and Art in the lurch<lb/> For sham sentiment,
							semi-religious?<lb/>    Why, the game is as safe as a church!</p>
						<p> Or with Nibbs, drop a tiny oasis<lb/>    Of plot in a desert of scene?<lb/> Or with Cribbs, grind eternal pink faces,<lb/>
							   Like as sausages made by machine?</p>
						<p> Ah, my Croesus! The butter and honey,<lb/>    I grant you, are excellent cheer!<lb/> I profoundly respect ready
							money—<lb/>    But why should I buy it so dear?</p>
						<p> God forgive thee, old Fubsey! Poor sinner!<lb/>    What a life! Yet he fancies it sweet!<lb/> Nay, perhaps he may wake
							after dinner,<lb/>    Musing, "Jones hasn't got such Lafite!"</p>
						<p> A mere puff-ball existence, divulging<lb/>    No hint of leaf, flower, or fruit;<lb/> Just a bulb of white fungus-pulp,
							bulging<lb/>    Over wrinkles which serve for a root.</p>
						<p> Yet, a gull not a whit less than guller,<lb/>    Poor soul, he's a creed of his own;<lb/> He believes that a pigment is
							colour,<lb/>    That a varnish—God bless him!—is tone.</p>
						<p> For the rest—tut! he cares not a fico:<lb/>    If he does, he prefers, I should say,<lb/> Mister Tibbs's fine gooseberry
							Cliquot<lb/>    To the cream of my Titian's Tokay.</p>
						<p> How politely the creature applauded<lb/>    My novel devotion to Fame!<lb/> He was hardly more kind when he lauded<lb/>
							   My "Two in Arquà"—for the frame!</p>
						<p> Think of Fame viâ Fubsey! How grateful<lb/>    The glory reserved for the brave!<lb/> What is life worth, compared with a
							plateful<lb/>    Of puffs from the fool and the knave?</p>
						<p> Fame at best! Would you know what she is? Mark<lb/>    Yon photographs there in the shop:<lb/> Patti, Darwin, Anonyma,
							Bismark,<lb/>    And the Siamese Twins up at top.</p>
						<p> What! You say, "Just a fugitive fashion;<lb/>    Notoriety, merely, not Fame?"<lb/> Well, but stripped of all temporal
							passion,<lb/>    How you will, the result is the same.</p>
						<p> What of Homer's serene High-and-mighties<lb/>    Whom he packed off to glory pell-mell?<lb/> What's Achilles, pray, more
							than Thersites?<lb/>    Penelope better than Nell?</p>
						<p> Homer's self—was he one? Was he many?<lb/>    Or compiled by some politic muse?<lb/> True, the poems are greater than
							any,<lb/>    But their greatest of glory is—whose?</p>
						<p> Yet he's greatest, we say. Who's to know it,<lb/>    Grant him greatest that lives to be read?<lb/> 'Tis most like, the

						<p> Fame, forsooth! A curator of dummies,<lb/>    She herself but a dummy as dumb!<lb/> A Sphinx dropt asleep o'er her

						<p> Foot of stag, ear of hare, eye of vulture,<lb/>    Nose of bloodhound once justly were fame:<lb/> Whose fame? In the

						<p> Who's your Phidias palæolithic<lb/>    Sketching mammoth from dawn to the dusk,<lb/> In an artist's fine frenzy

						<p> Our Shakspere himself:—what we rave on<lb/>    Isn't Shakspere—'tis only his robe.<lb/> He was greater at rest by the

						<p> No! The Fame I should care for is only<lb/>    When my hand has forgotten its art,<lb/> If some stout fellow-worker as
							lonely<lb/>    Shall see what I've done and take heart.</p>
						<p> Some wrestler, who, fighting it single,<lb/>    Shall look on my work and find cheer:<lb/> Shall muse, all his pulses
							a-tingle:<lb/>    "Aha, brother mine, art thou here?"</p>
						<p> So shall gird him again to his fighting,<lb/>    With a dominant plait of the brow:<lb/> "Brother mine, thou hast dealt me

						<p> That's Fame! What the deuce does it matter<lb/>    Who does what there is to be done?<lb/> Heaven bless us! Why make such

						<p> Well, and what if I'm known not for ever?<lb/>    'Tis a pity, perhaps—not for me!<lb/> Not for me! I have done my

						<p> Look you yonder! A lion-heart Viking<lb/>    Will win if he may to the Pole:<lb/> North, North! ever dodging and
							tricking<lb/>    The traps of the pack and the shoal.</p>
						<p> North, North! But the second December<lb/>    Hears his tread never more on the deck;<lb/> There he sits o'er the
							flickering ember,<lb/>    By the snow-covered wrecks of his wreck.</p>
						<p> His own gallant schooner, his darling,<lb/>    Has been cracked like a nut by the floe;<lb/> The bears, his sole
							neighbours, are snarling<lb/>    O'er a comrade half-scraped from the snow.</p>
						<p> All alone by the gnash of the surges<lb/>    In the creeks of the caverns beneath,<lb/> Where the world from its uttermost
							verges<lb/>    Looks out evermore upon death;</p>
						<p> And close, in the ice-fog abysmal,<lb/>    As the last flicker dies to a spark,<lb/> Comes that snarl through the clash
							cataclysmal<lb/>    Of icebergs atilt in the dark;</p>
						<p> He piles him a cairn from the lumber<lb/>    To tell that he once has been there,<lb/> Gives his soul back to God ere he
							slumber,<lb/>    And yields up his bones to the bear.</p>
						<p> Let his peers follow North with their navies!<lb/>    'Tis well, though they follow and fall!<lb/> Well for them if they
							find where his grave is,<lb/>    For himself—he was there! That was all!</p>
						<p> He was there! Yes, he wished they should find him,<lb/>    As he died ere he deigned to despond:<lb/> He was there! Might
							his brothers behind him<lb/>    See his tomb, and go venture beyond!</p>
						<p> And what, say his death-bed has drifted<lb/>    Far South as he lay there asleep;<lb/> That the thaws of the Gulf-stream
							have sifted<lb/>    His bones on the floor of the deep?</p>
						<p> He was there! Yea, though none through all ages<lb/>    Shall know of his venture again:<lb/> He was there! safe at least
							from the sage's<lb/>    "Poor fool, to go thither in vain!"</p>
						<p> Yes; he did what he meant to do duly,<lb/>    For he meant but to do what he could:<lb/> A Plus Ultra in Ultima Thule<lb/>
							   He raised—hath it perished or stood!</p>
						<p> He was there! Will ye seek in the Sistine<lb/>    The cairn of a like lion-heart,<lb/> Builded high on the peaks
							amethystine<lb/>    That point to the Pole-star of Art?</p>
						<p> Such an one, too, was there! Do ye know him --<lb/>    That soul who was taught of the Star?<lb/> Him, who pictured that
							terrible poem<lb/>    Up there with its burden: "Thus far!"</p>
						<p> Him, the Thaumaturge, shaping his will in<lb/>    High riddles on ceiling and wall;<lb/> Oracular, mystic, Sibylline,<lb/>
							   The secrets of Life and the Fall?</p>
						<p> Him, Prometheus, the Titan, the fearless,<lb/>    And his work—as of days ere the Flood,<lb/> Wrought in agony speechless
							and tearless,<lb/>    And splashed with a sweat as of blood?</p>
						<p> Do ye know him, the man Buonaroti,<lb/>    Him who watched by his Art as she fell,<lb/> With a brow that long since had

						<p> Prate of Fame to that prophet of sorrow?<lb/>    For his toil promise glory untold?<lb/> Nay! As soon might the Sorcerer
							borrow<lb/>    The gifts of a Peter for gold!</p>
						<p> Not for him nor his like shall the Circe<lb/>    Mix madness and blood with her wine!<lb/> She hath wooers enough at her
							mercy;<lb/>    Shall Odysseus go herd with her swine?</p>
						<p> Ha! Come hither, Odysseus! Calypso<lb/>    Lives here on my easel again!<lb/> Thus she looked when she grudged you a ship
							so,<lb/>    And wept when you talked of the main!</p>
						<p> O Love! Not the passion, the madness,<lb/>    Stamping eld on the brow of the youth,<lb/> But the quiet, the calm, and the

						<p> Love of Beauty, for ever that heapest<lb/>    Fresh flame on the shrine of the heart,<lb/> At thine altars the highest and

						<p> In thy mysteries, Nature for ever<lb/>    Is maiden in beauty and youth;<lb/> Yea, though Art, overshadowing, leave
							her<lb/>    Divinely the Mother of Truth!</p>
						<p> Tush! A truly terrestrial pigment<lb/>    Is this on my canvas the while!<lb/> I must fain shut my eyes on my
							figment,<lb/>    Would I see how Calypso can smile.</p>
						<p> Now I see her, at home in her valleys,<lb/>    Not a bird nor a blossom more free:<lb/> Singing sweet in the green hazel
							alleys:<lb/>    Laughing out, catching sight of the sea:</p>
						<p> Now she stops: 'tis the black-caps that whistle;<lb/>    Now she stoops: 'tis the plume of a jay,<lb/> Nigh a humble-bee
							drunk on a thistle,<lb/>    Who gladdens her heart for a day.</p>
						<p> My Calypso! My maiden of maidens!<lb/>    Fair as e'er was May-morn and as fresh:<lb/> All the grace and the glory that
							gladdens<lb/>    In the roses revealed in the flesh!</p>
						<p> O Voice up in Heaven, that greetest<lb/>    The day till thy carol unborn!<lb/> O Sovran of all that is sweetest<lb/>
							   In song of the springtide and morn!</p>
						<p> O reverend Chaucer! O hymner<lb/>    All peerless of beauty and race!<lb/> O master! O cunningest limner<lb/>    Of
							joyance, and girlhood, and grace!</p>
						<p> O Poet of youth! Could I dip so<lb/>    My brush in thy colour divine,<lb/> I would paint thee a canvas Calypso<lb/>    As
							deathless as Homer's or thine!</p>
						<p> My Calypso! My girl at all issues!<lb/>    My beauty, my passion, my dread!<lb/> If I paint thee, a fig for Odysseus!<lb/>
							   Thou shalt make me immortal instead! </p>

						<p>                                                       —Moore.</p>
						<p> Thou Great Unknown<lb/> I do not mean Eternity nor Death,<lb/> That vast incog!<lb/> For I suppose thou hast a living
							breath,<lb/> Howbeit we know not from whose lungs 'tis blown,<lb/> Thou man of fog!<lb/> Parent of many children—child of

							Why dost thou so conceal, and puzzle curious folks?</p>
						<p> Thou,—whom the second-sighted never saw,<lb/> The Master Fiction of fictitious history!<lb/> Chief Nong-tong-paw!<lb/> No
							mister in the world—and yet all mystery!<lb/> The "tricksy spirit" of a Scotch Cock Lane—<lb/> A novel Junius puzzling the

							Stranger of the stage;<lb/>A Some One made in every man's presumption,<lb/> Frankenstein's monster—but instinct with

							ask,<lb/> Hast thou no silver platter,<lb/> No door-plate, or no card—or some such matter,<lb/> To scrawl a name upon, and
							then cast forth?</p>
						<p> Thou Scottish Barmecide, feeding the hunger<lb/> Of Curiosity with airy gammon!<lb/> Thou mystery-monger,<lb/> Dealing it

							hurts the sale of it;)<lb/> Thou chief of authors mystic and abstractical,<lb/> That lay their proper bodies on the

							degree,<lb/> Anonymous L. L. D.!</p>
						<p> Thou nameless captain of the nameless gang<lb/> That do—and inquests cannot say who did it!<lb/> Wert thou at Mrs.
							Donatty's death-pang?<lb/> Hast thou made gravy of Weare's watch—or hid it?<lb/> Hast thou a Blue-Beard chamber? Heaven
							forbid it!<lb/> I should be very loth to see thee hang!<lb/> I hope thou hast an alibi well plann'd,<lb/> An innocent,
							altho' an ink-black hand.<lb/> Tho' thou hast newly turn'd thy private bolt on<lb/> The curiosity of all invaders—<lb/> I
							hope thou art merely closeted with Colton,<lb/> Who knows a little of the Holy Land,<lb/> Writing thy next new novel—The
							Crusaders!</p>
						<p> Perhaps thou wert even born<lb/> To be Unknown.—Perhaps hung, some foggy morn,<lb/> At Captain Coram's charitable
							wicket,<lb/> Pinn'd to a ticket<lb/> That Fate had made illegible, foreseeing<lb/> The future great unmentionable
							being.—<lb/> Perhaps thou hast ridden<lb/> A scholar poor on St. Augustine's Back,<lb/> Like Chatterton, and found a dusty
							pack<lb/> Of Rowley novels in an old chest hidden;<lb/> A little hoard of clever simulation,<lb/> That took the town—and
							Constable has bidden<lb/> Some hundred pounds for a continuation—<lb/> To keep and clothe thee in genteel starvation.</p>
						<p> I liked thy Waverly—first of thy breeding;<lb/> I like its modest "sixty years ago,"<lb/> As if it was not meant for ages'
							reading.<lb/> I don't like Ivanhoe,<lb/> Tho' Dymoke does—it makes him think of clattering<lb/> In iron overalls before
							the king,<lb/> Secure from battering, to ladies flattering,<lb/> Tuning his challenge to the gauntlets' ring—<lb/> Oh
							better far than all that anvil clang<lb/> It was to hear thee touch the famous string<lb/> Of Robin Hood's tough bow and
							make it twang,<lb/> Rousing him up, all verdant, with his clan,<lb/> Like Sagittarian Pan!</p>
						<p> I like Guy Mannering—but not that sham son<lb/> Of Brown.—I like that literary Sampson,<lb/> Nine-tenths a Dyer, with a

							like old Ursa Major;<lb/> And Merrilies, young Bertram's old defender,<lb/> That Scottish Witch of Endor,<lb/> That doom'd
							thy fame. She was the Witch, I take it,<lb/> To tell a great man's fortune—or to make it!</p>
						<p> I like thy Antiquary. With his fit on,<lb/> He makes me think of Mr. Britton,<lb/> Who has—or had—within his garden
							wall,<lb/> A miniature Stone Henge, so very small<lb/> The sparrows find it difficult to sit on;<lb/> And Dousterswivel,
							like Poyais' M'Gregor;<lb/> And Edie Ochiltree, that old Blue Beggar,<lb/> Painted so cleverly,<lb/> I think thou surely
							knowest Mrs. Beverly!<lb/> I like thy Barber—him that fired the Beacon—<lb/> But that's a tender subject now to speak
							on!</p>
						<p> I like long-arm'd Rob Roy.—His very charms<lb/> Fashion'd him for renown!—In sad sincerity,<lb/> The man that robs or
							writes must have long arms,<lb/> If he's to hand his deeds down to posterity!<lb/> Witness Miss Biffin's posthumous
							prosperity,<lb/> Her poor brown crumpled mummy (nothing more)<lb/> Bearing the name she bore,<lb/> A thing Time's tooth is
							tempted to destroy!<lb/> But Roys can never die—why else, in verity,<lb/> Is Paris echoing with "Vive le Roy!"<lb/> Aye,
							Rob shall live again, and deathless Die—<lb/> (Vernon, of course) shall often live again—<lb/> Whilst there's a stone in
							Newgate, or a chain,<lb/> Who can pass by<lb/> Nor feel the Thief's in prison and at hand?<lb/> There be Old Bailey
							Jarvies on the stand!</p>
						<p> I like thy Landlord's Tales!—I like that Idol<lb/> Of love and Lammermoor—the blue-eyed maid<lb/> That led to church the
							mounted cavalcade,<lb/> And then pull'd up with such a bloody bridal!<lb/> Throwing equestrian Hymen on his haunches—<lb/>
							I like the family—(not silver) branches<lb/> That hold the tapers<lb/> To light the serious legend of Montrose.—<lb/> I
							like M'Aulay's second-sighted vapours,<lb/> As if he could not walk or talk alone,<lb/> Without the devil—or the Great
							Unknown,—<lb/> Dalgetty is the nearest of Ducrows!</p>
						<p> I like St. Leonard's Lily—drench'd with dew!<lb/> I like thy Vision of the Covenanters,<lb/> That bloody-minded Graham
							shot and slew.<lb/> I like the battle lost and won,<lb/> The hurly burly's bravely done,<lb/> The warlike gallops and the
							warlike canters!<lb/> I like that girded chieftain of the ranters,<lb/> Ready to preach down heathens, or to grapple,<lb/>
							With one eye on his sword,<lb/> And one upon the Word,—<lb/> How he would cram the Caledonian Chapel!<lb/> I like stern
							Claverhouse, though he doth dapple<lb/> His raven steed with blood of many a corse—<lb/> I like dear Mrs. Headrigg, that
							unravels<lb/> Her texts of scripture on a trotting horse—<lb/> She is so like Rae Wilson when he travels!</p>
						<p> I like thy Kenilworth—but I'm not going<lb/> To take a Retrospective Re-Review<lb/> Of all thy dainty novels—merely
							showing<lb/> The old familiar faces of a few,<lb/> The question to renew,<lb/> How thou canst leave such deeds without a
							name,<lb/> Forego the unclaim'd dividends of fame,<lb/> Forego the smiles of literary houris—<lb/> Mid Lothian's trump,
							and Fife's shrill note of praise,<lb/> And all the Carse of Gowrie's,<lb/> When thou might'st have thy statue in
							Cromarty—<lb/> Or see thy image on Italian trays,<lb/> Betwixt Queen Caroline and Buonaparté,<lb/> Be painted by the
							Titian of R.A.'s,<lb/> Or vie in sign-boards with the Royal Guelph<lb/> Perhaps have thy bust set cheek by jowl with
							Homer's,<lb/> Perhaps send out plaster proxies of thyself<lb/> To other Englands with Australian roamers—<lb/> Mayhap, in
							Literary Owhyhee<lb/> Displace the native wooden gods, or be<lb/> The China-Lar of a Canadian shelf!</p>
						<p> It is not modesty that bids thee hide—<lb/> She never wastes her blushes out of sight:<lb/> It is not to invite<lb/> The
							world's decision, for thy fame is tried,—<lb/> And thy fair deeds are scatter'd far and wide,<lb/> Even royal heads are
							with thy readers reckon'd,—<lb/> From men in trencher caps to trencher scholars<lb/> In crimson collars,<lb/> And learned
							serjeants in the forty-second!<lb/> Whither by land or sea art thou not beckon'd?<lb/> Mayhap exported from the Frith of
							Forth,<lb/> Defying distance and its dim control;<lb/> Perhaps read about Stromness, and reckon'd worth<lb/> A brace of
							Miltons for capacious soul—<lb/> Perhaps studied in the whalers, further north,<lb/> And set above ten Shakspeares near
							the pole!</p>
						<p> Oh, when thou writest by Aladdin's lamp,<lb/> With such a giant genius at command,<lb/> For ever at thy stamp,<lb/> To
							fill thy treasury from Fairy Land,<lb/> When haply thou might'st ask the pearly hand<lb/> Of some great British Vizier's
							eldest daughter,<lb/> Tho' princes sought her,<lb/> And lead her in procession hymeneal,<lb/> Oh, why dost thou remain a
							Beau Ideal!<lb/> Why stay, a ghost, on the Lethean Wharf,<lb/> Envelop'd in Scotch mist and gloomy fogs?<lb/> Why, but
							because thou art some puny Dwarf,<lb/> Some hopeless Imp, like Riquet with the Tuft,<lb/> Fearing, for all thy wit, to be
							rebuff'd,<lb/> Or bullied by our great reviewing Gogs?</p>
						<p> What in this masquing age<lb/> Maketh Unknowns so many and so shy?<lb/> What but the critic's page?<lb/> One hath a cast,
							he hides from the world's eye;<lb/> Another hath a wen,—he won't show where;<lb/> A third has sandy hair,<lb/> A hunch
							upon his back, or legs awry,<lb/> Things for a vile reviewer to espy!<lb/> Another hath a mangel-wurzel nose,—<lb/>
							Finally, this is dimpled,<lb/> Like a pale crumpet face, or that is pimpled,<lb/> Things for a monthly critic to
							expose—<lb/> Nay, what is thy own case—that being small,<lb/> Thou choosest to be nobody at all!</p>
						<p> Well, thou art prudent, with such puny bones—<lb/> E'en like Elshender, the mysterious elf,<lb/> That shadowy revelation
							of thyself—<lb/> To build thee a small hut of haunted stones—<lb/> For certainly the first pernicious man<lb/> That ever
							saw thee, would quickly draw thee<lb/> In some vile literary caravan—<lb/> Shown for a shilling<lb/> Would be thy
							killing,<lb/> Think of Crachami's miserable span!<lb/> No tinier frame the tiny spark could dwell in<lb/> Than there it
							fell in—<lb/> But when she felt herself a show—she tried<lb/> To shrink from the world's eye, poor dwarf! and died!</p>
						<p> O since it was thy fortune to be born<lb/> A dwarf on some Scotch Inch, and then to flinch<lb/> From all the Gog-like
							jostle of great men,<lb/> Still with thy small crow pen<lb/> Amuse and charm thy lonely hours forlorn—<lb/> Still Scottish
							story daintily adorn,<lb/> Be still a shade—and when this age is fled,<lb/> When we poor sons and daughters of
							reality<lb/> Are in our graves forgotten and quite dead,<lb/> And Time destroys our mottoes of morality—<lb/> The
							lithographic hand of Old Mortality<lb/> Shall still restore thy emblem on the stone,<lb/> A featureless death's head,<lb/>
							And rob Oblivion ev'n of the Unknown!</p>

							command<lb/> All the motions of my hand,<lb/> Lest the bard's unworthy song<lb/> Do the matchless Hero wrong.</p>
						<p> Tell me, when o'erweening pride<lb/> Lured him to a scene untried,<lb/> When it hurried him astray<lb/> From a safe and
							noiseless way,<lb/> To the dangerous heights of Play,<lb/> Tell me what the valiant Cid<lb/> Of St. James's, Crockford,
							did.<lb/> How he spurred his desperate soul<lb/> Onward to the destined goal.</p>
						<p> Thanks to many a luckless caster,<lb/> Houses four now called him master.<lb/> Still (since never mortal gained<lb/> All
							he wished) a fifth remained,<lb/> Where the men of rub-a-dub,<lb/> Left without a foe to drub,<lb/> Long had held their
							peaceful club;<lb/> And, disdaining to be sold,<lb/> Spurned our Hero's proffered gold.</p>
						<p> Strange, when soldiers disobey,<lb/> And refuse to move for pay!<lb/> Crockford, in a case so new,<lb/> Puzzled felt what
							next to do;<lb/> But, though formed for soft persuasion<lb/> More than open bold invasion,<lb/> Driven at last to change
							his course,<lb/> Foiled at fair means, took to force.<lb/> As some "losel," to possess<lb/> Her who scorns his soft
							caress,<lb/> Long in vain of money lavish,<lb/> Wickedly resolves to ravish.</p>
						<p> Thus he on the luckless building<lb/> Forced the pill without the gilding.<lb/> Baffled and enraged to find it<lb/> Curbed
							his fancy, and confined it,<lb/> He attacked and undermined it.<lb/> Armed with pickaxe, crow, and spade,<lb/> Such a rent
							this Casca made,<lb/> That, as dawned the wintry day,<lb/> Rocked awhile with side-long sway,<lb/> Joists, and floors, and
							beams gave way.<lb/> Every story, every wall,<lb/> Nodding, tottered to its fall,<lb/> Ousting husbands, children,
							wives,<lb/> Just in time to save their lives.</p>
						<p> Many a neighbour by the shock<lb/> Startled, woke at seven o'clock,<lb/> Many a stranger heard from far, a<lb/> Sound like
							that of Niagara.<lb/> Haunts beloved of fife and drum,<lb/> Down, in thunder, down you come,<lb/> And with ruin far and
							wide<lb/> Strew the gulf on every side!</p>
						<p> Passenger, I need not ask,<lb/> Would it be an easy task<lb/>Now, to trace a feature clubbish,<lb/> In yon heap of dust
							and rubbish.<lb/> Ne'er before had household-gods<lb/> Struggled with such fearful odds;<lb/> By the sudden
							revolution,<lb/> Worse than sheriff's execution,<lb/> Scarce was left within the house<lb/> Shelter for a man or
							mouse;<lb/> Reft of every stick within it,<lb/> 'Twas unfurnished in a minute;<lb/> While, perchance, some broker sly<lb/>
							Marked the goods, in passing by,<lb/> Thus projected, with amazement,<lb/> Longing for a fair appraisement.<lb/> While, in
							spite of many a prop,<lb/> Hoby trembled for the shop<lb/> Where his matchless boots are sold,<lb/> Nearly for their
							weight in gold!</p>
						<p> Is it thus that Fate rewards<lb/> Deeds like yours, ye dauntless Guards?<lb/> Must you, bearded in your camp<lb/> By a foe
							of Crockford's stamp,<lb/> See him in your quarters dwell,<lb/> In your very citadel?<lb/> Must your trials never
							cease,<lb/> Spared in war, to fall in peace?</p>
						<p> Yet, while, club-less, you bemoan<lb/> Walls so suddenly o'erthrown,<lb/> Gratitude should check your tongue;<lb/> For,
							had such a mine been sprung<lb/> At an earlier hour or later,<lb/> By that merciless Abater,<lb/> Had the Fates, his will
							obeying,<lb/> Caught you dining, supping, playing,<lb/> Neither fortitude nor flight<lb/> Had availed you—Men of
							might,<lb/> 'Twould have sealed your doom outright!<lb/> All had perished, flesh and bones,<lb/> Maimed and lifeless, on
							the stones,<lb/> All from cards or billiards hurled<lb/> Headlong to another world!</p>
						<p> Thalaba, thou Arch-destroyer,<lb/> Do, consult a clever lawyer.<lb/> Let him be an able varlet,<lb/> For the Red-coats
							must have Scarlet.<lb/> Therefore, to avert your doom,<lb/> Be advised, and "buy a Brougham."<lb/> One who's never to be
							bought<lb/> But in cases where he ought,<lb/> Where, I fancy, those who try him<lb/> Find it well worth while to buy
							him.</p>
						<p>You may laugh at such a trespass,<lb/> But 'twill never with the Mess pass.<lb/> Law, like war, affords an action;<lb/>
							Guards-men, though a fighting faction,<lb/> May contrive to calm their fury<lb/> With the verdict of a Jury.<lb/> Mischief
							done there's no undoing;<lb/> Vengeance in their breast is brewing,<lb/> And, whatever you may say for't,<lb/> Ten to one,
							they'll make you pay for't.</p>
						<p> Still, though awkward is the scrape,<lb/> There's a loop-hole to escape<lb/> From its trouble and vexation.<lb/> End the
							suit by arbitration,<lb/> Might I venture to advise;<lb/> For a sudden compromise,<lb/> Breaking out between the
							parties,<lb/> Wormwood to the' Attorney's heart is.</p>
						<p> But if you are over-bold<lb/> For my counsel,—if you hold<lb/> That submission in a hero<lb/> Lowers him, at once, to
							Zero,<lb/> Luckily there yet a charm is,<lb/> (Though, in trespass vi et armis<lb/> Damages are often heavy),<lb/> Ere the
							Sheriff makes his levy,<lb/> There's a charm to save you still—<lb/> Crockford, you may file a bill.<lb/> Law to equity
							must yield;<lb/> Equity, that Gorgon-shield,<lb/> To the liveliest suitor shewn,<lb/> Stiffens him at once to stone.</p>
						<p> Bring the haughty warriors down,<lb/> Make them truckle to the Gown;<lb/> Folks like you have no compunction,<lb/> Only
							move for an injunction,<lb/> And with charges so involve it,<lb/> That no answer can dissolve it.<lb/> If they stir an
							atom faster,<lb/> Have them up before a Master,<lb/> Ply them well with forms for fudge meant,<lb/> Never let them hope
							for judgment;<lb/> And if, eager in the suit,<lb/> On they rush to seize the fruit,<lb/> As on cattle does a lion,<lb/> As
							on Juno did Ixion,<lb/> Let their arms, in vain held out,<lb/> Only clasp a cloud of doubt,<lb/> Raised, to check their
							daring love<lb/> Of dispatch, by Chancery's Jove;<lb/> While the' avenging pangs they feel<lb/> Of his slow-revolving
							wheel.</p>
						<p> Think what anguish and surprise,<lb/> Mingled, in their bosoms rise,<lb/> Chill their hearts, and glaze their eyes,<lb/>
							When my Lord, to cure their vapours,<lb/> Talks of taking home the papers,<lb/> Where, perchance, his Lordship weighs
							them,<lb/> Reads perchance,—perchance mislays them!</p>
						<p> Term by term, and day by day,<lb/> Wear their patience thus away,<lb/> Till arrives that consummation<lb/> Of their woe,
							the long Vacation.<lb/> Drained by sums already lost,<lb/> Scared by dreams of future cost,<lb/> You may curb these men of
							war<lb/> With their own Solicitor;<lb/> Or, if Fortitude endures<lb/> Aught more terrible, with yours.<lb/> Think, if
							these should charge together<lb/> On the baffled suitors, whether<lb/> Proof there'd be in gun or blade<lb/> 'Gainst two
							Chancery-bills unpaid!</p>
						<p> Thus tormented let them be;<lb/> Feeing ever, still to fee,<lb/> For a lingering last decree;<lb/> While till doomsday off
							you stave it<lb/> With a special affidavit.<lb/> Think in oaths what magic spells lie!<lb/> Think of Beaufort versus
							Wellesley!</p>
						<p> Friends and foes you may defy,<lb/> Thus intrenched in Chancery.<lb/> 'Tis like Doubting-Castle, where<lb/> Dwelt that
							giant-form, Despair,<lb/> Save that all the luckless clients,<lb/> Though his namesakes, are not giants,<lb/> But, by
							heavy fees exacted,<lb/> Into pigmy-forms contracted.<lb/> Can a standard here be planted?<lb/> Hence, avaunt!—The
							ground's enchanted.<lb/> Warlike engines are in vain,<lb/> Storm, or sap, or coup-de-main.<lb/> Guards, you might with
							less ado,<lb/> Win a second Waterloo,<lb/> Than a victory achieve<lb/>Here, without the Conjuror's leave.</p>
						<p> He can keep you all at bay<lb/> With one magic word—Delay.<lb/> Send you to the right about<lb/> By two syllables—I
							doubt.<lb/> So impregnable a fort<lb/> Ne'er held out as Eldon's court.<lb/> Europe's armies would be beat<lb/> Matched
							with Eldon, and—the Fleet!</p>
						<p> But it matters not a straw<lb/> Whether Equity or Law,<lb/> (Blessings both, but somewhat dear)<lb/> Conquers, or is
							conquered here;<lb/> If the Man of dice and cards<lb/> Proves too many for the Guards;<lb/> Or if they, of life and
							limb<lb/> Prodigal, should master him;<lb/> If, in short, the case that's strongest<lb/> Triumphs, or the purse that's
							longest.</p>
						<p> These are trifles, light as air,<lb/> Little worth our Hero's care.<lb/> Crockford, conscious of the ready,<lb/> To his
							darling purpose steady,<lb/> Nay, each hour determined more,<lb/> Having ruined, to restore,<lb/> Hastes to be a man or
							mouse,<lb/> Made or marred, at Crockford-House.</p>
						<p> See, the destined ground is cleared!<lb/> See, the scaffolding is reared!<lb/> Carts on carts the gulf environ,<lb/>
							Fraught with timber, stone, and iron.<lb/> Piles of bricks from every quarter<lb/> Pay their court to hods of mortar,<lb/>
							And, in spite of wintry weather,<lb/> Lovingly are linked together.<lb/> Welcome (here's a fig for lawyers)<lb/> Masons,
							carpenters, and sawyers,<lb/> Heaving, pulleying, chipping, craning,<lb/> Thumping, hammering, and planing,<lb/> Never
							grudging, night or day,<lb/> Double tasks for double pay.</p>
						<p> Soon shall spring (for Crockford dashes),<lb/> Like a phenix from its ashes,<lb/> Like a rising exhalation,<lb/> Such a
							plan, and elevation!<lb/> Such a fabric, such a building,<lb/> Rich in marble, stucco, gilding,<lb/> Pannels varnished,
							mouldings burnished;<lb/> All so fitted up, and furnished;<lb/> Monstrous hive for making honey!<lb/> Tempting trap for
							catching money!</p>
						<p> But while, mushroom-like, it grows,<lb/> Folks get frightened, and suppose<lb/> That, for ends so full of evil,<lb/>
							Crockford's dealing with the Devil;<lb/> And, from greediness of pelf,<lb/> To that fiend has sold himself<lb/> Who will,
							at no distant day,<lb/> Claim, and carry him away!</p>
						<p> They down-face you that his master<lb/> Scarcely for himself built faster,<lb/> When he of metallic scum<lb/> Fashioned
							Pandemonium,<lb/> Than his slave, they can't tell how,<lb/> Builds, as if by magic, now;<lb/> So that any one may spy<lb/>
							Satan's finger in the pye.</p>
						<p> Thus, they add, as if they'd seen'em<lb/> Sign the deed, it runs between'em.<lb/> That of masonry or brick-work,<lb/>
							(Being anxious to make quick work)<lb/> Crockford covenants to lay<lb/> Certain cubits every day;<lb/> Stipulating so,
							they guess,<lb/> Just to save appearances;<lb/> While the Devil, maturely weighing<lb/> What the house is meant
							for—playing,<lb/> And that then and there, the guests<lb/> Most perform his high behests,<lb/> And promote his
							interests,<lb/> Duly promises to lay,<lb/> (Reckoning on the' aforesaid Play),<lb/> Every night, in order true,<lb/> For
							each Crockford-cubit, two.<lb/> Both performing thus in turn,<lb/> To complete the whole concern,<lb/> As agreed, if not
							so soon<lb/> As the end of May, in June.</p>
						<p> To the contract, as it stood,<lb/> Crockford set his hand in blood;<lb/> Satan, with a pen of flame<lb/> Dipped in
							sulphur, did the same.<lb/> "Sealed," quoth Satan. Crockford shivered<lb/> As he stammered forth "delivered."<lb/> And his
							terror scarce was banished<lb/> When the other party—vanished!</p>
						<p> Such the tale, of little credit.<lb/> 'Twas a burning shame to spread it;<lb/> To encourage a report<lb/> So malicious
							ev'n in sport.<lb/> 'Twas a calumny for spite meant,<lb/> And, if dealt with by indictment,<lb/> Though 'twere true as is
							the Bible,<lb/> More, on that account, a libel,<lb/> Say the jury, on their oath,<lb/> 'Gainst the Devil and Crockford
							both.<lb/> I, for one, though some receive it<lb/> All for gospel, don't believe it;<lb/> Or that any sprite but
							Mammon<lb/> Helps him on.—The rest is gammon.</p>
						<p> Yet, my friend, though he and you<lb/> Never had an interview;<lb/> And hereafter, as I pray<lb/> Most devoutly, never
							may;<lb/> Though no demon-spell has bound you,<lb/> Dangers here, on earth, surround you.<lb/> Pause a moment, Crockford,
							pause—<lb/> Break, but do not brave the laws;<lb/> Out-manoeuvre, or out-buy them;<lb/> But 'tis madness to defy them.</p>
						<p> Though their silence, long and deep,<lb/> Plainly shews them fast asleep,<lb/> Be not by their slumbers led<lb/> To
							imagine they are dead.<lb/> Fear their renovated vigour,<lb/> Fear their threatened "utmost rigour,"<lb/> Which, near
							covers and preserves,<lb/> Frowns aloft, to try the nerves<lb/> Of those pestilent encroachers<lb/> On all rural bliss,
							the poachers,<lb/> In the yearly war which peasants<lb/> Wage with gentlemen, for pheasants.</p>
						<p> If the legal lion rouses,<lb/> How you'll mourn your vanished houses!<lb/> When th' expounders of the Laws<lb/> Grant a
							rule for shewing cause,<lb/> And to court you trembling go,<lb/> Conscious you have none to shew,<lb/> How you'll wish
							yourself again<lb/> Safe within that modest den<lb/> Where your dextrous course you shaped<lb/> So discreetly, and
							escaped<lb/> From such perils as, in print,<lb/> 'Twere ungracious ev'n to hint!<lb/> Now, pursuit may well grow
							warmer;<lb/> Now, you are your own informer.</p>
						<p> Wherefore all this fuss and flourish?<lb/> Friends are lukewarm, foes are currish.<lb/>Those would hardly stir to right
							you;<lb/>These move heaven and earth to spite you.<lb/> Make not such a noise and shew:<lb/> If so loud your trumpets
							blow,<lb/> Dread the fate of Jericho.<lb/> At their sounding, every wall<lb/> Of your citadel may fall.</p>
						<p> Take my counsel, do not brag;<lb/> Keep your cat within her bag;<lb/> Comely whiskers, velvet paws,<lb/> Ill conceal her
							teeth and claws.<lb/> Nought avails her coat and purring,<lb/> If she keeps the mice from stirring.</p>
						<p> With so nourishing a diet<lb/> Can't you chew the cud in quiet?<lb/> Unmolested would you eat<lb/> Never, never, cry roast
							meat;<lb/> Nor, at meals, proclaim aloud<lb/> Plenty to a hungry crowd,<lb/> Who begin, perhaps, by staring,<lb/> But, at
							last, insist on sharing.<lb/> While you summon many a guest<lb/> In your pompous halls to feast,<lb/> Tremble at the
							Bow-Street Harpies,<lb/> With their nails unclean, and sharp eyes,<lb/> Birds obscene, whose sight and touch<lb/> May not
							please you over-much.</p>
						<p> Here, I fancy you replying<lb/> By a truth there's no denying,<lb/> "Men have gambled, and they will,<lb/> Spite of
							lectures, gamble still.<lb/> So that any speculation<lb/> Has, in Play, a sure foundation."<lb/> Granted.—But in every
							case,<lb/> Pray consider time and place:<lb/> If you weigh not manners, men,<lb/>Where you lay your traps, and when,<lb/>
							Your conclusion's not exact.—<lb/> Still, by long experience backed,<lb/> Still, your major is a fact.</p>
						<p> Wise and simple, grave and gay,<lb/> Have been lured and led away<lb/> Captives, by the charms of Play.<lb/> There's no
							punishing or shaming<lb/> Certain people out of gaming;<lb/> 'Tis among the plagues that ravage<lb/> Countries civilized
							and savage,<lb/> In its blind, impartial rage<lb/> Sparing neither sex nor age.<lb/> Here, 'tis a resistless passion,<lb/>
							There, a pastime or a fashion.<lb/> Some it maddens and bewitches<lb/> With the hope of sudden riches:<lb/> Some would
							fain, because too well off,<lb/> Stave Ennui, that demon-spell, off;<lb/> And by Play's excitement strive<lb/> Just to
							keep themselves alive.<lb/> Moralists may preach or wonder;<lb/> 'Tis as ancient quite as thunder.</p>
						<p> Nor imagine that the vice<lb/> Is confined to cards and dice;<lb/> That its power is felt or shewn<lb/> In saloons or
							clubs alone.<lb/> Practised our desires to move<lb/> In as various forms as Love,<lb/> Shifting to a hundred shapes,<lb/>
							Here some grave pursuit it apes;<lb/> Here performs some sordid task<lb/> In a domino and mask.</p>
						<p> All who, dashing, over-trade,<lb/> All by whom a wager's laid;<lb/> All who deal in those affairs<lb/> Called, from
							sharing nothing,—shares,<lb/> (As a grove all classic men do<lb/>Lucus term, a non lucendo);<lb/> All who would their
							incomes double,<lb/> By some specious two-faced bubble,<lb/> And secure, by hums on hums,<lb/>Bonuses and premiums;<lb/>
							All the bulls and bears that range,<lb/> Shaped like men, the Stock-exchange,<lb/> And, without remorse, would martyr<lb/>
							Half mankind for half a quarter;<lb/> All who, preying on the nation,<lb/> Call their rapine speculation;<lb/> Who by
							accident advance,<lb/> And in all things trust to chance;<lb/> Scheme-contrivers, money-scramblers,<lb/> All are errant
							downright gamblers.</p>
						<p> Who, but smiling, hears and sees<lb/> Folks like some at least of these;<lb/> Thus untouched by love of gold,<lb/> Thus
							"in conscious virtue bold,"<lb/> With uplifted hands and eyes<lb/> Feigning anger, or surprise;<lb/> With severe and
							Spartan air<lb/> Sitting in the moral chair;<lb/> When at others' motes they scream,<lb/> With their own enormous
							beam;<lb/> When they dare the lash to lay<lb/> So relentlessly on Play,<lb/> And to wonder what retards<lb/> God's revenge
							on dice and cards!</p>
						<p> Softly, Stoics, if you please.<lb/> Truth, profaned by lips like these,<lb/> Sounds but like a lottery-puff.<lb/> Play, we
							own, is bad enough,<lb/> With its see-saw loss and gain;—<lb/> Every mischief's in its train.<lb/> In the human breast, we
							grant<lb/> 'Tis a poisonous deadly plant,<lb/> One whose growth is sure to smother<lb/> And o'ershadow every other;<lb/>
							As for miles round Java's Upas,<lb/> ('Twont among us, now, for true pass)<lb/> Nothing, as the fable goes,<lb/> Either
							moves, or breathes, or grows.</p>
						<p> Arm against it Woman's beauty,<lb/> Love, Ambition, Fame, and Duty,<lb/> Play, unconquered since the Fall,<lb/> Play will
							triumph o'er them all!<lb/> 'Tis no easier to defend it,<lb/> Than by any law to end it;<lb/> Vain attempt, and sure to
							fail. 'Tis<lb/> Like a host of other frailties,<lb/> Which, if rooted up, no doubt,<lb/> We should better be without.</p>
						<p> But are Doctors such as these<lb/> Fit to combat the disease?<lb/> Men who, in a different form,<lb/> Hug the vice at
							which they storm?<lb/> May n't we whisper to these elves,<lb/> Sage physicians, cure yourselves?<lb/> Others justly may
							condemn<lb/> Who offend not, but in them<lb/> 'Tis, whatever the pretence,<lb/> Sheer, unblushing impudence,<lb/> If its
							real name you want:—<lb/> Sheer hypocrisy and cant!</p>
						<p> Be it then as you contend.—<lb/> Play, no doubt, my venturous friend,<lb/> Is an universal passion;<lb/> Still be
							cautious, while you dash on,<lb/> What a scheme you risk your cash on.<lb/> Freely, we confess, you bleed,<lb/> And would,
							ten to one, succeed,<lb/> Were the' adventure French or Flemish;<lb/> But, at home, we're somewhat squeamish;<lb/> Not
							what is, but what appears,<lb/> Here, alarms our eyes and ears.</p>
						<p> While the question we are blinking,<lb/> And, as is our custom, winking<lb/> Hard, though manifest the case is<lb/> As the
							nose on all our faces,<lb/> Crockford, are you not a ninny, an<lb/> Errant, reckless Carthaginian,<lb/> Thus our Roman
							eyelids paring,<lb/> At your deeds to set us staring,<lb/> When, through indolence or kindness,<lb/> We've so long been
							shamming blindness?</p>
						<p> If you, for your strange vocation,<lb/> Not content with toleration,<lb/> Aim at full emancipation,<lb/> If you from the
							monster, Play,<lb/> Rashly tear the veil away,<lb/> As the' impostor-prophet cast<lb/> His, in triumph, off at last;<lb/>
							(So 'tis written in that book<lb/> Of enchantment, Lalla Rookh);<lb/> Should you, to unseal the eyes<lb/> Of its abject
							votaries,<lb/> Treat them even to a glance<lb/> Of its hideous countenance,<lb/> Crockford, while you ape Mokanna,<lb/>
							Dread the Acts of George and Anna!</p>
						<p> Wherefore hurry up a mansion<lb/> Of such splendour and expansion,<lb/> Wherefore build so proud a fane<lb/> To the greedy
							God of gain?<lb/> Nursed in darkness, scared by light,<lb/> Play should, here, play least in sight,<lb/> And, ensconced
							behind a screen,<lb/> If it blushes, "blush unseen."</p>
						<p> Though, from policy or chance,<lb/> It has thriven, and thrives in France,<lb/> Where unbroken custom backs it,<lb/> Law
							permits, and statesmen tax it;<lb/> Crockford, even you must grant,<lb/> Here, 'tis but a sickly plant,<lb/> Stunted oft,
							and oft laid low,<lb/> By the nipping squalls that blow,<lb/> Fitful, from the Street of Bow.</p>
						<p> Ev'n our darling shares and tickets,<lb/> Long afflicted with the rickets,<lb/> Lingering, spite of many a vote,<lb/> With
							the rattles in the throat,<lb/> After all their struggles past,<lb/> Calmly have expired at last;<lb/> And there's left
							not breath enough<lb/> In the Lottery—for a puff!</p>
						<p> Wherefore conjure up accusers<lb/> In the testy tribe of losers,<lb/> Who compose, your annals say,<lb/> Just nine-tenths
							of those who play?<lb/> Why instruct the thickest skull<lb/> In the secret of the pull?<lb/> Are your customers so
							dull?<lb/> Who can doubt, but Nature's fools,<lb/> From the value of the tools,<lb/> And the instruments they see,<lb/>
							What the precious work must be?<lb/>Something you were known to touch,<lb/> But we never dreamed how much,<lb/> Nor, till
							such a pile was shewn us,<lb/> Guessed the value of your bonus.</p>
						<p> Every brick and stone that's laid,<lb/> Whispers of your prosperous trade:<lb/> When we see yon walls aspire<lb/> Higher
							every day and higher;<lb/> When we view that stately front,<lb/> Ominous to those who punt,<lb/> Parting, by some scores
							of feet,<lb/> Hoby's boots from Bennet-Street,<lb/> This, at once, the veil withdraws;<lb/> From th' effect we judge the
							cause,<lb/> Sure that all the boundless cost,<lb/> Gained by you, by us was lost.</p>
						<p>He, the Chief, whose armies went<lb/> Rough-shod o'er the Continent,<lb/> Who, insatiate of renown,<lb/> Thrones and
							Kingdoms crumbled down,<lb/> Deeming he had nothing gained<lb/> While unconquered aught remained,<lb/> By the flames of
							Moscow crossed<lb/> Mourned his fame and empire lost.<lb/>You, though all confess your sway,<lb/> Sovereign o'er the
							realms of Play,<lb/> Crockford, if you're wise, refrain<lb/> From this dangerous new campaign.<lb/> Spite of your
							achievements, tremble<lb/> Lest your fate his fate resemble,<lb/> Lest the Palace in our view<lb/> Should a Kremlin prove
							to you.<lb/> What though, beaten, you surrender?<lb/> We are ruthless and untender,<lb/> And have Forts, within a
							mile,<lb/> Strong as St. Helena's isle.</p>
						<p> Mighty Man of cards and dice,<lb/> Take a real friend's advice;<lb/> One who, though he never threw in,<lb/> Fain would
							shelter you from ruin.<lb/> Mine's a maxim soon expressed,<lb/> Loss the first is loss the best.<lb/> Don't, or I shall
							think you mad,<lb/> Throw good money after bad;<lb/> Don't, thou prodigal of purse,<lb/> Farther go, to fare the
							worse;<lb/> On the precipice's brink<lb/> Still you've time to pause and think.<lb/> If your noddle be not too dense<lb/>
							For a single grain of prudence,<lb/> Now, your self-command recover,<lb/> One step more, and all is over.</p>
						<p> Haste, ere Winter yield to Spring,<lb/> Haste, and strike your scaffolding.<lb/> Though you've set the World a gazing<lb/>
							At the structure you are raising,<lb/> Though so proud an elevation<lb/> Makes what's called—a strong sensation,<lb/>
							Keeping, like the Funds of late,<lb/> People in a "feverish state,"<lb/> Let it, like the Bear and Fiddle,<lb/> Off be
							broken in the middle;<lb/> Let the speculation drop;<lb/> Bid your swarming workmen stop;<lb/> They may grumble, sneer, or
							scoff,<lb/> Never mind, but pay them off.</p>
						<p> Or, should pausing here, perchance,<lb/> Cost as much as to advance,<lb/> 'Twould be easy to diminish<lb/> Your expenses,
							ere you finish<lb/> What you rashly mean to build—<lb/> Ere its destiny's fulfilled,<lb/> Ere to such a size you swell
							it,<lb/>Un-bedevil, and un-hell it,<lb/> From a Play-devoted cavern<lb/> To a club, hotel, or tavern.<lb/> Crowning thus
							St. James's heights,<lb/> 'Twill be popular; and White's,<lb/> If you delicately break it<lb/> To the Managers, and make
							it<lb/> Worth their while, perhaps may take it.</p>
						<p> Not intending to distress you,<lb/> Not in malice I address you.<lb/> Little wisdom lies in scorning<lb/> Mine, a
							well-meant friendly warning.<lb/> Dread yon treacherous hollow sea,<lb/> Dread the breakers on your lea;<lb/> If you would
							not be the sport<lb/> Of foul weather, make for port;<lb/> Or, in plainer words, retire<lb/> To your snug domestic
							fire;<lb/> To your safe and tight-built ark,<lb/> Anchored in the Régent's Park.</p>
						<p> Wherefore dread too still a life?<lb/> You have children, and a wife;<lb/> Can't you trust to her for strife?<lb/> And to
							little girls and boys,<lb/> Romping up and down, for noise?<lb/> Scarce, amid these "natural shocks,"<lb/> Need you miss
							the dice and box,<lb/> Or, in scenes so little dull,<lb/> Murmur, though you lose the pull.</p>
						<p> There, aloof from tradesmen's bills,<lb/> Gaze upon the Sister-hills;<lb/> Musing, as you lift the sash,<lb/> On M`Adam,
							and on Nash.<lb/> And when Eastern fogs and blights<lb/> Mar these innocent delights,<lb/> When encroaching smoke from
							Town<lb/> Bids you pull the window down,<lb/> Then, for sweet discourse you'll find,<lb/> With a neighbour to your
							mind,<lb/> Subjects tempting to dilate on;<lb/> Such as we can all debate on.</p>
						<p> Sheltered then from wind and rain,<lb/> Talk of Portugal and Spain;<lb/> Of that driveller in command<lb/> Over bigots,
							Ferdinand;<lb/> Of the Lisbon-constitution,<lb/> Problem of no quick solution;<lb/> And at your discretion mix<lb/> These
							with corn and Catholics;<lb/> With protections, prohibitions,<lb/> Fierce debates, and strong petitions.<lb/> Next,
							discuss, for a cephalic,<lb/> Notes and currency metallic;<lb/> Or the crisis which portends<lb/> War 'twixt rents and
							dividends;<lb/> War, where moneyed men or landed<lb/>Must be scratched, and may be stranded.<lb/> Hopeful topics such as
							these<lb/> You may handle at your ease;<lb/> Topics, on which every mother's<lb/> Son may bore himself—and others.</p>
						<p> Or, if later in the year,<lb/> Posting down to Cambridgeshire,<lb/> On whose plains, by Fortune's care,<lb/> You've
							another pied-à-terre,<lb/> Lay your bets, and hedge, and lark it<lb/> With the jockeys of Newmarket;<lb/> With your wonted
							welcome greeting,<lb/> Every Spring and Autumn-meeting,<lb/> All the dear familiar faces<lb/> Seldom missed at any

							So shall nothing ill come near you;<lb/> So, whate'er you spend or save,<lb/> Peace and safety shall you have.</p>
						<p> Lay no longer on, Macduff,<lb/> Prudence whispers, "hold—enough!"<lb/> Do what every creature tries<lb/> To

						<p> Muse, the rambling course we've run<lb/> Might be lengthened, but I've done<lb/> Gently, as I hope, my task;—<lb/> And if
							sterner critics ask,<lb/> Deeming, in a case like this,<lb/> Whips and scorpions not amiss,<lb/> Why I have not thought it
							fitter<lb/> For my purpose to be bitter;<lb/> Have not opened every sluice<lb/> Of all possiblé abuse<lb/> (Since good

							names,<lb/> Be it with the pen or tongue,<lb/> Be it written, said, or sung.<lb/> Since, could any vice or failing<lb/>
							Have been rooted out by railing,<lb/> We, though men in outward shew,<lb/> Had been angels long ago.<lb/> They who deal in

							Has no chance of being new.<lb/> Every one can be abusive:<lb/> There's no privilege exclusive<lb/> To protect their
							hopeful labours,<lb/> Who, in shewing up their neighbours,<lb/> Mingle truth enough with lies,<lb/> In their batch of
							calumnies,<lb/> Just to make the ferment rise.<lb/> None can fail, and none excells<lb/> On that paltry peal of bells<lb/>
							Through whose belfry he who ranges,<lb/> In a trice, may ring the changes.</p>
						<p> Reader, if you're not with me,<lb/> Listen to another plea.<lb/> Could I sweep, from Earth, away<lb/> Every Proteus-form
							of Play;<lb/> Could I wield, in such a cause,<lb/> All the thunder of the laws,<lb/> And to death, or stripes, or
							fetters,<lb/> Doom its aiders and abettors,<lb/> Hunted so through every shape,<lb/> That no culprit should escape,<lb/>
							Think what ruin would be hurled<lb/> On the heads of half the World!</p>
						<p> No, if justice must be done,<lb/> Let it be on all, or none.<lb/> I, averse to kill so many,<lb/> Point no blunderbuss at
							any;<lb/> But, contented to resort<lb/> To less murderous arms, for sport,<lb/> Pepper, since they can't be all shot,<lb/>
							Those that crow the most, with small shot.</p>
						<p> Wherefore should I scold and rate,<lb/> Like some nymph of Billingsgate,<lb/> Those who, slaves to cards and dice,<lb/>
							Revel in their favorite vice?<lb/> Wherefore, by so fierce a tone,<lb/> Spoil their temper and my own?—<lb/> Can I thus
							reform produce?<lb/> Who grows moral from abuse<lb/> Destined, now-a-days, to fall,<lb/> Like th'impartial rain, on
							all;<lb/> Like the evils every creature<lb/> Suffers from our common nature.<lb/> Whether innocent or not,<lb/> Every one
							must stand that shot;<lb/> Must an epidemy bear<lb/> "General as the casing air."</p>
						<p> Wherefore, when the laws are broken,<lb/> Brand the' offender with a token,<lb/> Who, like old Astolpho's groom,<lb/>
							Shorn, and trembling for his doom,<lb/> Comes, and slyly, in the dark,<lb/> Sets on all the self-same mark?</p>
						<p> To be vilified and hissed<lb/> You have only to exist.<lb/> 'Tis the atmosphere we breathe in;<lb/> 'Tis a cauldron all

							Frankenstein,<lb/> And, however loathed and hated,<lb/>Must be fed, when once created.</p>
						<p> Libelled, on pretence of news,<lb/> Scourged by critics in reviews,<lb/> Each is in his turn a martyr<lb/> By the day, the

						<p> Since these Heroes of the pen<lb/> War with women thus, and men,<lb/> Since their viewless arrows strike<lb/> Every head

						<p> Reader, be what you appear.<lb/> Keep your fame and conscience clear,<lb/> And, regardless of their frown<lb/> Laugh, or

						<p> </p>
						<p>This late-Victorian satire invokes Frankenstein as an analogue for the politician Northcote, "shrink[ing] from the monster
							he made."</p>
						<p>Dame Nature, perusing the newspaper page,<lb/> Jumped out of her bed in a deuce of a rage;<lb/> And swore by all Saints to
							the Calendar known,<lb/> She would prove on the spot she'd a will of her own.<lb/> "I have waited and waited," quoth she,
							"by the Mass,<lb/> In the hope things might come to a likelier pass;<lb/> When sham 'Peace and Honour' were kicked out o'
							door,<lb/> I swore to give England a chance or two more.<lb/> In return for that kicking, I gave her a year<lb/> To the
							heart of the Briton I thought might be dear;<lb/> With a warm sun above him, a kind earth below,<lb/> And seasons as true
							as the ocean at flow—<lb/> When crops might all flourish, and harvest increase,<lb/> And Trade lift her head for a
							worthier peace;<lb/> When Zulus and Afghans might rest on their oars,<lb/> And B-rtle be fêted on civilised shores;<lb/> I
							drank power to his elbow, though under the sun<lb/> B-rtle's elbow had wrought all the harm to be done—<lb/> Believing, at
							least, the small reason of men<lb/> Would prevent him from shaking that elbow again.<lb/> I bowed out my D-zzy, nor
							grudged him the while<lb/> Of my sister, Dame Fortune, the kindliest smile,<lb/> (For though Truth in the end should
							compel us to flee him<lb/> We both of us know a big man when we see him):<lb/>I bowed in my Gl-dst-n-, right worthy to
							share<lb/> By Tories created, by Tories deplored,<lb/> In the Queen's House of Commons mere Brass is the lord;<lb/>Sleek
							N-rthc-t- calls angels and saints to his aid,<lb/> And like Frankenstein shrinks from the monster he made,<lb/> And while
							his poor hands he in humbleness rubs,<lb/> The Tory bear-leader is led by his cubs;<lb/> St. Stephen's still echoes the
							infantine Ch-rch-ll<lb/> (Whose pedagogues, surely, used ruler and birch ill,<lb/> When they fostered the pea in its
							juvenile pod,<lb/> And ruined the child by avoiding the rod).<lb/> While S-l-sbr-y utters his figments serene,<lb/> Still
							Anarchy stalks o'er the desolate scene;<lb/> Nor Br-ght, nor M-nd-lla, nor D-lke, has pretence<lb/> To infuse in the
							mixture one tittle of sense.</p>
						<p> The O'shine, the O'Paque, the O'Brian Boru,<lb/> Give the best of bad brains their own land to undo;<lb/> O'Tongs and
							MacHammer keep pounding away,<lb/> The first half the night, and the second all day,<lb/> With never a glimmer of wit to
							the fore,<lb/> All powerless to speak, and all-powerful to bore—<lb/> Till Ireland's dead Currans indignant disclaim<lb/>
							The darkness of dulness now linked with her name.</p>
						<p> Historic McC-rthy, on history nursed,<lb/> Tries to make of his 'own times' the weakest and worst;<lb/> P-rn-ll plays the
							stalest of demagogue play,<lb/> To be called 'King P-rn-ll' talks his country away;<lb/> And while England, awake to the
							wrongs of the past,<lb/> The mantle of Love over Erin would cast,<lb/> Bad landlords would banish, good tenants would
							bless,<lb/> And kiss a loved sister with sister's caress,<lb/> These self-seeking weaklings, of Pigmydom born,<lb/> Make
							Ireland a desert, and England a scorn.</p>
						<p> If there's not in the wide world a valley so sweet<lb/> As that in whose bosom the bright waters meet,<lb/> Oh! sad was
							that valley when luckless she fell<lb/> To thee and to thine, cattle-maiming P-rn-ll!</p>
						<p> What differs the past from the present, I pray?<lb/> Wherein, please, is yesterday worse than to-day?<lb/> The floor of
							your Commons is held by the men<lb/> Who held it before, and now hold it again;<lb/> Dishonour the master, and honour trod
							down,<lb/> And N-rthc-t- submissive to S-l-sb-ry's frown,<lb/> The country, o'erweary, o'erpatient, o'erworn,<lb/>
							Uprising in murmurs of infinite scorn,<lb/> And asking wherein, to those that have eyes,<lb/> Between 'Whig' and 'Tory'
							the difference lies.<lb/> I am weary of all of you—weary and sad—<lb/> Where weak beyond weak seems the best to be
							had;<lb/> Since for Right and for Reason no strength ye have got,<lb/> By the Lord of Creation, I'll 'Boycott' the
							lot!"</p>
						<p> Dame Nature arose, in her infinite strength,<lb/> In the depths of her spirit outwearied at length;<lb/> The East wind and
							North wind she summoned to throw<lb/> Over Earth, Sea, and Heaven her masterful snow:<lb/> She "boycotted" London from Kew
							to Mile End,<lb/> Bade Thames to the tempest his armoury lend,<lb/> She locked up two Judges forlorn and alone,<lb/> And
							forced on the House a clôture of her own:<lb/> She blocked the steel rails man-invented to prove<lb/> That man was the
							master of force from above;<lb/> She laughed at his mission, she mocked at his word,<lb/> And through the loud storm-drift
							her warning was heard:<lb/> "Ay! speak from the West, and foretell to a day<lb/> When the storm-cloud shall break, and the
							lightning shall play;<lb/> Foretelling is folly, and knowledge for fools,<lb/> For the wisest of men keep the oldest of
							rules:<lb/> Ye fret me, ye stir me, ye move me to mirth,<lb/> At your Lownesses crawling 'twixt Heaven and Earth.<lb/> My
							tide it shall gather, my storm it shall burst,<lb/> In their own thoughts alone, sirs, your last shall be first:<lb/> In

							young merit thou canst vomit rage,—<lb/> In heaven itself, when callous lies can doom,<lb/> Emerging talent to thy former
							gloom!<lb/> Did Byron's laurels feel thy blackening slime,<lb/> And forged detection of his thought and rhyme?<lb/> Did
							Wisdom thank thee for the fierce lampoon,<lb/> Or dub thee, "Pasquin," and a worse poltroon?<lb/> How well the grov'ling
							task adorn'd thy fame,—<lb/> To link a Byron to piratic shame!<lb/> For this dull deed, may ne'er thy rhyme again<lb/>
							Crawl through a page, or hobble in a strain;<lb/> But injured genius blast thy venal muse,<lb/> And drive thee, snarler,
							to thy fostering blues;<lb/> Remorseful there, dissect thy feeble line,<lb/> And print us all the tinsel, purely
							thine.</p>
						<p> We hail that day, when Romish fetters ceased<lb/> To slave the press,—and candid powers released,<lb/> Allowed each Briton
							honest truth to cite,<lb/> And strength and weakness, their alternate right;<lb/> But now, the press with lawless sway
							outgoes,<lb/> Denouncing private, more than public foes;<lb/> The good and great, the noble and the mean,<lb/> Alike
							endure the arrows of its spleen.</p>
						<p> Lord of the squib, and primate of the pun,<lb/> Fat Theodore, thy wreaths for these are won!<lb/> The ton's hired Comus
							thou,—thy brains each week<lb/> Can void in columns, puns thou dar'st not speak;<lb/> Who, prompt, like thee, can hatch an
							unclean joke,<lb/> Or give to bawdy wit the master stroke?<lb/> So meaningly, who throw the smutty hint,—<lb/> Thou
							punning improvisator in print?<lb/> May George enrol thee for his Windsor fool,<lb/> A dinner wit, surpassing Villiers'
							school!</p>
						<p> The meanest carle that vends a Sunday sheet,<lb/> Whose pen can perjure till the lie's complete,<lb/> Lampooning
							Hunt,—with fiendish growl appeals,<lb/> And licks the refuse shook from Cobbett's heels;<lb/> Traducive hack! still vent,
							perversely vile,<lb/> Each feeling fester'd with malignant bile;<lb/> In slang and bawd'ry vomit forth abuse,<lb/> Too
							virulently vile for London stews,—<lb/> Invigorate each Pagan joke that's stale,<lb/> And trim the musty filthiness of
							Bayle;<lb/> Re-mould the sceptic dust of dead Voltaire,<lb/> And in his vileness trace thy portrait there;<lb/> Be all,
							and more, than Virtue can detest,—<lb/> The rabble's patron, and the empire's pest!</p>
						<p> Are bards and editorial tools alone,<lb/> To malice pliant, and to trick'ry prone?<lb/> Let crews that comment on the
							classic page,<lb/> Approve their claim—book-harpies of the age!<lb/> Or, breeding man-moths, with eternal notes,—<lb/>
							Whose purging mania ev'ry line devotes:<lb/> Heaven help the scholar, whom their frauds allure<lb/> To read the author,
							cleans'd by texts impure!<lb/> No Roman poet now,—no useless piece<lb/> Of mouldy nonsense filch'd from ancient
							Greece;<lb/> Creeps forth in print,—without a turgid mass<lb/> Of notes, from English, or from German ass:</p>
						<p> To graduate, the hopeful firstling flies<lb/> To Cam, or where Oxonia's turrets rise;—<lb/> There quaffs his "Massic,"
							drives a borrowed gig,<lb/> Games high, and bows before each powder'd wig;<lb/> Reads Ovid's Loves, Petronius, the
							Unclean,<lb/> And rivals Flaccus in his midnight scene;<lb/> Then leaves his girl for Plato's ethic sweets,<lb/> Or else,
							in Longus half his fellow greets;—<lb/> Till primed with metre's true constructive laws,<lb/> And all the lore of "ictus"
							and of "pause,"—<lb/> The sharp-eyed pedant clears the college nooks,<lb/> And foists purgations into perfect books!</p>
						<p> Ye insect Porsons! whose defrauding plan<lb/> Re-binds each blunder of confus'd Hermánn;<lb/> Look round, and see your
							classic tomes perplex'd,<lb/> With darkening comments, and corrupted text!<lb/> And thou, dear Valpy, whose Delphinic
							trade,<lb/> Through Bloomfield's critic crash, began to fade,—<lb/> No more such variorum'd lumber vamp,<lb/> But, sated
							with thy present gains, decamp;<lb/> Let Priestley's pickled notes awhile succeed,<lb/> And gain, as thine
							did,—surreptitious meed.</p>
						<p> Shall none be praised,—no all-presiding mind<lb/> Illum'd by Heaven, to better human kind?—<lb/> Let powerful Turner's
							philosophic page<lb/> Still teach his country, and this letter'd age;<lb/> And prigs, and dunces, rank from Greece or
							Rome,<lb/> To leave their ancients, and observe at home:<lb/> Unequalled Irving, with pathetic art,<lb/> Still, chaste
							describer, melt the British heart;<lb/> And Scott, thy fame undying as thy soul,<lb/> Blest is the feeling struck by thy
							control!</p>
						<p> Look where we please, there is a sad decline,<lb/> From human, to realities divine;<lb/> Religion, morals,—all but vice,
							decay,<lb/> And Fashion leads, while Folly blinds the day.<lb/> No more the Thespian art's improving power,<lb/> Lights up
							the mind, and lures a vacant hour;<lb/> Nor forceful talent sway with Passion's rod,<lb/> Where Kemble spoke, and
							Shakspeare's heroes trod!<lb/> Ere patch-work dramas, and their tawdry train,<lb/> Prologued the mumm'ries of an impure
							reign,—<lb/> Our stage was evening bliss, where Britons sought<lb/> The flash of Genius and the fire of thought,—<lb/>
							Where guilt was imag'd to the musing eye,<lb/> And dread example drew the gentle sigh,<lb/> Till worth triumphant breath'd
							its hallowed prayer,<lb/> And Virtue smiled to see her semblance there!</p>
						<p> While fumbling dramatists employ their pen,<lb/> Sublimely careless of the where and when,<lb/> Let Britain blush for her
							degraded stage,—<lb/> The scenic fripp'ries of a bloated age:<lb/> A flag far-streaming, with coruscant sheen,<lb/> The
							rose-wreath'd trees to dance along the scene,—<lb/> A pensive fountain lolling on a rock,<lb/> A squirt of lightning, and
							a copper shock;—<lb/> The clash of pewter, and the raw recruit,<lb/> Whose gilded scabbard dangles to his foot;<lb/> And
							then, the lean procession's limping throng,<lb/> Like white-wash'd puppets, wheeling slow along;—<lb/> All these,—with
							clouds to fatten up the sky,<lb/> And mid-day moons to ope the sawney's eye,—<lb/> Drawl out the ling'ring life of plays
							purvey'd,<lb/> And hash'd-up melodrams to serve the trade!</p>
						<p> But most, the clap-trap's heart-convulsive cant,<lb/> Conducive "damns," and well-timed mouthing rant;<lb/> With smutty
							meanings, wrapt in puns and grins,<lb/> The hand's wide sweep, the shoulder-work, and shins—<lb/> Prelude the music of a
							gall'ry squall,—<lb/> Well-earn'd applause for Beazely, Pool or Ball!</p>
						<p> The Comic vein has ceased its merry flow,<lb/> And Satire aims no more th' instructive blow;<lb/> Though faithful
							guardians of the moral spell,<lb/> Forbid a Shakspeare for a Marmontel!—<lb/> Look back on proud Eliza's peerless
							reign,<lb/> And will not our dramatic contrast pain?<lb/> Then playful Congreve kindled humour's fire,<lb/> And Beaumont
							sparkled in the wit's attire;<lb/> While Massinger, with eloquential charm,<lb/> And Forde pathetic, forced the sweet
							alarm;—<lb/> But, these are exiled for a sullied verse,<lb/> Indecent niceness proves their genius coarse!—<lb/>
							Yes!—"Hallers" mourning for a kindred whore,<lb/> Hook their nice noses at the taste of yore!—<lb/> When false decorum
							takes a hoaxing trip,<lb/> And flies the heart, to shelter in the lip.</p>
						<p> Awake thee, Kemble, from thy sluggish trance,<lb/> And drive dramatic flumm'ry to France;<lb/> No more, let poachers of
							exotic trash,<lb/> For Farce and trick, monopolize thy cash;<lb/> Shall fustian flourish, where thy brother paced,<lb/>
							And Shakspeare's boards, by mummers be disgraced!<lb/> Shall piping Roscius represent his king,<lb/> And tragic bull dogs
							bay the crowded ring!<lb/> Though emptied buckets mimic Ocean's fall,<lb/> And sooty jugglers whirl the brazen ball,—<lb/>
							While ragged scenes, refresh'd with horn and drum,<lb/> Secure the shillings of the London scum,—<lb/> These mean
							buffoon'ries blot thy Thespian name,<lb/> And barter genius for a worthless fame;<lb/> O, yet revive the Drama's purer
							part,<lb/> And scout each mess of pantomimic art;<lb/> Let no dull toaders wheedle off thy pay,<lb/> While baffled talent
							shrinks unseen away;—<lb/> Not cawing Kenny's everlasting quill,<lb/> Or plund'ring Pocock's, more eternal still.</p>
						<p> Our manufactur'd plays,—peruse, who list!<lb/> The worst abortions audience ever hissed;<lb/> From Egan's hundred heaps of
							dross obscene,<lb/> To all the trump'ry plaster'd up by Green.</p>
						<p> Peep forth! thou son of genius, prying Pool,<lb/> Unrivalled filcher from the witless school;<lb/> Though kicked behind,
							prolific as before,<lb/> To gull each season with thy smutty store;<lb/> While driv'ling colloquies, and borrowed
							jokes,<lb/> A baseless plot, and vulgar equivoques,—<lb/> While hems, and funny squints, and calf-like nods<lb/> Delight
							the doltish, and transport the "gods,"—<lb/> Our stage shall hail thee her amusive scribe,<lb/> And critic boobies puff
							thee for a bribe.</p>
						<p> Enchanting master of the wry grimace,<lb/> How well thy pieces suit an ugly face!<lb/> O'er all the kingdom mark thy
							glories fly,<lb/> See, shops and buggies bear immortal "Pry"!—<lb/> His nose cocked up with pertinacious pride,<lb/> And
							bagged in breeches, clinging round his side,—<lb/> The goggling puppet served for Liston's use,<lb/> And limped, like
							Poole, from Elliston let loose,—<lb/> It met no frown—no truth-awakening sneer,<lb/> For "Pry" incessant ding'd the
							nation's ear!</p>
						<p> Alas! for Waverly's discover'd bays,<lb/> When Pocock minces novels into plays!<lb/> With dull contrivance, murd'ring
							sense and plot,<lb/> To stew a melodrame from Walter Scott;<lb/> Or, operatic mess of tinsel caps, and coats,<lb/> To live
							on Sapio's, or on Stephens' notes:—<lb/> Though Horne, nor clumsy Serle, could save his "Peake,"<lb/> An unwept death, to
							close its gaudy week!</p>
						<p> Of equal fame, melodious Plànchè's quill,<lb/> Purloins his hum-drum to swell out the bill;<lb/> And, hir'd by managers
							for French bombast,<lb/> He cribs each play, more owlish than the last.</p>
						<p> Kind friend to Laureate Southey's epic fame,<lb/> Prolific Ball,—in nonsense, half as tame,—<lb/> Dramatic patron to
							rejected verse,<lb/> Try thou some wonder from "Kehama's Curse;"<lb/> Then, borne on "Hunchbacks," bid the stage
							adieu,<lb/> And with thee take thy whole be-devil'd crew.</p>
						<p> Sure, all the tribe by Beazely was outdone,<lb/> Who made, for novelty, a midnight sun!<lb/> The purblind cocknies liked
							this wond'rous spell,<lb/> So plenteous plaudits greeted Avenel:—<lb/> O! would that Satire's lash, "at one fell
							swoop,"<lb/> Might level all this play-supplying troop,<lb/> Then should the fanes of Thespis cease to groan,<lb/> With
							dross from Farren, or with trash from Soane.</p>
						<p> So long have melo-drame, and pilfer'd farce,<lb/> Made taste corrupted, and true genius scarce,<lb/> That classic models
							win no patron's eye,<lb/> And outlawd tragedies forgotten lie;<lb/> To win the president of Drury's fane,<lb/> Could any
							but his bloated hirelings deign?—<lb/> Compound some proverbs of obscurest growth,<lb/> The mouldy remnants of the dust
							and moth;<lb/> Add quantums due, of powder, flash, and smoke,<lb/> The scenic whistle, and the poinard's stroke,—<lb/>
							With all appliances of fort and gun,<lb/> Dish up five acts—the tragedy is done!<lb/> Six times, shall thund'ring sticks
							and hired huzzas,<lb/> Force the vile stuff, and wake the slow applause.</p>
						<p> Ye managerial knaves, whose nod decides,<lb/> Whose pocket judges, and whose whim provides;<lb/> Before whose glance the
							manuscript must shake,<lb/> And shirtless authors feel a fellow quake,—<lb/> While throned on high, by British boobies
							paid,<lb/> Let no mean tricks reveal the trust betrayed,—<lb/> Though patronage e'er be a blind-struck dupe,<lb/> And
							sotted thousands to your verdict stoop!—<lb/> Renounce all greedy arts, that end in shame,<lb/> Refine the Drama, and its
							force reclaim;<lb/> No more, let thick-brained poachers, dull and crude,<lb/> Their scribbled bantlings on the stage
							protrude;<lb/> Or ape Mazurier climb the box, from France,—<lb/> Or Ducrow's stud on scenic stables prance;<lb/> Nor bribe
							your bawling mouths to aid a cheat,<lb/> And fill with riff-raff ev'ry vacant seat;—<lb/> Dramatic dignity and wit
							restore,<lb/> Till Genius reign, and Mumm'ry be no more!</p>
						<p> Why should the pertly vulgar cry with scorn,<lb/> "Thank heaven, I'm not a paltry player born!"<lb/> Why should the
							sleek-mouth'd saint appoint his doom,<lb/> And moral prophets damn him round the room?<lb/> There may be virtue in an
							actor's heart,<lb/> Beyond the reach of pharasaic art;—<lb/> He often does, what "saints dare seldom do,"<lb/> Display the
							bad, and keep the good from view.</p>
						<p> Not unremember'd now, shall genius bide,—<lb/> Arouse thee, Kean! be still the drama's pride,<lb/> From nature fresh, with
							spirit in each vein,<lb/> To thrill with pleasure, or delight with pain;—<lb/> Though modest England drove thee from her
							shore,<lb/> While favour'd strumpets footed on thy floor:<lb/> Next princely Kemble, Young, with heart-deep voice,<lb/>
							And proud Macready first of classic choice,—<lb/> Three mighty masters, still supremely great,<lb/> Long grace the
							boards,—our stage-triumvirate!</p>
						<p> 'Tis not their art, but its professors, soil,<lb/> By low debauch, the triumphs of their toil;<lb/> Transplanting parts
							with all an actor's rage,<lb/> To play their whoredoms on a worldly stage!<lb/> Here, turned Lotharian pests, in midnight
							crews,<lb/> They strut the bright aristocrats of stews;<lb/> Or, more select, some buskined heroes burn<lb/> For
							peeresses, and city wives, by turn:—<lb/> One plucks a darling from the lower row,<lb/> Whence plumes and billet-doux
							procure a beau;<lb/> And frowsy beldames eye their fav'rite face,<lb/> Till boundless bribes hush up a foul disgrace!</p>
						<p> No Moorish taste voluptuous, hath divined<lb/> More harem bliss than waits the scenes behind,<lb/> Where waddling dotards,
							unresisted, get<lb/> Sweet virgin flow'rs to grace their coronet,—<lb/> And glimm'ring belles, ere all their bloom is
							past,<lb/> Roll the wild gaze, and yield the ghost at last!<lb/> [.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/>
							[.....]<lb/> That vouch for all the eye hereafter sees;<lb/> These, blazon'd well, with scientific sighs,<lb/> Attract the
							noble, and lead off the prize;—<lb/> Though, now and then an Amazonian belle,<lb/> Flogs back the victim of her beauty's
							spell.</p>
						<p> Who blames the actor, when rich harlots pay,<lb/> Or beastly Colonels bribe the maid away?<lb/> Let the rank country
							fester in its shame,<lb/> When prov'd impures partake the highest fame,<lb/> And mothers, steeled against parental
							fears,<lb/> Unblushing, feast the prostitutes of peers!<lb/> Thus, still ye, Cyprians,—still be splendid whores,<lb/> And
							stalk our stage, amid triumphant roars!—</p>
						<p> Now to the Opera turn, where ballets please,<lb/> And foppish Fashion fumes away at ease;<lb/> There, what fine ear can
							list the lewd-breath'd sounds,<lb/> What decent eye survey the wanton bounds,<lb/> The passion-swelling breast,
							denuded—<lb/> And gauzy robe to fix the straining eyes,—<lb/> Each warm lascivious twirl of panting lust,<lb/> Nor feel
							the burning fever of disgust?<lb/> Bedaub'd with paint, here jewell'd herds compose,<lb/> Their pustul'd persons in the
							steamy rows;<lb/> Pile luscious fancies on transparent limbs,<lb/> Move with each form, and languish as it swims;<lb/>
							[.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/> [.....]<lb/> Patrons of vice, from dunghill or from
							court,<lb/> In mercy, cease such Operatic sport!<lb/> Caress no Boschas in your costly home,<lb/> No whisker'd knave, no
							eunuch scamp'd from Rome;<lb/> O! let the lavish'd millions feed the poor,<lb/> The wan-eyed paupers fainting at your
							door,—<lb/> With pity mark, what home-bred mis'ries stare,<lb/> Let Britons born, an unask'd bounty share,—<lb/> Then
							sickness, want, and woe, would bless the gift,<lb/> And orphan babes, their tear-moist hands uplift.</p>
						<p> What line shall Fashion paint?—that creed of fools<lb/> Whose flighty doctrine, half the empire rules:—<lb/> Queen of the
							rich,—Minerva of the vain,<lb/> Begot by Folly,—cleav'd from Falsehood's brain?<lb/> 'Tis Fashion dies the beldame's
							blister'd cheek,<lb/> Lives in her errant gaze, and kitten squeak;<lb/> 'Tis Fashion rolls the lech'ry of the eye,<lb/>
							Breathes in the tone, and wantons in the sigh,—<lb/> Deals with the gambler, pilfers with the rogue,<lb/> And gives to
							wealth, a new-made decalogue!</p>
						<p> Shall satire dread the judgment of a frown,<lb/> When monsters brave, and villains lead the town!—<lb/> When foreign
							strumpets dare the public gaze,<lb/> And English mothers think they grace our plays!<lb/> The times are come, when arts
							Parisian please,<lb/> And Britons, to be Englishmen must cease:<lb/> To Gallic shores our demi-reps resort,—<lb/> Return
							again—and all their filth import;<lb/> Then like French apes, these scented mongrels talk,<lb/> Feast like the French, and
							like the Frenchmen walk.</p>
						<p> And can it be, that Albion's deemed no more<lb/> A fairer, nobler clime, than Gallia's shore?—<lb/> Must England stoop to
							be the mime of France,<lb/> Beget her toaders, and adopt her dance?<lb/> For novel crimes, need English spendthrifts
							roam<lb/> And kindly teach them to us boors at home?</p>
						<p> What morals mark that blood-presuming rank,<lb/> Where cultured villains emulate each prank!—<lb/> Who best can guzzle
							down the nineteenth glass,<lb/> Denounce a wittal, and select a lass;<lb/> Genteely damn, or sprawl a low lampoon.<lb/>
							And pipe the bawdry of a stable tune;<lb/> Or, growl in cock-pits, shuffle at the "Hell,"<lb/> Supply a harem, and
							proclaim it well!<lb/> E'en women patronize the vice in vogue,<lb/> And hail the triumphs of a rakish rogue;<lb/> Or pat
							his cheek, in love-resenting play,<lb/> While oglings ask, what lips would blush to say.</p>
						<p> A mother's love,—resistless speaks that claim,<lb/> When first the cherub lisps her gentle name!<lb/> And looking up, it
							moves its little tongue,<lb/> In passive dalliance to her bosom clung;—<lb/> 'Tis sweet to view the sinless baby
							rest,<lb/> To drink its life-spring from her nursing breast;<lb/> And mark the smiling mother's mantling eyes,<lb/> While
							hush'd beneath, the helpless infant lies;—<lb/> How fondly pure that unobtruding pray'r,<lb/> Breathed gently o'er the
							listless sleeper there!<lb/> 'Tis nature this!—the forest beast can hug,<lb/> And cubs are nestled 'neath its milky
							dug;<lb/> But Fashion petrifies the human heart,<lb/> Scar'd at her nod, see ev'ry love depart!</p>
						<p> In Rome's majestic days, long fleeted by,<lb/> Did not her mighty dames sing lullaby?—<lb/> No mean-bred hags then nurs'd
							the guiltless child,<lb/> No kitchen slang its innocence despoiled;<lb/> 'Twas deem'd a glory, that the babe should
							rest<lb/> In slumb'ring beauty, on the mother's breast;—<lb/> But England's mighty dame is too genteel,<lb/> To nurse, and
							guard, and like the mother feel!</p>
						<p> Fond bands of love,—how seldom can they bind,<lb/> When sordid wishes rankle in the mind!<lb/> The fret of av'rice soon
							distempers all,<lb/> Till peevish languor bursts the sullen thrall:<lb/> Not so, when Love, the child of Fondness
							born,<lb/> Breathes on, to its own parent faithful sworn;<lb/> Weaving for wedded hearts a mystic chain,<lb/> That feel
							the sorrow, and partake the pain;<lb/> Each true to each, as echo to the sound,—<lb/> One changeless two, through life's
							precarious round:<lb/> Oh, happy pair! thus link'd for smiles and tears,<lb/> Whom absence binds, and grief but more
							endears;<lb/> 'Tis your's, one common hope and fear to know,<lb/> Through the long pilgrimage of joy and woe.</p>
						<p> Miss Prostitution, hail! now buck and rake,<lb/> From female marts such ready fair may take,<lb/> As mothers bred up from
							a ripe eighteen,<lb/> To pant for wooers, and their husbands glean;<lb/> Or chant love-lies, and curtsey with a
							grace,<lb/> While lust meanders through each bloodless face;—<lb/> Then, like their dams, arrayed in patch and plume,<lb/>
							To blaze the leading strumpets of the room!</p>
						<p> Train'd by some venal, match-contriving jade,<lb/> In palsied arms what lovely maidens fade!<lb/> Like flowers
							transplanted to a sandy heath,<lb/> Where vapours wither, and pollutions breathe:<lb/> Great heaven!—and must youth's
							summer fleet away,<lb/> In cheerless union with the bald and grey?<lb/> Must blooming forms, and stainless bosoms
							press,<lb/> Where passion mocks, and nature cannot bless!<lb/> What eye can such a loathsome scene behold,<lb/> Nor curse
							the rottenness preserv'd in gold?</p>
						<p> To marry wealth, what anguish will be borne?<lb/> A crooked log by night—a child by morn!<lb/> His parchment sealed?—the
							wife attends each whim,<lb/> Starts at his groan, and chafes the flannell'd limb;<lb/> Hangs round his knee, and whimpers
							at his wrath,<lb/> Secures his tucker, and spoons out his broth;<lb/> A vigil, down to periwig and cap,<lb/> She prays for
							death,—and sees it in his nap!</p>
						<p> O Love!—exhaustless theme for print and pen,<lb/> Thou dream of women, and thou joke of men,<lb/> We will not curse thee
							for thy cruel crimes,<lb/> In distant regions, or in darker times,—<lb/> But turn to Britain, blessed with blooming
							arts,<lb/> And hear her tearful tales of stricken hearts;<lb/> Of beauty, blemish'd by seduction's stain,<lb/> Of
							with'ring sorrow, and unpitied pain:<lb/> Where mailed in rank, seducers boast the deed,<lb/> While female lechers smile
							applausive meed,<lb/> And ticklish flirts a pretty pardon grant,<lb/> Or fusty dow'gers on the tale descant!</p>
						<p> O, I have seen, the young and trusting maid,<lb/> By love beguil'd—enraptured—and betrayed,<lb/> Fade day by day, in
							unregarded gloom,<lb/> And greet the shelter of an early tomb:<lb/> To virtue lost,—her sex's chilling frown,<lb/> Forbad
							the smile, and awed her spirit down;<lb/> Abandoned thus, oh, where could hope appear?<lb/> None felt her throb—none wiped
							the mourner's tear!</p>
						<p> When blushing Love first breathes its virgin sigh,<lb/> And fond devotion glitters in the eye;<lb/> How soon it steals an
							unsuspecting mind,<lb/> That melts away, like perfume on the wind!<lb/> Not half so fondly does the bud repose,<lb/> Its
							drooping beauty on the parent rose;<lb/> Not half so tenderly the dew-lit gem<lb/> At morning, hang upon the languid
							stem,—<lb/> As woman's maiden love,—when true and warm,<lb/> Rests on the plighted vow, and lover's charm:<lb/> How base
							the bosom then, with treach'ry fraught,<lb/> For her who claims the homage of each thought!</p>
						<p> England, full rare thy decent matrons now,<lb/> Though Time has delved his wrinkles on the brow!<lb/> Shame on't!—to see
							thine unrepenting jades,<lb/> The female blacklegs,—filch like "Hell"-taught blades,<lb/> When fourscore years have
							bronz'd their mummied face,<lb/> And ev'ry furrow is a theme's disgrace:—<lb/> Mark! at their table, how the beldames
							sigh,<lb/> Turn their brown neck, and blink the sunken eye;<lb/> Anon, their wither'd carcase heave and puff,—<lb/> With
							pustuled cheeks, and lips befouled with snuff;<lb/> Squat round the pack, they gamble and they grin,<lb/> Rub their lean
							hands, and sweat their brows to win!</p>
						<p> In wint'ry age, how sadly drear the lot<lb/> Of Fashion's hack, by Fashion's host forgot!—<lb/> Bowed down by crippled
							age, impurely grey,<lb/> To mental throes, and peevish qualms a prey:<lb/> Dimm'd now the youthful gleams of love-lit
							eyes,<lb/> And cold the filmy lid that o'er them lies;<lb/> O, where are they that throng'd her matin court,<lb/> Plann'd
							out the day's intrigue, and shared its sport,—<lb/> Who praised her plumes, her love-attracting gait,<lb/> And ball-room
							glance, that bade the proudest wait?<lb/> Alas! the parasites of youth have fled,<lb/> Some mope like her, some fill their
							wormy bed.</p>
						<p> How rank has lost by condescending crimes,<lb/> That birth-right influence felt in purer times,<lb/> When titled greatness
							won respectful awe,<lb/> And lowly ranks a worthy peerage saw;<lb/> While lineal honours bloomed without disgrace,<lb/>
							And every heir begat a better race;—<lb/> Now, rank bequeath'd to high-begotten shame,<lb/> But hands the mirror to
							degen'rate fame.</p>
						<p> Review thy thickening peerage, Albion, now,<lb/> And rare the peer, that lifts an honoured brow!<lb/> Where spring such
							crimes of undecaying growth,<lb/> Such innate vileness, and voluptuous sloth?—<lb/> The bestial panders of Domitian's
							reign,<lb/> Now mark, thy mindless,—bloated,—titled train!<lb/> St. Giles and Billingsgate are horrid holes,<lb/> And
							Newgate shelters some atrocious souls;<lb/> But scour out England's most polluted spots,<lb/> Convene her bullies, and
							select her sots,—<lb/> And let presiding Truth, unmoved, declare,<lb/> Will not our peerage match the vilest there?—<lb/>
							Peers of the realm—the autocrats that shine,<lb/> With lineage reckon'd up to Cæsar's line!</p>
						<p> But still, though vile,—the peerage read some books,<lb/> To smooth their manners and refine their looks;<lb/> Soft
							Little's verse—or any am'rous chime,<lb/> To tickle fancy, and toy off the time:<lb/> While now and then, to train both
							fop and peer,<lb/> And furnish scandal to enlive the year,<lb/> Select confessions of exemplive cast,<lb/> From first-rate
							hacks, whose hour of glory's past;<lb/> Come forth, and meet a most abundant sale,—<lb/> For what so pleasing as a
							harlot's tale?</p>
						<p> Contrast the hour of Fashion's brief delight,<lb/> With that, of fearful Death's unhallow'd night;<lb/> When life and time
							are ebbing to their close,<lb/> And martyr'd pleasure dreads the tomb's repose:—<lb/> Alone and fever'd, on his sleepless
							bed,<lb/> Yon dying libertine supports his head;<lb/> There is an awe—a silence in the gloom,<lb/> As if the fiend were
							cow'ring o'er the room:<lb/> A faintly-glimm'ring taper flickers there,<lb/> Tinting his livid cheek with hectic
							glare;<lb/> While throbs of guilt are quivering thro' each limb:—<lb/> Thus Folly consummates her reign in him!</p>
						<p> Days were, when beauty, love, saloon and ball,<lb/> Found him the gayest, wildest, rake of all;<lb/> Unmanly wreck! all
							blanch'd and blighted now,<lb/> With hollow cheek, and anguish-moisten'd brow,<lb/> Oft turns he round, to feel his
							throbbing brain,<lb/> Grind his dark teeth, and root his locks for pain;—<lb/> Then tears the garment from his heated
							breast,<lb/> And lifts in vain, his pale-clench'd hands, for rest;<lb/> No tears of sad remorse bedew his face,<lb/> But
							penitential woe is in each trace;<lb/> Those burning lips that breathe a dismal sigh,<lb/> The phrenzies flashing from his
							fretful eye,<lb/> That wild convulsion through each feature spread,—<lb/> All speak of pangful guilt, and hopeless
							dread!</p>
						<p> And thou, Religion, heaven-descended maid,<lb/> What crews molest thee, and thy shrine invade?<lb/> Where all thy pristine
							grace unsoiled with art,—<lb/> The offer'd incense of a glowing heart?<lb/> On most, how toilsome steals the Sabbath
							day,<lb/> How few can worship, though their fingers pray!<lb/> Sabbatic rites are deemed but prudish ties,<lb/> While
							penitence contents itself with sighs.<lb/> A lolling bliss where scented loungers meet,<lb/> And lip-wide grins all round
							the velvet seat;<lb/> The fretful mumbling of an unfelt prayer,<lb/> Or snoozing godsend in a padded chair,—<lb/> These,
							with the practice of the Sunday moan,<lb/> Are Fashion's off'rings at Jehovah's throne!</p>
						<p> Fresh Christian locusts, whose unfetter'd cant,<lb/> Provides the fuel for deistic rant,—<lb/> Arise each day,—besotted,
							wild, or mad,<lb/> To craze the holy, and augment the bad;<lb/>Who trace the Godhead in each trick of life,<lb/>And hear
							his thunders rolling for their strife!<lb/> First, see the addle-headed Ranters, try<lb/> To wake St. Peter, with a
							hideous cry;<lb/> Sublime their doctrines, when unloosen'd jaws<lb/> Are baying heaven, like congregate Macaws!—<lb/>
							While, sprightlier still, the jolly Jumper squalls;<lb/> For God inspires high-leaping Bacchanals!!—<lb/> What more!
							Yes;—here they creep with psalm and song,<lb/> The dipping Baptist, and Moravian throng.</p>
						<p> Last, Huntingdon's cold, pharasaic herd,<lb/> Self-loving dolers of the grace and word,—<lb/> Pourtray the gospel in their
							sour grimace,<lb/> Or prove its pureness by a smutty face;<lb/> Election swells their puritanic breast,—<lb/> For them,
							salvation smiles the soul to rest:<lb/> Cant in each word, and "Bible" for each boast,<lb/> They paint "Old Nick"—as if
							they loved him most!</p>
						<p> With lanky locks upon a sheepish head,<lb/> And visage stolen from the mould'ring dead,<lb/> While ghostly terrors bend
							the bile-ting'd brow,—<lb/> His black chin lolled in sleepy lump below,—<lb/> The methodistic preacher heads his
							clan,<lb/> A precious sample of angelic man:<lb/> Perch'd in the pulpit, how he frowns beneath,<lb/> What heavenly
							phrenzies wet his clatt'ring teeth!<lb/> His chisell'd features, seem but granite stone,—<lb/> And snivel sanctifies each
							grunted moan;<lb/> The saintly curl upon his quiv'ring lip,<lb/> Whence awful threats in rich saliva drip,—<lb/> That
							pharasaic rankness in his sneer,<lb/> And donkey voice, betrayful of the seer,—<lb/> All prove him dropp'd from heaven,
							the world to save.<lb/> To picture Hell, and realise the grave!</p>
						<p> How loathes the eye! to see the babbler preach,<lb/> And shoot his neck, to frighten and to teach;<lb/> To mark him spread
							about his clammy palms,<lb/> And sputter forth in cant, celestial qualms,<lb/> Now, wild-struck, turning to the chapel's
							roof,—<lb/> Now down to Hades for sublimer proof:<lb/> Great God!—and should Religion's awful aim,<lb/> Be thus unravell'd
							by the fool's acclaim,—<lb/> Or, hoaxing zealots, pluck'd from shop or cell,<lb/> Rant forth, like mountebanks, on "heaven
							and hell!"<lb/> Since venalism rules both head and heart,<lb/> The Church hath dwindled to Ambition's mart,<lb/> And
							av'rice soils that fane, supposed to be<lb/> The earthly temple of the Deity:<lb/> Some stick the righteous "Rev'rend" to
							their name,<lb/> To prop its meanness, and obtrude its fame:<lb/> While others, drawl an unpresuming strain,<lb/> While
							lawn and mitres dance about their brain:—<lb/> Who knows, when powder'd well, and stol'd in white,<lb/> If God, or livings
							form their best delight?<lb/> Next, see the Rectors, whose ancestral worth,<lb/> Secures a "good fat" living, at their
							birth;<lb/> From college ripe, they chaunt the hunter's song,<lb/> Drink, chase, and shoot the wood's wild "feather'd
							throng"<lb/> Let the lean Curate, in his white-wash'd room,<lb/> Gulp the small beer, and preach the sinner's doom,—<lb/>
							With foggy throat three sermons growl a day,<lb/> And, thankful, feast on sixty pounds for pay!</p>
						<p> What now is Irving,—he who heav'd his tongue,<lb/> As if a world upon its ravings hung?<lb/> He gave a trinket to redeem
							the Jews,—<lb/> (Sure, such a Scotchman, Heav'n will not refuse!)<lb/> And nobly vow'd, his pious craft should make,<lb/>
							His best orations for the bauble's sake:<lb/> Wo! to Isaiah,—and his rostrum too,<lb/> Deserted now, but by the cockney
							few!—<lb/> There, let the vaunter pant, and puff, and sneer,<lb/> And rattle doctrines through the splitting ear.</p>
						<p> More honest, and less stern, wags merry Hill,<lb/> A grey-locked joker, in the pulpit still,<lb/> Whose John Bull sermons
							wake the chapel's grin,<lb/> When smiling Conscience owns her tickled sin:<lb/> How tender he, to Adam's recreant
							race,<lb/> When "putrid sores" depict our need for grace,—<lb/> While softly wiling off each hungry grief,<lb/> He carves
							the gospel into rounds of "beef!"<lb/> O Rowland, Rowland!—cease thy wink and nod,<lb/> Nor be a pulpit punch, to joke for
							God.</p>
						<p> Not preaching Bedlamites alone arise,<lb/> To force the gospel, and astound with cries,—<lb/> But rank revilers, headed by
							Carlile,<lb/> Blaspheming, pour their poison through the isle;<lb/> While foul-mouth'd Ign'rance spits her impious
							gibes,<lb/> And London swarms with Atheistic tribes!</p>
						<p> Now for the apex of polluted souls,<lb/> No shame subdues, no reverence controuls,<lb/> Puff'd into pertness, pand'ring to
							the time,<lb/> Two pinnacles of blasphemy and crime;—<lb/> Come, godless, blushless—England's vilest pair,<lb/> Blots on
							her land, and pestful to the air,—<lb/> C--- and T---!—may each kindred name,<lb/> Be linked to one eternity of shame!</p>
						<p> First, thou, the cap'ring coxcomb of the two,<lb/> With head upshooting from thy coat of blue,—<lb/> Say, what has
							"Reverend" to do with thee,<lb/> Though big and bloated with effrontery?<lb/> Wert Reverend, when round thee lolled a
							gang,<lb/> To drink the poison of thine impious slang;<lb/> And on Heav'n's book, thy cursed feet then trod,<lb/> To foam
							thy foulness at the throne of God?—<lb/> Wert Reverend, when from the pot-house turn'd,<lb/> And drunken fevers through
							thy bosom burn'd,—<lb/> Mean to the larc'ny of a paltry pot,<lb/> At once a rogue, an Atheist, and a sot!<lb/> Or,
							Reverend,—when to each Christian fane,<lb/> Thou lead'st the barking bull-dogs of thy train,<lb/> In mean and native
							brutishness of mind,<lb/> To growl thy dogmas, and pervert the blind?—<lb/> Go, caitiff!—put a mask upon that face,<lb/>
							The staring mirror of thy soul's disgrace,<lb/> Go, seek some dunghill to harangue thy breed,<lb/> And there enjoy the
							dark satannic creed:—<lb/> Though stiff in port, and stately with thy glass,<lb/> May good men frown, whene'er they see
							thee pass,<lb/> Till even infant tongues shall lisp thee, "vile,"<lb/> And Britons hoot thee from their tainted isle!</p>
						<p> The base we've had, of ev'ry kind and hue,<lb/> The bloody, lech'rous, and unnat'ral too—<lb/> But never, yet, the wretch
							that equall'd thee,<lb/> Thou synonyme of all depravity;<lb/> Thy mind as canker'd as thy columns vile,—<lb/> Thou
							pois'nous, poor polluted thing,—C—!<lb/> For thee, must heaven's empyreal portals close,<lb/> And Hope be buried in her
							dead repose!—<lb/> For thee must glorious aspirations cease,<lb/> Nor Faith, still vision, out her heav'n of peace,<lb/>
							And minds no longer dare to feel divine,<lb/> But turn distorted, fester'd, lewd as thine!—<lb/> If yet within thee dwell
							one thought of shame,<lb/> If the least true feeling for thy country's claim,<lb/> And common nature but preserve her
							right,—<lb/> Then tear thy hellish pictures from our sight;<lb/> If vile thou must be,—hie thee to some den,<lb/> To feast
							the fancies of thy fellow-men;<lb/> But stand not forth to Britain's public eye,<lb/> The monger-fiend of painted
							blasphemy;<lb/> Now go!—and quickly end thy course perverse,<lb/> Hung on the gibbet of a nation's curse!</p>
						<p> Ascendant God, still let unslumb'ring love,<lb/> Gaze down from thine all-glorious throne above;<lb/> Expel illusion from
							each erring mind,<lb/> Thine be the judgment, ours the will resigned;<lb/> O, long from Britain keep that fearful
							hour,<lb/> When unrelenting crime shall curse thy power;—<lb/> When hearts shall cease to plead to be forgiv'n,<lb/> And
							banished Faith unveil no future heav'n!</p>
						<p> Thou flower of cities, Earth's imperial mart,<lb/> Unequal'd London!—Britain's mighty heart;<lb/> That, like our
							blood-spring with reversive tide,<lb/> Receiving, pour'st to empires far and wide,—<lb/> To thee, the nations look, like
							Magi bowed<lb/> Before their fire-god, in his burning shroud:<lb/> There is a living spell around thee spread,<lb/> That
							wakes the shadows of thy peerless dead;—<lb/> Within thy walls, we tread enchanted ground,<lb/> By sages, poets,
							martyrs,—made renowned!<lb/> What heroes here, what kings have sprung to birth,<lb/> What martyr'd minds of unexhausted
							worth,—<lb/> What gifted ones of heaven's congenial sphere,<lb/> Have liv'd and struggl'd—starv'd and triumph'd here!<lb/>
							O, never can I press one stone of thine,<lb/> Nor think of feet that trod, where now tread mine,—<lb/> Of unforgotten
							greatness that hath been,<lb/> Of genius weeping, perhaps, where I am seen.</p>
						<p> While bagatelles in ev'ry distant clime,<lb/> Receive the sacrifice of prose and rhyme,<lb/> And gaping pilgrims leave
							their English home,<lb/> With wonder-searching eye for Greece and Rome;—<lb/> Must London share no patriot's glowing
							theme?—<lb/> Can none sing ancient Thamis' freighted stream;<lb/> Meand'ring far through sun-bright meads, and rifts;<lb/>
							'Neath beetling hills, and Henley's chalky clifts,<lb/> With grass-green banks, where cluster'd villas peep,<lb/> In
							sylvan beauty, from their laurel'd steep?—<lb/> Her piles of glory, and her pillar'd halls,<lb/> Her tow'ring mansions and
							historic walls?</p>
						<p> While speeds the crowd, how oft I pause to view,<lb/> The fairy scene from thy Bridge, Waterloo!—<lb/> And rest my arms
							upon the massy stone,<lb/> Till spell-blind fancy dreams I stand alone;<lb/> Soft whisp'ring flows thy spread of infant
							waves,<lb/> While far along the dizzy sunshine laves,—<lb/> Dancing as light and mellow on the stream,<lb/> As Hope's
							first glimmer on a youthful dream!—<lb/> Fleet down the river skip the careless boats,<lb/> While o'er its bosom tremble
							flute-breath'd notes;<lb/> Or, light barks cluster near its heaving side,<lb/> Whose tangled oars are imaged in the
							tide;—<lb/> Upraise the glance,—majestic to the eyes,<lb/> Above the amber'd stream, the bridges rise;<lb/> While
							slumb'ring near, with unpartaking smile,<lb/> Behold the massive, many-windowed pile.</p>
						<p> For thoughts sublime, aloft the Abbey rears<lb/> Its towers, in all the majesty of years;<lb/> Unawed, no British patriots
							here can tread,<lb/> The dim cold fane where sleep the mighty dead;—<lb/> But, while each dome and ancient fane
							conspire,<lb/> To rouse the poet, and attune his lyre;<lb/> Compel'd, we mark, where London scenes entice,<lb/> This queen
							of cities in the sink of vice!</p>
						<p> To London—now so Babylonian grown,<lb/> That half is scarce to genuine cocknies known;—<lb/> What errant mongrels of
							exotic breed,<lb/> What motly knaves from Ganges to the Tweed,—<lb/> Advent'rous tramp, with mother, brat, and
							spouse,<lb/> Quite scripless all, as to some pauper house?<lb/> From Ludgate Hill,—see myriads throng in view,—<lb/> Turk,
							Swiss, and Gaul, John Bull and howling Jew;<lb/> The world assembled from each far-off clime,<lb/> All passing swiftly to
							the goal of time;<lb/> Here, as the buzzing crowds collected meet,<lb/> Behold the living drama of the street!—<lb/> The
							greasy trader paddling with his arms,<lb/> The rustic monarch furious for his farms,<lb/> The hawk-eyed bailiff, clerk,
							and jobber grey,<lb/> With currish boobies, fumbling for their way,—<lb/> The flying porters, and the ballad throng,<lb/>
							That pick the pocket with a venal song,<lb/> With all the melody of whips and wheels,<lb/> Of bellmen, pawing hoofs, and
							mud-splash'd heels;—<lb/> No melodrames, though hash'd by Pool or Peake,<lb/> Such mingled droll'ry, and true pathos
							speak!</p>
						<p> Parade the streets!—what countless wonders rise,<lb/> Eternal changing to the changing eyes!<lb/> Fresh sights unrival'd
							by Niag'ra's Fall,—<lb/> Miverva pigs, and tigers from Bengal,<lb/>Brobdignag heroes,—Lilliputian dwarfs,<lb/> And
							breeches languishing near ladies' scarfs!<lb/> The lame in dog-cars—giants on their stilts,<lb/> And matrons fing'ring out
							the ruffled quilts!—<lb/> Here, Hunt turns shoe-black to his dear-lov'd land,<lb/> And poisonous Eady dirts the lazy
							hand;<lb/> Here, round some pander's lust-purveying shop,<lb/> The peering urchins strain their necks, and stop,—<lb/>
							While coal-hole sermons, when the walls are bare,<lb/> With smug enticement catch the lounger's stare.</p>
						<p> From vulgar scenes, sometimes a gilded change,<lb/> When paunchy shrieves enjoy their wat'ry range;<lb/> Now bells are
							cracked! and fat the turtle flames,—<lb/> For proudly sails the charlatan of Thames!<lb/> The sinking river sweats beneath
							its weight,<lb/> And bubbles anger at the capon'd freight;<lb/> While wond'ring ideots stare along the shore,<lb/> Sigh
							for the soup, or watch the dipping oar.</p>
						<p> When decent nonsense lures the listless throng,<lb/> Small Waithman's speech, or blund'ring Beazeley's song<lb/> Repugnant
							Sense, disdainful of the town,<lb/> Collects her censure in a passing frown;<lb/> When tumbling Gilchrist tortures men and
							girls,<lb/> To twist their bodies for gymnastic twirls,<lb/> All laugh, to think that morning streets are left,<lb/> And
							wives, through humbug, of their mates bereft,—<lb/> But shall we smile, when filthy imports bless<lb/> A nation's eye with
							bony nakedness?—<lb/> How flocked the ton, and curious virgin clan,<lb/> To view the skinless mirror of a man,<lb/>
							Shipped off from Gaul—where skeletons abound—<lb/> To show its beastly zone on British ground!<lb/> Lascivious Gaul! in
							mercy send no more<lb/> Disgustful sweepings, from thy baleful shore;<lb/> Keep all such filth, to please thine own foul
							race,<lb/> Mean without shame, and lewd without disgrace!</p>
						<p> But while the rich, the vicious, and the vain,<lb/> Pursue their pleasure till it turn to pain,—<lb/> While Rank rolls on,
							and Pride upturns her eye,<lb/> What hapless, houseless, wretches wander by,—<lb/> From babes, whose tongue cannot repeat
							their woe,<lb/> To Age, that totters on with locks of snow!<lb/> Where'er we move, some wailings strike the ear,<lb/> And
							melt humanity into a tear!—<lb/> My countrymen,—though famished, friendless, poor,<lb/> Or trembling tatter'd, at the
							spurner's door,—<lb/> Like Stoics, bear an uncomplaining grief,<lb/> Till Government shall bring its slow relief!</p>
						<p> Will Pity aid?—oh, here are pangless hearts,<lb/> Where sympathy no tender pain imparts;<lb/> Eyes, that can mark, like
							dead ones, fixed as glass,<lb/> The tearful Britons, fainting as they pass!—<lb/> Unnoticed here, the pauper lorn and
							pale,<lb/> With bleeding feet, may shiver to his tale,—<lb/> Unfed, the sailor with his quiv'ring lip<lb/> Recal the
							ocean, by a painted ship,—<lb/> Unwept, a suckling Niobé may plead,<lb/> While clinging infants lisp their early
							need!<lb/> And sadly faint, the shredless and unknown,<lb/> May chalk their fortunes on their bed of stone.</p>
						<p> To this huge capital,—the dream of youth,<lb/> That paradise till Fancy melt in truth,—<lb/> The young advent'rer,
							kindling for a name,<lb/> Repairs to offer at the shrine of Fame:<lb/> Parental lips have sealed their parting kiss,<lb/>
							And fond farewells have omen'd future bliss,—<lb/> Then proudly pure, his panting bosom glows,<lb/> While Hope around him
							all her magic throws;<lb/> Thus comes he to the crowded capital,<lb/> Where toil-worn genius fades, and talents fall;<lb/>
							And hate and rivalship alike conspire,<lb/> To crush the spirit, and exhale its fire.</p>
						<p> Deluding weakness! here did Goldsmith roam,<lb/> And Chatterton could share no shelt'ring home;<lb/> Here, martyred Otway
							hunger'd to his grave,<lb/> And toiling Johnson drudg'd a printer's slave!<lb/> The lurking satire of each stranger's
							eye,<lb/> The bribe-fed sycophants that swagger by,—<lb/> The knaves that cozen, and the fools that goad,<lb/> With all
							the thorns on life's precarious road,—<lb/> Commingled, these oft balk the firstling thrown<lb/> On life, to steer his
							little bark alone:<lb/> How many a flower of dear domestic pride,<lb/> In wasted fragrance here, has drooped and died!</p>
						<p> Yet better far, to languish on and die,<lb/> Than live to pen the page of infamy,<lb/> Like those dull tools that browse
							on mean-got pay,<lb/> And furbish libels to supply the day,—<lb/> Too vain to labour where their fathers did,<lb/> Turned
							letter'd dolts in gloomy garrets hid;<lb/> Where, unbeheld, their fev'rish lungs can drink,<lb/> The smoky airs that
							whistle through each chink:<lb/> A bed, whose bronzing blankets sweep the ground,<lb/> Amid dismember'd chattels mourning
							round;<lb/> One fusty board, where rare the grub is placed,<lb/> A desk, and shelf with mildew'd volumes graced—<lb/> And
							lamp and filth—complete the stenching room,<lb/> Where Cockney paper-minions mope and fume.<lb/> Fine rapes and
							murders—acted in the brain,—<lb/> And sudden fires quenched out by sudden rain;<lb/> A magic quill, for pand'ring party
							lies,<lb/> To heap on virtuous heads foul calumnies;<lb/> The art to wrench a pun, or slimy bit<lb/> Of cobbled nonsense
							clench'd up into wit,<lb/> Or, pinch a puff—indite a paragraph,<lb/> Or Tookish squib to make the Tookites laugh,—<lb/>
							Insures a living where detraction's fed,<lb/> A "free admission," and a lousy bed.<lb/> The skinny lip, moist eye, and
							thread-worn dress,<lb/> And lean long visage, soap can seldom bless,—<lb/> Announcing mark, like Cain's base-branded
							brow,<lb/> These plodding elves, from Grub-street to the Row.</p>
						<p> Sure, England's climate more diseaseful grows,<lb/> And every gust a fresh distemper blows!<lb/> Since Æsculapians now,
							like mushrooms rise,<lb/> And physic sickens on the sated eyes.<lb/> No art is quackless now;—from College skill,<lb/> To
							Lambert's Balm, and Abernethy's pill:<lb/> What lives are ravag'd by the baleful craft,<lb/> Of canker'd powders, and
							blood-pois'ning draught!<lb/> Who knows what hapless victims yearly fall,<lb/> By lancing lubbers, and cathartic
							ball;—<lb/> Hack'd, swill'd, and purg'd, till physic stifle breath,—<lb/> Though such mistakes ne'er hap till after
							death!</p>
						<p> Our flesh seems priceless after parted life,<lb/> And feeling shudders at the murd'rous knife;<lb/> That worms should
							feast upon primeval earth,—<lb/> This doctrine Nature speaks, to mark our birth;<lb/> But human thieves, to mawl th'
							uncoffin'd clay,<lb/> And tear men up before the judgment day!—<lb/> Such putrid horrors for the Christian dead,<lb/>
							Become a cannibal's,—or Cooper's head;<lb/> Though Abernethy sniff his awful nose,<lb/> And College puppies plant their
							bloody blows!</p>
						<p>"An honest man's the noblest work of God;"<lb/> So lectur'd Pope, who swayed the critic's rod;—<lb/> He's prais'd by
							matron, moralist and don,<lb/> Though seen more rarely than the coal-black swan!<lb/>True Honesty!—where is it in these
							days,<lb/> When rogues repeat, and villains beg their praise?—<lb/> Not in the full-blown unassuming face,<lb/> Where
							honesty is but a smiling grace;<lb/> Nor in the glossy candour of their tones,<lb/> Who pule and gabble what the heart
							disowns;—<lb/> Nor in prim proverbs daub'd with moral paint,<lb/> Where unfelt goodness whimpers from the saint,<lb/> Or
							mumbling drones, that foster secret vice,<lb/> But blazon Virtue, and define her nice:<lb/> In truth, the honest man
							scarce lives at all,<lb/> The last I saw, was on a church-yard wall!—<lb/> If ev'ry knave must have his reprimand,<lb/>
							Then take a rope, and gibbet half the land.</p>
						<p> A tribe there is,—the tribe of every street,<lb/> That steal unhang'd, yet help to hang the cheat;<lb/> A plague so
							direful, Egypt never saw,—<lb/> The money-gulping vermin of the law:<lb/> The perjur'd banes to aught sincere and
							good,<lb/> Who prowl for jobs, and filch for daily food:<lb/> No doubt, if Satan roams his kindred earth,<lb/> He finds a
							lawyer's cranium for his birth!</p>
						<p> Down that long lane, whose time-encrusted porch<lb/> Leads care-worn clients to a dubious lurch,<lb/> In woeful wigs, and
							wavy robes resort,<lb/> Our budding Eldons, to beseige the court;<lb/> With fretful step, and circumambient glance,<lb/>
							And wrinkled brow, and bag, all slow advance;<lb/> Grim, lean, and hunger'd,—pond'ring on their cause,<lb/> And prompt to
							spy the loop-holes of the laws.<lb/> But see! what dapper caitiffs bustling come,<lb/> Whose teeth-grip'd lips compress
							the mutter'd hum?<lb/> A savage grin plays on the sallow cheek,<lb/> While knitting eye-brows, augur'd pillage speak;<lb/>
							Beneath their hugging arms, tied briefs repose,<lb/> And free behind, the ruby tape-string flows:<lb/> These are the
							scurvy minions of a breed,<lb/> Whose sateless mouths on thwarted justice feed,—<lb/> A cringing, tricky, over-bearing
							host,<lb/> Whose law is quibble, and whose cheat's a boast;<lb/> Who twist fair reason to a crooked shape<lb/> Teach fraud
							to flourish, and the rogue to'scape,<lb/> Conceal a contract deed, from orphans wrench,<lb/> And help the thief, both in
							and out the bench;<lb/> A baser tribe, three kingdoms cannot nurse,<lb/> To well-stocked clients, bowing, sneaking,
							terse;<lb/> To lowlier ones, presumptive braggarts they,—<lb/> Tap-room Moguls, and despots of the day:<lb/> E'en round
							the cup they'll pant to twine the laws,<lb/> And plot a quarrel, to create a cause!</p>
						<p> Now leave the law, for that which must allure,—<lb/> For modesty—so docile and so pure!<lb/> Marked in the gait, and
							seated on the front,<lb/> And just now gallicised to, mauvaise honte,—<lb/> Of ev'ry home and ev'ry clime a part,<lb/> But
							rarely templed in the taintless heart:<lb/> The French (a southern clime is apt to warm,)<lb/> Perceive its presence in
							each filthy charm:—<lb/>Their wanton beauties daunt the bravest eye,<lb/> Nor blush, when petticoats ascend too high,<lb/>
							No further,—'tis but artlessness revealed,—<lb/> Their honour's guarded by the stoic shield:<lb/> In Britain, (were she,
							faithful to her name,<lb/> Un-French in manner, as un-French in fame!)<lb/> True modesty and love are threadbare
							themes,<lb/> For moral mouths, and sanctimonious dreams;—<lb/> Yes! here behold it in a wax-doll maid,<lb/> With minc'd
							palaver, and a step delayed,—<lb/> In squeaks of sentiment, and lips that sigh<lb/> A dismal death-dirge o'er a bleeding
							fly,—<lb/> Or eyes that dribble buckets full of tears,<lb/> And heads that droop down like dead donkies' ears!<lb/> How
							modest too, those plaintive mouths that share<lb/> No bliss colloquial, save 'tis simpering there?—<lb/> How modest
							Coutts! that with an awkward shame,<lb/> Does good by stealth, and frowns to find it fame.</p>
						<p> Now titles seldom shine without a spot,<lb/> Start not, to find distinctive rank forgot;<lb/> That pert Intrusion levels
							all the town,<lb/> And ev'ry rascal wears a kingly frown:<lb/> Securely panoplied in birth-right brass,<lb/> Our spurious
							"gentles" undiscover'd pass;<lb/> And swagger on with autocratic sneer,<lb/> The first to babble, and the last to
							hear.—<lb/> "What titled Nabob he, that quizzes there,<lb/> With braided bosom, and Macassar'd hair?<lb/> The creamy
							glove, and supercilious shoe,<lb/> That glossy garment of imperial blue,—<lb/> Those taper'd fingers, and unwholesome
							skin,<lb/> Betray patrician spirit shrined within?"—<lb/> O, that's a tailor, kneaded to a fop,<lb/> Obliged Sir T. with
							loans,—and left his shop!<lb/> "And who is he, with punchy cheek, and nose,<lb/> Whose vermeil tip with pompous grandeur
							glows?"—<lb/> A bouncing huckster,—in the Commons now,<lb/> Who piles his honour on a brazen brow.</p>
						<p> Revealing day has fled;—and foggy Night,<lb/> With mist, and lamp-light, claims alternate right:<lb/> Now, perch'd in
							coaches, whirl to see the play,<lb/> The stiff-neck'd traders, weary of their day;<lb/> Clad in the motley hues of dressy
							skill,<lb/> How sweet to lose the meanness of a till!<lb/> Alack! each grumble, posture, gabbling flow,<lb/> Announce the
							shop,—though in the lower row;<lb/> The frowsy Hottentots that puff and stare,<lb/> The snip that paws his chin, and ruffs
							his hair,<lb/> The sleek apprentice, balancing his side,<lb/> And fumbling hucksters, big with watch-chain pride,<lb/>
							Poor mimics!—show amid their "bran new" dress,<lb/> The direful struggles of vain littleness.</p>
						<p> How time must lag, where Fashion sits the queen,<lb/> Nor heart, nor soul, commingles with the scene;<lb/> Where each
							succeeding hour is but the last,<lb/> And Folly stagnates, by herself surpass'd:—<lb/> To scribble, leave the card's
							diurnal lie,<lb/> Watch Christie's grin, or pinch a noon-tide pie,<lb/> Create importance in a matin call,<lb/> Unpack a
							tradesman's shop—nor buy at all,—<lb/> Crawl forth each morn, and so yawn out the day,<lb/> Growl, smile, and
							guzzle,—sorrowing, to be gay;<lb/> Thus, Fashion dupes her addle-headed slaves,<lb/> Until, like dogs, they shrivel to
							their graves!</p>
						<p> How sweet those hours! where beldames, fine and fat,<lb/> Enjoy the curtsey, and the thumb-worn hat;<lb/> Now, fools
							assembled for a tongue-born strife,<lb/> In nimble nonsense talk away their life;<lb/> What Miss elop'd?—Whose paroquet
							has died?—<lb/> The mighty trash a solemn hint implied;<lb/> How gross Duke D—! how famine thins the land!<lb/> What
							future "Boleyn" groans 'neath Milman's hand?<lb/> Of C—m's amours, Fitzherbert's right,—<lb/> What new-made whore shall
							kick the stage to-night?<lb/> Here, tender Wellesley and enamour'd Bligh,<lb/> With kid-napp'd Turner, rouse each
							Wakefield's sigh;<lb/> Here pug-like Brummells wince, and Berkleys walk,<lb/> While eager Pagets linger as they talk;<lb/>
							And holy Clóghers preach of skies above,<lb/> Or wink a lecture on illegal love:<lb/> Old maids are prim'd—the coxcombs
							cough perfume,<lb/> And belles and albums please the fool-cramm'd room,<lb/> While naked Cupids, frisking on a
							screen,<lb/> Make staring widows pant for what has been!</p>
						<p> When chilling mists, within a yellow cloud,<lb/> Creep on the Strand, and dense the street enshroud,<lb/> And floating
							filth, from each Mac Adam's road,<lb/> Lights on the cheek, as swift the drivers goad,—<lb/> Then London, like a
							chrysalis, unrolls,<lb/> And dark December greets her winter souls:<lb/> Fleet rush the chariots,—flash the whisker'd
							host,<lb/> Poole loads the wall, and Hafiz daubs the "Post"—<lb/> Returning gadders soon the tour-race run,<lb/> And
							Margate follies thrive at Kensington.</p>
						<p> While tawdry Fashion struts her idle way,<lb/> Let's pause, and sketch some models of the day:<lb/> First stalks the
							coxcomb, flimsy,—frothy—vain,<lb/> In step a Brummell, and in look a Hayne;<lb/> "From head to toe," perfum'd like Rowland
							shops,<lb/> He's every inch the paragon of fops!<lb/> A porkish whiteness pales his plastic skin,<lb/> And muslin halters
							hold the pimpl'd chin;<lb/> A gleaming spy-glass dangles from his neck,<lb/> And ev'ry honor hangs upon his beck!<lb/> A
							goatish thing—he lives on ogling eyes,<lb/> On scented handkerchiefs, and woman's sighs!<lb/> Its door-acquirements, and
							revolving limb,<lb/> Its luscious prate, and bawdy hints so trim,—<lb/> Secure each beldame's patronizing smile,<lb/> And
							feast the Bacchanals of lewd Argyle!</p>
						<p> The foppish soldier, pining for a ball,<lb/> Comes clinking next, the cynosure of all:<lb/> Though boastless he of W--'s
							war-nose,<lb/> Like him, in uniform, his valour glows;<lb/> For him, will titled Harriets melt and frown,<lb/> And rank
							him darling puppy of the town:<lb/> Big lips, and clanking chains, and polished spurs,<lb/> And sword—that rarely from its
							scabbard stirs,<lb/> The war-like foot fall, and the hairy glue,<lb/> All fit him for another Waterloo!—<lb/> Although
							from blood and smoke his hands are clean,<lb/> And all his actions fought on Brighton Steyne.</p>
						<p> While these bedizen'd fools in daylight pass,<lb/> And even Wisdom peeps in Fashion's glass,<lb/> Pray not, ye Brummells,
							for King Charles' times,<lb/> We have far sleeker knaves, and courtly crimes;<lb/> Our tom-fool Haynes, our Theodores for

							heroes whimp'ring at a strumpet's door!</p>
						<p> As blinded Fortune's artful wheel went round,<lb/> And crafty Bish made prize or blank abound,<lb/> So Fashion's umpires
							plot their doubtful sway,<lb/> Now puppies rule—now grooms command the day;<lb/> Still, let them take due rank and
							place,<lb/> Now modest Berkely lends them all his grace!<lb/> And spitting Harb'rough cracks the heated stone,<lb/> While
							ling'ring Stanhope sighs to share his throne;—<lb/> O! mark the red nosed Jehu, awe the street,<lb/> With file-thinn'd
							teeth, and "benjamin" complete;<lb/> His balanc'd hat, and far equestrian gaze,<lb/> The val'rous spume that round his

							The look from Tatterstall's,—the snorted "hail,"—<lb/> All shew him tallied for the horse's tail:<lb/> Had heaven, in

						<p> Be proud, be greatly proud of Jehu's fame,<lb/> Great Albion, worthy now of Argos' name:<lb/> Each high-born ass—each "bit
							of blood" can breed,<lb/> Or whip with critic lash, the glossy steed;<lb/> Far round the world thy titled greatness
							blooms,<lb/> Thy barons whips, thy peerage raised to grooms!</p>
						<p> There are some brutal dolts of Huntish schools,<lb/> Who deem all women born for sensual tools;<lb/> As if no chasteness
							hallowed female breasts,<lb/> And love and constancy but liv'd in jests!—<lb/> Some colder tastes approve the priggish
							Blues,<lb/> Who shift their sex, and snarl like quack reviews,<lb/> Blight every gentle grace that Nature gave,<lb/> And
							stifle loveliness in learning's grave;—<lb/> But, where's the heart, that has not said farewell<lb/> To each pure
							feeling—that approves the "belle"?<lb/> That living lie, to wanton and decoy,<lb/> The puppy's play-thing, and the
							ball-room toy;<lb/> The one whom flippant thousands dream their own,<lb/> The love of all, and yet a friend in none!<lb/>
							Such now the Frenchy belles of Britain's isle,<lb/> Begot to dress, to dazzle, and beguile,—<lb/> Or slabber royal palms,
							and gaily flaunt,<lb/> At steamy Bath,—that Bedlamitish haunt;<lb/> There, taught by swaddled demireps, she blooms,<lb/>
							The twirling, would-be bawd of Nash's Rooms;<lb/> Each year, the tourist of sea-water'd towns,<lb/> Till virgin simpers
							change to spousal frowns:—<lb/> When we survey these flimsy dolls deck'd out,<lb/> By trick maternal, for the evening
							rout,<lb/> Their inane flutter, and illusive gaze,<lb/> Or hear the gabblings of their selfish praise;<lb/> Vain seems the
							form, without its gem, the soul,—<lb/> That priceless charm which beautifies the whole!</p>
						<p> Now to the Sabbath turn—by Heav'n design'd<lb/> To solace labour, and becalm the mind;<lb/> It dawns on London, but for
							dress and art,<lb/> When pride, for six days kept, relieves the heart.<lb/> What! though the time-hoar'd steeples point
							sublime,<lb/> And, from the belfry rolls the far-swell'd chime,<lb/> Though mingled peals, by ling'ring breezes
							driv'n,<lb/> Still sound like deep mementos knell'd from heav'n;<lb/> How rare the homage, kindled by the day,<lb/> Within
							the fane, or on the wheel-worn way!<lb/> The lifted hands, and felt responsive tone,<lb/> The knee's low bend before the
							viewless throne,—<lb/> That heart-born worship pictur'd in the gaze,<lb/> And deep seclusion of the soul that prays—<lb/>
							Few fanes ere hallow now—though Fashion there,<lb/> Opes her vile lip, and deems the mock'ry, pray'r.</p>
						<p> To flaunt a boddice, or a fine peruke,<lb/> Survey a rival, and a dropsied duke,—<lb/> Review their skins, and realize the
							noon,<lb/> Turn the light head, and lisp a pew lampoon,<lb/> Or mete the mincing parson's plastic neck,<lb/> And close
							each "hear us!" with a nod or beck,—<lb/> For this, the ton, in George's genteel fane<lb/> From parks, and Thames' stream,
							an hour refrain!<lb/> Some too, are holy round their Sunday fire,<lb/> Where, baffled doctrines like its smoke
							expire;<lb/> Discuss polemics o'er their tea and toast,<lb/> Doubt fast—and smile away the Holy Ghost.</p>
						<p> While thus Religion, and each rev'rend truth,<lb/> Are scoff'd by dotards, and contemn'd by youth,<lb/> Presiding Vice,
							with all her hell-born train,<lb/> Pervades the city, and pollutes the plain:<lb/> What styes of lewdness,—cells for
							covert crime,<lb/> What holes to suit all age, all rank, and time,<lb/> Are London's modern haunts—where bevies
							swarm,<lb/> And vice is bliss, and infamy, a charm!—<lb/> Her pits, where meet the beggar'd and the great,<lb/> St. Giles'
							scroff, with helmsmen of the state,—<lb/> Her dark retreats for link-boys, cheats, and sots,<lb/> Who celebrate their
							orgies round their pots,—<lb/> Her masquerades, where dress'd debauchers wile,<lb/> And bevied harlots straddle through
							Argyle.</p>
						<p> Argyle!—fir'd at the sound, my muse shall light<lb/> In honest vengeance on humbugging W—<lb/> That vinous Colburn, whose
							accursed rhymes,<lb/> Delude the country, and disgrace the times:<lb/> Poetic rogue!—will not the day-light gain<lb/>
							Enough poor victims for thy false champagne?<lb/> That drug-compounded mess of gooseberry juice,<lb/> Corked into froth,
							and coloured for our use;—<lb/> Must the pale drunkards of the midnight hour,<lb/> Buy off the stale, the rotten, and the
							sour,<lb/> Each lot too rancid for the day's broad sale,<lb/> With all the mess of porter and of ale?<lb/> O what a heaven
							is thine own Masquerade!<lb/> Now for the velvet cap, and rich brocade,<lb/> The clown to tumble, with his plaster'd
							face,<lb/> Eunuchs with belts,—and harlots in their lace!<lb/> The knave as polished as his heart is black,—<lb/> The
							whole foul orgies of an Argyle pack!<lb/> What then?—the minstrel slyly creeps his round,<lb/> The pastry lessens, and the
							corks abound!—<lb/> Though each trick'd virgin should return a w—e,<lb/> No matter,—— has sunk his cellar'd store!<lb/>
							Oh, Fie! Mayor Brown—to suffer such a troop,<lb/> Forsake awhile the turtle and the soup;<lb/> Go, send your red-fringed
							bullies to Argyle,—<lb/> No "hell" so monstrous, and no den so vile!<lb/> Break up this glittering bedlam of the
							night,<lb/> Protect the sawney, and empale C—!<lb/> To London, too, what rustic maids decoy'd<lb/> From those sweet homes,
							their infant years enjoy'd,<lb/> By courteous villains are beset and wil'd,<lb/> Till, left undone,—defenceless,—and
							defil'd!<lb/> If One there be, that sees sublime o'er all,<lb/> "A hero perish, or a sparrow fall"—<lb/> His
							judgment-curse repay the trait'rous arts,<lb/> That wither up the innocence of hearts,—<lb/> In secret stews, that
							slaughter trusting love,<lb/> And blast the spirits that should reign above!</p>
						<p> To blazon London vice, need Satire's muse<lb/> Descend to cock-pits, "Finish," and the stews,—<lb/> Root out the Drury
							styes and oyster-shops,<lb/> Their hoggish keepers, and maintaining fops?<lb/> To fill the house, e'en Managers
							purvey<lb/> Saloon and bawd, that cater for the play!<lb/> Here, 'tween each act the Cyprian dames retreat,<lb/> And
							swagg'ring coxcombs fellow souls may meet;<lb/> Here, lordlings flourish forth colloquial ire,<lb/> Till the long mirrors
							steam with lust-breath'd fire;<lb/> While oft around the glaring punks entice,<lb/> And flutt'ring freshmen hand the
							creamy ice:<lb/> Warm thanks to managers, let fathers raise,<lb/> Ye tender mothers, join their glowing praise,<lb/> For
							where can wanton youth such wisdom learn,<lb/> And kindled lewdness through the bosom burn—<lb/> As in saloons,—where
							mix'd enchantments fill<lb/> At once young folly's cup, and play-house till?</p>
						<p> Proud spreads the feast, and richly flows the wine,<lb/> In yon tall club-house, where the knaves combine;<lb/> Congenial
							villains—firmly all unite<lb/> To dazzle, glut, and gamble out the night:<lb/> 'Tis sweet, through Fashion's round to
							darken all,<lb/> Out-deck the peer, and startle at the ball;<lb/> 'Tis sweet, to strut the nabobs of the day,<lb/> Tho'
							cheats conspired, and gambling grip'd their pay!<lb/> True to their trade, these clubbing swindlers swear<lb/> To pluck
							the fortunes of each silly heir;<lb/> Then crawl away, like spiders fat with blood,—<lb/> Fools for their game, and ruin
							for their food!</p>
						<p> How oft is beggar'd affluence forced to roam<lb/> Far from its peace, and once respected home,<lb/> While all its honours
							droop forgot away,<lb/> And palaces become a blackleg's prey?<lb/> No tie the gambler from his conclave tears,<lb/>
							Himself, nor dearer self, his passion spares;<lb/> When wretched Av'rice weaves her deadly plot,<lb/> See kindred, heaven,
							and hell itself forgot!</p>
						<p> Great God! how hearts must welter in their vice,<lb/> When blighted happiness supports the dice,<lb/> And gamblers with
							convivial smiles can meet,<lb/> Sit face to face, and triumph in the cheat!<lb/> Within St. James' Hells, what bilks
							resort,—<lb/> Both young and hoary, to pursue their sport!<lb/> 'Tis Mis'ry revels here!—the haggard mien<lb/> And lips
							that quiver with the curse obscene,<lb/> The hollow cheeks that faintly fall and rise,<lb/> While silent madness flashes
							from the eyes,<lb/> Those fever'd hands, the darkly-knitting brow,<lb/> Where mingling passions delve their traces
							now—<lb/> Denote the ruined,—whose bewilder'd air,<lb/> Is one wild vengeful throbbing of despair!<lb/> Deserted homes,
							and mothers' broken hearts,<lb/> Forsaken offspring,—crime's unfathomed arts,<lb/> The suicide,—and ev'ry sad
							farewell,—<lb/> These are the triumphs of a London Hell!</p>
						<p> Can titles dignify a cunning cheat?—<lb/> Not though C--- swear the debt complete,<lb/> When he, O'N--- , and P---

							battle-field,—where base or brutish peers,<lb/> And touchy boobies, fire away their dread,<lb/> And thick-skulls blunt,
							the disappointed lead:<lb/> Lo! there the heroes stand,—the pistols roar!—<lb/> Heaven sweep from Britain's isle one
							villain more!<lb/> Here L--- and G--- their prowess try,<lb/> Till gentle smoke-clouds fumigate their eye;<lb/> And tender
							Dick, whose philanthropic pride<lb/> Can drop a tear on ev'ry donkey's side,—<lb/> His duellistic fools can here
							surpass,<lb/> And shoot the blackleg, though he guard the ass:</p>
						<p> The last fine haunt for Fashion's bloated dames,<lb/> To pamper pride, and furbish up their names,—<lb/> Is proud
							"Almacks," where rival quarterings rear,<lb/> And harridans select their fav'rite peer;<lb/> Fair S---'s luring smile, and
							S---d's frown,<lb/> Soft H---'s smirk, and B---y's book renown,—<lb/> All serve the myst'ries of this dread conclave<lb/>
							While Willis toils, their sneakup and their slave:<lb/> O peerless senate!—ye who here decree,<lb/> And trace beyond the
							flood, a pedigree,<lb/> Illumined rulers of a wax-lit stye,<lb/> Where passion twirls the leg, and rolls the eye,—<lb/>
							Let your mean pride ascend to decent aim,<lb/> Outlaw the bosom's lust-creating shame,<lb/> Loose the tight breech, [. .

							Untempted Virtue might o'ersway the ball,<lb/> And lech'ry burn within a safer thrall!</p>
						<p> The ball commences—rich the music flows,<lb/> Melts on the heart, and vivifies the toes;<lb/> Wide o'er the room, behold
							the chalky round,<lb/> Where light the foot-beat floor begins to bound;<lb/> Awak'ning pleasure each red face
							illumes,<lb/> And flirting misses toss their crested plumes;—<lb/> Warm streams the blood within each thrilling vein,<lb/>
							Tints the bright cheek, and rushes on the brain.</p>
						<p> Now anxious ideots in their pomps appear,<lb/> From city banker up to lean jaw'd peer;<lb/> Here a huge beldame swells
							within her stays,<lb/> Smirks at each beau—and flaps him for his praise;<lb/> Here Bond Street puppies, rank with eau
							Cologne,<lb/> Limp round the room, and whimper to the ton;<lb/> While peevish beldames by their daughters watch,<lb/>
							Glance in their eyes, and pray—"God send a match!"</p>
						<p> Connubial Waltz! 'tis thine our sight to charm,<lb/> Wake the sweet thrill, and kindle all the form—<lb/> 'Tis thine to
							shed soft dreams as on we trip,<lb/> Unbind the bosom,—<lb/> In longing eyes to pour a lech'rous flame,<lb/> And hide
							indecent motions in thy name!</p>
						<p> The doleful thunder of the deep-mouth'd bell,<lb/> Hath roll'd to heav'n the dying day's farewell;<lb/> And, like a
							death-groan from a tomb in air,<lb/> The echo bounds with dismal mutter there;—<lb/> 'Tis midnight hour:—through England's
							city Queen<lb/> Her countless lamps throw out their glitt'ring sheen;<lb/> And oft, some pensive pilgrims trace
							awhile,<lb/> The far faint lustre of their twinkling file,—<lb/> Then turning, look, where more serenely bright,<lb/>
							Smile the sweet spirit stars of list'ning Night.</p>
						<p> The city slumbers, like a dreary heart,<lb/> Whose chaining sorrows tremblingly depart;<lb/> And now, what victims are
							within her walls,<lb/> Whom changeful Fortune martyrs, guides and thralls!<lb/> The pale-cheek'd mourner in the dungeon's
							tomb,<lb/> The glad ones tripping o'er the wax-lit room,—<lb/> The proud and mean—the wealthy and the poor,<lb/> The free
							to spend—the miser at his ore,<lb/> All now, from ev'ry shade of woe and joy,<lb/> In changeful moods their midnight hour
							employ:<lb/> How many pillows bear some fev'rish head,<lb/> Damp with the weepings on their downy spread;<lb/> How many
							eyes, in sealing slumber hid,<lb/> With tear-drops quivering on their wan-cold lid!</p>
						<p> A day of thought, and mingled labour past,<lb/> Unwatch'd,—unknown,—with dreamy front o'ercast,<lb/> Won by the starry
							time, I've lov'd to walk<lb/> The silent city, and with feeling talk;<lb/> While on the languor of a fever'd frame,<lb/>
							The vesper calm of cooling midnight came:<lb/> The glistening choir around their Dian Queen,<lb/> The heaven of azure,
							mellow'd and serene;<lb/> With all the blended musings of the heart,—<lb/> Then told me, Night, how eloquent thou
							art!<lb/> Here, while I paced along the shrub-crown'd square,<lb/> Between whose laurels flit the lamp's faint glare,<lb/>
							And watchlights from illumined windows played,<lb/> Athwart the quiet street their flick'ring braid,—<lb/> Re-calling
							Mem'ry bade her spells disclose,<lb/> And rev'rend visions on my fancy rose:<lb/> Each matchless vet'ran of true English
							days,<lb/> With all the story of their tears and praise,—<lb/> The peerless spirits of our glorious clime,<lb/> Seemed
							hov'ring near to consecrate the time!</p>
						<p> Now from the Op'ra's widened portals stream<lb/> A shiv'ring concourse,—wide the torches gleam,—<lb/> And fling cadav'rous
							hues upon each face,<lb/> Where palled Delight has left her pale-worn trace;<lb/> Perturbed mark, the blinking chap'rons
							guard,<lb/> Wrapt in her gather'd silks—their dainty ward;<lb/> While flutt'ring near, gallants obtrusive try<lb/> To read
							the twinkling promise of her eye:<lb/> Within the crush-room fretful throngs parade,<lb/> And lisping puppies quizz each
							well-laced maid;<lb/> Some round the fire-place chafe their chilly hands,<lb/> Smooth their wild locks, and fold their
							silken bands:<lb/> Here, too, the rival flirt with whispers loud,<lb/> Hung on a suitor's arm, attracts the crowd;<lb/>
							While borne with crutches to the creaking door,<lb/> The snarling cuckolds for their cars implore:<lb/> Without,—a
							Pandemonium seems to sound,<lb/> Where busy foot-falls beat along the ground;<lb/> The bouncing coachman's sky-ascending
							bawl,<lb/> And loud-mouthed lacquies elbowing through all,—<lb/> The cracking stones beneath each fire-eyed steed,<lb/>
							All eager pawing till the course is freed,<lb/> Commingled—greet the concourse hastening home,<lb/> To dream of
							neat-legg'd eunuchs fresh from Rome!</p>
						<p> With tott'ring step and motion of a beast,<lb/> Next come the rev'llers, sotted from their feast;<lb/> Quick of affront,
							they growl some cockney strain,<lb/> Or stutter oaths to ease the swimming brain;<lb/> While bustling by, shop-puppies
							whiff cigars,<lb/> Clink their nail'd heels, and swagger at the stars!—<lb/> But who art thou, whose passion-wither'd
							face<lb/> Sheds mournful beauty through the netted lace?<lb/> Those radiant orbs, that so obtrusive shine<lb/> Like stars,
							beneath thine eyebrow's arching line,<lb/> That lip's vermillion,—brow of lucid snow,<lb/> Can these betray thee, child of
							sin and woe?<lb/> Alas, that ever woman's gentle soul<lb/> Should sink to glutted passion's base controul!<lb/> But still,
							around thine air there lurks a grief<lb/> That longs, yet will not ask a pure relief;<lb/> Perchance, ere villains taught
							thee thence to roam,<lb/> A mother clasped thee in her cottage home,<lb/> Some grey-locked sire sat round his evening
							hearth,<lb/> Hung on thy neck, and blessed thy happy birth!</p>
						<p> But list! huge wheels roll o'er the jarring stones,<lb/> I hear the clatt'ring hoofs, and rabble's tones!<lb/> Before yon
							dome the creaking engines wait,<lb/> Where shield-mark'd firemen empt their liquid freight,<lb/> While, grandly awful to
							the startled sight,<lb/> Rear the red columns of resistless light!<lb/> The windows deepen into dreadful glow,<lb/> Till
							the hot glass bursts shatt'ring down below;<lb/> While darting fires around their wood-work blaze,<lb/> And lick the
							water, hissing as it plays;<lb/> Above the crackling roof fierce flames arise,<lb/> And whirl their sparks, careering to
							the skies;<lb/> Triumphantly the ravenous blazes mount,<lb/> As if they started from a fiery fount,<lb/> Now, cloud-like,
							piling up in billowy fire,<lb/> Now quiv'ring sunk, to re-collect their ire:—<lb/> But see! again whirl up the blood-red
							flames,<lb/> In vain the rushing flood their fury tames;<lb/> Like burning mountain-peaks, aloft they raise,<lb/> Their
							jagged columns of unequal blaze,<lb/> Till the loose beams, and flaking rafters fall,<lb/> And like a thund'ring
							earthquake, bury all!</p>
						<p> And now, farewell!—and if a forceful line<lb/> Hath injured virtue,—let the blame be mine:<lb/> But if one vice hath borne
							its proper name,<lb/> Conceit its brand, and fopp'ry its shame;—<lb/> If reckless follies, and unblushing crimes,<lb/> And
							all the polished vileness of the times,<lb/> Are stamped with iron hate, severely true,—<lb/> Unmasked, unspared, and
							lash'd beneath the view—<lb/> Then, not desertless will the patriot deem<lb/> The censor's page, and widely-travelled
							theme.</p>
						<p> And thou, lorn Wisdom's child, where'er thou art—<lb/> That mark'st each May-morn dream of hope depart,<lb/> The knave and
							parasite on Fortune's throne,<lb/> Whilst thou hast only thought to call thine own;<lb/> Still nobly live the solitary
							sage,<lb/> And soar in mind above this venal age;<lb/> Rich in thyself, partake the best content,—<lb/> A heart well
							governed, and a life well spent! </p>

							stand,<lb/>    That, if folks were to furnish me now with a suit,<lb/> It would take ev'ry morsel of scrip in the

							stature,<lb/>    To cover me nothing but rags will supply;<lb/> And the doctors declare that, in due course of

							object of int'rest, most painful, to all;<lb/> In the warehouse, the cottage, the palace I'm found,<lb/>    Holding

						<p>At Cheltenham, where one drinks one's fill<lb/>    Of folly and cold water,<lb/> I danced last year my first quadrille<lb/>
							   With old Sir Geoffrey's daughter.<lb/> Her cheek with summer's rose might vie,<lb/>    When summer's rose is
							newest;<lb/> Her eyes were blue as autumn's sky,<lb/>    When autumn's sky is bluest;<lb/> And well my heart might deem
							her one<lb/>    Of life's most precious flowers,<lb/> For half her thoughts were of its sun,<lb/>    And half were of its
							showers.</p>
						<p>I spoke of Novels:—"Vivian Grey"<lb/>    Was positively charming,<lb/> And "Almacks" infinitely gay,<lb/>    And
							"Frankenstein" alarming;<lb/> I said "De Vere" was chastely told,<lb/>    Thought well of "Herbert Lacy,"<lb/> Called Mr.
							Banim's sketches "bold,"<lb/>    And Lady Morgan's "racy;"<lb/> I vowed that last new thing of Hook's<lb/>    Was vastly
							entertaining:<lb/> And Laura said—"I doat on books,<lb/>    Because it's always raining!"</p>
						<p> I talked of Music's gorgeous fane;<lb/>    I raved about Rossini,<lb/> Hoped Ronzi would come back again,<lb/>    And

							"Alas!" my beauteous listener sighed,<lb/>    "We must have rain to-morrow!"</p>
						<p> I told her tales of other lands;<lb/>    Of ever-boiling fountains,<lb/> Of poisonous lakes and barren sands,<lb/>    Vast

							treason:<lb/> And Laura asked me—where the glass<lb/>    Stood, at Madrid, last season.</p>
						<p> I broached whate'er had gone its rounds,<lb/>    The week before, of scandal;<lb/> What made Sir Luke lay down his
