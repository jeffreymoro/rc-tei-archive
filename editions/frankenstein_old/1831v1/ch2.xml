<p rend="emph">Chapter 2 </p>

<list type="simple">
<item>
<p> We were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in our ages. I need not say that we were
									strangers to any species of disunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our
									characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
									application, and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the
									aerial creations of the poets; and in the majestic
									and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss home—the sublime shapes of the mountains; the changes of
									the season; tempest and calm; the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our Alpine
									summers,—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my companion contemplated with a
									serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was to me a
									secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to
									rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>On the birth of a second son, my
									junior by seven years, my parents gave up entirely their wandering life, and fixed themselves in their native
									country. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne  on Belrive, the eastern shore of the lake, at the
									distance of rather more than a league from the city.
									We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my
									temper to avoid a crowd, and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was indifferent, therefore, to my
									schoolfellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship  to one among them. Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He
									was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved
										enterprise, hardship, and even danger , for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs, and
									began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays, and to enter into
									masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the
										heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood
									to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My parents were possessed by the very spirit of
									kindness and indulgence. We felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice, but
									the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families, I
									distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial
								love.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>My temper was sometimes violent , and my passions
									vehement; but by some law in my temperature they were turned, not towards childish pursuits, but to an eager
									desire to learn, and not to learn all things indiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of
										governments, nor the politics of various states , possessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of
									heaven and earth that I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things, or the inner spirit
									of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my enquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
									or, in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Meanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the
										moral relations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes, and the actions of men, were his
									theme; and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story, as the gallant
									and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in
									our peaceful home. Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were
									ever there to bless and animate us. She was the living
										spirit of love to soften and attract: I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of
									my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And Clerval—could
									aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?—yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so
									thoughtful in his generosity—so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous
									exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence, and made the doing good the end and aim
									of his soaring ambition. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and
									changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness
									into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.
									Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which led, by insensible steps to my
									after tale of misery: for when I would account to myself for the birth of that passion, which afterwards ruled my
										destiny, I find it arise, like a mountain river,
									from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its
									course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my
									fate; I desire therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age, we all
									went on a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon: the inclemency of the
									weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I chanced to find a volume of the works of
										Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it
									with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed
									this feeling into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with joy, I communicated my
									discovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at
									the title-page of my book, and said, "Ah! Cornelius Agrippa. My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it
									is sad trash."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me, that the principles of Agrippa had
									been entirely exploded, and that a modern system of
										science had been introduced, which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of
									the latter were chimerical, while those of the
									former were real and practical; under such circumstances, I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside, and have
									contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies. It is even
									possible, that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse  that led to my ruin. But the cursory
									glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents; and I
									continued to read with the greatest avidity. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>When I returned home, my first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and afterwards of Paracelsus  and Albertus Magnus. I read and
									studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself;
									and I have described myself as always having been embued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of the intense labour and
									wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir
									Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a
										child picking up shells  beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each
									branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted, appeared even to my boy's apprehensions, as tyros engaged
									in the same pursuit. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was acquainted with their
									practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but
									her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. He might dissect, anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes in their
									secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments
									that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more. I took their word for all that
									they averred, and I became their disciple. It may
									appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in
									the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was
									not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for knowledge.
									Under the guidance of my new preceptors, I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life. But the
										latter soon obtained my undivided attention:
									wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would
									attend the discovery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a
									violent death! </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Nor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or
										devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfillment of which I most eagerly
									sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience
									and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was occupied by exploded
									systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand contradictory theories, and floundering desperately in a very
									slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again
									changed the current of my ideas.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> When I was about fifteen years old, we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunder-storm. It advanced from behind the
									mountains of Jura; and the thunder
									burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained, while the storm lasted,
									watching its progress with curiosity and delight. As I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire
									issue from an old and beautiful oak, which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the dazzling
									light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning,
									we found the tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin
									ribands of wood. I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity. On this occasion a man of great
									research in natural philosophy was with us, and, excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a
									theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to
									me. All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of
									my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies. It
									seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known. All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
									despicable. By one of those caprices of the mind, which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth, I at once
									gave up my former occupations; set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation;
									and entertained the greatest disdain for a would-be science, which could never even step within the threshold of
									real knowledge. In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics, and the branches of study appertaining to that science, as being built upon secure
									foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p> Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin. When I
									look back, it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion
									of the guardian angel of my life—the last
									effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars, and ready to
									envelope me. Her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul, which followed the
									relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies. It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil
									with their prosecution, happiness with their disregard. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was a strong effort of the spirit of good; but it was ineffectual. Destiny was too potent, and immutable laws
									had decreed my utter and terrible destruction. </p>
