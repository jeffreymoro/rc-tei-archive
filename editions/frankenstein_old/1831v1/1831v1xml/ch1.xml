<p rend="emph">Chapter 1 </p>
<p> </p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p>I AM by birth a Genevese; and my family is one of the
									most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and
										syndics; and my father had filled several public
									situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him, for his integrity and indefatigable
									attention to public business. He passed his younger
									days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; and a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying
									early, nor was it until the decline of life that he
									became a husband and the father of a family.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>As the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of his most
									intimate friends was a merchant, who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty.
									This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud
									and unbending disposition, and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for
									his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
									daughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest
									friendship, and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the
									false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time
									in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
									assistance.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself; and it was ten months before my father discovered his
									abode. Overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street, near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone
									welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes; but it was
									sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some
									respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep
									and rankling, when he had leisure for reflection; and at length it took so fast hold of his mind, that at the end
									of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>His daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness;
									but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing, and that there was no other prospect of
									support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould; and her courage rose to support her in her
									adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw; and by various means contrived to
									earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Several months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him;
									her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her; and
									she knelt by Beaufort's coffin, weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a protecting
									spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care, and after the interment of his friend he conducted her
									to Geneva, and placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this event Caroline became his
									wife.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only
									closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense
										of justice in my father's upright mind, which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
									strongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved, and so
									was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to
									my mother, differing wholly from the doating fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues,
									and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave
									inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Every thing was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He
									strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered
									by the gardener, from every rougher wind, and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable
									emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit,
									had been shaken by what she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my
									father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the
									change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened
									frame.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>From Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied
									them in their rambles. I remained for several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each other,
									they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother's
									tender caresses, and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me, are my first recollections. I
									was their plaything and their idol, and something
										better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring
									up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they
									fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they
									had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
									every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that all seemed but
									one train of enjoyment to me.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desire to have a daughter, but I continued their single
									offspring. When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a
									week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made them enter
									the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
									passion,—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been relieved,— for her to act in
									her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
									attracted their notice, as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of half-clothed children gathered about
									it, spoke of penury in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,
									accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and
									labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far
									above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this
									child was thin, and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living gold, and, despite the poverty of her clothing,
									seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her
									lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of
										sensibility and sweetness, that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a
									being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this
									lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her
									mother was a German, and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people to nurse:
									they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of
									their charge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy,—one among the
										schiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he
									had died, or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria, was not known. His property was confiscated, his child
									became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her foster parents, and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than
									a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa, a
									child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks, and whose form
									and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my
									mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her
									presence had seemed a blessing to them; but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want, when
									Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was, that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents'
									house—my more than sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my
									pleasures.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Every one loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became,
									while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had
									said playfully,—'I have a pretty present for my Victor—to-morrow he shall have it.' And when,
									on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her
									words literally, and looked upon Elizabeth as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on her, I received as made to a
									possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body
									forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than sister, since till death she was to be
									mine only.</p>
