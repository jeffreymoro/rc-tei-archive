                    down to write to you. I am tolarably happy and more than tolarably busy. I have
                    had a complimentary letter sent me from a Mr Swinburne of Leicester he was much
                    pleased with my description of our cheese, his letter did not come alone there
                    came with it a Leicester Cheese of 11lb. — Last night I had a letter enclosing a
                    £2 note from a <ref target="people.html#GilchristOctavius">Mr Gilchrist</ref> of
                    Stamford. If Mr Burrell of Cambridge would send me some more Tobacco I might
                    live cheap these hard times, and smoke a health to all my friends. TWO things I
                    wish you would not forget when you send, 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> the Letters for
                        <ref target="people.html#HingstonElizabeth">Bet</ref>. I think we should
                    send them, 6 months have pass’d, or nearly, since we had hers.</p><p rend="indent1"> I doubt I must build a song for Mr Guest, not to oblidge him, but
                    to oblidge <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref>. What did you do
                    with the 50 songs? I suppose no further call for them will be found at <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref>. I have been too much engaged
                    to attend to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac’s</ref>
                    affairs as I could wish. I will write to him soon. The Boot patterns I had from
                        <ref target="people.html#HortonMr">Horton</ref>. The shoe patterns from a
                    Don shoeman: perhaps you may never use them, but they are curious as being cut
                    in the high taste. I have a cold coming, and my head akes, or I would send
                    patterns of my Womans Work. I have a man and a half employd now, and have plenty
                    of good custom lookd out. I like it Better than I did. So much for my mastering.
                    My book affairs go on tolarably. I am getting acquainted with another baronet,

                    writings and bargains compleated, and the poems put to press. My double capacity

                    my head, which is somtimes as much as I can say. I send you patterns [illegible
