                    continue well, and in as good spirits as you can. I send you another two pounds,
                    for I am sure you will want it. I want to know all your news by conversation,
                    but know not at which end to begin to advise you. If I come to town it must be
                    expensive, and so it will for you to come here though I should so well like to
                    see you. I am sorry to hear that you feel forlorn; I know that you are now hard
                    task’d and wish you could have a week’s respite and recreation here. Would Mr
                    Johnson admit you back again if you did so? I am pretty certain I shall have to
                    come to London whenever you go to <ref target="places.html#Putney">Putney</ref>,
                    but how or where I shall find money to support you and us I know not. I think
                    you act perfectly right in going to <ref target="places.html#Putney">Putney</ref> to look after them, it will show that you are alive and
                    willing. Perhaps Mr Johnson wishes you gone? If so it ill agrees with Mr
                    Sanderlands advice to continue, as you have already been there longer than many
                    others. I write with the utmost difficulty for want of better eyes, and should
                    prefer one hour’s conversation to all that we could write in a month. For God’s
                    sake take care of the Cowcross fever, it pays no respect to young schoolmasters
                    be they ever so good or worthy. I cannot proceed further without a headache, do
                    according to your own judgment with the enclosed notes; if you come for a week
                    to see us you know how gladly you will be received, and that this is still a
                    home. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldHannah">Hannah</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn">Mother</ref> are well, but <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldRobertHenry">Rob</ref> has a very bad cold.
                    Tomorrow is our noisy Fair. Love and health to you from your father</p><closer><signed rend="right">Rob Bloomfield</signed></closer><postscript><p>If you can catch hold of Mr Johnson just to speak for five minutes you had
                        perhaps better ask him if he <hi rend="ital">wishes</hi> you to leave him,
                        or whither you have it at your <hi rend="ital">own option</hi> to <hi rend="ital">stay</hi> or <hi rend="ital">leave</hi> his school till that

                        do as you think best and let us hear again from you before long. Miss Weston
                        left us a fortnight ago. We have not heard of her since—give my love to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref> and tell
                        her this is not the letter which I promised to write to her, but I will not

                        your father saw in London. Your father and I drank tea at Mr Fitzjohn’s
                        yesterday, Jane desires her love to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref>. I took tea
                        at Mrs Peppercorn’s one day last week and am going to spend a few days there
                        next week. I cannot say anything about my <hi rend="ital">success</hi> or
                        otherwise, in business, for I am scarcely determined whither to attempt it
                        or not so this is holliday with me. I don’t know of any news to tell you,
                        unless the following is news to you Mr Gaye has set up a gig, so times go
                        well with him. Mr Ibbs has lost one of his daughters to the mumps, Briggs

                        bottom, and sash instead of casement, up stairs.—Your father has got the
