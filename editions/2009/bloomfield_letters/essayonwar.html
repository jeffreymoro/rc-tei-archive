               <div class="l">MAN'S sad necessity, destructive War,</div>
               <div class="l">Sweeps to the grave the surplus of his sons,</div>
               <div class="l">Where’er the kindly clime and soil invite</div>
               <div class="l">To Love; and multiply the Human Race.</div>
               <div class="l">Around the World, in every happier spot</div>
               <div class="l">Where Earth spontaneous gives nutritious fruits,</div>
               <div class="l">Her softest verdure courting human feet,</div>
               <div class="l">And mossy grots, beneath protecting shades,</div>
               <div class="l">The Stranger’s envy, the Possessor’s pride;</div>
               <div class="l">There, as increasing numbers throng each bower,</div>
               <div class="l">Frequent and fatal rivalships arise;</div>
               <div class="l">And ruthless War erects his hideous crest.</div>
               <div class="l">Soon as Appropriation’s iron hand</div>
               <div class="l">Assays to grasp the Produce of the Earth;</div>
               <div class="l">And youths assert hereditary power,</div>
               <div class="l">Propriety exclusive, and in arms</div>
               <div class="l">League to defend their patrimonial rights,</div>
               <div class="l">Indisputable claim of Fruits and Fields</div>
               <div class="l">Contending, oft their massive clubs they raise</div>
               <div class="l">Against each other’s life: often, alas,</div>
               <div class="l">The needy cravings of the unportion’d poor</div>
               <div class="l">Provoke their jealous wrath; relentlessly</div>
               <div class="l">Tenacious of their store, they shut him out,</div>
               <div class="l">’Midst desart Famine, and ferocious Beasts,</div>
               <div class="l">To guard his life and till the steril soil;</div>
               <div class="l">And thus extend the range of human feet.</div>
               <div class="l">Still as Experience, in her tardy school,</div>
               <div class="l">Instructs the Shepherd and the Husbandman</div>
               <div class="l">To great increase their flocks and herds to rear,</div>
               <div class="l">To till the ground, and plant the fruitful tree</div>
               <div class="l">In slow progression rising into use,</div>
               <div class="l">Nurtur’d by Her the infant Arts appear.</div>
               <div class="l">While sage Experience thus teaches Man</div>
               <div class="l">The useful and the pleasant Arts of Life,</div>
               <div class="l">She in harsh lectures, in the frequent broil,</div>
               <div class="l">Enjoins her Pupil still to cultivate</div>
               <div class="l">The fatal, necessary Art of War.</div>
               <div class="l">The Artizan, who from metallic ores</div>
               <div class="l">Forms the sharp implements to dress the glebe,</div>
               <div class="l">And prune the wild luxuriance of the tree;…</div>
               <div class="l">By him is made the sword, the spear, the shaft,</div>
               <div class="l">By Man worn to defend him against Man.</div>
               <div class="l">Most bless’d the country where kind Nature’s face</div>
               <div class="l">In unsophisticated Freedom smiles:</div>
               <div class="l">Happy the tenants of primeval days</div>
               <div class="l">When young society is in its spring:</div>
               <div class="l">Where there is room and food for millions more,</div>
               <div class="l">Love knows no check, the votaries of Love,</div>
               <div class="l">The happy votaries of Wedded Love,</div>
               <div class="l">Know not the curse of peopled, polish’d, times:</div>
               <div class="l">The curse to wish their children may be few.</div>
               <div class="l">Sweet converse binds the cords of social love;</div>
               <div class="l">When the rude noise and gestures that ere while</div>
               <div class="l">Imperfectly express’d the labouring thought;</div>
               <div class="l">By social concourse are improv’d to Speech:</div>
               <div class="l">Speech, reasoning Man’s distinguishing perfection;</div>
               <div class="l">Speech, the inestimable vehicle</div>
               <div class="l">Of mental light, and intellectual bliss;</div>
               <div class="l">Whence the fair fruits of Holy Friendship grow,</div>
               <div class="l">Presenting to fond Hope’s enamour’d sight</div>
               <div class="l">The fairy prospect of perpetual Peace.</div>
               <div class="l">Advanc’d Society’s prudential Laws,</div>
               <div class="l">The moral virtues of the enlighten’d mind,</div>
               <div class="l">And all the ties of Interest and of Love,</div>
               <div class="l">In vain conspire to nurse their favourite Peace, </div>
               <div class="l">And banish dire Immanity and War.</div>
               <div class="l">Strong Nature’s bent, continual increase,</div>
               <div class="l">Still counteracts Humanity’s fond wish,</div>
               <div class="l">The perpetuity of Peace, and Love;</div>
               <div class="l">Alas! progressive Increase cannot last.</div>
               <div class="l">Soon mourns the encumber’d land its human load:</div>
               <div class="l">Too soon arrives the inauspicious hour;</div>
               <div class="l">The Natal Hour of the unhappy Man,</div>
               <div class="l">Who all his life goes mourning up and down</div>
               <div class="l">That there is neither bough, nor mud, nor straw </div>
               <div class="l">That he may take to make himself a hut;</div>
               <div class="l">No, not in all his native land a twig</div>
               <div class="l">That he may take, nor spot of green grass turf,</div>
               <div class="l">Where without trespass he may set his foot.</div>
               <div class="l">Now Want and Poverty wage War with Love;</div>
               <div class="l">And hard the conflict: horrible the thought,</div>
               <div class="l">That Love, who boasts of his all-conquering impulse,</div>
               <div class="l">Should have to mourn abortive energies... </div>
               <div class="l">But in proportion as Mankind increase,</div>
               <div class="l">So evils multiply: till Nature’s self, </div>
               <div class="l">(The native passions of the human mind)</div>
               <div class="l">Engender War; which thins, and segregates,</div>
               <div class="l">And rectifies the balance of the world:</div>
               <div class="l">As thick-sown plants in the vegetable world,</div>
               <div class="l">With stretching branches wage continual War; </div>
               <div class="l">Each tender bud shrinks from the foreign touch</div>
               <div class="l">With a degree of sensitive perception;</div>
               <div class="l">Till one deforms, o’er-tops, and kills the other.</div>
               <div class="l">Like Summer swarms, that quit their native hives,</div>
               <div class="l">The offspring of increasing families,</div>
               <div class="l">Who find no room beneath their father’s roofs,</div>
               <div class="l">No patrimony nor employ at home,</div>
               <div class="l">Colleagu’d in bands explore the desart wilds,</div>
               <div class="l">To seek adventures; or to seek their food:</div>
               <div class="l">If chance they meet with rovers (like themselves)</div>
               <div class="l">Whose home is far away in distant vales,</div>
               <div class="l">Behind the mountains, or beyond the lake;</div>
               <div class="l">Instinctively they war where’er they meet:</div>
               <div class="l">The friendly parley cannot intervene;</div>
               <div class="l">The unknown tongue does but create alarm:</div>
               <div class="l">With jealous fears, stern looks, and brandish’d arms,</div>
               <div class="l">They stand aloof: as birds of distant groves</div>
               <div class="l">At the strange note prepare for instant War.</div>
               <div class="l">At first they skirmishing dispute the right</div>
               <div class="l">Of hunting in the unappropriate waste:</div>
               <div class="l">But every onset aggravates their hate;</div>
               <div class="l">Till each increasing force, whetting their swords,</div>
               <div class="l">With purpos’d malice seeking out the foe,</div>
               <div class="l">Alternate by reprisal and revenge,</div>
               <div class="l">Doubly compensate each discomfiture.</div>
               <div class="l">Yet seek not to attack each-other’s home,</div>
               <div class="l">Where Age, and Infancy, in safety dwell:</div>
               <div class="l">They war but with freebooters: private Peace</div>
               <div class="l">And Female Covert, Valour scorns to assail.</div>
               <div class="l">But when in evil hour some female hand, </div>
               <div class="l">Whether by force of Love, or force of Arms,</div>
               <div class="l">Is led across the desart by the Foe;</div>
               <div class="l">The jealous fury kindles to a flame:</div>
               <div class="l">No longer sacred the domestic hearth:</div>
               <div class="l">Fire, Death, and Devastation, mark their way,</div>
               <div class="l">And all the horrid crimes of savage War.</div>
               <div class="l">Now War becomes the business of the State:</div>
               <div class="l">The most humane, the most pacific men,</div>
               <div class="l">Must arm for War, or lose all they hold dear:</div>
               <div class="l">The sorrows of the Aged, Infant cries,</div>
               <div class="l">And Female Tears, resistlessly prevail:</div>
               <div class="l">Can gentlest natures be in love with Peace,</div>
               <div class="l">When Love, most tender Love, excites to War?</div>
               <div class="l">No…When some lov’d and honour’d youth distress’d,</div>
               <div class="l">Raising his head amongst his arm’d compeers, </div>
               <div class="l">Tells that the well-known honourable Maid,</div>
               <div class="l">The Virgin Mistress of his dearest hopes,</div>
               <div class="l">Is ravish’d from him, borne by force away;</div>
               <div class="l">Though pierc’d with grief, yet nobly he exclaims,</div>
               <div class="l">‘Think not I wish to’ embroil you in my fate:</div>
               <div class="l">For though not one of you espouse my cause,</div>
               <div class="l">I singly will attempt the desperate deed.</div>
               <div class="l">Farewell: I go to find my Love, or die!’</div>
               <div class="l">Silent and motionless the legions stand,</div>
               <div class="l">By looks examining each-other’s heart:</div>
               <div class="l">But soon a murmur through the ranks proceeds,</div>
               <div class="l">Swelling as quickly a terrific roar;</div>
               <div class="l">Like heavy waters breaking from their mounds,</div>
               <div class="l">A long, and loud, and inarticulate shout,</div>
               <div class="l">While every weapon vibrates in the air,</div>
               <div class="l">And hisses its fierce vengeance at the foe.</div>
               <div class="l">The righteous cause admits of no delay;</div>
               <div class="l">No tardy foot impedes the immediate march:</div>
               <div class="l">The Enemy, not taken by surprise, </div>
               <div class="l">Wak’d by the watchful fears of conscious guilt,</div>
               <div class="l">On their frontiers await the coming foe.</div>
               <div class="l">Now at the near approach of threatening Death,</div>
               <div class="l">Full many a thinking, sighing, aching heart,</div>
               <div class="l">Indulges secretly the hopeless wish</div>
               <div class="l">For Life, and Peace...Alas! it cannot be:</div>
               <div class="l">To advance is to encounter dreadful danger;</div>
               <div class="l">But to recede, inevitable death;</div>
               <div class="l">His own associates would deal the blow:</div>
               <div class="l">Thus led by Fate, behold upon the plain,</div>
               <div class="l">The adverse bands in view, and in advance.</div>
               <div class="l">Now Fear, Self-pity, and affected Courage,</div>
               <div class="l">Speak in their hideous shouts with voice scarce human;</div>
               <div class="l">Like that which issues from his hollow throat</div>
               <div class="l">Who sleeping bellows in a frightful dream.</div>
               <div class="l">More near their glaring eye-balls flashing meet;</div>
               <div class="l">Terror and Rage distorting every face,</div>
               <div class="l">Inflame each-other into trembling fury.</div>
               <div class="l">Soft-ey’d Humanity, oh! veil thy fight!</div>
               <div class="l">’Tis not in Rationality to view</div>
               <div class="l">(Even in thought) the dire ensuing scene; </div>
               <div class="l">For Madness, Madness reigns, and urges men</div>
               <div class="l">To deeds that Rationality disowns.</div>
               <div class="l">Now here and there about the horrid Field,</div>
               <div class="l">Striding across the dying and the dead,</div>
               <div class="l">Stalks up a man by strength superior,</div>
               <div class="l">Or skill and prowess in the arduous fight,</div>
               <div class="l">Preserv’d alive:...fainting he looks around;</div>
               <div class="l">Fearing pursuit, nor caring to pursue.</div>
               <div class="l">The supplicating voice of bitterest moans,</div>
               <div class="l">Contortions of excruciating pain,</div>
               <div class="l">The shriek of torture and the groan of death,</div>
               <div class="l">Surround him; and as Night her mantle spreads,</div>
               <div class="l">To veil the horrors of the mourning Field,</div>
               <div class="l">With cautious step shaping his devious way,</div>
               <div class="l">He seeks a covert where to hide and rest: </div>
               <div class="l">At every leaf that rustles in the breeze</div>
               <div class="l">Starting, he grasps his sword; and every nerve</div>
               <div class="l">Is ready strain’d, for combat or for flight.</div>
               <div class="l">Thus list’ning to ward off approaching foes,</div>
               <div class="l">A distant whispering, sighing, murmuring sound</div>
               <div class="l">Salutes his ear, and to his throbbing heart</div>
               <div class="l">Soft tidings tells of tenderness and love.</div>
               <div class="l">For on that fatal day of vengeful ire,</div>
               <div class="l">At fearful distance following the host,</div>
               <div class="l">From either country came a female throng;</div>
               <div class="l">And now beneath the covert of the night</div>
               <div class="l">Advancing, guided by the voice of woe,</div>
               <div class="l">Where on the earth the wounded mourners lay,</div>
               <div class="l">With trembling steps and fearful whispering voice,</div>
               <div class="l">Each seeks, and calls him who she came to seek:</div>
               <div class="l">And many a fugitive, whom force or fear</div>
               <div class="l">Had driven from the Field, steals softly back,</div>
               <div class="l">Anxious to know the fate of some lov’d friend.</div>
               <div class="l">Mutual fears appal the mingled group,</div>
               <div class="l">Starting alternate at the unknown tongue: </div>
               <div class="l">They fear a foe in each uncertain form</div>
               <div class="l">That through the gloom imperfectly appears.</div>
               <div class="l">The mournful horrors of the doleful night</div>
               <div class="l">Melt every heart:…and when the morning’s beam</div>
               <div class="l">Shews the sad scene, and gives an interview,</div>
               <div class="l">Resentment, that worst torment of the mind,</div>
               <div class="l">Resentment ceases, satiate wrath subsides.</div>
               <div class="l">Woman is present: and so strong the charm</div>
               <div class="l">Of weeping Woman’s fascinating tears,</div>
               <div class="l">That though surviving Heroes’ unwash’d hands</div>
               <div class="l">Still grasp the falchion of horrid hue,</div>
               <div class="l">And though their fallen brethren from the ground</div>
               <div class="l">May seem to call for Vengeance from their hands,</div>
               <div class="l">The impulse of Revenge is felt no more;</div>
               <div class="l">No more the strange attire, the foreign tongue </div>
               <div class="l">Creates alarm: for Nature’s-self has writ</div>
               <div class="l">In every face; where every eye can read</div>
               <div class="l">Repentant Sorrow, and forgiving Love.</div>
               <div class="l">Their mingled tears wash the lamented dead:</div>
               <div class="l">On every wound they pour soft Pity’s balm:</div>
               <div class="l">Ere Sorrow’s tears are dried, they feel the spring</div>
               <div class="l">Of new-born joys, and each expanding heart</div>
               <div class="l">Contemplates future scenes of Peace and Love.</div>
               <div class="l">Long, even as long as room and food abound,</div>
               <div class="l">They interchange their friendly offices</div>
               <div class="l">For mutual good; reciprocally kind:</div>
               <div class="l">And much they wonder that they e’er were foes.</div>
               <div class="l">Still War’s terrific name is kept alive:</div>
               <div class="l">Tradition, pointing to the rusty arms</div>
               <div class="l">That hang on high, informs each list’ning youth</div>
               <div class="l">How erst in fatal fields their Grandsires fell;</div>
               <div class="l">Childhood attentive hears the tragic tale;</div>
               <div class="l">And learns to shudder at the name of War.</div>
               <div class="l">GUNPOWDER! let the Soldier’s Pean rise,</div>
               <div class="l">Where e’er thy name or thundering voice is heard:</div>
               <div class="l">Let him who, fated to the needful trade,</div>
               <div class="l">Deals out the adventitious shafts of Death,</div>
               <div class="l">Rejoice in thee; and hail with loudest shouts</div>
               <div class="l">The auspicious era when deep-searching Art</div>
               <div class="l">From out the hidden things in Nature’s store </div>
               <div class="l">Cull’d thy tremendous powers, and tutor’d Man</div>
               <div class="l">To chain the unruly element of Fire</div>
               <div class="l">At his controul, to wait his potent touch:</div>
               <div class="l">To urge his missile bolts of sudden Death,</div>
               <div class="l">And thunder terribly his vengeful wrath. </div>
               <div class="l">Thy mighty engines and gigantic towers</div>
               <div class="l">With frowning aspect awe the trembling World.</div>
               <div class="l">Destruction, bursting from thy sudden blaze</div>
               <div class="l">Hath taught the Birds to tremble at the sound;</div>
               <div class="l">And Man himself, thy terror’s boasted lord,</div>
               <div class="l">Within the blacken’d hollow of thy tube,</div>
               <div class="l">Affrighted sees the darksome shades of Death.</div>
               <div class="l">Not only mourning groves, but human tears,</div>
               <div class="l">The weeping Widow’s tears, the Orphan’s cries,</div>
               <div class="l">Sadly deplore that e’er thy powers were known.</div>
               <div class="l">Yet let thy Advent be the Soldier’s song,</div>
               <div class="l">No longer doom’d to grapple with the Foe</div>
               <div class="l">With Teeth and Nails.…When close in view, and in</div>
               <div class="l">Each-other’s grasp, to grin, and hack, and stab;</div>
               <div class="l">Then tug his horrid weapon from one breast</div>
               <div class="l">To hide it in another:...with clear hands</div>
               <div class="l">He now expertly poizing thy bright tube,</div>
               <div class="l">At distance kills, unknowing and unknown;</div>
               <div class="l">Sees not the wound he gives, nor hears the shriek</div>
               <div class="l">Of him whose breast he pierces….GUNPOWDER!</div>
               <div class="l">(O! let Humanity rejoice) who much</div>
               <div class="l">The Soldier’s fearful work is humaniz’d,</div>
               <div class="l">Since thy momentous birth...stupendous power.</div>
               <div class="l">In Britain, where the hills and fertile plains,</div>
               <div class="l">Like her historic page, are overspread </div>
               <div class="l">With vestiges of War, the Shepherd Boy</div>
               <div class="l">Climbs the green hillock to survey his flock;</div>
               <div class="l">Then sweetly sleeps upon his favourite hill,</div>
               <div class="l">Not conscious that his bed’s a Warrior’s Tomb.</div>
               <div class="l">The ancient Mansions, deeply moated round,</div>
               <div class="l">Where, in the iron Age of Chivalry,</div>
               <div class="l">Redoubted Barons wag’d their little Wars;</div>
               <div class="l">The strong Entrenchments and enormous Mounds,</div>
               <div class="l">Rais’d to oppose the fierce, perfidious Danes;</div>
               <div class="l">And still more ancient traces that remain</div>
               <div class="l">Of Dykes and Camps, from the far distant date</div>
               <div class="l">When minstrel Druids wak’d the soul of War,</div>
               <div class="l">And rous’d to arms old Albion’s hardy sons,</div>
               <div class="l">To stem the tide of Roman Tyranny:…</div>
               <div class="l">War’s footsteps, thus imprinted on the ground, </div>
               <div class="l">Shew that in Britain he, from age to age,</div>
               <div class="l">Has rear’d his horrid head, and raging reign’d.</div>
               <div class="l">Long on the margins of the silver Tweed</div>
               <div class="l">Opposing Ensigns wav’d; War’s clarion</div>
               <div class="l">Dreadfully echo’d down the winding stream,</div>
               <div class="l">Where now sweet Peace and Unity reside:</div>
               <div class="l">The happy peasant of Tweed’s smiling dale,</div>
               <div class="l">Whene’er his spade disturbs a Soldier’s bones,</div>
               <div class="l">With shudd’ring horror ruminates on War;</div>
               <div class="l">Then deeper hides the awful spectacle,</div>
               <div class="l">Blessing the peaceful days in which he lives.</div>
               <div class="l">Since Peace has bless’d the villages on Tweed,</div>
               <div class="l">And War has ceas’d to drive his iron car</div>
               <div class="l">On Britain’s shore, what myriads of men</div>
               <div class="l">Over the Eastern and the Western Seas </div>
               <div class="l">Have follow’d War, and found untimely graves.</div>
               <div class="l">Where’er the jarring interests of States</div>
               <div class="l">Excite the brave to advance their native land</div>
               <div class="l">By deeds of arms, Britons are foremost found.</div>
               <div class="l">The sprightly bands, hast’ning from place to place,</div>
               <div class="l">Gayly carousing in their gay attire,</div>
               <div class="l">Invite, not force the train of heedless youths,</div>
               <div class="l">Who crowd to share their jollity and joy:</div>
               <div class="l">To martial music dancing into death,</div>
               <div class="l">They fell their Freedom for a holiday;</div>
               <div class="l">And with the Rich and Great ’tis Glory charms,</div>
               <div class="l">And Beauty’s favour that rewards the Brave.</div>
               <div class="l">All the historic Records of the World</div>
               <div class="l">Are little more than histories of Wars;</div>
               <div class="l">Shewing how many thousands War destroy’d,</div>
               <div class="l">The time, the place, and some few great ones’ names.</div>
               <div class="l">The mournful remnants of demolish’d States,</div>
               <div class="l">The Greeks, the Roman, and long-exil’d Jew;</div>
               <div class="l">Are living monuments of wasting War’s</div>
               <div class="l">Annihilating power: and while they mourn</div>
               <div class="l">Their Grandeur faded, and their Power extinct,</div>
               <div class="l">To every State <span class="ital">memento mori</span> sounds.</div>
               <div class="l">From age to age the habitable World</div>
               <div class="l">Has been a constant theatre of War:</div>
               <div class="l">In every land with Nature’s gifts most blest,</div>
               <div class="l">Frequent and fatal War’s destructive rage.</div>
               <div class="l">So bland is fair Britannia’s genial clime,</div>
               <div class="l">So liberal her all-protecting Laws,</div>
               <div class="l">So generous the spirit of her Sons,</div>
               <div class="l">So fond, so chaste, her Daughters virtuous love,</div>
               <div class="l">That human offspring still redundant grows,</div>
               <div class="l">And free-born Britons must contend for life.</div>
               <div class="l">O! envy not the lands where Slaves reside,</div>
               <div class="l">Though their proud Tyrants boast of <span class="ital">peaceful</span> reign,</div>
               <div class="l">Where hard Oppression, freezing genial love, </div>
               <div class="l">Performs the work of War in embryo:</div>
               <div class="l">Let not mistaken fondness dote on Peace,</div>
               <div class="l">Preserv’d by arts more horrid far than War!…</div>
               <div class="l">Let the dull languor of the pale Chinese</div>
               <div class="l">Desert their Infants, and their <span class="ital">Peace</span> enjoy!</div>
               <div class="l">But, O! let Britons still in Love and War</div>
               <div class="l">Exert the generous ardour of the soul;</div>
               <div class="l">Protect the Fair, and softer Infancy.</div>
               <div class="l">By strenuous enterprize, and arduous toils,</div>
               <div class="l">Is public safety purchas’d and secur’d.</div>
               <div class="l">Negative merit, ‘I have done no harm,’</div>
               <div class="l">Is an inglorious boast: shall he who sits</div>
               <div class="l">Secure, enjoying Plenty in the lap</div>
               <div class="l">Of Ease, vaunt his recumbent Virtues?…He</div>
               <div class="l">Brand with harsh epithets the Warrior’s toils? </div>
               <div class="l">While ’tis to them he owes sincerest thanks</div>
               <div class="l">For Peace and Safety, that are earn’d in War.…</div>
               <div class="l">As well might he who eats the flesh of Lambs,</div>
               <div class="l">And smacks the ichor in a savoury dish,</div>
               <div class="l">Boast his humanity, and say ‘My hand</div>
               <div class="l">Ne’er slew a Lamb;’ and censure as a crime,</div>
               <div class="l">The Butcher’s cruel, necessary trade.</div>
               <div class="l">In Battle, the chance-medley game of Death,</div>
               <div class="l">Where every one still hopes ’till he expires,</div>
               <div class="l">Less horror shocks the mind contemplative,</div>
               <div class="l">Than where, in slow procession’s solemn pace,</div>
               <div class="l">Doom’d wretches meet their destin’d fate in bonds,</div>
               <div class="l">Who know the moment to expect the blow,</div>
               <div class="l">And count the moments ’till that moment comes:</div>
               <div class="l">Or where Oppression wages War, in Peace,</div>
               <div class="l">On the defenceless: on the hapless man</div>
               <div class="l">Who holds his breath but by another’s will:</div>
               <div class="l">Whose Life is only one long cruel Death!…</div>
               <div class="l">Hardly he fares, and hopelessly he toils;</div>
               <div class="l">And when his driver’s anger, or caprice,</div>
               <div class="l">Or wanton cruelty, inflicts a blow,</div>
               <div class="l">Not daring to look angry at the whip,</div>
               <div class="l">Oh! see him meekly clasp his hands and bow</div>
               <div class="l">To every stroke: no lurid deathful scene</div>
               <div class="l">In Battle’s rage, so racks the feeling heart;</div>
               <div class="l">Not all the thunders of infuriate War,</div>
               <div class="l">Disploding mines, and crashing, bursting bombs,</div>
               <div class="l">Are half so horrid as the sounding lash</div>
               <div class="l">That echoes through the Carribean groves.</div>
               <div class="l">Incessant is the War of Human Wit,</div>
               <div class="l">Oppos’d to bestial strength; and variously</div>
               <div class="l">Successful: in these happy fertile climes,</div>
               <div class="l">Man still maintains his surreptitious power;</div>
               <div class="l">Reigns o’er the Brutes, and, with the voice of Fate,</div>
               <div class="l">Says ‘This to-day, and that to-morrow dies.’</div>
               <div class="l">Though here our Shambles blazon the Renown,</div>
               <div class="l">The Victory, and Rule, and lordly Man;</div>
               <div class="l">Far wider tracts within the Torrid Zone</div>
               <div class="l">Own no such Lord: where Sol’s intenser rays</div>
               <div class="l">Create in bestial hearts more fervid fires,</div>
               <div class="l">And deadlier poisons arm the Serpent’s tooth;</div>
               <div class="l">In gloomy shades, impassable to Man,</div>
               <div class="l">Where matted foliage exclude the Sun,</div>
               <div class="l">The torpid Birds that crawl from bough to bough</div>
               <div class="l">Utter their notes of terror: while beneath </div>
               <div class="l">Fury and Venom, couch’d in murky dens,</div>
               <div class="l">Hissing and yelling, guard the hideous gloom.</div>
               <div class="l">O’er dreary wastes, untrod by human feet,</div>
               <div class="l">Without controul the lordly Lion reigns;</div>
               <div class="l">And every creature trembles at his voice: </div>
               <div class="l">When risen from his den, he prances forth,</div>
               <div class="l">Extends his talons, shakes his flaky mane,</div>
               <div class="l">Then whurrs his tufted tail, and stooping low</div>
               <div class="l">His wide mouth near the ground, his dreadful roar</div>
               <div class="l">Makes all the desart tremble: he proclaims</div>
               <div class="l">His ire—proclaims his strong necessity;</div>
               <div class="l">And that surprise or artifice he scorns.</div>
               <div class="l">Unskill’d, alas! in philosophic lore,</div>
               <div class="l">Unbless’d with scientific erudition;</div>
               <div class="l">How can I sing of elemental War,</div>
               <div class="l">Or the contending powers of opposite</div>
               <div class="l">Attractions, that impel, and poize, and guide,</div>
               <div class="l">The ever-rolling Spheres: Animal War,</div>
               <div class="l">The flux of Life, devouring and devour’d,</div>
               <div class="l">Ceaseless in every tribe, through Earth, and Air,</div>
               <div class="l">And Ocean, transcends my utmost ken.</div>

               <div class="l">From obvious truths my Song has aim’d to shew</div>
               <div class="l">That War is an inevitable Ill;</div>
               <div class="l">An Ill through Nature’s various Realms diffus’d;</div>
