                    accept an invitation to take a cheap ride to Durham, which under other
                    circumstances would be delightful. It is an author traveling for statistical
                    information and I don’t know enough about him.—The account which I have received

                    her as I trust that the conveyance will be strictly honourable; as I have
                    address’d the letter inclosed to Mr Charles Wilson Peale, Museum, Philadelphia;
                    who is father to the proprietor of the Mammoth, who with his Mammoth and his
                    paintings is now at Bristol on his return to America, and who will most probably
                    cary the letter himself.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Wilson
                        Peale, proprietor of a museum of art and ‘natural curiosities’ in
                        Philadelphia, had been touring Britain showing the fossilized bones of a
                        mammoth unearthed in New York State. Peale’s son Rembrandt Peale, a student
                        in London, painted Bloomfield’s portrait for his father’s ‘portrait factory’
                        in Philadelphia. Thomas Inskip wrote of it: ‘Mr. Bloomfield himself told me
                        that the most correct likeness of him ever painted was done by Peele, son to
                        the proprietor of the <title>Mammoth</title>. He painted it while resident
                        in England and took it away with him to America after promising it to the
                        author’ <title>The Bedfordshire Times</title>, 6 May 1904.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> I have not received a farthing, for my <ref target="places.html#SealOffice">Seal Office</ref> job. Nor seen <ref target="people.html#AllenWilliam">Mr Allen</ref> but once since my return
                    from <ref target="places.html#Woolwich">Woolwich</ref>. I am highly gratified at
                        <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft’s</ref> calling on <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref> because I know she
                    would be gratified by it.</p><p rend="indent1"> I ocasionally mend and make shoes for my family, and then write
                    letters, compose, read, sing, sigh, nurse, &amp;c as the spirit
                    dictates.</p><p rend="indent1"> You will find; I hope, that I have thus far endeavour’d manfully
                    to get the pastoral noticed by the public,<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to Nathaniel Bloomfield’s play (see Letters 113,
                        114 and 117).</note> but my introductions are crampt; and the public mind so
                    engaged about War and Bloodshed that I begin to doubt much that the lowly and
                    charming eloquence of that piece will never be heard. <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> justly says that it would
                    succeed <hi rend="ital">if it was</hi> accepted by the managers, but I doubt
                    that he is not aware of the difficulties to be overcome in getting it accepted:
                    there lies the point, nothing on my part shall be wanting either in walks or in
                    impudence, at least more of it than I could use if the piece was my own.</p><p rend="indent1"> I lately dined in company with <ref target="people.html#AikenJohnEd">Dr Aikin</ref> and his son <ref target="people.html#AikenArthur">Arthur</ref>, who is Editor of the Annual
                    Review, and who in that work by the bye, has given my neighbour <ref target="people.html#HollowayWilliam">Holloway</ref> and some others a very
                    indiferent ‘character from their last place.’ <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nats</ref> poems are not noticed there,
                    nor mine of course; for they did not come into last year’s literature. I was
                    anxious to see men so famous in the world of Books; But though <ref target="people.html#RogersSamuel">Mr Rogers</ref> at whose table we met
                    behaved with his usual kindness <ref target="people.html#AikenJohnEd">Dr A</ref>
                    and <ref target="people.html#AikenArthur">Son</ref> would have known just as
                    much of me had I been looking through a gimblet hole in the wainscot, and I
                    should have made as good a figure in the company. Neither of them ask’d one
                    question of any kind nor gave a moment’s chance for poor Giles to mix his mud
                    with the unceasing stream of erudition that flowd copiously for four hours. I
                    eat a good dinner, but soon found that I was in the wrong box. Yet, I was
                    invited there and they were no more. Now all this might happen without any
                    intention on their side. <ref target="people.html#AikenJohnEd">Dr A.</ref> drank
                    to me in common on taking the first glass of wine; else I should have concluded
                    that he did not know I was there. They are professd Criticks, and perhaps they
                    served me right for being among them; but if they will but pardon me this first
                    time I will not offend again. During the first hour I felt pain, but during the
                    rest of the evening pride kindly came to my assistance and from that moment
                    instead of feeling myself <hi rend="ital">little</hi>, I grew to a most noble
                    and patagonian<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The Patagonians were
                        reputedly of giant stature.</note> nature, from which I could scarcely
                    reduce myself for many days after; and which enabled me at the moment to turn a
                    deaf ear to the contended merits of Demosthenes and Cicero, the Borhavians in
                    medicine, and the &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c—and to set and
                    compose verses ‘to my Old Oak table’, which by the bye is a far better companion
                    to me, as I will make appear, than <ref target="people.html#AikenJohnEd">Dr.
                        A</ref> and his <ref target="people.html#AikenArthur">son</ref> put
                        together.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">‘To My Old Oak Table’ was
                        published in <title>Wild Flowers</title>, pp. 21–29.</note> If they were
                    previously ofended with me or any one connected with me it is more than I know.
                    If I did chance to smell of wax as I had been mending my Children’s shoes in the
                    morning I might be disagreeable without knowing it; but if a man invited to a
                    neighbour’s table finds there one inferior to him in knowledge and wealth, and
                    takes care to let him see that he thinks so, my soul despises that man: and I
                    had allmost said that God allmighty was jesting when he made him.—Pardon my
                    warmth <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> you know me. If
                    this sees the daylight I shall have them about my ears.—Love to <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref> and to your
