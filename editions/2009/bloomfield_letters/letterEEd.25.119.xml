                    interesting and very unexpected communication. I have thought about it ever
                    since. But to talk about it is a difficulty which though I feel it a duty to
                    perform I do not like to set about. The moment that the worthy Charcoal-burner
                    is canvass’d over in conversation he appears to my fancy to loose a part of that
                    singular interest he so promptly and forcibly claims in your recital of his
                    history. Madam the story must stand alone as you have drawn it and it is a
                    serious question with me whither poetry itself can make it more truly
                    interesting, except it could be poetised by one who knows the spot, and who
                    knows in some degree the provincial dialect. Granting Madam your priority as to
                    knowledge of the spot, and of local circumstances, you certainly have the great
                    advantage of first sight, and first impressions, and I have by your kindness a
                    kind of <hi rend="ital">second sight</hi>, by virtue of which I plainly see
                    water rushing down, the man striding with a child under each arm, the rescued
                    children asleep (a good picture,) the destress’d Mother wading up to her neck;
                    and I can very plainly see the Lanthorn upon her head, it throws a light upon
                    the subject. The very singular coincidence of the names of Richard and Kate
                    endears the couple still more to my mind, but having succeeded so much beyond my
                    expectation in my Suffolk Ballad, I have the following scruples on that head. I
                    think most attempts at amplifications, or <hi rend="ital">second parts</hi>, are
                    unsuccessfull, and when they relate to what have eminently succeeded it appears
                    to my mind like ‘more last words of Mr Baxter.’<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield is recalling Joseph Addison's remarks in <title>The
                        Spectator</title>: 'I remember upon Mr. Baxter's death, there was published
                        a sheet of very good sayings, inscribed "The last words of Mr. Baxter." The
                        title sold so great a number of these papers, that about a week after there
                        came out a second sheet, inscribed, "More last words of Mr Baxter"' (No.
                        445, Thursday, July 31, 1712).</note> Yet I am very sure that this
                    simple truth of the Venerable Richard Brooks would make a figure as a Ballad and
                    might be highly acceptable, at least to those of the neighbourhood. Should I
                    ever persuade myself that I have better’d the description by giving it the dress
                    of Rhime, I hereby engage to send it to you immediately; but I have small hopes
                    of success.—</p><p rend="indent1"> The scetch of the Hut would indeed be considere’d here as a prize
                    and I should keep it as such.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">A sketch of
                        the rustic hut that Jenner had built in his garden at Berkeley, near
                        Bristol, as a place to administer vaccination.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Within these few days I have been haunted night and day by the
                    unsought recolections of an old tragical tale which had its origin perhaps fifty
                    years ago at <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref>, and I suppose I
                    must rid myself of it by making a kind of dying-speech Ballad, and then I can
                    attend to Richard Brooks.</p><p rend="indent1"> By the association of ideas, (of which I know somthing less that
                    [sic] Mr Locke,) I always bring you to my mind in the attitude of flying. It
                    seems that the Heathen Goddesses had a knack of flying just when and where they
                    pleased, but as I have very little knowledge of, or acquaintance with these
                    lasses I do not think it unpoetical to declare that I had much rather see a real
                    bonafida, terrestreal lady <hi rend="ital">swinging between two Trees</hi>.</p><p rend="indent1"> Have the goodness to remember my self and family to <ref target="people.html#SharpJames">Mr and Mrs Sharp</ref>, and to <ref target="people.html#ProwseElizabeth">Mrs Prowse</ref>, and to the <ref target="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ">Lord of
                    your vows</ref>.</p><p rend="indent1"> And now Madam for the most insipid part of a letter—self—which
                    should her form no part did I not feel a lash from my conscience when I reflect
                    that I let slip all the last summer without calling at <ref target="places.html#Fulham">Fullham</ref>. Anticipating some kind questions,
                    I say that I have some time ago busied my brain and workd up my feelings to a
                    great pitch in poetically celebrating the great victory obtain’d over the
                    desease that kill’d my Father; and in which your neighbour and my friend <ref target="people.html#JennerEdward">Dr Jenner</ref> is so immediately
                    concern’d. The piece is still in existence, and I have allmost offended some
                    worthy members of the medical world by keeping it unpublish’d.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">A reference to <title>Good Tidings; or, News

                        was published in 1804.</note></p><p rend="indent1"> Last spring the Muses struck a light for me, not on parnassus,
                    but on Shooter’s-Hill, and sooth’d my vanity exceedingly.<note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Bloomfield’s ‘Shooter’s Hill’ was published in
                            <title>Wild Flowers</title>, pp. 75–81.</note> Thus madam I jog on with
                    poetry much the same as I did with my whistle and my song in the Bird-Field, for
                    amusement.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have had some trouble, and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn">my partner</ref> much care and much

                    last became lame with a swelling on his knee. By surgical assistance it appeared
                    quite well in August, but has return’d since, and is again diminishing with the
                    appearance of a speedy restoration.</p><p rend="indent1"> That kind of inspiration so common in the world at all times,
                    attacked <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldMaryAnn">my wife</ref> some time
