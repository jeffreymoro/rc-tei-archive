                        the supporters of reform whom he was addressing at a mass meeting in
                        Manchester killed. The Peterloo massacre, as it was called, caused popular
                        protest across the country. On 13 September Hunt returned to London, his
                        trial pending, to be met by huge cheering crowds, a procession and welcoming
                        committee. Despite this support, he was sentenced to two and a half years in
                        prison.</note> in the afternoon, They are coming in procession from
                    Highgate. Your parcel was not deliverd until yesterday (Sunday) at eleven. The
                    peaches were partly smashd, for they require nice packing. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldJames">James</ref> came in while we were
                    opening it. He first eat his peaches and then open’d the letter to see if they
                    were his. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacNephew">Isaac</ref> and child
                    were here and tasted of your good things. I took part of them to Curtain Road,
                    where I had engaged to dine, and there, to the astonishment of every one found
                    that <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">my Brother</ref> had resolved to
                    dress and come down stairs! He did so, and breakfasted below, and sat there till
                    I came, when he eat for dinner, baked pudding and Lamb, and was full of talk but
                    quite as full of groans. He was askd what he would take by way of drink, and he
                    answered ‘O I will have some beer’, he accordingly took perhaps half a pint of
                    good porter, (Barclay &amp; Perkins) and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt">Aunt Charlotte</ref> happening
                    to say ‘perhaps <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">your Brother</ref> would
                    like to go into the little room and smoke his pipe?’ ‘Aye, says he and Ill have
                    a pipe too, for the novelty’. He had not smoked before for a year and a half. I
                    have began to think that this was all unnatural appetite, and that he would
                    never eat again; but he went to sleep soundly and 6 hours after had tea and
                    coffee, and a Rusk, and ‘said he was better’ but he found out that he could not
                    workd if it had not been Sunday, though he actually went out to be shaved and
                    would not suffer any one to lead him! Did I not always tell you that he is the
                    strangest man I ever met with in my life?—</p><p rend="indent1"> (One Oclock) I have just seen him and both the Doctors, who say
                    that he is certainly getting better, but must take care of himself.

                    On Thursday morning Miss Weston and Mrs Smith calld and had a gossip of which it
                    would be folly to attempt any account. I myself shall try to see them, (the
                    windsorites) short as the time is. I will see <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref> or write to her

                    you for the nuts, and at the rate she goes on they will not get mouldy. Tomorrow
