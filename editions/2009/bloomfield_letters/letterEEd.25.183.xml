                    consciousness of having been remiss myself, I had reason to suppose that you
                    would or might probably be first with one. I long ago determined that I would
                    not write to you untill I could announce the publication of my ‘Wild Flowers’
                    and send you a copy—and then close upon the Back of that came the
                    ‘Illustrations’ by Storer &amp; <ref target="people.html#GriegJohn">Greig</ref>, the two artists who visited you last summer.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"><title>Wild Flowers; or, Pastoral and Local
                            Poetry</title> was published by Vernor, Hood and Sharpe in early 1806.
                        J. Storer and J. Greig, <title>Views in Suffolk, Norfolk, and
                            Northamptonshire, Illustrative of the Works of Robert Bloomfield;
                            Accompanied with Descriptions: to which is Annexed a Memoir of the
                            Poet's Life by E. W. Brayley</title>
                        was also published by Vernor, Hood and Sharpe. The illustrations can be seen
                        here: <ref target="../images/image16.html">[1]</ref><ref target="../images/image17.html"> [2]</ref><ref target="../images/image18.html">[3]</ref><ref target="../images/image19.html">[4]</ref><ref target="../images/image35.html">[5]</ref><ref target="../images/image31.html">[6]</ref><ref target="../images/image32.html">[7]</ref><ref target="../images/image33.html">[8]</ref><ref target="../images/image34.html">[9]</ref><ref target="../images/image36.html">[10]</ref><ref target="../images/image37.html">[11]</ref><ref target="../images/image38.html">[12]</ref><ref target="../images/image39.html">[13]</ref><ref target="../images/image40.html">[14]</ref></note> The first has been
                    published some time, and after having been neglectfull in the first case, I
                    resolved to send you the two Books together. The latter is just publishe’d, and
                    I will certainly make them into a parcel, with some songs I have long meant to
                    send you. and you will receive it by next Thursday night by Avey—But I write
                    this quickly that you may have it tomorrow evening and know that the packet is
                    coming.—</p><p rend="indent1"> There is another material cause yet for my not sending to you
                    sooner. Our Bookseller has been to Scotland, and has not yet settled my yearly
                    account, upon which depends the payment of the dividends on account of the
                    house, the intended fence of the garden, and my whole plans for the ensuing
                    year. I have no doubt of having a settlement next week. </p><p rend="indent1"> With this preface on account of my long silence, let us proceed
                    to other subjects I will certainly and cheerfully too, perform all in my power
                    with respect to the anthemns, and will write in due time to Dr Mills, or any
                    other you may name. I have every reason to believe that Mrs Park, (who has set a
                    tune on the death of Nelson and requested me to forward a copy to you) will give
                    her attention and support to such an undertaking. But I should think it material
                    to you as to <hi rend="ital">who</hi> is to look at the Music, I mean as to your
                        <hi rend="ital">own</hi> feelings and their judgement. Dr Hague of Cambridge
                    has lately stood Editor and partly composer to a collection of songs (in number
                    86) which are sold for 12 and 16 shillings; and though when you see them you
                    will feel a conscious pride exceedingly well grounded, I wish to heaven you
                    could get half his list of subscribers.—<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Charles Hague (1769–1821) was a violinist and professor of music at
                        Cambridge, where he taught, among others, William Crotch. A writer of songs
                        and glees, Hague contributed to the collection to which Bloomfield refers,
                        James Plumptre’s <title>A Collection of Songs, Moral, Sentimental,
                            Instructive, and Amusing</title> (London, 1805).</note></p><p rend="indent1"> It must first be known how many pages it will occupy; and how
                    much it will or ought to sell for; then regulate the copies by the number
                    subscribed for; and to get subscribers a small bill specifying particulars of
                    the intended work, and the author, his children &amp;c, as far as you
                    please, should be distributed, and I will endeavour that through <ref target="people.html#GedgePeter">Mr Gedge</ref> it shall be known to the
                    Suffolk folks. I immagine that it ought to sell at 5 or 6 shillings, and that
                    three or four hundred copies might be printed, but this is merely the thought of
                    the moment.<note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">Isaac Bloomfield’s anthems

                    like to send the MS. to London. If you do I will abide by your wishes in the
