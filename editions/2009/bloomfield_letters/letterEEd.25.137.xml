                    arrived about 12 o’clock, and the coach in which I travelld happening to stop at
                    a house out of the high street where the London Coaches stop, I was forc’d to go
                    to another House, and this I did by chance, and it chanced here that I put into
                    one where no coaches stopt at all, but this I did not discover till afterwards.
                    Dinner was to be ready at one, I accordingly took advantage of that spare hour,
                    as I thought it, to look round a prodigious old church calld St Albans Abbey—I
                    enquir’d at a Book shop for some historical account of it, but could get none.
                    The whole Building is in the form of a cross with a venerable square tower in
                    the center. The East, or upper end of the church is going fast to decay, being
                    separated from the main body of the building by having the immense Gothick
                    arches from the floor to the roof filld up with rough, modern brickwork and a
                    public footpath passing through from side to side of the sanctuary, or chapel of
                    St Albans. At the back of the church appears to have once been perhaps another
                    Aisle, or side wing, but the space is now a green meadow interspersed with
                    ruins, and the earth lies up nearly to the top of a fine range of Gothick
                    windows, the cells of which, if I estimate right must be at least 12 foot below
                    the earth; the windows are stop’d with brick work, and the sides of the
                    beautiful carvework of stone is all crumbling away in places, and in others rubd
                    smooth by the cattle that shelter under the wall from the flies. The whole gives
                    me an idea of space and grandeur far more than Westminster Abbey. the body of
                    the building is longer, and being less ornamented, and standing on a fine
                    commanding Hill, is the noblest object (except St Pauls) that I have ever seen.
                    I did not attempt to see the inside because I meant to set off by the first
                    coach that came by. But after dinner I found none but such as would get to <ref target="places.html#Towcester">Towcester</ref> too soon, and set me down in
                    the middle of the night, so, I bespoke a bed and made myself happy. And I am
                    glad that I stopt there, as the sight of the Abbey and Town was worth the
                    expence. No doubt but the Abbey at <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref> was of equal beauty and extent when it was in its prime.</p><p rend="indent1"> I had a good bed and accommodation, and in the morning waited at
                    another House for the Coventry coach which brought me to <ref target="people.html#GrantWilliam">Mr Grants</ref> yesterday afternoon at 4.
                    They were all from home, and if I had had my recollection about me, there might
                    have been time to have sent you word by last nights post, but I was tired, and
                        <ref target="people.html#GrantWilliam">Mr G</ref> returning in the evening, I
                    went early to bed. You will have received a letter from <ref target="people.html#GrantWilliam">Mr G</ref> which was posted on Tuesday. It
                    wants no answer. I am here safe enough. <ref target="people.html#GrantWilliam">Mr
                        G</ref> is gone to Day to a meeting of Officers, he being captain of a
                    Company of the <ref target="places.html#Towcester">Towcester</ref> Volunteers.
                    The Hall which in <ref target="people.html#GrantThomas">Dr Grant’s</ref> days
                    was appropriated to medical purposes, is now completely surrounded by Muskets
                    and pikes arranged in exact order, and accompanied by some small, and one large
                    Drum, and all the dreadfull paraphernalia of noise and death.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am going for a walk, and am to dine with I know not who at
                    Braden Hall, about two miles from hence.</p><p rend="indent1"> I think to go to the <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Dukes</ref> on Sunday or Monday,
                    and you shall hear from me again on Wednesday next. How did <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldHannah">Hannah</ref> get home? She might write
                    and tell me.
