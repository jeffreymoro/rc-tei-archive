                  in the published <title>An Essay on War</title>, in which the episode concerning gunpowder appears on pp. 15–16.</note> I want you
               to exclude the word taylor let there be no such a word in the Book, <note n="4" place="foot" resp="editors">Nathaniel’s fears of
                  publicity—tailors had, since Shakespeare’s time, been the butt of jokes—were justified. His profession was revealed in <title>An
                     Essay on War</title> when Lofft included this very entreaty, quoted verbatim from this letter, in his preface to the volume (pp.
                  xxv–xxvii). Critics regretted Lofft’s exposure of the author’s embarrassment but declared that Nathaniel’s poems, while exhibiting
                  the recent diffusion of knowledge among the labouring classes, were not good enough for him to give up his trade. See <title>The
                     Annual Review</title>, 2 (1803), 585–88, which remarked, ‘The poem being bad, Mr. Capel Lofft is ignorant. Q.E.D, lamentably
                  ignorant, and presumptuously obtrusive in his ignorance’ (p. 587). Cf. <title>The Monthly Review</title>, 42 (1803), 379–81.
                     <title>The British Critic</title>, 22 (1803), 81–82, declared ‘Another Bloomfield, and a poet! Are all the Bloomfields poets?’
                  (p. 81). </note> but perhaps I am to late if Mr Gedge has mention’d it in the paper perhaps he has already said that the author is a
               taylor. <note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Nat feared that Gedge had already identified him as a tailor in advertisements for the
                  forthcoming book published in Gedge’s newspaper, the <title>Bury and Norwich Post</title>. See Letter 77 for notices of the
                  Bloomfields in this newspaper in 1802. </note> I know there is in the publick mind as great <del>a</del> Contempt for him who bears
               the appelation of Taylor, as Stern has made old Shandy have for the Names, Simken, Nicky or tristram, ‘how many Ceasars and pompy’s
               (sais he) by mere inspiration of the Names have been render’d worthy of them, and how many are there who might have done exceeding well
               in the World, had not their Characters and spirits been totally Depress’d and Nicodemus’d’ <note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">From
                  Laurence Sterne, <title>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman </title>(London, 1759), I, 19, ‘How many Cæsars and
                  Pompeys . . by mere inspiration of the names have been rendered worthy of them; and how many … might have done … well in the world …
                  had they not been Nicodemused into nothing.’ </note> and I will add Taylor’d ‘into nothing’ in the rehearsal (professedly written
               for ridicule) the author to make the most ridiculous part of it still more riddiculous, tells us that it was written to a Taylor and by
               a Taylors wife. <note n="7" place="foot" resp="editors"> Tailors are mocked for their lack of virility and as cuckolds in George

                  afterwards did Penance in a Bay Gelding for ten Years; as also how I was a Taylor, a Shrimp, and a Tom-tit’.</note> it is from these
