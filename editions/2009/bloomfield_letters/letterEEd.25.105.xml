                    explain at large immediately. I was within a turn of a straw of coming to
                    Suffolk on Monday but I must have been travelling all day, and must have done
                    the same back again on Wednesday on account of being at the <ref target="places.html#SealOffice">Office</ref> on Thursday morning. I could
                    have spent but one day with you! So I gave it up, and still determining to go
                    out of the smoke I took a ride down to Dorking in Surrey stayd two nights and
                    came back on Wednesday. I had heard of Box Hill, and the romantic scenery about
                    that part of the County and I was delighted beyond my most poetical
                    expectations. I must give some account of the excursion next week. My Vaccine
