                            Herschilian.<note n="5" place="foot" resp="editors">Lofft was a keen
                            astronomer. Here he refers to reports of a new heavenly body much more
                            distant than Uranus, discovered in 1781 by William Herschel (1738-1822).
                            The body to which he refers was most likely Juno whose discovery was
                            formally reported on 1 September 1804, by German astronomer Karl L.
                            Harding. Juno was the third asteroid to be discovered: as with the
                            previous two, Ceres (discovered by Guiseppe Piazzi (1746-1826) in 1801)
                            and Pallas (discovered in 1802 by Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers
                            (1758-1840)), it was at first thought to be a planet; Herschel coined
                            the term ‘asteroid’ to describe these small star-like bodies in
                            1802.</note> What is said of its bylaws agrees astronomically with what
                        is said to be its period. I do wonder, however, that they have not seen it
                        at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich: which by a letter from the elder <ref target="people.html#WalkerAdam">Mr Walker</ref> I learn to be a Fact:
                        but far more that they have no information concerning it; which I understand
                        from the same authority. This would startle my belief of it: if the
                        circumstances did not so well cohere.</p><p>Thomas Hill Esqr</p><p>Thurs: 24 May 1804.</p><p rend="indent1"> How like you the ode on Negro Emancipation in St
                            Domingo?<note n="6" place="foot" resp="editors">Lofft, a longtime
                            opponent of the slave trade, had forwarded to Bloomfield a packet
                            containing Thomas Clio Rickman’s ‘An Ode in Celebration of the
                            Emancipation of the Blacks of St Domingo, November 29, 1803’ (1804).
                            This prompted Bloomfield to write to Rickman, a radical pressman and
                            admirer of Thomas Paine, on 29 May. Rickman replied on 30th with an
                            offer to sell Bloomfield’s poem (presumably <title>Good Tidings</title>)
                            from his shop. See letters 129 and 130.</note></p></postscript></div></body></text></TEI>
