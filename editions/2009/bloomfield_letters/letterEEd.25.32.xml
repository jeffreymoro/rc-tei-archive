                    you, like a coachman; talk flying. I have been this morning with <ref target="people.html#BunburyCharles">Sir C. Bunbury</ref> to his next door
                    neighbours at <ref target="places.html#CarltonHouse">Carlton House</ref>;
                    carrying with me a large coppy of the poem. It was the intention of <ref target="people.html#BunburyCharles">Sir C</ref> to have introduced me to the
                    Prince of Wales; but we were desired to call again in an hour; we did so; but
                    one of the brothers (I think) Prince Adolphus was with him; and afterwards Mr
                    Tierney; so that, not being likely to be disengaged; <ref target="people.html#BunburyCharles">Sir C</ref> proposed to leave the Book,
                    which was done; and promised if the Prince should wish to see me, he (<ref target="people.html#BunburyCharles">Sir C</ref>) would let me know,
                    &amp;c. I received Ten Guineas from the hand of my most zealous friend <ref target="people.html#BunburyCharles">Sir C</ref>, which, with a handsome
                    complimentary letter, came to his house for me, from H.R.H. the Duke of York.
                    the letter I have now enclosed to <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr.
                        Lofft</ref>; it will come back to your hand; send it to me again soon; don’t
                    deface it, &amp;c. With regard to the copyright of the Farmer’s Boy; I
                    believe <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">my Mother</ref> did not
                    understand it; it was not Messrs. <ref target="people.html#VernorThomas">Vernor</ref> and <ref target="people.html#HoodThomas">Hood</ref> offer’d to
                    buy it, it was another bookseller hinted about purchasing it of me and them, but
                    the measure was overruled, and I am glad of it, as you will see by the enclosed
                    letter of <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr. Loffts</ref>. Send the
                    enclosed to Mrs Phillips. The <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">D
                        of Grafton</ref> desird me by letter to wait on him on Wednesday night, to
                    tell him ‘what was doing to the second edition.’ A Mr. Anesley and Mr. Harison
                    member for Thetford, were present, and each ordered 2 coppies; they were
                    deliverd next day.</p><p rend="indent1"> I supd with <ref target="people.html#HoodThomas">Mr Hood</ref> on
                    Tuesday; he treated me with a sight of the Exhibition of paintings at Summersett
                    House, in company with his wife and son on Wednesday afternoon; he has likewise
                    promisd to settle with me for the first Edition next week. He gave me the
                    ‘Pleasures of Hope’ and three handsome vols of ‘Peter Pindar’s works’ (plenty of
                        laughter).<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Thomas Campbell’s
