                  interest in Bloomfield’s writing and exertions on his behalf. He had now provided Bloomfield with letters of introduction to

               that you, sir, know well that the great and fashionable part of the world are not so easy of access as yourself, I anticipate rather a
               smile at my adventures than that you will feel any thing like disappointment.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#WindhamWilliam">Mr Windham</ref> was too much engaged to see me. The Earl of Carlisle <note n="2" resp="editors" place="foot">Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle (1748–1825). Howard’s London residence was at 12 Grosvenor
                  Place, Knightsbridge. Howard was the guardian of Byron, with whom he fell out; if he did indeed support Bloomfield this may account
                  for Byron’s attack on Bloomfield, Nathaniel Bloomfield and Capel Lofft in <title>English Bards and Scotch Reviewers; a
                     Satire</title>, 2nd edn (London, 1809), pp. 59–60.</note> sent a message to the same effect, but added, that if I could call any
               morning in the following week he would be glad to speak with me. Accordingly, I took a charming walk in Hyde Park, and call’d a second
               time, when his lordship sent down for my address, and said he should see Sir Charles Bunbury.</p><p rend="indent1">On the same day, at half-past one, I met with a civil reception from the servants at Devonshire House. But the duchess
                  <note n="3" resp="editors" place="foot">Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (1757–1806), wife of the 5th Duke. The Duchess
                  was a patron of poets and herself a poet. Like Carlisle, she was a member of the circle of powerful Whig aristocrats in which
                  Bunbury and Bloomfield’s local patron, the 3rd Duke of Grafton, also belonged. The Devonshires’ London residence, Devonshire House,
                  stood in Picadilly.</note> was not up. I therefore left your letter and the book;<note n="4" resp="editors" place="foot">Probably a
                  presentation copy of Bloomfield’s new collection <title>Wild Flowers; or, Pastoral and Local Poetry </title>(London, 1806).</note>
               perhaps herein I acted wrong—but I felt at that instant as if I should be much happier out of the house than in.</p><p rend="indent1">I had all along a great desire to see <ref target="people.html#FoxCharlesJames">Mr. Fox</ref>, and therefore twice
               declined calling, because there appear’d several carriages at the door, <note n="5" resp="editors" place="foot">In 1806 Fox lived—and
                  died—at Chiswick House, west London, a residence loaned him by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.</note> and because I conceived
               that, as I have as little as possible the appearance of a minister of state, <note n="6" resp="editors" place="foot">Fox was Foreign
                  Secretary.</note> the porter would not think me of importance enough to attend to. But feeling that my first objection was of a kind
               not likely to be avoided by waiting, I at last called when some gentleman, whose carriage stood at the door, was probably engaged with
               Mr Fox, and I had an intimation to that purpose; I had however so far antici¬pated my fortune, and so far disclosed my mind in a note
               enclosed, as to say that ‘I ought for my country’s sake to wish that he might not find time to read the poems.’ <note n="7" resp="editors" place="foot">For the note Bloomfield left on this occasion see Letter 177, Robert Bloomfield to Charles James Fox, 7
                  March 1806. The visit, therefore, must have been made on that day.</note></p><p rend="indent1">Thus, Sir, I have told you my adventures with a bluntness of expression which I hope will bear with it its own apology.
