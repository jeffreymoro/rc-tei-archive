                    6 in the evening. She was never left nor neglected by night or by day; the
                    Doctor attended dayly, but her attack was too violent to admit of remedy. I was
                    present at her death, a most afflicting scene! </p><p><ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldKitty">Kitty</ref>, <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">my Father</ref> and <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldElizabeth1789">Bet</ref>, myself, <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref> and his children,

                    illness and on Saturday last spoke to me as to the tomb or monument which he
                    wishes to have erected on the grave, and says that with our permission he will
                    get it done as a token of respect, by subscription amongst the neighbouring
                    Gentry, that the expence may not fall on me.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The gravestone is briefly described in Letter 412.</note>
                    This plan of his render’d it necessary to have the grave arch’d and brick’d to
                    the top, which with much exertion we accomplished just in time to recieve the
                    Coffin. This have increas’d the expence, but I know that you will not begrudge
                    what I have done when I come to show you why and how I have spent my money. It
                    is a very great satisfaction to me that I was here. I have had £20 transmitted
                    to me from <ref target="people.html#HoodThomas">Mr Hood</ref>. I am now going to

                    give her instructions as to breakfast and dinner and her bundle. She might bring

                    upon you, for I know it a serious one if you feel the least reluctance as the
                    cold [MS torn] ride or her means of geting home again don’t let her come, for, I
                    want to be home next week; and shall very likely leave her behind. Weigh the job
                    well and if it appears wrong, say so by writing to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George</ref> directly; or if she comes
                    be sure write to <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury</ref> the day
                    before. I want 4 of the portraits. I wish <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat</ref> could pack them either by
                    rolling them without creasing and putting them in a tin tube like a candle Box,
                    or in a narrow deal box by the Coach.<note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Two
                        portraits of Bloomfield were engraved by John Young at this time; one, a
                        miniature, by Pierre Violet (see Letter 131) was published at the start of
                        January 1805. The other, by J. Rising, was also published in 1805. The dates
                        suggest it is the former to which Bloomfield refers here.</note><ref target="people.html#BloomfieldHannah">Hannah</ref> I know has some reason
                    about her and if you all think the present proposal wrong which I rather doubt
