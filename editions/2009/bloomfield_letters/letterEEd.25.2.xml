His head lies close up against the buttress of the
                    chancel. If you remember, each corner of the chancel, is supported by a large
                    brick buttress. He lies by that, at the front corner, close by the path, which
                    leads from the little clap-gate to the porch. In digging his grave, they took up
                    what time had left of the coffin, &amp;c. of my brother John.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#GloverIsaac">Isaac</ref>, lies beside his grandfather
                    and grandmother, Glover. <ref target="people.html#GloverElizabeth">My
                        mother</ref> seemed much hurt at his loss. My brother <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref> hinted, that <ref target="people.html#GloverJohn">my father</ref> and he, could easily work a
                    small free-stone into the buttress, and said, you was the likeliest person in
                    our family, to remember a suitable verse, if you had ever seen one, — or else to
                    compose one. I have not brains enough to make a verse that will please myself. I
                    think there is difficulty in a verse of this sort, for such a youth as <ref target="people.html#GloverIsaac">Isaac</ref>, for he cannot be said to have
                        <hi rend="ital">any</hi> character. He was the darling of his parents; was
                    very sympathetic; a tale of woe produced the same effect on his mind, as on the
                    mind of a woman. He would weep with whoever wept, and though his voice was <hi rend="ital">broke</hi> to a soft base, which <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldIsaacBrother">Isaac</ref> said bore a strong
                    affinity to yours, and he had downy lips, and other marks of approaching
                    manhood, yet, had he lived till March, he would but have reached his sixteenth
                    year; which time, he lived at home with the most indulgent parents, and very
                    lately with an old lady, as indulgent as they. It is certain that he was a total
                    stranger to all the little hardships and neglects, which we meet with, or fancy
                    we meet, when we first go to service, or apprentice; and as he died ere the
                    strong passions had reached to maturity, I consider him (as his health was
                    always precarious, and his constitution tender) in the same light as a choice
                    flower, which, in the first opening of the bud, promised every thing that could
                    be hoped or wished, — but which, owing to an innate weakness in the stem, though
                    cultured with the utmost care, shrunk down and died, ere it had felt the
                    blighting wind of poverty, or the mildew of disappointment! Now the readers of
                    epitaphs, generally expect to find panegyrics, so that there would be little
                    danger of falling into a fault on that side; but I think, truth and propriety
                    should be attended to, though it would certainly be better, to be blamed for too
                    much praise, than for coldness. Mr. Pope stands first amongst our poets, for
                    this kind of writing; but some of his epitaphs, which I have seen, did not
                    please me; and, I believe, that if as great a poet as Pope, was to undertake to
                    write an epitaph for this youth, he would find it impossible to please all. But
                    I think it cannot be too short, not if it could be contained in two lines, and
                    ought to be either <hi rend="ital">lamentation</hi> for the deceased, or <hi rend="ital">caution</hi> to others; but <hi rend="ital">I</hi>, am most for
                    the <hi rend="ital">lamentable</hi>.</p><p rend="indent1"> The reason why I say so much about it, is, because <ref target="people.html#GloverIsaac">Isaac</ref> asked my opinion, I thought,
                    perhaps, you would have done the same, if you could have conversed with me on
                    the subject. Besides, it is so lately that I was several nights with him, having
                    sat up three nights with him while on his death-bed.</p><p rend="indent1"> He was ill but three weeks; had his senses till within a few
                    hours of his dissolution. He often pulled me down to him, to kiss his trembling
                    lips. His observations and discourse, in general, were surprisingly affecting;
                    and it was easy to discover that he was loth to quit the stage, — and no wonder,
                    for to use an expression of <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat’s</ref>,
                    ‘he was just of the right age, for golden ideas.’ Seeing him so often while in
                    so much pain, and losing him at last, has left a gloomy impression upon my mind.
                    Under this impression I now write, and I know you will excuse my dwelling on a
                    subject, which seems so well to suit my present train of thinking; but I see I
                    have but little room left, so must leave my favourite theme. I have wrote so
                    little lately, that I am quite behind. Several letters of yours, ought to have
                    had more particular answers, than what I gave them. One in particular, which now
                    strikes me. It is that, in which you told me, you had resolved, not to go to
                        <ref target="places.html#Sapiston">Sapiston</ref> — till independent. I
                    highly approve your resolution, but lament that necessity made me so much your
                    hinderance. Pray give my love to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat</ref>; tell him what he wrote last, pleased me extremely. On examining
                        <hi rend="ital">why</hi> I was pleased with it, I find it was, because it is
                    just what I should have said to him, if we had each been in the situation of the
                    other: tell him that a line or two, written in our old, open, sincere way, makes
                    me think of days of yore, and makes me long to hear from him again.</p><closer><signed rend="right"><ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">George Bloomfield</ref></signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
