                    by parcel, but I have been visiting at Mr. Walker’s of Gravely during the whole
                    of the last week, and only found yours and your sister’s mutual information on
                    Saturday last on my return.—This is a pen of my own mending, mind that! Before I
                    give you any account of my late expedition, let me congratulate you on your
                    determind stile of writing to me, by which I am firmly perswaded that you both
                        <hi rend="ital">feel</hi> and <hi rend="ital">know</hi> what may be done by
                    a steady perseverance in a good cause.</p><p rend="indent1"> Mr Wests offer would have been a good one if your present offer
                    was not a better—I send two pounds* give <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">Charlotte</ref> one and keep
                    the other ‘and make good use of it’, as old <ref target="people.html#WhitbreadSamuel">Whitbread</ref> said. I am glad to hear
                    that Betsy is safe through her illness and confinement. Love to all that love
                    me, and respects to <ref target="people.html#SwanJames">Mr Swan</ref> and family
                    &amp;c</p><p rend="indent1"> While at Mr Walker’s the time was spent in riding about the
                    country. On the Tuesday when you wrote we were at Nebworth park in the pouring
                    rain; afterwards at Aston, Walkern &amp;c at little Wimorly or Wimbly<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">Little Wymondley, near Hitchin,
                        Hertfordshire.</note> near Hitchin. We measured a Spanish chestnut which was
                    a few years back entire in its trunk, and then measurd more than sixteen yards
                    in circumference! Mind, I say <hi rend="ital">yards</hi>, not feet! (The oak at
                    Amptill is 8 yards or 24 feet as you no doubt remember.) This is by <hi rend="ital">far</hi> the largest tree I have ever seen, but it is in ruins.
                    At Chessfield Lodge, very near Mr Walkers, lives Parkins Esq, who has a
                    beautiful house and grounds, and is likewise a great Wine-dealer in London, with
                    a Town House No 40 Weymouth St. Mr W has two pupils, one is a very clever
                    interesting youth, whose older brother, an officer in the English army now in
                    Flander is familiarly calld ‘the King of Scotland’ being Robert Bruce, and the
                        <hi rend="ital">direct</hi> heir and descendant of the scotch king. The
                    other pupil is also a Scotch Lad Brother to Sir — Ramsey; but I don’t like him,
                    and of course he will never come to much.</p><p rend="indent1"> In repairing neighbour Brigg’s house the work men have turnd out
                    some Bats of the largest kind, we have preserved one which when expanded is
                    exactly one foot from tip to tip of his wings.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am realy sorry to tell you that Mrs Flints little boy is
