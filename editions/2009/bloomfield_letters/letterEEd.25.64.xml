                    my calling on you as I intended. In consequence of a corispondence with my first
                    friend <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref>, in which I ventured
                    to suggest the removal of his notes in the Quartos and Octavos of the new work,
                    I find that any omition in the original work, ‘the Farmer’s Boy’ will not rest
                    on you, as you generously proposed that it might, but will infallibly fall on my
                    shoulders. To the <ref target="people.html#GraftonAugustusHenry3">Duke of Grafton</ref> and many other friends it will
                    be utterly impossible for me to escape the charge of the blackest baseness and
                    ingratitude: for who of them will have patience, to hear my defence? Or take the
                    pains to acquire information? My character will sink rapidly. You will hamstring
                    me if you do it. I shall halt for the remainder of my race. You know well my <hi rend="ital">real</hi> sentiments on this business; and you know too my
                    situation, and the immense debt of gratitude I owe to <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref>; and I am confident that your
                    candor must admit that we have gaind one material point as to the notes of the
                    new work; and that as five numerous impressions of the former work have been
                    received by the public, though with sentiments of disappropbation to the notes
                    in question and as <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Ls</ref> exculpation
                    of me in his last added note to the last Edition<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The 5th edition includes the following note from Lofft: ‘And
                        here I have to remark, that whatever <hi rend="ital">political</hi>
                        Sentiments or <hi rend="ital">personal</hi> Feelings I have expresst, either
                        in the PREFACE or the APPENDIX, I trust they have not occupied a
                        disproportion’d Space; nor have been unsuitable either to the place in which
                        they are introduced, or to the subject or the occasion. That occasion, I am
                        convinc’d, is just and urgent: and that it is becoming of a man, and of me
                        in particular, and consonant to the whole course of my life, to speak openly
                        even in these times what I think of moment to my Country and to human
                        Society. As to what is personal to myself, I should have passed it entirely
                        here, if that also did not concern the PUBLIC; and if it did not concern the
                        FARMER’S BOY on account of the relation in which I stand to it as <hi rend="ital">Editor</hi>. But I wish it to be understood, that neither
                        for political Sentiments, Opinions, and Conduct, nor for any thing which I
                        have said that personally concerns myself in the introductory part of this
                            <hi rend="ital">Appendix</hi>, is Mr. BLOOMFIELD in the smallest degree
                        responsible. Those therefore who dislike either the sentiments or the mode
                        of expression must, in mere justice, impute them to me alone, and in no
                        respect as in any way implicating him. He wishes, I believe, to decline <hi rend="ital">Politics</hi> and <hi rend="ital">Controversy</hi>
                        altogether; and I wish no man to mix in either farther than he feels it to
                        be a Duty’ (<title>The Farmer’s Boy</title>, 5th edn. (London, 1801), pp.
                        106-107).</note> has past; that very consideration will throw the blame more
                    strongly on me in his estimation.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have acted throughout as a peacemaker as far as was in my
                    power. I have an unshaken reliance on your integrity, and your good wishes to me
                    and your infant family. You would not like to see me incur the disgrace of a
                    criminal. Would not such an imputation laid at my door slacken the ardour of the
                    reading world, and ultimately injure us both? I state this merely as a
                    conjecture. If matters rest where they are now, I can (I believe) avoid an open
                    rupture with <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref>. If, as things
                    stand <hi rend="ital">now</hi> between us, the Sixth Edition of Giles is
                    alter’d, I shall bear the blame, and bear the consequences. If <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr Lofft</ref> would do it himself, all
                    would be well. As it is, I dare not do otherwise than wish that this Sixth
                    Edition may meet the public <hi rend="ital">entire</hi> as the others have done.
                    We have both been, and shall be great gainers by ‘The Boy’. if his coat has
                    holes in it I am not authorised to strip it off. I beg of you to consider of
                    this: and I shall not fear but we shall go smoothly on through these two
                    publications, and perhaps through another; which if I quarrel with <ref target="people.html#LofftCapel">Mr L</ref> will loose greatly in its
                    intended interest in my own country, where I mean it for the amusement of the
                    rising generation.</p><p rend="indent1"> I leave these reasons to your candid consideration and shall hope
                    to see at <ref target="people.html#SwanJames">Mr Swan’s</ref> a copy of Mr
                    Bensley’s last impression, Then I can meet censure or praise with a face of
