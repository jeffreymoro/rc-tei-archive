                    you that the parties concerned are like wise pleased with them, and that,
                    consequently they will be engraved in due time.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have divided the Journal into 4 books. The first concludes at
                    Monmouth. The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> at chepstow. The Third at Brecknock. and
                    the last brings us home.</p><p rend="indent1"> From this division you will see that the two drawings now
                    recieved apply, one to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Book finishing with Chepstow
                    Castle, and the other to the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. which includes Crickhowel.
                    Now if the publishers take it into their heads that the plates should apply to
                        <hi rend="ital">each Book</hi>, I should then choose the ‘<ref target="../images/image21.html">New Wier on the Wye’</ref> for the first,
                    Book, and ‘<ref target="../images/image23.html">the Summits of the Vann from the
                        Priory woods</ref>’ for the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> unless you prefer ‘Hay
                    Castle’ which I fear would not be deemed equally interesting in itself, however
                    excellently it was drawn. The Publishers I learn wish to confine themselves to 4
                    Engravings and therefore your trouble will be the less, but not my
                        obligation.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The four illustrations
                        eventually chosen can be seen here: <ref target="../images/image21.html">[1]</ref><ref target="../images/image22.html">[2]</ref><ref target="../images/image23.html">[3]</ref><ref target="../images/image24.html">[4]</ref></note></p><p rend="indent1"> I shall be greatly vex’d if they do not execute them as they
                    deserve, or give us any of the Bookseller’s quirks.</p><p rend="indent1"> I have again thought of it, and am decided in my choice of ‘<ref target="../images/image21.html">The New Wier</ref>,’ and ‘<ref target="../images/image23.html">The Vann, from the priory Woods</ref>’ With
                    these you may proceed, I hope, at your leisure moments, for they have not begun
                    printing. <ref target="people.html#ShieldWilliam">Mr Shield</ref> (I believe) is to set Music to the Songs, but I have not
                    seen him yet, though I have a very kind letter.</p><p rend="indent1"> I am particularly pleased with the view through the arch, and the
                    other speaks as plainly my language in the rhimes as it possibly could.</p><p rend="indent1"> My Housemates, Young and old, are well, including myself; allways
                    complaining a little, sometimes in moderate health and spirits for a day, and
                    then ‘all down at heel’. I am now in one of my best fits, and with a lively
                    recollection of past hours, and Love to <ref target="people.html#CooperCharlotte">Miss Cooper</ref>, and
                    Sister, and all friends, Am Sir Yours truly, and affectionately</p><closer><signed rend="right">Robt Bloomfield</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
