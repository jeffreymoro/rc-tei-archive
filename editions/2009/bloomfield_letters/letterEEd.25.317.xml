                    untill I could see <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">my son’s</ref>
                    probable chance with his competition at ‘the Central National School’ under <ref target="people.html#BellAndrew">Dr Bell</ref>. He is now there, but entirely
                    at my expence for perhaps a long time to come. I have procured him a Lodging to
                    my wish, and shall return to Bedfordshire as soon as possible, but this I cannot
                    do without giving you the following statement.</p><p rend="indent1"> Some time since when dining with <ref target="people.html#BrydgesSamuelEgerton">Sir E Brydges</ref> he offer’d me
                    the assistance of his purse, which I then declined, because he at the same time
                    gave me an order on the Bankers at Canterbury for £30 being money lodged then
                    for my benefit; but the reply from thence stated that said sum had already been
                    drawn by another hand and transmitted to <ref target="places.html#BuryStEdmunds">Bury St Edm</ref> for my ultimate use. Thus disappointed I found my daily
                    expences in London bring me fast aground, and I venturd to state my case to my
                    good friend <ref target="people.html#ParkThomas">Mr park</ref>, that the want of
                    some such assistance would leave me miserably straightened, if not disable me
                    entirely from compleating what I have so happily begun for my Daughters and
                    Son’s benefit, and consequently for my own. I think it impossible that the
                    wishes of my friends to do me good, can in any way be better accomplishd than in
                    thus providing for my children at the proper time of life for their exertions. I
                    ask’d <ref target="people.html#ParkThomas">Mr Parks</ref> advice, and you have
                    it in the enclosed letter.</p><p rend="indent1"> Whatever may be the end of the susbscription, or of your more
                    immediate exertions, Sir, to serve me, I cannot hesitate to inform you that the
                    clothing my <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteShot">youngest
                        daughter</ref>, and the <hi rend="ital">entire</hi> support of <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">my Son</ref> in lodgings, still
                    call for what I cannot continue to give without thus soliciting and obtaining
                    something to keep the wheels going which I have put in motion. Forty of fifty
                    pounds out of whatever may be left in Clements Lane in my name, would enable me
                    to return to Bedfordshire with a tolerable grace, and give me the solid
                    satisfaction of having accomplished at least as much as I wish’d, and more than
                    I realy hop’d.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> I am Sir, your most obedient servant</salute><signed rend="right">Rob Boomfield</signed></closer><postscript><p>I promise myself the honour of seeing you on Saturday morning at ten, if not
