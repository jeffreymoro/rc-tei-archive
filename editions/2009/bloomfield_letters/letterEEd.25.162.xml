                    when I wrote last, so much so that I resolved to accept <ref target="people.html#DisneyJohn">Dr Disney’s</ref> invitation for a day or
                    two. I meant to go to Ingatestone (23 miles) on Wednesday last, but having by
                        <ref target="people.html#YoungThomas">Mr Youngs</ref> advice taken phisick,
                    I was forced to stop till Thursday morning; I was home again on Saturday night,
                    not being willing to leave the house long to <ref target="people.html#Honour">Honour</ref>, though she grows more capable every day, and because <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter">Mary</ref> was far from well,
                    and not quite happy. her spirits are mended with her health, and she is going on
                    very well. I met a very kind reception at the <ref target="people.html#DisneyJohn">Doctor’s</ref>. They have a noble mansion,
                    and fine estate. they regretted much that I could not stop with them, and so did
                    I, as I found my appetite mended by my short visit, I had some delightfull
                    walks, and brought home a present of valuable pictures. I have taking [sic]
                    pills to day, and have no doubt of being well in a day or two. </p><p rend="indent1"> I have not been able to see <ref target="people.html#YoungThomas">Young</ref> this morning, but if he thinks you are not dealing right with
                    the knee I will write again tomorrow or Wednesday. I am surprised at your
                    firmness in resolving to keep it open, but think that whatever be the end of it
                    we shall both at last think that we have done our utmost duty by him, and rest
                    contented with our lot.</p><p rend="indent1"> As to Mr Morah, you should not be unhappy about him, you know
                    Doctors love to hear the clink of a Guinea; there is nothing strange in his
                    apparent neglect, perhaps he only think you have no money in your pocket, which
                    would cool the zeal of the first Doctors in England. Hereafter, if you can
                    reside at Worthing with pleasure during the summer, if <ref target="people.html#YoungThomas">Dr Youngs</ref> method fails, and you still
                    want to try Morah, there is no doubt but he will act as soon as you go to him
                    with <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlesSon">the child</ref> and offer
                        <hi rend="ital">to pay him</hi>. Think, therefore, no more about that until
                    you want him. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldMaryDaughter">Mary</ref> was
