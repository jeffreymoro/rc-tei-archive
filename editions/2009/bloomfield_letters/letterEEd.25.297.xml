                    answer it directly. You seem greatly concerned about my eyes and my happiness,
                    (two precious things) and I thank you for your kindness, and I will speak of
                    them both in their turns. First, as to my sight. About three weeks ago I had one
                    of my desperate head-aches, and the following day, I felt somthing the matter
                    with my boasted <hi rend="ital">right eye</hi>. A slight kind of inflammation
                    ensued, but nothing to give pain; only a sort of obscurity. I shortly after
                    found a dark speck, or cloud over the pupil, which moved with the eye, and was
                    capable of <hi rend="ital">totally</hi> obscuring the brightest star. I then
                    began to be alarm’d as much, and I hope no more, than such a threat of blindness
                    would warrant. I could not see one word of print, nor the tame Robin at the
                    further end of the room. In this state I sent to London for spectacles to suit
                    the Age of 60, for my old ones were quite useless. <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldCharlotteAunt">Aunt Charlotte</ref> went to
                    Dollands for them, with her broken arm, so you may judge that their storm is
                    blown over, and particularly as <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldNat">Nat</ref> says nothing about Tom, but in his letter says in his usual short
                    and strong way, ‘it is fortunate that your best trade may be followd, without
                    the aid of eyesight.’ I tried my new spectacles with trepidation, and found them
                    tolerably well, but my sight was still so bad that I found it prudent to abstain
                    from all attempts to read and write, and to wear a shade. |Nov<hi rend="sup">b</hi> 10.| I am glad I can now add that my sight is mending. The cloud is
                    less black and threatening, and I can write, after a fashion.</p><p rend="indent1"> As to my happiness, I have found but little real and lasting
                    expression of spirits. I think I shall escape it this season if I can but keep
                    up my health, which is much better than this time twelvemonth. Now then for
                    other news. Miss Weston is going on Monday next to Oxfordshire for a month, and
                    then she will be a <hi rend="ital">very short</hi> time here before she goes to
                    Hastings, for she goes long before <ref target="people.html#WestonJoseph">her brother</ref>, and is afraid she shall not see
                    you before her departure.—<ref target="places.html#Shefford">Shefford</ref>
                    News—Lawyer King removed yesterday to potton. Mr Walker and the Cork Rump go at
                    Christmas to live at <ref target="places.html#Graveley">Gravely</ref> near
                    Hitchin, Stevenson at the George is going to quit. Nightingall, palmer, and our
                    friend peppercorn, have given in their warnings to quit their farms! Whenever
                    you come home you will have no acquaintance but Miss Martin.—Such is the
                    changing state of things here, that I expect in my next to have to say somthing
                    like the following. ‘The Ivel has taken into its head to turn about and run
                    towards Clophill, it would do your heart good to see how it contrives to get up
                    the waterfall at <ref target="places.html#Chicksands">Chicksands</ref>. Little
                    Gawky is going to be shown for a dwarf. Mother Rogers and Old Squelch are not a
                    bit bigger than two halfpenny candles Briggs is gone to Bedford Jail for setting
                    fire to a Methodist meeting, and Old Mother Robinson run off to Gretney Green
                    with a young fortune hunter!!! Your green frock, with some little pecuniary aid
                    shall be sent next week, as we are going to send some straw for Mrs West-tee.
                    The mean old toad!</p><p rend="indent1"> If you and <ref target="people.html#LockwoodEdward">Mrs
                        Lockwood</ref> agree to it, I can have no <hi rend="ital">prudent</hi> cause
                    to oppose your staying the Christmas twelmonth, for you will have but a rum sort
                    of a home here, and though I never cease talking of you, and wanting your
                    company, I have your <hi rend="ital">real</hi> welfare so strongly at heart that
                    I would bear any privation to secure it. It was from this consideration that I
                    urge’d your making yourself personally known to Mrs Philips and Lady Bunbury. If
                    you do not, after what I wrote to the former, they may feel themselves justly
                    offended, and our own original intention or chance will be thrown away without
                    trial. Give my love to sister <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldKitty">Kate</ref>, but for God’s sake don’t let her come here. Tell her I was
                    arrested last week, and my goods sold by auction; or any thing you can think
                    of.—I walk when I can, I have been to Henlow, and <ref target="places.html#Southill">Southill</ref>, and am going to day to dine
                    with Mr Olivere of Clifton, and if my <hi rend="ital">horrors</hi> come on too
                    strong I shall immediately set off either to <ref target="places.html#ClareHall">Clare Hall</ref>, or to Gransdon, to break the seen. So be not surprised if
                    I write to you from another quarter I know that exertion of mind and body is
                    real wisdom; but I also know that to <hi rend="ital">command exertion</hi> is
                    not so easy as some healthy fools think it. Give my respects to your kind
                    entertainers, and love to <ref target="people.html#BloomfieldGeorge">Unkle
                        George</ref>. I have his long letter, and will if possible try to write to
                    him, but not about politicks. Did I tell you that Cawdel has lost his
                    postmastership, and that we past at the Green Man over the way?</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> God bless you.
