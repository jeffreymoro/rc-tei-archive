                    regret that I canot be with you, therefore enjoy the feast to the utmost of your
                    power, and store it in your brain, as the poor Camel stores the product of the
                    fountain spring to sustain his strength across the Desert. Accept my thanks for
                    your kind wishes, and give my respects to your friends upon the Ivel.<note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors">The Ivel, a river in the east of England.</note>I do not
                    feel that I have any thing to add to what I impudently said on the Poem, and if
                    I had, I should prefer telling you in the way of gossip. This delicious rain
                    will make your roses sweeter, and I sit with a smile of pleasure to see it fall.
                    During the late hot days I somehow or other caught a cold of a more violent kind
                    than I have had for these ten years past, the effects for a day or two were
                    alarming. I am now recoverd, and I mention it not with a view of exciting ‘lack
                    a days’, and causing long chins, but to show you that while <hi rend="ital">you</hi> were probably all hop and kick upon the banks of the Brook, <hi rend="ital">I</hi> was forced to nurse my loggerhead upon a table with
                    scarce an eye to see out of. And here me thinks I could moralize about the
                    strange tenements that we live in, and all that sort of fun, but I have not time
                    just now; and besides I have the Eolian Harps in hand, and I find such pleasure
                    in the use of the saw and the plane that I am determined to fetch up my arrears
                    in writing to day, and attack the Harps tomorrow. And so I have only to wish you
                    happiness which I do most sincerely, and to desire our respects to Mrs Inskip
                    and the twigg, and to your friend <ref target="people.html#WestonJoseph">Weston</ref>.</p><closer><salute rend="indent1"> I am yours truly</salute><signed rend="right">Robt Bloomfield</signed></closer></div></body></text></TEI>
