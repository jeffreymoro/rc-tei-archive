               of the eighteenth-century. The elder Pitt was the minister who led Britain to success
               in the Seven Years’ War but who later, ennobled as Lord Chatham, presided over the
               unpopular refusal to let John Wilkes take the seat in parliament to which he had been
               elected. Alderman William Beckford was a wealthy plantation owner who, in 1770, when
               Lord Mayor of London, became a Whig political hero by supporting John Wilkes’s campaign
               to be allowed to take his seat. Wilkes, journalist, pornographer, campaigner for the
               extension of the franchise was the centre of popular protest, culminating in London-wide
               riots, when he was excluded from the House of Commons although elected by a majority.
               Alderman John Sawbridge, also a Lord Mayor of London, was one of Wilkes’s coterie.
               Drs Richard Price and Joseph Priestley were Unitarian theologians and political writers
               who supported Whig campaigns for the reform of parliament and, in 1789, welcomed the
               French Revolution, both as a model for the revolution they hoped would occur in Britain

               was in fact too large and becoming larger. Previously, the position espoused by Oliver
               Goldsmith in chapter one of his 1766 novel <em>The Vicar of Wakefield</em> was the norm—and William Pitt, as Prime Minister, had been concerned to introduce
               measures tending to increase national population.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note20_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div>
