                    justice in believing that the error in the notice publishd in the Bury paper
                        <note n="1" place="foot" resp="editors"> The ‘error’ to which Bloomfield
                        refers was the statement in <title>The Bury and Norwich Post</title> that
                        the conditions of his contract with his publishers prevented the publication
                        of a subscription edition of his works. See note [3].</note> had not my
                    sanction. I had nothing to do with it; but I have both an interest and a feeling
                    of right and duty in contradicting &lt;it&gt;, which I will use
                    immediately.</p><p rend="indent1"> On the receipt of your last, containing such fair and liberal
                    offers, I was rejoiced, and immediately gave a copy to the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stewart <note n="2" place="foot" resp="editors">Revd Stewart. Presumably a local Bedfordshire clergyman.
                        Plans for a subscription edition of Bloomfield’s collected works were
                        eventually dropped, on the recommendation of friends, to be replaced with
                        one for financial support alone. (See Letters 310 and 303).</note> in this
                    Neighbourhood, who was likewise struck with the honourable offer on your part,
                    and with the superior chance of its being a more eligable as well as a more
                    productive plan than a plain <hi rend="ital">dry</hi> subscription. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stewart wrote to the parties in Suffolk, your sentiments
                    next day, so that whoever wrote the publishd Notice must be informd long ere
                    this time that it containd the error of which you have so much reason to
                    complain. I will take effectual means to prevent its reappearance in next week’s
                    paper, and to give them the truth. The same shall be done with Next Month’s
                    Magazine but when you say <hi rend="ital">New</hi> Monthly, do you mean that
                    publishd by Sir R Philips, or a more modern one? <note n="3" place="foot" resp="editors">The following notice from the <title>Bury Post</title> was
                        reproduced in the April number of <title>The New Monthly Magazine and
                            Universal Register</title>:
                <p rend="indent1">We shall feel happy if the introduction of the following notice transcribed from
                    the <title>Bury Post</title>, shall serve to promote its object––the relieving
                    of a modest and worthy man and an ingenious poet from difficulties under which
                    we regret to learn that he at present labours:</p><p rend="indent1">‘It has been discovered that Mr. ROBERT BLOOMFIELD the well known author of the
                        <title>Farmer’s Boy</title>, and other entertaining Poems, is now residing
                    in the parish of Shefford, in Bedfordshire, under considerable embarrassment,
                    which his delicacy has induced him to conceal; and that the conditions of his
                    engagements with the booksellers prevent him from relieving himself by a new
                    edition of his former works, or by a new publication. It is therefore, proposed,
                    to open a Subscription in his favour, as well for the purpose of expressing the
                    sense entertained by his countrymen of his unassuming merit, as of supplying him
                    with the means of immediate comfort. Mr. Deck, of Bury St. Edmunds, will receive
                    subscriptions, and account to the subscribers for the application of them.
                    Suffolk is a rich, respectable, and enlightened county, and will answer this
                    appeal, there is no doubt, with ardour and promptitude: and it is hoped, that
                    the example will be followed by all lovers of nature and genius.’</p><p rend="indent1">Mr. GILLET, of Crown-Court, Fleet-street (the printer of this Magazine), has
                    undertaken to receive the contributions of the friends of literary merit in
                    London, and to forward them to their destination (<title>The New Monthly
                        Magazine and Universal Register</title> 5 (April 1816), 233).</p><p rend="indent1"><title>The New Monthly Magazine</title> had been established in 1814 by Henry
                    Colburn and Frederic Shoberl as a Tory competitor to Sir Richard Phillips’s
                        <title>Monthly Magazine; or British Register</title>. The piece from
                        <title>The Bury Post</title> was also copied into <title>The European
                        Magazine and London Review</title> 69 (April, 1816), 373.</p></note></p><p rend="indent1">I have good reasons for thus mentioning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                    Stewart, for he acts as a voluntary agent between myself and my friends. We
                    canvass’d the matter over for two hours, and concluded that if the four Vollms
                    could be printed in a superior stile, in <hi rend="ital">Two Vols large
                        Octavo</hi>, it would be more acceptable than in one Vol. But here we wanted
                    &lt;[illegible word]&gt; a Bookseller at our elbow, to say whether it
                    could be sold for a guinea &amp; half, or 2 Guineas? The latter, he thinks
                    would make its way quite as well as the former. Thus you see Sir, that I am
                    still in the dark as to the probable number of names to be collected, and as to
                    the probable &lt;actual&gt; expence of each copy. It appears to me,
                    Solus, that the first thing to be ascertaind is, whether the four Vol<hi rend="sup">ms</hi>, (all that I have written) can be so printed as to
                    warrant such a price? If so, perhaps it might at once be said publickly, that an
                    Edition at such or such price was printing, or would be printed to supply
                    whoever chose to subscribe before a given time, and that no more would be
                    printed than subscribed for? but this is a mere thought of my own. I cannot stir
                    in this matter untill the road is quiet before me, but lie like a Tortoise in a
                    Wheel-rut, and then get up when I see opportunity.</p><p rend="indent1"> Whatever comes of this measure ultimately, I shall be glad if you
                    would take to yourselves the merit you deserve, and if I am a gainer in pocket,
                    remunerate yourselves by all means in any way that your candour and honour may
                    dictate.</p><p rend="indent1"> It happens that I have not &lt;a&gt; copy of Banks of Wye
                    in the house, and cannot therefore supply my <hi rend="ital">Country</hi>
                    friends who are now in London. I have an order similar to the last, to send to
                    ‘Mr Coates, No 19, Brewer Stt, Golden Square’ <hi rend="ital">2 Setts</hi> of my
                    poems, (a set containing Farmers Boy, R.T. W.F. and Banks of Wye). If I had them
                    here I would not trouble you, but if you have a boy who could take such an
                    errand in his rounds I should feel greatly obliged.</p><p rend="indent1"> I thank you Sir most sincerely for your last letter, and for the
                    good wishes and good advice at its close. Your wishes may perhaps be fulfilld,
                    but your advice I am afraid I cannot act upon for want of the <hi rend="ital">stuff</hi>. But let us see w[MS torn] and in the mean time, I Am [MS torn]
