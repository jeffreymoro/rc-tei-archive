                    said but who shall say exactly what the obstacles may be that may obtrude
                    themselves between the wish and the accomplishment! I tarried longer in
                    Bedfordshire than I proposed, and <hi rend="ital">could not</hi> do otherwise,
                    and I learn’d from <ref target="people.html#SharpCatherine">Catharine’s</ref>
                    communication that you would leave on the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of this month.
                    I therefore could not meet you. Yet it is a great consolation to hear that you
                    are so well, and that I have therefore so fair a chance of seeing you at some
                    future time. I told <ref target="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ">Mr Baker</ref>
                    my business with <ref target="people.html#OsborneGeorge">Sir G Osborn</ref> I
                    dined with him, and felt at home. <ref target="people.html#WhitbreadSamuel">Mr
                        Whitbread</ref> allso behaved handsomly and gave his Bedfordshire invitation
                    &amp;c. &amp;c. When I said that I felt myself at home I ought to have
                    said that I wishd the Country my home; and that radical first-planted principle
                    in my composition can never be blotted out by London and all it can produce.</p><p rend="indent1"><ref target="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ">Mr Baker</ref> expressed a
                    particular desire to see my Journal, tell him that I am going over it once again

                    you no doubt. In the mean time I rest assured that you will, when convenient,
                    write to me and inform me of the health of yourself and Children whom I should
                    like to see, and allso to remember me to <ref target="people.html#LloydBakerThomasJ">Mr B</ref>, and All Friends at <ref target="places.html#StoutsHill">Stouts Hill</ref>, And with these hopes,
