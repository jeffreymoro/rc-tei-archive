<p rend="emph">Chapter 19</p>
<p> </p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p>LONDON was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city.
									Clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me
									a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
									completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me,
									addressed to the most distinguished natural
									philosophers.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible
									pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information
									they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill
									my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a
									transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable
									barrier placed between me and my fellow-men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and Justine; and to
									reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he
									was inquisitive, and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was
									to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long had in
									view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in
									the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of European colonisation and trade. In
									Britain only could he further the execution of his plan. He was for ever busy; and the only check to his
									enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried
										to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one, who was
									entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,
									alleging another engagement, that I might remain
									alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the
									torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an
									extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to
									palpitate.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland, who had formerly been our
									visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country, and asked us if those were not sufficient
									allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired
									to accept this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams, and all
									the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen
									dwelling-places.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to
									commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to
									follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit
									Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the
									end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my
									labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was
									a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all
									novelties to us.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a
									century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful
									to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory
									of that unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every
									part of the city, which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here,
									and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the
									appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and
									picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of
									exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of
									towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past, and the anticipation of
									the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if
									I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of what is
									excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart, and communicate elasticity to my
									spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has
									entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to be—a
									miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and intolerable to myself.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot
									which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often
									prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and
									the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears, to
									contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the
									remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my
										chains, and look around me with a free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank
									again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the
									neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but every thing is on a
									lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps, which always attend on the piny mountains
									of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave, and the little cabinets of natural history, where the
									curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me
									tremble, when pronounced by Henry; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus
									associated.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>From Derby, still journeying northward, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmoreland. I could now almost fancy
									myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the
									mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we
									made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to
									cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the
									company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
									imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. "I could pass my life here," said he to
									me; "and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for
									ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he
									rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other
									novelties.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and conceived an affection for some of
									the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel
									on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected
										my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon's disappointment. He might
									remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every
									moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish
									impatience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived, and I
									saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the
									fiend followed me, and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I
									would not quit Henry for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his
									destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great
									crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse
									upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being.
									Clerval did not like it so well as Oxford: for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the
									beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh,
										its romantic castle, and its environs, the most
									delightful in the world, Arthur's Seat, St. Bernard's
										Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for the change, and filled him with cheerfulness and
									admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St.
										Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us. But I was in no mood to
									laugh and talk with strangers, or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest;
									and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the
										tour of Scotland alone. "Do you," said I, "enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. I may be absent
									a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat you: leave me to peace and solitude for a short
									time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Henry wished to dissuade me; but, seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate. He entreated me to write
									often. "I had rather be with you," he said, "in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch people, whom I do
									not know: hasten then, my dear friend, to return, that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do
									in your absence."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland, and finish my work in solitude. I
									did not doubt but that the monster followed me, and would discover himself to me when I should have finished, that
									he might receive his companion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands, and fixed on one of the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my
									labours. It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock, whose high sides were continually
									beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal
									for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable
									fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from the main land, which was about five miles
								distant.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired.
									It contained but two rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury. The thatch had
									fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some
									furniture, and took possession; an incident which would, doubtless, have occasioned some surprise, had not all the
									senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at and unmolested,
									hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which I gave; so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of
									men.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening, when the weather permitted, I walked on the
									stony beach of the sea, to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a monotonous yet
									ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills are
									covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle
									sky; and, when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant, when compared to the
									roarings of the giant ocean.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived; but, as I proceeded in my labour, it became every
									day more horrible and irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several
									days; and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged. During my
									first experiment, a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had
									blinded me to the horror of my employment; my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my
									eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at
									the work of my hands.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an
									instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared
									to meet my persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them, lest they should
									encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow-creatures,
									lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably advanced. I looked towards its completion with
									a tremulous and eager hope, which I dared not trust myself to question, but which was intermixed with obscure
									forebodings of evil, that made my heart sicken in my bosom.</p>
