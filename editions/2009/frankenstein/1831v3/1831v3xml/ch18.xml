<item>
<p>DAY after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my
									work. I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend,
									yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a
									female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some
									discoveries having been made by an English
									philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my
									father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and shrunk from taking
									the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A change indeed
									had taken place in me: my health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
									unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and
									he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and
									then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I
									took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little
									boat, watching the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and
									bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my
									friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed
								me:—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and seem to be returning to
									yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to
									the cause of this; but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve
									on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father
									continued—</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my
									declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared,
									in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man, that what I
									conceived to be the best assistants to my plan, may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your
									sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love;
									and, considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which
									you appear to feel."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as
									Elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the
									expectation of our union."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some
									time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us.
									But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,
									therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent
									events have drawn us from that every-day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I
									do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
										plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate
									happiness to you, or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with
									confidence and sincerity."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly
									in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an
									immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not
									yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted
									family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly
										weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my engagement, and let the
									monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected
									peace.</p>
</item>
<item> I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England, or entering
								into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge and discoveries were of
								indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was
								dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, I had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome
								task in my father's house, while in habits of familiar intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful
								accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror. I was
								aware also that I should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would
								possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed.
								Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise
								fulfilled, the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some accident might meanwhile occur to
								destroy him, and put an end to my slavery for ever.</item>
<item>
<p>These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England; but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I
									clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I urged my desire with an earnestness that
									easily induced my father to comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy, that resembled madness in
									its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a
									journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely
									to myself.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or at most a year, was the period contemplated.
										One paternal kind precaution he had taken to
									ensure my having a companion. Without previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,
									arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my
									task; yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment, and truly
									I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between
									me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me, to
									remind me of my task, or to contemplate its progress?</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place
									immediately on my return. My father's age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one reward
									I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the
									prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth, and forget the past in
									my union with her.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me, which filled me with fear and agitation. During
									my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his
									attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; and
									would he not accompany me to England? This imagination
										was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonised
									with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature, I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the
										moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family
									from the danger of his machinations.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>It was in the latter end of
										September that I again quitted my native country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth,
									therefore, acquiesced: but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of
									misery and grief. It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval -- and yet a man is blind to a
									thousand minute circumstances, which call forth a woman's sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my
									return,—a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute, as she bade me a tearful silent farewell.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered
									only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be
									packed to go with me. Filled with dreary imaginations,
									I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of
									the bourne of my travels, and the work which was to
									occupy me whilst they endured.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>After some days spent in listless indolence, during
									which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Clerval. He came. Alas, how
									great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting
									sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of
									the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. "This is what it is to live," he cried, "now I enjoy existence! But
									you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful?" In truth, I was occupied by gloomy
									thoughts, and neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor the golden sunrise reflected in the
									Rhine.—And you, my friend, would be far more
									amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the
									scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up
									every avenue to enjoyment.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for
									London. During this voyage, we passed many willowy islands, and saw several beautiful towns. We stayed a day at
									Manheim, and, on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below Mayence
									becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of
									beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high
									and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you
									view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and, on
									the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards, with green sloping banks, and a meandering river, and
									populous towns occupy the scene.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>We travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the
									song of the labourers, as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually
									agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless
									blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my
									sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
									man. "I have seen," he said, "the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the
									snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would
									cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
									appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you
									an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
									where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their dying voices are still said to
									be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but
									this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and
									strange; but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river, that I never before saw equalled. Look at that
									castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those
									lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the
									recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than those who pile
									the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country."</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words, and to dwell on the praise of which you are
									so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the "very
										poetry of nature." His wild and enthusiastic
										imagination was chastened by the sensibility
									of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature
									that the worldy-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his
									eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which
									others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—</p>
<lg>
<l>
<p>                          "The
										sounding cataract<lb/> Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,<lb/> The mountain, and the deep and gloomy
										wood,<lb/> Their colours and their forms, were then to him<lb/> An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<lb/> That
										had no need of a remoter charm,<lb/> By thought supplied, or any interest<lb/> Unborrow'd from the
										eye"*</p>
</l>
</lg>
</item>
<item>
<p> And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost forever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas,
									imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No,
									it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits
									and consoles your unhappy friend.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but
									they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream of the river was
										too gentle to aid us.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.
									It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of
									December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were
									flat, but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered the Spanish armada;
									Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places which I had heard of even in my country.</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering above all, and the Tower famed in English
										history.<lb/>
<lb/> *Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey.</p>
