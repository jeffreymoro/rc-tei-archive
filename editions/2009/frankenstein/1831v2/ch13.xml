<p rend="emph">Chapter 13 </p>
<p> </p>
<list type="simple">
<item>
<p>"I NOW hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events,
									that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had
										been, have made me what I am. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies cloudless. It surprised me, that what before was
									desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and
									refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a thousand sights of beauty. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his
									guitar, and the children listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond
									expression; he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he
									inquired the cause of his son's sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his
									music, when some one tapped at the door. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman
									as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Agatha asked a question; to
									which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was musical, but
									unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Felix came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw
									him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of
										angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
									dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair,
									each cheek tinged with a lovely pink. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face,
									and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes
									sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She
									appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix,
									who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear
									to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and, dismissing her guide, conducted her into the
									cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old man's
									feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced her affectionately. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to have a language of her
									own, she was neither understood by, nor herself
										understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her presence
									diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix
									seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed
									the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he
									had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the
									cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the
									stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred
									to me, that I should make use of the same instructions
										to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them, indeed, were
									those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they separated, Felix kissed the hand
									of the stranger, and said, 'Good night, sweet Safie.' He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by
									the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation.
										I ardently desired to understand them, and bent
									every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The next morning Felix went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian
									sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at
									once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes.
									She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her
									voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared
									enraptured, and said some words, which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to
									express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The days now passed as peacefully as before, with the sole alteration, that joy had taken the place of sadness in
									the countenances of my friends. Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of
									language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed
									with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
									the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me,
									although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun; for I never ventured
									abroad during day-light, fearful of meeting with the same treatment I had formerly endured in the first village
									which I entered. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who
									understood very little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word
									that was spoken. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of
										letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.
								</p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's 'Ruins of Empires.' I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not Felix, in reading it,
									given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in
									imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the
									several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and
									religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and
									mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans -- of their subsequent
									degenerating -- of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the
									discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so
										vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at another, as all that
									can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall
									a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a
									condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one
									man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of
									vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and loathing. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix
									bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human
										society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty;
									of rank, descent, and noble blood. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures
									were, high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages;
									but, without either, he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen
										few. And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of
									property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same
									nature as man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and
									cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around, I saw and heard of none
									like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the
									earth, from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned? </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me: I tried to dispel
									them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh,
									that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat! </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to
									the mind, when it has once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought
									and feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was
									death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the
									gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except
									through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than
									satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha, and the animated smiles
									of the charming Arabian, were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the
									loved Felix, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy
									wretch! </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.
									I heard of the difference of sexes; and the birth and growth of children; how the father doated on the smiles of
									the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child; how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in
									the precious charge; how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge; of brother, sister, and all the various
									relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my infant days, no mother had
									blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I distinguished nothing. From
									my earliest remembrance I had been as I then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being resembling
									me, or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with
									groans. </p>
</item>
<item>
<p>"I will soon explain to what these feelings tended; but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story
									excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional
									love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in an innocent, half painful self-deceit, to call them). </p>
